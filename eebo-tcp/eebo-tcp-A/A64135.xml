            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And but that he who stilleth the raging of the Sea, and the noise of his Waves, and the madnesse of his

people, had provided a Plank for me, I had been lost to all the opportunities of content or study. But I know not whether I have been more preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the courtesies of my friends, or the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and mercies of a noble Enemy: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. And now since I have come ashoar, I have been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering a few sticks to warm me, a few books to entertain my thoughts, and divert them from the perpetuall Meditation of my private Troubles, and the publike Dyscrasy, but those which I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain were so few and so impertinent, and unusefull to any great purposes, that I began to be sad upon a new stock, and full of apprehension that I should live unprofitably, and die obscurely, and be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and my bones thrown into some common char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell house, without any name or note to distinguish me from those who only served their Generation by filling the number of Citizens, and who could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no thanks or reward from the Publike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a <hi>jus trium liberorum.</hi> While I was troubled with these thoughts, and busie to find out an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing some good in my small proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, still the cares of the publike did so intervene, that it was as impossible to separate my design from relating to the present, as to exempt my selfe from the participation of the common calamity; still halfe my thoughts was (in despite of all my diversions and arts of avocation) fixt upon and mingled with the present concernments: so that besides them I could

not goe. Now because the great Question is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion, and in that also my Scene lies, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved here to fix my considerations, especially when I observed the wayes of promoting the severall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which now are busie, to be such, as besides that they were most troublesome to me, and such as I could by no meanes be friends withall, they were also such as to my understanding, did the most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently disserve their ends whose design in advancing their own opinions was pretended for Religion: For as contrary as cruelty is to mercy, as tyranny to charity, so is warre and bloodshed to the meeknesse and gentlenesse of Christian Religion: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that there are some exterminating spirits who think God to delight in humane sacrifices, as if that Oracle—<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41208:6"/>
I had often thought of the Prophecy that in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, <hi>our swords should be turned into plowshares, and our Speares into pruning hooks;</hi> I knew that no tittle spoken by Gods Spirit could return unperform'd and ineffectuall, and I was certain, that such was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Christ's Doctrine, that if men would obey it, Christians should never warre one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in the mean time I considered not, that it was <hi>praedictio consilii, non eventus,</hi> till I saw what men were now doing, and ever had done since the heats and primitive fervours did coole, and the love of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests sweld higher then the love of Christianity; but then on the other side, I began to fear that whatever I could say would be as ineffectuall, as it could be reasonable: For if those excellent words which our blessed Master spake, could not charm the tumult of our spirits, I had little reason to hope that one of the meanest and most ignorant of his servants could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the end of that which he cals his great, and his old, and his new Commandement, so well as the excellency of his own Spirit and discourses could. And yet since he who knew every event of things, and the successe and efficacy of every Doctrine; and that very much of it to most men, and all of it to some men would be ineffectuall, yet was pleased to consign our duty that it might bee a direction to them that would, and a conviction and a Testimony against them that would not obey, I thought it might not misbecome my duty and endevours to plead for peace and charity, and forgivenesse and permissions mutuall, although I had reason to believe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41208:6"/>
that such is the iniquity of men, and they so indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to receive such impresses, that I had as good plow the Sands, or till the Aire, as perswade such Doctrines, which destroy mens interests, and serve no end but the great end of a happy eternity, and what is in order to it. But because the events of things are in Gods disposition, and I knew them not, and because if I had known my good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses would be totally ineffectuall as to others, yet my own designation and purposes would be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to my selfe, who might from Gods mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the retribution which he is pleased to promise to all pious intendments; I resolved to encounter with all Objections, and to doe something to which I should be determined by the consideration of the present distemperatures and necessities, by my own thoughts, by the Questions and Scruples, the Sects and names, the interests and animosities which at this day, and for some years past have exercised and disquieted Christendome.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre I discourst my selfe into imployment, and having come thus farre, I knew not how to get farther, for I had heard of a great experience, how difficult it was to make Brick without Straw, and here I had even seene my design blasted in the bud, and I despaired in the Calends of doing what I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the Ides before: For I had no Books of my own here, nor any in the voisinage, and but that I remembred the result of some of those excellent Discourses, I had heard your Lordship make when I was so happy as in private to gather up what your

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41208:8"/>
my opinion, because I think I have place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which seems to warrant it to my understanding, why may he not serve up another dish to me in the same dresse, and exact the same task of me to believe the contradictory: And then since all the Hereticks in the world have offered to prove their Articles by the same meanes by which true believers propound theirs, it is necessary that some separation either of Doctrine or of persons be clearly made, that all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences may not be admitted, nor any just Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be rejected; and yet that in some other Questions whether they be truly or falsly pretended if not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently or demonstratively, there may be considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had to the persons of men and to the Laws of charity more then to the triumphing in any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or doctrine not simply necessary. Now because some doctrines are clearly not necessary, and some are absolutely necessary, why may not the first separation be made upon this difference, and Articles necessary be only urg'd as necessary, and the rest left to men indifferently, as they were by the Scripture indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. And it were well if men would as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider themselves as the Doctrines, and think that they may as well be deceiv'd by their own weaknesse, as perswaded by the Arguments of a Doctrine which other men, as wise, call inevident. For it is a hard case that we shall think all Papists and Anabaptists and Sacramentaries to be fooles and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, certainly among all these Sects there are very many wise men and good men, as well as erring; and although some zeales are so hot, and their eyes so
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41208:9"/>
inflamed with their ardors, that they doe not think their Adversaries look like other men, yet certainly we find by the results of their discourses, and the transactions of their affaires of civill society, that they are men that speak and make syllogismes, and use reason, and read Scripture, and although they do no more understand all of it, then we doe, yet they endeavour to understand as much as concerns them, even all that they can, even all that concerns repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ: And therefore me thinks this also should be another consideration distinguishing the persons, for if the persons be Christians in their lives, and Christians in their profession, if they acknowledge the Eternall Sonne of God for their Master and their Lord, and live in all relations as becomes persons making such professions, why then should I hate such persons whom God loves, and who love God, who are partakers of Christ, and Christ hath a title to them, who dwell in Christ, and Christ in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their understandings have not been brought up like mine, have not had the same Masters, they have not met with the same books, nor the same compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or have not the same interest, or are not so wise, or else are wiser, (that is, for some reason or other which I neither doe understand, nor ought to blame) have not the same opinions that I have, and do not determine their Schoole Questions to the sense of my Sect or interest.</p>
                  <p>But now I know before hand, that those men who will endure none but their own Sect, will make all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41208:9"/>
manner of attemps against these purposes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and compliance, and say I, or doe I what I can, will tell all their Proselytes that I preach indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Religion, that I say it is no matter how we believe, nor what they professe: But that they may comply with all Sects, and doe violence to their own consciences, that they may be sav'd in all Religions, and so make way for a <hi>colluvies</hi> of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, and by consequence destroy all Religion. Nay, they will say worse then all this, and but that I am not used to their phrases and formes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, I am perswaded I might represent fine Tragedies before hand. And this will be such an objection, that although I am most confident I shall make apparent to be as false and scandalous as the Objectors themselves are zealous and impatient, yet besides that, I believe the Objection will come where my answers will not come, or not be understood; I am also confident that in defiance and incurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all that I shall say, some men will persist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously in the accusation, and deny my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion in despite of mee: well, but however I will try.</p>
                  <p>And first I answer, that whatsoever is against the foundation of Faith, or contrary to good life and the lawes of obedience, or destructive to humane society, and the publick and just interests of bodies politick, is out of the limits of my Question, and does not pretend to complyance or toleration: So that I allow no indifferency, nor any countenance to those Religions whose principles destroy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41208:10"/>
nor to those Religions (if there be any such) that teach ill life, nor doe I think that any thing will now excuse from beliefe of a fundamentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, except stupidity or sottishnesse and naturall inhability. This alone is sufficient answer to this vanity, but I have much more to say.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The intendment of my Discourse is, that permissions should be in Questions speculative, indeterminable, curious, and unnecessary, and that men would not make more necessities then God made, which indeed are not many. The fault I find and seek to remedy is, that men are so dogmaticall and resolute in their opinions, and impatient of others disagreeings in those things wherein is no sufficient meanes of union and determination, but that men should let opinions and problemes keep their own forms, and not be obtruded as axiomes, nor questions in the vast collection of the systeme of Divinity, be adopted into the family of Faith: And I think I have reason to desire this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is hard to say, that he who would not have men put to death, or punished corporally for such things, for which no humane Authority is sufficient either for cognisance or determination, or competent for infliction, that he perswades to an indifferency, when he referres to another Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, which is competent, sufficient, infallible, just, and highly severe. No man or company of men can judge or punish our thoughts, or secret purposes whilest they so remaine, and yet it will be unequall to say, that he who owns this Doctrine preaches it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41208:10"/>
lawfull for men to think or purpose what they will. And so it is in matters of doubtfull disputation (such as are the distinguishing Articles of most of the Sects of Christendome:) So it is in matters intellectuall (which are not cognoscible by a secular power) in matters spirituall (which are to be discerned by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Authority, which cannot make corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions) and in Questions indeterminate, (which are doubtfully propounded or obscurely, and therefore may be <hi>in utramque partem</hi> disputed or believed;) for God alone must be Judge of these matters, who alone is Master of our souls, and hath a dominion over humane understanding, and he that sayes this, does not say that indifferency is perswaded, because God alone is Judge of erring persons.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, No part of this Discourse teaches or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages variety of Sects, and contradiction in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but supposes them already in being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since there are, and ever were, and ever will be variety of opinions, because there is variety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane understandings, and uncertainty in things, no man should be too forward in determining all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, nor so forward in prescribing to others, nor invade that liberty which God hath left to us intire by propounding many things obscurely, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting our souls and understandings from all power externally compulsory: So that the restraint is laid upon mens tyranny, but no license given to mens opinions, they are not considered in any of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, but in the premises only as an Argument to exhort to charity. So that if I perswade a license
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41208:11"/>
of discrediting any thing which God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to believe, and allow a liberty where God hath not allowed it, let it be shewn, and let the Objection presse as hard as it can; but to say that men are too forward in condemning where God hath declared no sentence nor prescribed any rule; is to disswade from tyranny, not to encourage licentiousnesse, is to take away a license of judging, not to give a license of dogmatizing what every one please, or as may best serve his turn. And for the other part of the Objection;</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This Discourse is so farre from giving leave to men to professe any thing though they believe the contrary, that it takes order that no man shall bee put to it, for I earnestly contend that another mans opinion shall be no rule to mine, and that my opinion shall be no snare and prejudice to my selfe, that men use one another so charitably and so gently, that no errour or violence tempt men to hypocrisy, this very thing being one of the Arguments I use to perswade permissions, lest compulsion introduce hypocrisy, and make sincerity troublesome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If men would not call all opinions by the name of Religion, and superstructures by the name of fundamentall Articles, and all fancies by the glorious appellative of Faith, this objection would have no pretence or footing, so that it is the disease of the men, not any cause that is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by such precepts of charity that makes them perpetually clamorous: And it would be hard to say
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41208:11"/>
that such Physitians are incurious of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and neglectfull of their health, who speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the unreasonablenesse of such Empericks that would cut off a mans head if they see but a Wart upon his cheek, or a dimple upon his chin, or any lines in his face to distinguish him from another man; the case is altogether the same, and we may as well decree a Wart to be mortall as a various opinion in <hi>re alioqui non necessariâ</hi> to be capitall and damnable.</p>
                  <p>For I consider, that there are but few Doctrines of Christianity, that were ordered to be preached to all the world, to every single person, and made a necessary Article of his explicite beliefe: Other Doctrines which are all of them not simply necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are either such as are not clearly revealed, or such as are: If they be clearely revealed, and that I know so too, or may, but for my own fault, I am not to be excused, but for this I am to be left to Gods judgement, unlesse my fault be externally such as to be cognoscible and punishable in humane ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory: But then, if it be not so revealed but that wise men and good men differ in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is a clear case, it is not <hi>inter dogmata ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria simpliciter,</hi> and then it is certain I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore safely disbelieve it, because I may be safely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it: For if I may with innocence be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, then to know it or believe it, is not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply obligatory; ignorance is absolutely inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with such an obligation, because it is destructive
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41208:12"/>
and a plaine negative to its performance, and if I doe my honest endeavour to understand it, and yet doe not attain it, it is certain that is not obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to me so much as by accident, for no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can presse the person of a man, if it be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, no man is bound to doe more then his best, no man is bound to have an excellent understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to be infallible, or to be wiser then he can, for these are things that are not in his choyce, and therefore not a matter of a Law, nor subject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and punishment; so that where ignorance of the Article is not a sin, there disbelieving it in the right sense, or believing it in the wrong, is not breach of any duty, essentially or accidentally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, neither in the thing it selfe, nor to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; that is, he is neither bound to the Article, nor to any endeavours or antecedent acts of voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and choyce, and that man who may safely bee ignorant of the proposition, is not tyed at all to search it out, and if not at all to search it, then certainly not to find it: All the obligation we are capable of, is not to be malicious or voluntarily criminall in any kind, and then if by accident we find out a truth, we are obliged to believe it; and so will every wise or good man doe; indeed he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe otherwise: But if he disbelieves an Article without malice, or design, or involuntarily, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly, it is contradiction to say it is a sinne to him who might totally have been ignorant of it; for that he believes it in the wrong sense, it is his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41208:12"/>
ignorance, and it is impossible that where hee hath heartily endeavoured to finde out a truth, that this endeavour should make him guilty of a sinne, which would never have been laid to his charge, if he had taken no paines at all: His ignorance in this case is not a fault at all; possibly it might, if there had been no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have cur'd it.</p>
                  <p>So that there is wholly a mistake in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: For true it is, there are some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which if a man never heare of, they will not be required of him; and they who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read might safely be ignorant, that <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck</hi> was King of <hi>Salem;</hi> but he who reads it in the Scripture, may not safely contradict it, although before that knowledge did arrive to him, he might safely have been ignorant of it: But this although it be true, is not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our Question; For <hi>in sensu diviso</hi> this is true, that which at one time a man may be ignorant of, at some other time he may not disbelieve: But <hi>in sensu conjuncto</hi> it is false; For at what time, and in what circumstance so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is no sinne to be ignorant, at that time and in that conjuncture, it is no sinne to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and such is the nature of all Questions disputable, which are therefore not required of us to bee believed in any one particular sense, because the nature of the thing is such as not to be necessary to be known at all simply and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41208:13"/>
absolutely, and such is the ambiguity and cloud of its face and representment as not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary so much as by accident, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to the particular sence of any one person.</p>
                  <p>And yet such is the iniquity of men, that they suck in opinions as wild Asses doe the wind, without distinguishing the wholesome from the corrupted ayre, and then live upon it at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and when all their confidence is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on zeale and mistake, yet therefore because they are zealous and mistaken, they are impatient of contradiction.</p>
                  <p>But besides that against this I have laid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice enough from the dictates of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is observable that this with its appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant degrees, I meane restraint of Prophesying, imposing upon other mens understanding, being masters of their consciences, and lording it over their Faith, came in with the retinue and traine of Antichrist, that is, they came as other abuses and corruptions of the Church did, by reason of the iniquity of times, and the cooling of the first heats of Christianity, and the encrease of interest, and the abatements of Christian sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, when the Churches fortune grew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and her Sonnes grew worse, and some of her Fathers worst of all; For in the first three hundred years there was no sign of persecuting any man for his opinion, though at that time
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41208:13"/>
there were very horrid opinions commenced, and such which were exemplary and parallel enough to determine this Question; for they then were assaulted by new Sects which destroyed the common principles of nature, of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of innocence and publike society; and they who used all the meanes Christian and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for their disimprovement and conviction, thought not of using corporall force, otherwise then by blaming such proceedings: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doe not only urge their not doing it as an Argument of the unlawfulnesse of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, but their defying it and speaking against such practises, as unreasonable and destructive of Christianity: For so <hi>Tertullian</hi> is expresse, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ad Scapulat.</note> 
                     <hi>juris &amp; naturalis potestatis, unicuique quod putaverit colere, sed nec religionis est cogere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem, quae suscipi debet sponte non vi:</hi> The same is the Doctrine of S. <hi>Cyprian, Lactantius,</hi> S. <hi>Hilary, Minutius Felix, Sulpitius Severus,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Austin, Damascen, Theophylact, Socrates Scholasticus,</hi> and S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> as they are severally referr'd to and urg'd upon occasion in the following Discourse.</p>
                  <p>To which I adde, that all wise Princes till they were overborn with faction or sollicited by peevish persons, gave Toleration to differing Sects, whose opinions did not disturb the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like interest: But at first, there were some he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall persons that were also impatient of an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41208:14"/>
Adversary, and they were the men who at first entreated the Emperours to persecute the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; but till foure hundred yeares after Christ, no Catholick persons, or very few, did provoke the secular arme, or implore its aide against the Hereticks, save only that <hi>Arrius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himselfe so seditiously and tumultuarily, that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers procur'd a temporary Decree for his relegation, but it was soon taken off and God left to be his Judge, who indeed did it to some purpose, when he was trusted with it and the matter wholly left to him.</p>
                  <p>But as the Ages grew worse, so men grew more cruell and unchristian, and in the Greek Church <hi>Atticus,</hi> and <hi>Nestorius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople, Theodosius</hi> of <hi>Synada,</hi> and some few others who had forgotten the mercies of their great Master, and their own duty, grew implacable and furious and impatient of contradiction. It was a bold and an arrogant speech which <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> made in his Sermon before <hi>Theodosius</hi> the younger, <hi>Da mihi, O Imperator, terram ab hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis repurgatam, &amp; ego tibi vicissim coelum dabo: Disperde mecum haereticos, &amp; ego tecum disperdam Persas:</hi> It was as groundlesse and unwarrantable, as it was bloody and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
                  <p>And we see the contrary events prove truer, then this groundlesse and unlearned promise; for <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> were prosperous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41208:14"/>
Princes, and have to all Ages a precious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and the reputation of a great piety; but they were so farre from doing what <hi>Nestorius</hi> had suggested, that they restrained him from his violence and immanity, and <hi>Theodosius</hi> did highly commend the good Bishop <hi>Proclus</hi> for his sweetnesse of deportment towards erring persons, far above the cruelty of his Predecessor <hi>Atticus:</hi> And the experience which Christendom hath had in this last Age is Argument enough, that Toleration of differing opinions is so farre from disturbing the publick peace, or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the interest of Princes and Common-Wealths, that it does advantage to the publick, it secures peace, because there is not so much as the pretence of Religion left to such persons to contend for it, being already indulged to them. When <hi>France</hi> fought against the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi> the spilling of her own blood was argument enough of the imprudence of that way of promoting Religion; but since she hath given permission to them, the world is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse how prosperous she hath been ever since: But the great instance is in the differing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Government and successe which <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had: The clemency of the first had almost extinguished the flame; but when she was removed, D' <hi>Alva</hi> succeeded and managed the matter of Religion with fire and sword; he made the flame so great,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41208:15"/>
that his Religion and his Prince too hath both been almost quite turned out of the Countrey. <hi>Pelli è medio sapientiam, quoties vi res agitur,</hi> said <hi>Ennius;</hi> and therefore the best of men, and the most glorious of Princes were alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give Toleration, but never to make execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for matters disputable: <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of the life of <hi>Constantine</hi> reports these words of the <hi>Emperour, Parem cum fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus ii qui errant, pacis &amp; quietis fruitionem gaudentes accipiant: Ipsa siquidem communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis &amp; societatis restitutio ad rectam etiam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis viam perducere potest. Nemo cui quam mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestus sit, quisque quod animo destinat hoc etiam faciat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed there is great reason for Princes to give Toleration to disagreeing persons, whose opinions by faire meanes cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; for if the persons be confident, they will serve God according to their perswasions; and if they be publikely prohibited, they will pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately convene, and then all those inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and mischiefes which are Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the permission of Conventicles, are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the publick permissions of differing Religions, because the denying of the publick worship will certainly produce private Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, against which all wise Princes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealths have upon great reasons made E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts and severe Sanctions, <hi>Quic quid enim agitur</hi>

King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory, in his Letters to the States of the United Provinces, dated 6 <hi>March.</hi> 1613.

reasonable by the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and his excellent Sonne <hi>Maximilian;</hi> For they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that violence did exasperate, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed, unsuccessefull and unreasonable, and therefore they made Decrees of Toleration, and appointed tempers and expedients to be drawn up by discreet persons, and <hi>George Cassander</hi> was design'd to this great work, and did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards it: And <hi>Emanuel Philibert,</hi> D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> repenting of his warre undertaken for Religion against the <hi>Pedemontans,</hi> promised them Toleration, and was as good as his word: As much is done by the Nobility of <hi>Polonia.</hi> So that the best Princes and the best Bishops gave Toleration and Impunities; but it is known that the first Persecutions of disagreeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> by the <hi>Circumcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> and from them, they of the Church took examples, who in small numbers did sometime perswade it, sometime practise it. And among the Greeks it became a publick and authorized practise, till the Question of Images grew hot and high; for then the Worshippers of Images having taken their example from the Empresse <hi>Irene,</hi> who put her Sonnes eyes out for making an Edict against Images, began to be as cruell as they were deceived, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who then blew the coales to some purpose.</p>
                  <p>And that I may upon this occasion give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41208:16"/>
of this affaire in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is remarkable that till the time of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>A. D.</hi> 525. the Catholicks and <hi>Novatians</hi> had Churches indifferently permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, but the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> whose interest was much concerned in it, spoke much against it, and laboured the era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and at last when they got power into their hands they served them accordingly, but it is observed by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> that when the first Persecution was made against them at <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> I, at the same instant the <hi>Gothes</hi> invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Lords of all, it being just in God to bring a Persecution upon them for true beliefe, who with an incompetent Authority and insufficient grounds doe persecute an errour lesse materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in persons agreeing with them in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the same common faith. And I have heard it observ'd as a blessing upon S. <hi>Austin</hi> (who was so mercifull to erring persons as the greatest part of his life in all senses, even when he had twice chang'd his mind, yet to Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, and never to endure they should be given over to the secular power to be kild) that the very night the <hi>Vandals</hi> set down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his City of <hi>Hippo</hi> to besiege it, he dyed and went to God, being (as a reward of his mercifull Doctrine) taken from the miseries to come, and yet that very thing was also a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41208:17"/>
issue of the Divine Providence upon that City, who not long before had altered their profession into truth by force, and now were falling into their power, who afterward by a greater force turned them to be <hi>Arrians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Popes were the first Preachers of force and violence in matters of opinion, and that so zealously, that Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> suffered himselfe to be imprisoned and handled roughly by the Emperour <hi>Iustinian,</hi> rather then he would consent to the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and peace of certain disagreeing persons, but as yet it came not so farre as death. The first that preached that Doctrine was <hi>Dominick,</hi> the Founder of the Begging Orders of Friers, the Friers Preachers; in memory of which the Inquisition is intrusted only to the Friers of his Order; and if there be any force in dreams, or truth in Legends (as there is not much in either) this very thing might be signified by his Mothers dreame, who the night before <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> was born, dream'd she was brought to Bed of a huge Dog with a fire-brand in his mouth: Sure enough, however his disciples ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the dreame, it was a better sign that he should prove a rabid, furious Incendiary, then any thing else; whatever he might be in the other parts of his life, in this Doctrine he was not much better, as appears in his deportment toward the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> against whom hee so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41208:17"/>
preached, <hi>adeo quidem ut centum haereticorum millia ab octo millibus Catholicorum fusa &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfecta fuisse perhibeantur,</hi> saith one of him; and of those who were taken, 180 were burnt to death, because they would not abjure their Doctrine: This was the first example of putting erring persons to death, that I find in the Roman Church; For about 170 years before, <note place="margin">B. Bruno Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarianes è suâ diocesi expulit, non morti aut sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciis corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</note> 
                     <hi>Berengarius</hi> fell into opinion concerning the blessed Sacrament which they cald Heresy, and recanted, and relapsed, and recanted againe, and fell again two or three times, saith <hi>Gerson</hi> writing against <hi>Romant</hi> of the <hi>Rose,</hi> and yet he died <hi>siccâ morte</hi> his own naturall death, and with hope of Heaven, and yet <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was once his judge, which shewes that at that time <hi>Rome</hi> was not come to so great heigths of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. In <hi>England,</hi> although the Pope had as great power here as any where, yet there were no Executions for matter of opinion known till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who (because he Usurped the Crown) was willing by all means to endeare the Clergy by destroying their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that so he might be sure of them to all his purposes. And indeed, it may become them well enough, who are wiser in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then the children of light, it may possibly serve the pollicies of evill persons, but never the pure and chaste designs of Christianity, which admits no blood but Christs, and the imitating
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41208:18"/>
blood of Martyrs, but knowes nothing how to serve her ends, by persecuting any of her erring children.</p>
                  <p>By this time I hope it will not be thought reasonable to say, he that teaches mercy to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring persons, teaches indifferency in Religion, unlesse so many Fathers, and so many Churches, and the best of Emperours, and all the world (till they were abused by Tyranny, Popery, and Faction) did teach indifferency, for I have shewn that Christianity does not punish corporally, persons erring spiritually, but indeed Popery does; The <hi>Donatists,</hi> and <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> and <hi>Arrians,</hi> and the <hi>Itaciani,</hi> they of old did: In the middle Ages, the Patrons of Images did, and the Papists at this day doe, and have done ever since they were taught it by their S. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, And yet after all this, I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to exempt my selfe from the clamour of this Objection: For let all errours be as much and as zealously suppressed as may be, (the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the following Discourse contradicts not that) but let it be done by such meanes as are proper instruments of their suppression, by Preaching and Disputation (so that neither of them breed disturbance) by charity and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by holinesse of life, assiduity of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the word of God and prayer.</p>
                  <p>For these wayes are most naturall, most prudent,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41208:18"/>
most peaceable, and effectuall. Only let not men be hasty in calling every dislik'd opinion by the name of Heresy, and when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that they will call it so, let them use the erring person like a brother, not beat him like a dog, or convince him with a gibbet, or vex him out of his understanding and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>And now if men will still say, I perswade to indifferency, there is no help for me, for I have given reasons against it, I must beare it as well as I can, I am not yet without remedy as they are, for patience will help me, and reason will not cure them, let them take their course, and He take mine:</p>
                  <p>Only I will take leave to consider this (and they would doe well to doe so too) that unlesse Faith be kept within its own latitude, and not cald out to patrocinate every lesse necessary opinion, and the interest of every Sect, or pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish person; and if damnation be pronounced against Christians believing the Creed, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good lives, because they are deceived, or are said to be deceived in some opinions lesse necessary, there is no way in the world to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie unlearned persons in the choice of their Religion, or to appease the unquietnesse of a scrupulous conscience: For suppose an honest Citizen whose imployment and parts will not enable him to judge the disputes and arguings
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41208:19"/>
of great Clerks, sees factions commenced and managed with much bitternesse by persons who might on either hand be fit enough to guide him; when if he follows either, he is disquieted and pronounced damned by the other (who also if he be the most unreasonable in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will perhaps be more furious in his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) what shall this man doe, where shall he rest the sole of his foot? Upon the Doctrine of the Church where he lives? Well! but that he heares declaimed against perpetually, and other Churches claime highly and pretend fairely for truth, and condemne his Church: If I tell him that he must live a good life, and believe the Creed, and not trouble himselfe with their disputes, or interesting himselfe in Sects and Factions, I speak reason: Because no law of God ties him to believe more then what is of essentiall necessity, and whatsoever he shall come to know to be reveal'd by God: Now if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves his Creed, he believes all that is necessary to all, or of it selfe, and if he doe his morall endeavour beside, he can doe no more toward finding out all the rest, and then he is secured; but then if this will secure him, why doe men presse further and pretend every opinion as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and that in so high degree that if they all said true, or any two indeed of them, in 500 Sects which are in the world (and for ought I know there may be 5000) it is 500 to one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41208:19"/>
but that every man is damn'd, for every Sect damnes all but it selfe, and that is damn'd of 499, and it is excellent fortune then if that escape; and there is the same reason in every one of them, that is, it is extreme unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse in all of them to pronounce damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against such persons against whom clearely and dogmatically holy Scripture hath not; <hi>In odiosis quod minimum est sequimur, in favoribus quod est maximum,</hi> saith the Law, and therefore we should say any thing, or make any excuse that is in any degree reasonable, rather then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the world to Hell, especially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these two things, that we our selves are as apt to be deceived as any are, and that they who are deceived, when they used their morall industry that they might not be deceived, if they perish for this, they perish for what they could not help.</p>
                  <p>But however, if the best security in the world be not in neglecting all Sects, and subdivisions of men, and fixing our selves on points necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and plain, and on honest and pious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, according to our severall capacities and opportunities for all the rest, if I say all this be not through the mercies of God, the best security to all unlearned persons, and learned too, where shall we fix, where shall we either have peace or security? If you bid me follow your Doctrine, you must tell me why, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41208:20"/>
when you have I am not able to judge, or if I be as able as other people are, yet when I have judged, I may be deceived too, and so may you, or any man else you bid me follow, so that I am no whit the nearer truth or peace.</p>
                  <p>And then if we look abroad, and consider how there is scarce any Church, but is highly charg'd by many Adversaries in many things, possibly we may see a reason to charge every one of them in some things; And what shall we do then? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath spots enough, and all the world is inquisitive enough to find out more, and to represent these to her greatest disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Greek Church denies the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the holy Ghost from the Son; If that be false Doctrine, she is highly too blame, if it be not, then all the Western Churches are too blame for saying the contrary: And there is no Church that is in prosperity, but alters her Doctrine every Age, either by bringing in new Doctrines, or by contradicting her old, which shewes that none are satisfied with themselves, or with their own confessions: And since all Churches believe themselves fallible, that only excepted which all other Churches say is most of all deceived, it were strange if in so many Articles which make up their severall bodies of Confessions, they had not mistaken every one of them in something or other: The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches maintaine Consubstantiation, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41208:20"/>
                     <hi>Zuinglians</hi> are Sacramentaries, the <hi>Calvinists</hi> are fierce in the matters of absolute Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all these reject Episcopacy, which the Primitive Church would have made no doubt to have called Heresy: The <hi>Socinians</hi> professe a portentous number of strange opinions; they deny the holy Trinity, and the satisfaction of our blessed Saviour: The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> laugh at Paedo-baptism; The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Churches are <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian:</hi> where then shall we fix our confidence, or joyn Communion? to pitch upon any one of these is to throw the dice, if salvation be to be had only in one of them, and that every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that by chance hath made a Sect, and is distinguished by a name, be damnable.</p>
                  <p>If this consideration does not deceive me, we have no other help in the midst of these distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and dis-unions, but all of us to be united in that common terme, which as it does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Church in its being such, so it is the medium of the Communion of Saints, and that is the Creed of the Apostles, and in all other things an honest endeavour to find out <note n="*" place="margin">Clem.

that will, and no man can be reasonably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, or satisfied in any thing else, unlesse he throwes himselfe upon chance, or absolute predestination, or his own confidence, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which it is two to one at least but he may miscarry.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre I thought I had reason on my side, and I suppose I have made it good upon its proper grounds, in the pages following. But then if the result be, that men must be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their opinions, and that Christians must not Persecute Christians; I have also as much reason to reprove all those oblique Arts which are not direct Persecutions of mens persons, but they are indirect proceedings, ungentle and unchristian, servants of faction and interest, provocations to zeal and animosities, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of learning and ingenuity. And these are suppressing all the monuments of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, forcing them to recant, and burning their Books.</p>
                  <p>For it is a strange industry, and an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune diligence that was used by our fore-fathers; of all those Heresies which gave them battle and imployment, we have absolutely no Record or Monument, but what themselves who were Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries have transmitted to us, and we know that Adversaries, especially such who observ'd all opportunities to discredit both the persons and doctrines of the Enemy, are not alwayes the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41208:21"/>
best records or witnesses of such transactions. We see it now in this very Age, in the present distemperatures, that parties are no good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters of the actions of the adverse side: And if we cannot be confident of the truth of a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now, now I say that it is possible for any man, and likely that the interessed adversary will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover the imposture, it is farre more unlikely, that after Ages should know any other truth, but such as serves the ends of the representers: I am sure such things were never taught us by Christ and his Apostles, and if we were sure that our selves spoke truth, or that truth were able to justifie her selfe, it were better if to preserve a Doctrine wee did not destroy a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and out of zeale pretending to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, loose the glories and rewards of ingenuity and Christian simplicity.</p>
                  <p>Of the same consideration is mending of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, not to their own mind but to ours, that is, to mend them so as to spoile them; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the publication of Books, in which there is nothing impious, or against the publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, leaving out clauses in Translations, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing mens persons, charging disavowed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins upon men, and the persons of the men with the consequents of their Doctrine, which they deny either to be true or to be consequent, false reporting of Disputations and Conferences, burning Books by the hand of the hang-man,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41208:22"/>
and all such Arts, which shew that we either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust God for the maintenance of his truth, or that we distrust the cause, or distrust our selves and our abilities: I will say no more of these, but only concerning the last, I shall transcribe a passage out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the life of <hi>Iulius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi> who gives this account of it, <hi>Veniam non petissem nisi incursaturus tam saeva &amp; infesta virtutibus tempora.

                  <p>And to my understanding, it is a plain Art and design of the Devill, to make us so in love with our own opinions, as to call them Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that we may be proud in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and besides, that by our zeale in our opinions, we grow coole in our piety and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall duties, he also by this earnest contention.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41208:23"/>
does directly destroy good life, by engagement of Zealots to do any thing rather then be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and loose their beloved propositions: But I would faine know why is not any vitious habit as bad or worse then a false opinion? Why are we so zealous against those we call Hereticks, and yet great friends with drunkards, and fornicators, &amp; swearers, and intemperate and idle persons? Is it because we are commanded by the Apostle to reject a Heretick after two admonitions, and not to bid such a one God speed? It is a good reason why we should be zealous against such persons, provided we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake them not. For those of whom these Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles speak, are such as deny Christ to be come in the flesh, such as deny an Article of Creed; and in such odious things, it is not safe nor chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to extend the gravamen and punishment beyond the instances the Apostles make, or their exact parallels. But then also, it would be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that the Apostles speak as fiercely against communion with fornicators, and all disorders practicall, as against communion with Hereticks, <hi>If any man that is called a brother be a Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such a one no not to eat:</hi> I am certain that a Drunkard is as contrary to God, and lives as contrary to the Lawes of Christianity, as a Heretick; and I am also sure that I know what drunkennesse is, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41208:23"/>
I am not sure that such an opinion is Heresy, neither would other men be so sure as they think for if they did consider it aright, and observe the infinite deceptions, and causes of decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in wise men, and in most things, and in all doubtfull Questions, and that they did not mistake confidence for certainty.</p>
                  <p>But indeed, I could not but smile at those jolly Fryers, two <hi>Franciscans</hi> offered themselves to the fire to prove <hi>Savonarola</hi> to be a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, but a certaine <hi>Iacobine</hi> offered himselfe to <note place="margin">Commin. l. 8. c. 19.</note> the fire to prove that <hi>Savonarola</hi> had true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and was no Heretick; in the meane time <hi>Savonarola</hi> preacht, but made no such confident offer, not durst he venture at that new kind of fire Ordeal; and put case all four had past through the fire, and dyed in the flames, what would that have proved? Had he been a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or no Heretick, the more or the lesse, for the confidence of these Zealous Ideots? If we mark it, a great many Arguments whereon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects rely, are no better probation then this comes to. Confidence is the first, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the third part of a very great many of their propositions.</p>
                  <p>But now if men would a little turn the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and be as zealous for a good life, and all the strictest precepts of Christianity (which is a Religion the most holy, the most reasonable, and the most consummate that ever was taught
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41208:24"/>
to man) as they are for such propositions in which neither the life, nor the ornament of Christianity is concerned, we should find, that as a consequent of this piety, men would be as carefull as they could, to find out all truths, and the sense of all revelations which may concern their duty; and where men were miserable and could not, yet others that liv'd good lives too would also be so charitable, as not to adde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to this misery; and both of them are parts of good life, to be compassionate, and to help to beare one anothers burdens, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the weak, but to entertain him meekly, that's a precept of charity, and to endeavour to find out the whole will of God, that also is a part of the obedience, the choyce and the excellency of Faith, and hee lives not a good life, that does not doe both these.</p>
                  <p>But men think they have more reason to bee zealous against Heresy then against a vice in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, because Heresy is infectious and dangerous, and the principle of much evill: Indeed if by a Heresy we mean that which is against an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Creed, and breaks part of the Covenant made between God and man by the mediation of Jesus Christ, I grant it to be a very grievous crime, a calling Gods veracity into question, and a destruction also of good life, because upon the Articles of Creed, obedience is built, and it lives or dies, as the effect does by its proper
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41208:24"/>
cause; for Faith is the morall cause of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But then Heresy, that is, such as this, is also a vice, and the person criminall, and so the sin is to be esteem'd in its degrees of malignity, and let men be as zealous against it as they can, and imploy the whole arsenall of the spirituall armour against it, such as this, is worse then adultery or murther, in as much as the soule is more noble then the body, and a false doctrine is of greater dissemination and extent then a single act of violence or impurity. Adultery or murder is a duell, but Heresy (truly and indeed such) is an unlawfull warre, it slayes thousands: The loosing of Faith is like digging down a foundation; all the superstructures of hope, and patience, and charity fall with it: And besides this, Heresy of all crimes is the most inexcusable and of least temptation; for true faith is most commonly kept with the least trouble of any grace in the world; and Heresy of it selfe hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no pleasure in it, but is a very punishment; because faith as it opposes hereticall or false opinions, and distinguishes from charity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in meare acts of believing, which because they are of true propositions, are naturall and proportionable to the understanding, and more honourable then false. But then concerning those things which men now adayes call Heresy, they cannot be so formidable as they are represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if we consider that drunkennesse is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41208:25"/>
certainly a damnable sin, and that there are more Drunkards then Hereticks, and that drunkennesse is parent of a thousand vices, it may better bee said of this vice then of most of those opinions which we call Heresies, it is infectious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and the principle of much evill, and therefore as fit an object for a pious zeale to contest against, as is any of those opinions which trouble mens ease or reputation, for that is the greatest of their malignity.</p>
                  <p>But if we consider that Sects are made and opinions are called Heresies upon interest, and the grounds of emolument, we shall see that a good life would cure much of this mischiefe. For first, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is the great dictatrix of dogmaticall resolutions, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarer of Heresy, and calls Heretick more then all the world besides, hath made that the rule of Heresy, which is the conservatory of interest, and the ends of men. For to recede from the Doctrine of the Church, with them makes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, that is, to disrepute their Authority and not to obey them, not to be their subjects, not to give them the Empire of our conscience, is the great <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Heresy.</p>
                  <p>So that with them, Heresy is to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clearely by humane ends, not by Divine Rules; that is formall Heresy which does ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially disserve them, and it would make a suspicious man a little inquisitive into their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41208:25"/>
particular Doctrins, and when hee finds that Indulgences, and Jubilies, and Purgatories, and Masses, and Offices for the dead, are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; that the Doctrine of primacy, of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, of superiority over Councels, of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect power in temporals, are great instruments of secular honour; would be apt enough to think that if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would learn to lay her honour at the feet of the Crucifix, and despise the world, and preferre <hi>Ierusalem</hi> before <hi>Rome,</hi> and Heaven above the Lateran, that these opinions would not have in them any native strength to support them, against the perpetuall assaults of their Adversaries, that speak so much reason and Scripture against them. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in the Roman Religion, but I wish it may be considered also how farre mens Doctrines in other Sects serve mens temporall ends, so farre that it would not bee unreasonable or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to attempt to cure some of their distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures or misperswasions by the salutary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of sanctity and holy life: Sure enough, if it did not more concern their reputation and their lasting interest to be counted true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rather then good livers, they would rather endeavour to live well, then to bee accounted of a right opinion in things beside the Creed.</p>
                  <p>For my own particular I cannot but expect, that God in his Justice should enlarge the bounds of the Turkish Empire, or some other way pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41208:26"/>
Christians by reason of their pertinacious disputing about things unnecessary, undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and unprofitable, and for their hating and persecuting their brethren which should be as dear to them as their own lives, for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to one anothers follies, and senselesse vanities: How many volumnes have been writ about Angels, about immaculate conception, about originall sin, when that all that is solid reason or clear Revelation, in all these three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, may be reasonably enough comprized in fourty lines! And in these trifles and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, men are curiously busie while they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect those glorious precepts of Christianity and holy life, which are the glories of our Religion, and would enable us to a happy eternity.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, Thus farre my thoughts have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me, and then I thought I had reason to goe further, and to examine the proper grounds upon which these perswasions might rely and stand firme, in case any body should contest against them: For possibly men may be angry at me and my design; for I doe all them great displeasure, who think no end is then well ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when their interest is disserved; and but that I have writ so untowardly and heavily, that I am not worth a confutation, possibly some or other might be writing against me. But then I must tell them I am prepared of an answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand: For I think I have spoken reason in my
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41208:26"/>
Book, and examined it with all the severity I have, and if after all this I be deceiv'd, this confirms me in my first opinion, and becomes a new Argument to me, that I have spoken reason; for it furnishes me with a new instance, that it is necessary, there should bee a mutuall complyance and Toleration, because even then when a man thinks he hath most reason to bee confident, hee may easily bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>For I am sure, I have no other design but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and advantage of truth, and I may truly use the words of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Non stude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus paci in detrimentum verae doctrinae, .... ut facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis &amp; mansuetudinis famam colligamus:</hi> But I have writ this because I thought it was necessary and seasonable, and charitable, and agreeable to the great precepts and design of Christianity, consonant to the practise of the Apostles, and of the best Ages of the Church, most agreeable to Scripture and reason, to revelation and the nature of the thing; and it is such a Doctrine, that if there be variety in humane affaires, if the event of things be not settled in a durable consistence, but is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, every one of us all may have need of it: I shall only therefore desire that they who will reade it may come to the reading it with as much sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of purposes and unmixed desires of truth, as I did to the writing it, and that no man trouble himselfe with me or my discourse, that thinks before hand that his opinion cannot be reasonably altered. If he thinks me to be mistaken before he tries, let
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41208:27"/>
him also think that hee may be mistaken too, and that he who judges before he heares, is mistaken though he gives a right sentence:</p>

In the meane time, Modesty were better for us both, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for all men: For when men indeed are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, amongst other things they are able to separate certainties from uncertainties; If they be not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is pity that their ignorance should bee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, or discompose the publike peace, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate confidence.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He infinite variety of Opinions in matters of Religion, as they have troubled Christendome, with interests, factions, and partialities; so have they caused great divisions of the heart, and variety of thoughts and designes amongst pious and prudent men. For they all seeing the inconveniences which the dis-union of perswasions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions have produced directly or accidentally, have thought themselves obliged to stop this inundation of mischiefes, and have made attempts accordingly. But it hath hapned to most of them as to a mistaken Physitian, who gives excellent physick but mis-applies it, and so misses of his cure; so have these men, their attempts have therefore been ineffectuall; for they put their help to a wrong part, or they have endeavoured to cure the symptomes, and have let the disease alone till it seem'd incurable. Some have endeavoured to re-unite these
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41208:31"/>
fractions by propounding such a Guide which they were all bound to follow; hoping that the Unity of a Guide, would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded unity of mindes; but who this Guide should be at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came such a Question, that it was made part of the fire that was to be quenched; so farre was it from extinguishing any part of the flame. Others thought of a Rule, and this must be the meanes of Union, or nothing could doe it. But supposing all the World had been agreed of this Rule, yet the interpretation of it was so full of variety, that this also became part of the disease, for which the cure was pretended. All men resolv'd upon this, that though they yet had not hit upon the right, yet some way must be thought upon to reconcile differences in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thinking so long as this variety should last, Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was not advanced, and the work of the Gospel went on but slowly: Few men in the mean time considered, that so long as men had such variety of principles, such severall constitutions, educations, tempers, and distempers, hopes, interests and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, degrees of light, and degrees of understanding, it was impossible all should be of one minde. And what is impossible to be done, is not necessary it should be done: And therefore, although variety of Opinions was impossible to be cured (and they who attempted it, did like him who claps his shoulder to the ground to stop an earth-quake) yet the inconveniences ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from it might possibly be cured, not by uniting their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes, that was to be dispaird of, but by curing that which caus'd these mischiefes, and accidentall inconveniences of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeings. For although these inconveniences which every man sees and feeles were consequent to this diversity of perswasions, yet it was but accidentally and by chance, in as much as wee see that in many things, and they of great concernment, men alow to themselves and to each other a liberty of disagreeing, and no hurt neither. And certainely if diversity of Opinions, were of it selfe the cause of mischiefes it would be so ever, that is, regularly and universally (but that we see it is not:) For there are disputes in Christendome concerning matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concernment then most of those Opinions that distinguish Sects, and make factions; and yet because men are permitted to differ in those great matters, such evills are not consequent to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41208:31"/>
such differences, as are to the uncharitable managing of smaller and more inconsiderable Questions. It is of greater consequence to believe right in the Question of the validity or invalidity of a death-bed repentance, then to believe aright in the Question of Purgatory; and the consequences of the Doctrine of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, are of deeper and more materiall consideration then the products of the beliefe of the lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse of private Masses; and yet these great concernments where a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Prophecying in these Questions hath been permitted, hath made no distinct Communion, no sects of Christians, and the others have, and so have these too in those places where they have peremptorily been determind on either side. Since then if men are quiet and charitable in some dis-agreeings, that then and there the inconvenience ceases, if they were so in all others where lawfully they might (and they may in most,) Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome should be no longer rent in pieces, but would be redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated in a new Pentecost, and although the Spirit of God did rest upon us in divided tongues, yet so long as those tongues were of fire not to kindle strife, but to warme our affections, and inflame our charities, we should finde that this variety of Opinions in severall persons would be look't upon as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only of diversity of operations, while the Spirit is the same; and that another man believes not so well as I, is onely an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I have a better and a clearer illumination than he, that I have a better gift than he, received a speciall grace and favour, and excell him in this, and am perhaps excelled by him in many more. And if we all impartially endeavour to finde a truth, since this endeavour and search only is in our power, that wee shall finde it being <hi>ab extra,</hi> a gift and an assistance extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall, I can see no reason why this pious endeavour to finde out truth shall not be of more force to unite us in the bonds of charity, then his misery in missing it shall be to dis-unite us. So that since a union of perswasion is impossible to be attain'd, if we would attempt the cure by such remedies as are apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle and encrease charity, I am confident wee might see a blessed peace would bee the reward and crown of such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>

the expiration of the first blessed Ages of Christianity, so in love with their own Fancies and Opinions, as to think Faith and all Christendome is concernd in their support and maintenance, and whoever is not so fond and does not dandle them like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it growes up to a quarrell, which because it is in <hi>materiâ theologiae</hi> is made a quarrell in Religion, and God is entitled to it; and then if you are once thought an enemy to God, it is our duty to persecute you even to death, we doe God good service in it; when if we should examine the matter rightly, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is either in <hi>materiâ non revelata,</hi> or <hi>minus evidenti,</hi> or <hi>non necessariâ,</hi> either it is not revealed, or not so clearely, but that wise and honest men may be of different minds, or else it is not of the foundation of faith, but a remote super-structure, or else of meere speculation, or perhaps when all comes to all, it is a false Opinion, or a matter of humane interest, that we have so zealously contended for; for to one of these heads most of the Disputes of Christendome may be reduc'd; so that I believe the present fractions (or the most) are from the same cause which St <hi>Paul</hi> observed in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schisme, <hi>when there are divisions among you, are ye not carnall?</hi> It is not the differing Opinions that is the cause of the present ruptures, but want of charity; it is not the variety of understandings, but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of wills and affections; it is not the severall principles, but the severall ends that cause our miseries: our Opinions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and are upheld according as our turns are serv'd and our interests are preserv'd, and there is no cure for us, but Piety and Charity. A holy life will make our belief holy, if we consult not humanity and its imperfections in the choyce of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but search for truth without designes, save only of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring heaven, and then be as carefull to preserve Charity, as we were to get a point of Faith; I am much perswaded we should finde out more truths by this meanes; or however (which is the maine of all) we shall be secured though we misse them; and then we are well enough.</p>
                  <p>For if it be evinced that one heaven shall hold men of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Opinions, if the unity of Faith be not destroyed by that which men call differing Religions, and if an unity of Charity be the duty of us all even towards persons that are not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

All these mischiefes proceed not from this, that all men are not of one minde, for that is neither necessary nor possible, but that every Opinion is made an Article of Faith, every Article is a ground of a quarrell, every quarrell makes a faction, every faction is zealous, and all zeale pretends for God, and whatsoever is for God cannot be too much; we by this time are come to that passe, we think we love not God except we hate our Brother, and we have not the vertue of Religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we persecute all Religions but our own; for luke-warmnesse is so odious to God and Man, that we proceeding furiously upon these mistakes, by supposing we preserve the body, we destroy the soule of Religion, or by being zealous for faith, or which is all one, for that which we mistake for faith, we are cold in charity, and so loose the reward of both.</p>

                     <p>In these particular instances, there is no variety of Articles, save only that in the annexes of the severall expressions, such <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> things are expressed, as besides that Christ is come, they tell from whence, and to what purpose: And whatsoever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, or is to these purposes implyed, is made articulate and explicate, in the short and admirable mysterious Creed of S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10. 8. <hi>This is the word of faith which we preach, that if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt bee saved:</hi> This is the great and intire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of a Christian's faith, and since salvation is promised to the beliefe of this Creed, either a snare is laid for us, with a purpose to deceive us, or else nothing is of prime and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall necessity to be believed, but this, <hi>Iesus Christ our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> and all that which is the necessary parts, meanes, or maine actions of working this redemption for us, and the honour for him is in the bowels and fold of the great Article, and claims an explicite belief by the same reason that binds us to the belief of its first complexion, without which neither the thing could be acted, nor the proposition understood.</p>
                     <p>For the act of believing propositions, is not for it selfe, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> but in order to certaine ends; as Sermons are to good life and obedience; for (excepting that it acknowledges, Gods ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and so is a direct act of Religion) believing a revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led proposition, hath no excellency in it selfe, but in order to that end for which we are instructed in such revelations. Now Gods great purpose being to bring us to him by Jesus Christ,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41208:34"/>
Christ is our medium to God, obedience is the medium to Christ, and Faith the medium to obedience, and therefore is to have its estimate in proportion to its proper end, and those things are necessary, which necessarily promote the end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which obedience cannot be encouraged or prudently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd: So that those Articles are necessary, that is, those are fundamentall points, upon which we build our obedience; and as the influence of the Article is to the perswasion or engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of obedience, so they have their degrees of necessity. Now all that Christ, when he preach'd, taught us to believe, and all that the Apostles in their Sermons propound, all aime at this, that wee should acknowledge Christ for our Law-Giver and our Saviour; so that nothing can be necessary by a prime necessity to be believ'd explicitely, but such things which are therefore parts of the great Article, because they either encourage our services, or oblige them, such as declare Christs greatnesse in himselfe, or his goodnesse to us: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we must neither deny nor doubt of any thing, which we know our great Master hath taught us: yet salvation is in speciall and by name annexed to the beliefe of those Articles only, which have in them the indearements of our services, or the support of our confidence, or the satisfaction of our hopes, such as are; Jesus Christ the Sonne of the living God, the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Iesus, forgivenesse of sinnes by his blood, Resurrection of the dead, and life eternall, because these propositions qualifie Christ for our Saviour and our Law-Giver, the one to engage our services, the other to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare them; for so much is necessary as will make us to be his servants, and his Disciples; and what can be required more? This only. Salvation is promis'd to the explicite belief of those Articles, and therefore those only are necessary, and those are sufficient; but thus, to us in the formality of Christians, which is a formality super-added to a former capacity, we before we are Christians are reasonable creatures, and capable of a blessed eternity, and there is a Creed which is the Gentiles Creed which is so supposed in the Christian Creed, as it is supposed in a Christian to be a man, and that is, <hi>oportet accedentem ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um credere Deum esse, &amp; esse remuneratorem quaerentium eum.</hi>

If any man will urge farther, that whatsoever is deducible from these Articles by necessary consequence, is necessary to be believed explicitely: I Answer. It is true, if he sees the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and coherence of the parts; but it is not certain that every man shall be able to deduce whatsoever is either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or certainly deducible from these premises; and then since salvation is promis'd to the explicite belief of these, I see not how any man can justifie the making the way to heaven narrower then Jesus Christ hath made it, it being already so narrow, that there are few that finde it.</p>

For, taking out the Article of Christs descent into Hell (which was not in the old Creed, as appeares in some of the Copies I before referd to, in <hi>Tertullian, Ruffinus,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> and indeed was omitted in all the Confessions of the Eastern Churches, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, which by adoption came to be the Creed of the Catholike Church) all other Articles are such as directly constitute the parts and work of our redemption, such as clearly derive the honour to Christ, and enable him with the capacities of our Saviour and Lord. The rest engage our services by proposition of such Articles which are rather promises then propositions; and the whole Creed, take it in any of the old Forms, is but an Analysis of that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals the word of salvation, whereby we shall be saved, <hi>viz.</hi> that we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41208:35"/>
confesse Jesus to be Lord, and that God raised him from the dead: by the first whereof he became our Law-Giver and our Guardian; by the second he was our Saviour: the other things are but parts and maine actions of those two. Now what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there is in the world that can inwrap any thing else within the foundation, that is, in the whole body of Articles simply and inseparably necessary, or in the prime originall necessity of Faith, I cannot possibly imagine. These doe the work, and therefore nothing can upon the true grounds of reason enlarge the necessity to the inclosure of other Articles.</p>
                     <p>Now if more were necessary than the Articles of the Creed, I demand why was it made the <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Isidor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Eccles. offic. lib. 1. cap. 20.

Or if this was intended as sufficient, did the Apostles or those Churches which they founded, know any thing else to be necessary? If they did not, then either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is necessary (I speak of matters of meer beliefe) or they did not know all the will of the Lord, and so were unfit Dispensers of the mysteries of the Kingdom; or if they did know more was necessary, and yet would not insert it, they did an act of publike notice, and consign'd it to all Ages of the Church to no purpose, unlesse to beguile credulous people by making them believe their faith was sufficient, having tryed it by that touch-stone Apostolicall, when there was no such matter.</p>
                     <p>But if this was sufficient to bring men to heaven then, why not now? If the Apostles admitted all to their Communion that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> believed this Creed, why shall wee exclude any that preserve the same intire? why is not our saith of these Articles of as much efficacy for bringing us to heaven, as it was in the Churches Apostolicall? who had guides more infallible that might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out errour have taught them superstructures enough, if they had been necessary: and so they did; But that they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them into the Creed, when they might have done it with as much certainty, as these Articles, makes it clear to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that other things were not necessary, but these were; that whatever profit and advantages might come from other Articles, yet these were sufficient, and however certain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41208:36"/>
persons might accidentally be obliged to believe much more, yet this was the one and onely foundation of Faith upon which all persons were to build their hopes of heaven; this was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore necessary to be taught to all, because of necessity to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by all: So that although other persons might commit a delinquency <hi>in genere morum,</hi> if they did not know or did not believe much more, because they were oblig'd to further disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in order to other ends, yet none of these who held the Creed intire, could perish for want of necessary faith, though possibly he might for supine negligence or affected ignorance, or some other fault which had influence upon his opinions, and his understanding, he having a new supervening obligation <hi>ex accidente</hi> to know and believe more.</p>
                     <p>Neither are we oblig'd to make these Articles more particular and minute then the Creed. For since the Apostles and indeed <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.</note> our blessed Lord himselfe promised heaven to them who believd him to be the Christ that was to come into the world, and that he who believes in him, should be partaker of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and life eternall, he will be as good as his word; yet because this Article was very generall, and a complexion rather then a single proposition; the Apostles and others our Fathers in Christ did make it more explicite, and though they have said no more then what lay entire and ready form'd in the bosome of the great Article, yet they made their extracts, to great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and absolute sufficiency, and therefore there needs no more deductions or remoter consequences from the first great Article, than the Creed of the Apostles. For although whatsoever is certainly deduced from any of these Articles made already so explicite, is as certainly true, and as much to be believed as the Article it selfe, because <hi>ex veris possunt nil nisi vera sequi,</hi> yet because it is not certain that our deductions from them are certain, and what one calls evident, is so obscure to another, that he believes it false; it is the best and only safe course to rest in that explication the Apostles have made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if any of these Apostolicall deductions were not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable evidently to follow from that great Article to which sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is promised, yet the authority of them who compil'd the Symboll, the plaine description of the Articles from the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41208:36"/>
words of Scriptures, the evidence of reason demonstrating these to be the whole foundation, are sufficient upon great grounds of reason to ascertaine us; but if we goe farther, besides the easinesse of being deceived, we relying upon our own discourses, (which though they may be true and then binde us to follow them, but yet no more then when they only seem truest,) yet they cannot make the thing certaine to another, much lesse necessary in it selfe. And since God would not binde us upon paine of sinne and punishment, to make deductions our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much lesse would he binde us to follow another man's Logick as an Article of our Faith; I say much lesse another mans; for our own integrity (for we will certainly be true to our selves, and doe our own businesse heartily) is as fit and proper to be imployed as another mans ability. He cannot secure me that his ability is absolute and the greatest, but I can be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that my own purposes and fidelity to my selfe is such. And since it is necessary to rest somewhere, lest we should run to an infinity, it is best to rest there where the Apostles and the Churches Apostolicall rested; when not only they who are able to judge, but others who are not, are equally ascertained of the certainty and of the sufficiency of that explication.</p>
                     <p>This I say, not that I believe it unlawfull or unsafe for the <note place="margin">

For it is a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that nothing can be necessary to be believed under paine of damnation, but such propositions of which it is certaine that God hath spoken and taught them to us, and of which it is certaine that this is their sense and purpose: For if the sense be uncertain, we can no more be obliged to believe it in a certain sense, then we are to believe it at all, if it were not certaine that God delivered it. But if it be onely certaine that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41208:37"/>
God spake it, and not certaine to what sense, our Faith of it is to be as indeterminate as its sense, and it can be no other in the nature of the thing, nor is it consonant to Gods justice to believe of him that he can or will require more. And this is of the nature of those propositions which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And therfore deductions inevident, from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and plain letter of Faith, are as great recessions from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as they are from the simplicity, and certainty of the Article. And this I also affirm, although the Church of any one denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or represented in a Councell, shall make the deduction or declaration. For unlesse Christ had promised his Spirit to protect every particular Church from all errors lesse materiall, unlesse he had promised an absolute universall infallibility <hi>etiam in minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioribus,</hi> unlesse super-structures be of the same necessity with the foundation, and that Gods Spirit doth not only preserve his Church in the being of a Church, but in a certainty of not say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that is lesse certain; and that whether they will or no too; we may be bound to peace and obedience, to silence, and to charity, but have not a new Article of Faith made; and a new proposition though consequent (as 'tis said) from an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith becomes not therefore a part of the Faith, nor of absolute necessity, <hi>Quid unquam aliud Ecclesia Conciliorum decretis</hi>

For Christ and his Apostles concealed nothing that was necessary to the integrity of Christian Faith, or salvation of our souls; Christ declared all the will of his Father, and the Apostles were Stewards and Dispensers of the same Mysteries, and were faithfull in all the house, and therefore conceald no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but taught the whole Doctrine of Christ; so they said themselves. And indeed if they did not teach all the Doctrine of Faith, an Angel or a man might have taught us other things

then what they taught, without deserving an Anathema, but not without deserving a blessing for making up that Faith intire which the Apostles left imperfect. Now if they taught all the whole body of Faith, either the Church in the following Ages lost part of the Faith (and then where was their infallibility, and the effect of those glorious promises to which she pretends and hath certain Title; for she may as well introduce a falshood as loose a truth, it being as much promised to her that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost shall lead her into all truth, as that she shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from all errors as appears, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13.)

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41208:38"/>
does hurt, I leave it to all wise and good men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. And yet besides this, it cannot enter into my thoughts, that it can possibly consist with Gods goodnesse, to put it into the power of man so palpably and openly to alter the paths and in-lets to heaven, and to streighten his mercies, unlesse he had furnished these men with an infallible judgement and an infallible prudence, and a never failing charity, that they should never doe it but with great necessity, and with great truth, and without ends and humane designes, of which I think no Arguments can make us certaine, what the Primitive Church hath done in this case: I shall afterwards consider and give an account of it, but for the present, there is no insecurity in ending there where the Apostles ended, in building where they built, in resting where they left us, unlesse the same infallibility which they had, had still continued, which I think I shall hereafter make evident it did not: And therefore those extensions of Creed which were made in the first Ages of the Church, although for the matter they were most true; yet because it was not certain that they should be so, and they might have been otherwise, therefore they could not be in the same order of Faith, nor in the same degrees of necessity to be believ'd with the Articles Apostolicall; and therefore whether they did well or no in laying the same weight upon them, or whether they did lay the same weight or no, we will afterwards consider.</p>
                     <p>But to return. I consider that a foundation of Faith cannot alter, unlesse a new building be to be made, the foundation is <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.</note> the same still; and this foundation is no other but that which Christ and his Apostles laid, which Doctrine is like himselfe, yesterday and to day, and the same for ever: So that the Articles of necessary beliefe to all (which are the only foundation) they cannot be severall in severall Ages, and to severall persons. Nay, the sentence &amp; declaration of the Church, cannot lay this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or make any thing of the foundation, because the Church cannot lay her own foundation; we must suppose her to be a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that she relies upon the foundation, which is therefore supposed to be laid before, because she is built upon it, or (to make it more explicate) because a cloud may arise from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory of building and foundation, it is plainly thus; The Church
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41208:38"/>
being a company of men obliged to the duties of Faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the duty and obligation being of the faculties of will and understanding to adhere to such an object, must pre-suppose the object made ready for them; for as the object is before the act in order of nature, and therefore not to be produc'd or encreased by the faculty (which is receptive, cannot be active upon its proper object:) So the object of the Churches Faith is in order of nature before the Church, or before the act and habite of Faith, and therefore cannot be enlarged by the Church, any more then the act of the visive faculty can adde visibility to the object. So that if we have found out what foundation Christ and his Apostles did lay, that is what body and systeme of Articles simply necessary they taught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of us to believe, we need not, we cannot goe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for foundation, we cannot enlarge that systeme or collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now then, although all that they said is true, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it to be doubted or dis-believed, yet as all that they said, is neither written nor delivered (because all was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary) so we know that of those things which are written, some things are as farre off from the foundation as those things which were omitted, and therefore although now accidentally they must be beliv'd by all that know them, yet it is not necessary all should know them; and that all should know them in the same sense and interpretation, is neither probable nor obligatory; but therefore since these things are to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by some differences of necessary and not necessary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no is not the declaration of Christs and his Apostles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing salvation to the beliefe of some great comprehensive Articles, and the act of the Apostles rendring them as expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite as they thought convenient, and consigning that Creed made so explicite, as a tessera of a Christian, as a comprehension of the Articles of his beliefe, as a sufficient disposition and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse of the Faith of a <hi>Catechumen</hi> in order to Baptism: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no I say, all this be not sufficient probation that these only are of absolute necessity, that this is sufficient for meer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in order to heaven, and that therefore whosoever believes these Articles heartily and explicitely, <gap reason="foreign">

And this was an opinion most petinaciously and obstinately maintain'd by the Jewes, and had made a Sect among the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and this was indeed wholy in opinion; and against it the Apostles opposed two Articles of the Creed, which serv'd at severall times according as the Jewes chang'd their opinion, and left some degrees of their error, <hi>I believe in Jesus Christ, and I believe the holy Catholike Church;</hi> For they therefore press'd the necessity of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, because they were unwilling to forgoe the glorious appellative of being Gods own peculiar people; and that salvation was of the Jewes, and that the rest of the world were capable of that grace, no otherwise but by adoption into their Religion, and becomming Proselytes: But this was so ill a doctrine, as that it overthrew the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Christ's comming; for <hi>if they were circumcis'd, Christ profited them nothing,</hi> meaning this, that Christ will not be a Saviour to them who doe not acknowledge him for their Law-Giver; and they neither confesse him their Law-Giver nor

their Saviour, that look to be justified by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and observation of legall rites; so that this doctrine was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect enemy to the foundation, and therefore the Apostles were so zealous against it. Now then that other opinion, which the Apostles met at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to resolve, was but a piece of that opinion; for the Iewes and Proselytes were drawn off from their lees and sediment, by degrees, step by step. At first, they would not endure any should be saved but themselves, and their Profelytes. Being wrought off from this heigth by Miracles, and preaching of the Apostles, they admitted the Gentiles to a possibility of salvation, but yet so as to hope for it by <hi>Moses</hi> Law. From which foolery, when they were with much adoe disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and told that salvation was by Faith in Christ, not by works of the Law, yet they resolv'd to plow with an Oxe and an Asse still, and joyne <hi>Moses</hi> with Christ; not as shadow and substance, but in an equall confederation, Christ should save the Gentiles if he was helpt by <hi>Moses</hi> but alone Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity could not doe it. Against this the Apostles assembled at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and made a decision of the Question, tying some of the Gentiles (such only who were blended by the Iewes <hi>in communi patria)</hi> to observation of such Rites which the Iewes had derived by tradition from <hi>Noah,</hi> intending by this to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Iewes as farre as might be with a reasonable compliance and condescension; the other Gentiles who were unmixt, in the meane while, remaining free as appeares in the liberty <hi>S. Paul</hi> gave the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> of eating Idoll Sacrifices (expresly against the Decree at <hi>Jerusalem)</hi> so it were without scandall. And yet for all this care and curious discretion, a little of the leaven still remain'd: All this they thought did so concern the Gentiles, that it was totally impertinent to the Iewes; still they had a distinction to satisfie the letter of the Apostles Decree, and yet to persist in their old opinion; and this so continued that fifteene Christian Bishops in succession <note place="margin">Euseb. l. 4.

S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s error, and the honesty of his heart caused God so to pardon him as to bring him to the knowledge of Christ, which God therefore did because it was necessary, <hi>necessitate medii;</hi> no salvation was consistent with the actuall remanency of that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; but in the Question of Circumcision, although they by consequence did overthrow the end of Christ's comming: yet because it was such a consequence, which they being hindred by a prejudice not impious did not perceive, God tolerated them in their error till time and a continuall dropping of the lessons and dictates Apostolicall did weare it out, and then the doctrine put on it's apparell, and became cloathed with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessity; they in the meane time so kept to the foundation, that is, Iesus Christ crucified and risen againe, that although this did make a violent concussion of it, yet they held fast with their heart, what they ignorantly destroyed with their tongue, (which <hi>Saul</hi> before his conversion did not) that God upon other Titles, then an actuall dereliction of their error did bring them to salvation.</p>

they of the Circumcision who in so great numbers did heartily believe in Christ, and yet most violently retaine Circumcision, and without Question went to Heaven in great numbers; yet of the number of these very men, they came deeply under censure, when to their errour they added impiety: So long as it stood with charity and without humane ends and secular interests, so long it was either innocent or conniv'd at; but when they grew covetous, and for filthy lucres sake taught the same doctrine which others did in the simplicity of their hearts, then they turn'd Hereticks, then they were term'd Seducers; and <hi>Titus</hi> was commanded to look to them, and to silence them; <hi>For there are many that are intractable and vaine bablers, Seducers of minds, especially they of the Circumcision, who seduce whole houses, teaching things that they ought not, for filthy lucres sake.</hi> These indeed were not to be indur'd, but to be silenced, by the conviction of sound doctrine, and to be rebuked sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and avoided.</p>

It was the heresy of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> that it was no matter how men liv'd, so they did but believe aright: Which wicked doctrine <hi>Tatianus</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christian did so detest, that he fell into a quite contrary, <hi>Non est curandum quid quisque credat, id tantum curandum est quod quisque faciat;</hi> And thence came the Sect <hi>Excratites:</hi> Both these heresies sprang from the too nice distinguishing the faith from the piety and good life of a Christian: They are both but one duty. However, they may be distinguished, if we speak like Philosophers; they cannot be distinguished, when we speak like Christians. For to believe what God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is in order to a good life; and to live well is the product of that believing, and as proper emanation from it, as from its proper principle, and as heat is from the fire. And therefore, in Scripture, they are used promiscuously in sense, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, as not only being subjected in the same person, but also in the same faculty; faith is as truly seated in the will as in the understanding, and a good life as meerly derives from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding as the will. Both of them are matters of choyce and of election, neither of them an effect naturall and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or necessary antecedently <hi>(necessaria ut fiant, non necessario facta.)</hi> And indeed if we remember that S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy amongst the works of the flesh, and ranks it with all manner of practicall impieties, we shall easily perceive that if a man mingles not a vice with his opinion, if he be innocent in his life, though deceiv'd in his doctrine his errour is his misery, not his crime; it makes him an argument of weaknesse and an object of pity, but not a person sealed up to ruine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
                     <p>For as the nature of faith is, so is the nature of heresy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries having the same proportion and commensuration. Now <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> faith, if it be taken for an act of the understanding meerly, is so farre from being that excellent grace that justifies us, that it is not good at all, in any kinde but <hi>in genere naturae,</hi> and makes the understanding better in it selfe, or pleasing to God, just as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41208:42"/>
strength doth the arme, or beauty the face, or health the body; these are naturall perfections indeed, and so knowledge and a true beliefe is to the understanding. But this makes us not at all more acceptable to God; for then the unlearned were certainly in a damnable condition, and all good Scholars should be saved (whereas I am afraid too much of the contrary is true.) But unlesse Faith be made morall by the mixtures of choyce, and charity, it is nothing but a naturall perfection, not a grace or a vertue; and this is demonstrably prov'd in this, that by the confession of all men of all interests and perswasions, in matters of meer belief, invincible ignorance is our excuse if we be deceived, which could not be, but that neither to believe aright is commendable, nor to believe amisse is reprovable; but where both one and the other is voluntary and chosen antecedently or consequently, by prime election or <hi>ex post facto,</hi> and so comes to be consider'd in morality, and is part of a good life or a bad life respectively.

And if any shall say any otherwise, it is to say that some men shall be damned when they cannot help it, perish without their own fault, and be miserable for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their unhappinesse to be deceived through their own simplicity and naturall or accidentall, but inculpable infirmity.</p>
                     <p>For it cannot stand with the goodnesse of God, who does <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> so know our infirmities, that he pardons many things in which our wills indeed have the least share (but some they have) but are overborn with the violence of an impetuous temptation; I say, it is inconsistent with his goodnesse to condemn those who erre where the error hath nothing of the will in it, who therefore cannot repent of their errour, because they believe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41208:43"/>
it true, who therefore cannot make compensation because they know not that they are tyed to dereliction of it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all Hereticks are in this condition, that is, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their errous to be true; yet there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them who believe so out of simplicity, and them who are given over to believe a lie, as a punishment or an effect of some other wickednesse or impiety. For all have a conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant assent to the truth of what they believe; and no man can at the same time believe what he does not believe, but this assent of the understanding in Hereticks is caused not by force of Argument, but the Argument is made forcible by something that is amisse in his will; and although a Heretick may peradventure have a stronger Argument for his errour then some true Believer for his right perswasion; yet it is not considerable how strong his Argument is (because in a weak understanding, a small motive will produce a great perswasion, like gentle physick in a weak body) but that which here is considerable, is, what it is that made his Argument forcible. If his invincible and harmlesse prejudice, if his weaknesse, if his education, if his mistaking piety, if any thing that hath no venome, nor a sting in it, there the heartinesse of his perswasion is no sin, but his misery and his excuse: but if any thing that is evill <hi>in genere morum</hi> did incline his understanding, if his opinion did commence upon pride, or is nourished by covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or continues through stupid carelesnesse, or increases by pertinacy, or is confirmed by obstinacy, then the innocency of the errour is disbanded, his misery is changed into a crime, and begins its own punishment. But by the way I must observe, that when I reckond <hi>obstinacy</hi> amongst those things which make a false opinion criminall, it is to be understood with some discretion and distinction. For there is an obstinacy of will which is indeed highly guilty of misdemeanour, and when the Schoole makes pertinacy or obstinacy to be the formality of heresy, they say not true at all, unlesse it be meant the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy of the will and choyce; and if they doe, they speak imperfectly and inartificially, this being but one of the causes that makes errour become heresy; the adequate and perfect forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of heresy is whatsoever makes the errour voluntary and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41208:43"/>
as is cleare in Scripture, reckoning covetousnesse, and pride, and lust, and whatsoever is vitious to be its causes; (and in habits, or morall changes and productions, whatever alters the essence of a habite, or gives it a new formality, is not to be reckoned the efficient but the forme) but there is also an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy (you may call it) but indeed, is nothing but a resolution and confirmation of understanding, which is not in a mans power honestly to alter, and it is not all the commands of humanity, that can be Argument sufficient to make a man leave believing that for which he thinks he hath reason, and for which he hath such Arguments as heartily convince him. Now the persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in an opinion finally, and against all the confidence and imperiousnesse of humane commands, that makes not this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall obstinacy, if the erring person have so much humility of will as to submit to whatever God sayes, and that no vice in his will hinders him from believing it. So that we must carefully distinguish continuance in opinion from obstinacy, confidence of understanding from peevishnesse of affection, a not being convinced from a resolution never to be convinc'd, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane ends and vitious principles: <hi>Scimus quosdam quod</hi>

                     <p>In this sense, it is that a Heretick is <gap reason="foreign">

As it is in the Canon Law, <hi>Notorius percussor Clerici</hi> is <hi>ipso jure</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, not <hi>per sententiam latam ab homine,</hi> but <hi>à jure.</hi> No man hath passed sentence <hi>pro tribunali,</hi> but Law hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it <hi>pro edicto:</hi> So it is in the case of a Heretick. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding which is judge, condemns him not by an expresse sentence; for he erres with as much simplicity in the result, as he had malice in the principle: But there is <hi>sententia lata à jure,</hi> his will which is his law, that hath condemn'd him. And this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41208:44"/>
is gathered from that saying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>But evill men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived:</hi> First, they are evill men; malice and peevishnesse is in their wills; then they turn Hereticks and seduce others, and while they grow worse and worse, the errour is master of their understanding, they are deceiv'd themselves, <hi>given over to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie,</hi> saith the Apostle: They first play the knave, and then play the foole; they first sell themselves to the purchase of vaine glory or ill ends, and then they become possessed with a lying spirit, and believe those things heartily, which if they were honest, they should with Gods Grace discover and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime. So that now we see that <hi>bona fides in falso articulo,</hi> a hearty perswasion in a false article does not alwayes make the errour to be esteemed involuntary; but then only when it is as innocent in the principle as it is confident in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent perswasion. And such persons who by their ill lives and vitious actions, or manifest designes (for by their fruits yee shall know them) give testimony of such criminall indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so as competent judges by humane and prudent estimate may so judge them, then they are to be declared Hereticks, and avoided. And if this were not true, it were vaine that the Apostle commands us to avoid an Heretick: For no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall act can passe upon a man for a crime that is not cognoscible.</p>
                     <p>Now every man that erres, though in a matter of consequence, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> so long as the foundation is intire, cannot be suspected justly guilty of a crime to give his error a formality of heresy; for we see many a good man miserably deceiv'd (as we shall make it appeare afterwards) and he that is the best amongst men, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely hath so much humility to think he may be easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and twenty to one but he is in some thing or other; yet if his error be not voluntary, and part of an ill life, then because he lives a good life, he is a good man, and therefore no Heretick: No man is a Heretick against his will. And if it be pretended that every man that is deceived, is therefore proud, because he does not submit his understanding to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God or Man respectively, and so his errour becomes a heresy: To this I answer, That there is no Christian man

but will submit his understanding to God, and believes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he hath said; but alwayes provided, he knowes that God hath said so, else he must doe his duty by a readinesse to obey when he shall know it. But for obedience or humility of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding towards men, that is a thing of another considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it must first be made evident that his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be submitted to men; and who those men are, must also be certaine, before it will be adjudg'd a sinne not to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. But if I mistake not Christs saying <hi>[call no man master upon earth</hi>] is so great a prejudice against this pretence, as I doubt it will goe neere wholy to make it invalid. So that as the worshipping of Angels is a humility indeed, but it is voluntary and a will-worship to an ill sence, not to be excused by the excellency of humility, nor the vertue of Religion: so is the relying upon the judgement of man, an humility too, but such as comes not under that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that obedience of Faith which is the duty of every Christian; but intrenches upon that duty which we owe to Christ as an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he is our great Master, and the Prince of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church. But whether it be or be not, if that be the Question whether the disagreeing person be to be determined by the dictates of men, I am sure the dictates of men must not determine him in that Question, but it must be settled by some higher principle: So that if of that Question the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing person does opine, or believe, or erre <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> he is not therefore to be judg'd a Heretick, because he submits not his understanding, because till it bee sufficiently made certaine to him that hee is bound to submit, he may innocently and piously disagree, and this not submitting is therefore not a crime (and so cannot make a heresy) because without a crime he may lawfully doubt whether he be bound to submit or no, for that's the Question. And if in such Questions which have influence upon a whole systeme of Theology, a man may doubt lawfully if he doubts heartily, because the authority of men being the thing in Question, cannot bee the judge of this Question, and therefore being rejected, or (which is all one) being questioned, that is, not believed, cannot render the doubting person guilty of pride, and by consequence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41208:45"/>
not of heresy, much more may particular questions be doubted of, and the authority of men examined, and yet the doubting person be humble enough, and therefore no Heretick for all this pretence. And it would be considered that humility is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in great ones as well as in Idiots. And as inferiours must not disagree without reason, so neither must superiours prescribe to others without sufficient authority, evidence and necessity too: And if rebellion be pride, so is tyranny; and it being <hi>in materiâ intellectuali,</hi> both may be guilty of pride of understanding, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the one in imposing, sometimes the other in a causelesse disagreeing; but in the inferiours it is then only the want of humility, when the guides impose or prescribe what God hath also taught, and then it is the disobeying Gods dictares, not mans, that makes the sinne. But then this consideration will also intervene, that as no dictate of God obliges men to believe it, unlesse I know it to be such: So neither will any of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of my superiours, engage my faith, unlesse I also know, or have no reason to dis believe, but that they are warranted to teach them to me, therefore, because God hath taught the same to them, which if I once know, or have no reason to think the contrary, if I disagree, my sinne is not in resisting humane authority, but divine. And therefore the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of submitting our understanding to humane authority, comes to nothing; for either it resolves into the direct duty of submitting to God, or if it be spoken of abstractedly, it is no duty at all.</p>
                     <p>But this pretence of a necessity of humbling the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is none of the meanest arts whereby some persons have <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.</note> invaded, and usurpt a power over mens faith and consciences, and therefore we shall examine the pretence afterwards, and try if God hath invested any Man or company of Men with such a power. In the meane time, he that submits his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to all that he knowes God hath said, and is ready to submit to all that he hath said if he but know it, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own affections and ends, and interests and humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, laying them all down at the foot of his great Master Jesus Christ, that man hath brought his understanding into subjection, and every proud thought unto the obedience of

Some more there were, but of the same nature and pest, not of a nicety in dispute, not a question of secret Philosophy, not of atomes, and undiscernable propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, but open defiances of all Faith, of all sobriety, and of all sanctity, excepting only the doctrine of the Millenaries, which in the best Ages was esteemed no heresy, but true Catholike Doctrine, though since it hath justice done to it, and hath suffered a just condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto, and in these instances, the Church did esteeme <note place="margin">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41208:46"/>
of Christian sanctity was against Faith, and if it made a Sect, was heresy; if not, it ended in personall impiety and went no farther. But those who as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, not only did such things, but had pleasure in them that doe them, and therefore taught others to do what they impiously did dogmatize, they were Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks both in matter and form, in doctrine and deportment, towards God, and towards man, and judicable in both tribunals.</p>
                     <p>But the Scripture and Apostolicall Sermons, having expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed most high indignation against these masters of impious <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</note> Sects, leaving them under prodigious characters, and horrid representments, as calling them <hi>men of corrupt minds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates concerning the faith, given over to strong delusions to the beliefe of a lye, false Apostles, false Prophets, men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready condemned, and that by themselves, Anti-christs, enemies of God;</hi> and heresy it selfe, <hi>a work of the flesh, excluding from the kingdome of heaven;</hi> left such impressions in the minds of all their successours, and so much zeal against such Sects, that if any opinion commenc'd in the Church, not heard of before; it oftentimes had this ill luck to run the same fortune with an old heresy. For because the Hereticks did bring in new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in matters of great concernment, every opinion <hi>de novo</hi> brought in was lyable to the same exception; and because the degree of malignity in every errour was oftentimes undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and most commonly indemonstrable, their zeale was alike against all; and those Ages being full of piety, were fitted to be abused with an overactive zeale, as wise persons and learned are with a too much indifferency.</p>
                     <p>But it came to passe, that the further the succession went from the Apostles, the more forward men were in numbring <note place="margin">

Some foot-steps of this wee shall finde, if we consider the Sects that are said to have sprung in the first three hundred years, and they were pretty and quick in their springs and falls; fourescore and seven of them are reckoned. They were indeed reckoned afterward, and though when they were alive, they were not condemn'd with as much forwardnesse, as after they were dead; yet even then, confidence began to mingle with opinions lesse necessary, and mistakes in judgement were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41208:46"/>
oftener and more publike then they should have been. But if they were forward in their censures (as some times some of them were) it is no great wonder they were deceiv'd. For what principle or <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> had they then to judge of heresies, or condemn them, besides the single dictates or decretals of private Bishops? for Scripture was indifferently pretended by all; and concerning the meaning of it, was the Question: now there was no generall Councell all that while, no opportunity for the Church to convene; and if we search the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory letters of the Bishops and Martyrs in those dayes, we shall finde but few sentences decretory concerning any Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, or new sprung opinion. And in those that did, for ought appeares, the persons were mis-reported, or their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions mistaken, or at most, the sentence of condemnation was no more but this; Such a Bishop who hath had the good fortune by posterity to be reputed a Catholike, did condemn such a man or such an opinion, and yet himselfe err'd in as considerable matters, but meeting with better neighbours in his life time, and a more charitable posterity, hath his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preserv'd in honour. It appears plain enough in the case of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Deacon of <hi>Antioch,</hi> upon a mistake of his words whereby he taught <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus.</hi> But in the Catalogue of Hereticks made by <hi>Philastrius</hi> he stands markt with a black character as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of many heresies: By which one testimony we may guesse what trust is to be given to those Catalogues: Well, This good man had ill luck to fall into unskilfull hands at first; but <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Justin Maryr, Lactantius,</hi> (to name no more) had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune; for it being still extant in their writings that they were of the Millenary opinion, <hi>Papias</hi> before, and <hi>Nepos</hi> after were censured hardly, and the opinion put into the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of heresies and yet these men never suspected as guilty, but like the children of the Captivity walkt in the midst of the flame, and not so mcuh as the smell of fire passed on them. But the uncertainty of these things is very memorable, in the Story of <hi>Eustathius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> contesting with <hi>Eusebius Pamphilus: Eustathius</hi> accused <hi>Eusebius</hi> for going about to corrupt the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, of which slander he then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himselfe (saith <hi>Socrates)</hi> and yet he is not cleared by <note place="margin">L. 1. c. 23.</note> posterity, for still he is suspected, and his fame not cleare: However <hi>Eusebius</hi> then scap'd well, but to be quit with his Adversary, he recriminares and accuses him to be a favourer of <hi>Sabellius, rather then of the Nicene Canons;</hi> an imperfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, God knowes, when the crime was a suspition, prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only by actions capable of divers constructions, and at the most, made but some degrees of probability, and the fact it selfe did not consist <hi>in indivisibili,</hi> and therefore was to stand or fall, to be improv'd or lessen'd according to the will of the Judges, whom in this cause <hi>Eustathius</hi> by his ill fortune and a potent Adversary found harsh towards him, in so much that he was for heresy deposed in the Synod of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and though this was layd open in the eye of the world as being most ready at hand, with the greatest ease charged upon every man, and with greatest difficulty acquitted by any man; yet there were other suspicions raised upon him privately, or at least talkt of <hi>ex post facto,</hi> and pretended as causes of his deprivation, least the sentence should seem too hard for the first offence. And yet what they were no man could tell, saith the story. But it is observable what <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, as in excuse of such proceedings,

                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        <q>It is the manner among the Bishops, when they accuse them that are deposed, they call them wicked, but they publish not the actions of their impiety.</q> It might possibly be that the Bishops did it in tendernesse of their reputation, but yet hardly; for to punish a person publikely and highly, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain declaring the person punished guilty of a high crime, and then to conceale the fault upon pretence to preserve his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, leaves every man at liberty, to conjecture what he pleaseth, who possibly will believe it worse than it is, in as much as they think his judges so charitable as therefore to conceale the fault, least the publishing of it should be his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test punishment, and the scandall greater then his deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note n="*" place="margin">Simplicitèr pateat vitium fortasse pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, Quod-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur majus creditur esse malum <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</hi>
                        </note> However this course, if it were just in any, was unsafe in all; for it might undoe more then it could preserve, and therefore is of more danger, then it can be of charity. It is therefore too probable that the matter was not very faire; for in publike sentence the acts ought to be publike; but that they rather pretend heresy to bring their ends about, shewes how easie it is to impute that crime, and how forward they were to doe it: And that they might and did then as easily call Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick as afterward, when <hi>Vigilius</hi> was condemned of heresy for saying there were <hi>Antipodes;</hi> or as the Fryars of late did, who suspected Greek and Hebrew of heresy, and cald their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Hereticks, and had like to have put <hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> into the <hi>Index Expurgatorius;</hi> sure enough they raild at them <hi>pro concione,</hi> therefore because they understood them not, and had reason to believe they would accidentally be enemies to their reputation among the people.</p>
                     <p>By this instance which was a while after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, where the acts of the Church were regular, judiciall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.</note> we may guesse at the sentences passed upon heresy, at such times and in such cases, when their processe was more private, and their acts more tumultuary, their information lesse certaine, and therefore their mistakes more easie and frequent. And it is remarkable in the case of the heresy of <hi>Montanus,</hi> the scene of whose heresy lay within the first three hundred yeares,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41208:48"/>
though it was represented in the Caralogues afterwards, and possibly the mistake concerning it, is to be put upon the score of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> by whom <hi>Montanus</hi> and his Followers were put into the Catalogue of Hereticks for commanding abstinence from meats, as if they were unclean, and of themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. Now the truth was, <hi>Montanus</hi> said no such thing, but commanded frequent abstinence, enjoyned dry diet, and an ascetick Table, not for conscience sake, but for Discipline; and yet because he did this with too much rigour and strictnesse of mandate, the Primitive Church mislik'd it in him, as being too neere their errour, who by a Judaicall superstition abstain'd from meats as from uncleannesse. This by the way will much concern them who place too much sanctity in such Rites and Acts of Discipline; for it is an eternall Rule and of never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth, that such abstinences if they be obtruded as Acts of originall immediate duty and sanctity, are unlawfull and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stious; if they be for Discipline they may be good, but of no very great profit; it is that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes profiteth but little; and just in the same degree the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church esteem'd them; for they therefore reprehended <hi>Montanus,</hi> for urging such abstinences with too much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, though but in the way of Discipline, for that it was no more, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who was himselfe a <hi>Montanist,</hi> and knew best the opinions of his own Sect, testifies; and yet <hi>Epiphanus</hi> reporting the errours of <hi>Montanus,</hi> commends that which <hi>Montanus</hi> truly and really taught, and which the Primitive Church condemn'd in him, and therefore represents that heresy to another sense, and affixes that to <hi>Montanus,</hi> which <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> beliv'd a heresy, and yet which <hi>Montanus</hi> did not teach. And this also among many other things lessens my opinion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much of the integrity or discretion of the old Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Hereticks, and much abates my confidence towards them.</p>
                     <p>And now that I have mentioned them casually in passing by, I shall give a short account of them; for men are much <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.</note> mistaken; some in their opinions concerning the truth of them, as believing them to be all true, some concerning their purpose as thinking them sufficient not only to condemn all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41208:48"/>
those opinions, there called hereticall; but to be a precedent to all Ages of the Church to be free and forward in calling He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick. But he that considers the Catalogues themselves, as they are collected by <hi>Epiphanius, Philastrius,</hi> and S. <hi>Austin,</hi> shall finde that many are reckoned for Hereticks for opinions in matters disputable, and undetermin'd, and of no consequence; and that in these Catalogues of Hereticks there are men num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for Hereticks, which by every side respectively are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted; so that there is no company of men in the world that admit these Catalogues as good Records, or sufficient sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of condemnation. For the Churches of the Reformation, I am certain, they acquit <hi>Aërius</hi> for denying prayer for the dead, and the <hi>Eustathians</hi> for denying invocation of Saints. And I am partly of opinion that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not willing to call the <hi>Collyridians</hi> Hereticks for offering a Cake to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> unlesse she also will runne the hazard of the same sentence for offering Candles to her: And that they will be glad with S. <hi>Austin (l.</hi> 6. <hi>de haeres. c.</hi> 86.) to excuse the <note n="*" place="margin">D. <hi>Thom.</hi> l. contr. gent. c. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Tertullianists</hi> for picturing God in a visible corporall representment. And yet these Sects are put in the black book by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>Isidore</hi> respectively. I remember also that the <hi>Osseni</hi> are cald Hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they refused to worship toward the East; and yet in that dissent, I finde not the malignity of a heresy, nor any thing against an Article of Faith or good manners; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in circumstance, it were hard, if they were otherwise pious men and true believers, to send them to Hell for such a trifle. The <hi>Parermeneutae</hi> refused to follow other mens dictates like sheep, but would expound Scripture according to the best evidence themselves could finde, and yet were called Hereticks whether they expounded true or no. The <note n="*" place="margin">Euthym. part. 1. tit. 21.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epiphan. haeres. 64.</note>

(for so many heresies and Hereticks are reckoned by <hi>Prateolus)</hi> may think that if a re-trenchment were justly made of truths, and all impertinencies, and all opinions, either still disputable, or lesse considerable, the number would much decrease; and therefore that the Catalogues are much amisse, and the name Heretick is made a <hi>terriculamentum</hi> to affright people from their beliefe, or to discountenance the persons of men, and disrepute them, that their Schooles may be empty and their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples few.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41208:49"/>
it, as the Western Church could prove their Tradition deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative from S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> If such things as these make up the Catalogues of Hereticks (as we see they did) their accounts differ from the Precedents they ought to have followed, that is, the censures Apostolicall, and therefore are unsafe Precedents for us; and unlesse they took the liberty of using the word heresy, in a lower sense, then the world now doth, since the Councels have been forward in pronouncing Anathema, and took it only for a distinct sense, and a differing perswasion in matters of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and minute Articles, we cannot excuse the persons of the men: But if they intended the crime of heresy against those opinions as they laid them down in their Catalogues, that crime (I say) which is a work of the flesh, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from the Kingdome of Heaven, all that I shall say against them, is, that the causlesse curse shall return empty, and no man is damn'd the sooner, because his enemy cryes <gap reason="foreign">

And of this we are sure they had no warrant from any rule of Scripture or practice Apostolicall, for driving so furiously and hastily in such decretory sentences. But I am willing rather to believe their sense of the word <hi>heresy</hi> was more gentle then with us it is, and for that they might have warrant from Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But by the way, I observe that although these Catalogues are <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</note> a great instance to shew that they whose Age and spirits were farre distant from the Apostles, had also other judgements concerning Faith and heresy, then the Apostles had, and the Ages Apostolicall; yet these Catalogues although they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of heresies in the second and third Ages, are not to be put upon the account of those Ages, nor to be reckoned as an instance of their judgement, which although it was in some degrees more culpable then that of their Predecessors, yet in respect of the following Ages it was innocent and modest. But these Catalogues I speak of, were set down according to the sense of the then presentages, in which as they in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility did differ from the apprehensions of the former Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, so it is certain, there were differing learnings, other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41208:50"/>
sancies, divers representments and judgements of men depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon circumstances which the first Ages knew, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ages did not; and therefore the Catalogues were drawn with some truth, but lesse certainty, as appears in their differing about the Authours of some heresies; severall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons imputed to the same, and some put in the roll of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks by one, which the other left out; which to me is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the Collectors were determin'd, not by the sense and sentences of the three first Ages but by themselves, and some circumstances about them, which to reckon for Hereticks, which not. And that they themselves were the prime Judges, or perhaps some in their own Age together with them; but there was not any sufficient externall judicatory competent to declare heresy that by any publike or sufficient sentence or acts of Court had furnished them with warrant for their Catalogues. And therefore they are no Argument sufficient that the first Ages of the Church, which certainly were the best, did much recede from that which I shewed to be the sense of the Scripture, and the practise of the Apostles; they all contented themselves with the Apostles Creed as the rule of the Faith; and therefore were not forward to judge of heresy, but by analogy to their rule of Faith: And those Catalogues made after these Ages are not sufficient Arguments that they did otherwise; but rather of the weaknesse of some persons, or of the spirit and genius of the Age in which the Compilers liv'd, in which the device of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all differing opinions by the name of heresies, might grow to be a design to serve ends, and to promote interests, as often as an act of zeale and just indignation against evill persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers of the Faith and corrupters of manners.</p>
                     <p>For whatever private mens opinions were, yet till the <hi>Nicene</hi>

And this appears exactly in the Question between S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Stephan</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which one instance it is easie to see what was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and safe for a wise and good man, and yet how others began
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41208:50"/>
even then to be abused by that temptation, which since hath invaded all Christendome. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> re. baptized Hereticks, and thought he was bound so to doe; calls a Synod in <hi>Africk</hi> as being Metropolitan, and confirms his opinion by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of his Suffragans and Brethren, but still with so much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty that if any man was of another opinion, he judg'd him not, but gave him that liberty that he desired himself; <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> growes angry, Excommunicates the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> that in divers Synods had consented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization, and without peace, and without charity condemns them for Hereticks. Indeed here was the rarest mixture and conjunction of unlikelihoods that I have observed. Here was errour of opinion with much modesty and sweetnesse of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on one side; and on the other, an over-active and impetuous zeal to attest a truth, it uses not to be so, for errour usually is supported with confidence, and truth suppressed and discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd by indifferency. But that it might appear that the errour was not the sinne but the uncharitablenesse, <hi>Stephan</hi> was accounted a zealous and furious person, and S. <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. S. Aug. l. 2. c. 6. de baptis. contra Donat.</note> 
                        <hi>Cyprian</hi> though deceiv'd, yet a very good man, and of great sanctity. For although every errour is to be opposed, yet according to the variety of errours, so is there variety of proceedings. If it be against Faith, that is, a destruction of any part of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it is with zeal to be resisted, and we have for it an Apostolicall warrant, <hi>contend earnestly for the Faith;</hi> but then as these things recede farther from the foundation, our cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is the lesse, and their necessity not so much, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were very fit, that our confidence should be according to our evidence, and our zeal according to our confidence, and our confidence should then be the Rule of our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the lightnesse of an Article should be considered with the weight of a precept of charity. And therefore, there are some errours to be reproved, rather by a private friend then a publike censure, and the persons of the men not avoided but admonished, and their Doctrine rejected, not their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; few opinions are of that malignity which are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with the same exterminating spirit, and confidence of aversation, with which the first Teachers of Christianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd

                        <hi>Ebion, Manes,</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus;</hi> and in the condemnation of Hereticks the personall iniquity is more considerable then the obliquity of the doctrine, not for the rejection of the Article, but for censuring the persons; and therefore it is the piety of the man that excused S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which is a certain Argument that it is not the opinion, but the impiety that condemns and makes the Heretick. And this was it which <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Adv. haeres. c. 11.</note> said in this very case of S. <hi>Cyprian, Vnius &amp; ejusdem opinionis (mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum videri potest) judicamus authores Catholicos, &amp; sequaces haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticos. Excusamus Magistros, &amp; condemnamus Scholasticos. Qui scripserunt libros sunt haeredes Coeli, quorum librorum defensores detruduntur ad infernum.</hi> Which saying, if we confront against the saying of <hi>Salvian</hi> condemning the first Authors of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Sect, and acquitting the Followers, we are taught by these two wise men, that an errour is not it that sends a man to Hell, but he that begins the heresy, and is the authour of the Sect, he is the man mark'd out to ruine; and his Followers scap'd, when the <hi>Here siarch</hi> commenc'd the errour upon pride and ambition, and his Followers went after him in simplicity of their heart; and so it was most commonly: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when the first man in the opinion was honestly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly deceived, as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, and that his Scholars to maintaine their credit, or their ends, maintaind the opinion, not for the excellency of the reason perswading, but for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and accruments, or peevishnesse, as did the <hi>Donatisis, qui de Cypriani authoritate fibi carnaliter blandiuntur,</hi> as S. <hi>Austin</hi> said of them; then the Scholars are the Hereticks, and the Master is a Catholike. For his errour is not the heresy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, and an erring person may be a Catholike. A wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his errour becomes heretick, when the good man in the same errour shall have all the rewards of Faith. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an ill man believes, if he therefore believe it because it serves his own ends, be his belief true or false, the man hath an hereticall minde, for to serve his own ends, his minde is prepared to believe a lie. But a good man that believes what according to his light, and upon the use of his morall industry he thinks true, whether he hits upon the right or no, because he hath a minde desirous of truth, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41208:51"/>
prepared to believe every truth is therefore acceptable to God, because nothing hindred him from it, but what hee could not help, his misery and his weaknesse, which being imperfections meerly naturall, which God never punishes, he stands faire for a blessing of his morality, which God alwayes accepts. So that now if <hi>Stephen</hi> had followed the example of God Almighty, or retained but the same peaceable spirit which his Brother of <hi>Cathage</hi> did, he might with more advantage to truth, and reputation both of wisdome and piety have done his duty in attesting what he believ'd to be true; for we are as much bound to be zealous pursuers of peace as earnest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders for the Faith I am sure more earnest we ought to be for the peace of the Church, then for an Article which is not of the Faith, as this Question of re-baptization was not; for S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> died in beliefe against it, and yet was a Catholike, and a Martyr for the Christian Faith.</p>
                     <p>The summe is this S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did right in a wrong cause (as <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.</note> it hath been since judged) and <hi>Stephen</hi> did ill in a good cause; as fame then as piety and charity is to be preferr'd before a true opinion, so farre is S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s practise a better precedent for us, and an example of primitive sanctity, then the zeale and indiscretion of <hi>Stephen:</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had not learn'd to forbid to any one a liberty of prophesying or interpretation, if hee transgressed not the foundation of Faith and the Creed of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>Well thus it was, and thus it ought to be in the first Ages, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.</note> the Faith of Christendome rested still upon the same foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the judgements of heresies were accordingly, or were amisie; but the first great violation of this truth was, when Generall Councels came in, and the Symbols were enlarged, and new Articles were made as much of necessity to be believed as the Creed of the Apostles, and damnation threatned to them that did diffent, and at last the Creeds multiplyed in number, and in Articles, and the liberty of prophesying began to be something restrained.</p>
                     <p>And this was of so much the more force and efficacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.</note> it began upon great reason, and in the first instance, with successe good enough. For I am much pleased with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41208:52"/>
of the Creed, which the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they enlarged it to my sense; but I am not sure that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are satisfied with it; While we look upon the Article they did determine, we see all things well enough; but there are some wise personages consider it in all circumstances, and think the Church had been more happy if she had not been in some sense constrain'd to alter the simplicity of her faith, and make it more curious and articulate, so much that he had need be a subtle man to understand the very words of the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.</p>

                        <hi>Arius</hi> (who was a Sophister too subtle as it afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd) misunderstood him, and thought he intended to bring in the heresy of <hi>Sabellius.</hi> For while he taught the Unity of the Trinity either he did it so inartificially, or so intricately, that <hi>Arius</hi> thought he did not distinguish the persons, when the Bishop intended only the unity of nature. Against this <hi>Arius</hi> furiously drives, and to confute <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and in him (as he thought) the Bishop, distinguishes the natures too, and so to secure the Article of the Trinity, destroyes the Unity. It was the first time the Question was disputed in the world, and in such mysterious niceties, possibly every wise man may understand something, but few can understand all, and therefore suspect what they understand not, and are furiously zealous for that part of it which they doe perceive. Well, it hapned in these as alwayes in such cases, in things men understand not they are most impetuous; and because suspition is a thing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in degrees, for it hath nothing to determine it, a suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person is ever most violent; for his feares are worse then the thing feared, because the thing is limited, but his feares are not; so that upon this grew contentions on both sides, and <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 6.</note> tumults, rayling and reviling each other; and then the Laity were drawn into parts, and the <hi>Meletians</hi> abetted the wrong part, and the right part fearing to be overborn, did any thing that was next at hand to secure it selfe. Now then they that lived in that Age, that understood the men, that saw how quiet
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41208:52"/>
the Church was before this stirre, how miserably rent now, what little benefit from the Question, what schisme about it, gave other censures of the businesse, then we since have done, who only look upon the Article determind with truth and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Church generally, since that time. But the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arius,</hi> tells the truth, and <note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> chides them both for commencing the Question, <hi>Alexander</hi> for broaching it, <hi>Arius</hi> for taking it up; and although this be true, that it had been better for the Church it never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, yet being begun, what is to be done in it? of this also in that admirable Epistle, we have the Emperours judgement (I suppose not without the advise and privity of <hi>Hosius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corduba,</hi> whom the Emperour lov'd and trusted much, and imployed in the delivery of the Letters.) <q>For first he calls it a certain vain piece of a Question, ill begun and more unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly published, a Question which no Law or Ecclesiasticall Canon defineth, a fruitlesse contention, the product of idle braines, a matter so nice, so obscure, so intricate that it was neither to be explicated by the Clergy, nor understood by the people, a dispute of words, a doctrine inexpliable, but most dangerous when taught least it introduce discord or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; and therefore, the Objector was rash, and the answerer unadvised; for it concernd not the substance of Faith, or the worship of God, nor any cheife commandment of Scripture, and therefore, why should it be the matter of discord? For though the matter be grave; yet because neither necessary, nor explicable, the contention is trifling and toyish. And therefore, as the Philosophers of the same Sect, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in explication of an opinion, yet more love for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Profession, then disagree for the difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; So should Christians believing in the same God, retaining the same Faith, having the same hopes, opposed by the same enemies, not fall at variance upon such disputes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering our understandings are not all alike; and therefore, neither can our opinions in such mysterious Articles: so that the matter being of no great importance, but vaine, and a toy in respect of the excellent blessings of peace and charity, it were good that <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arius</hi> should leave contending,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41208:53"/>
keep their opinions to themselves, ask each other forgivenesse, and give mutuall toleration.</q> This is the substance of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s letter, and it contains in it much reason, if he did not undervalue the Question; but it seems it was not then thought a Question of Faith but of nicety of dispute; they both did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one God, and the holy Trinity. Now then that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward called the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, it was upon occasion of the vilenesse of the men of the <hi>Arian</hi> part, their eternall discord and pertinacious wrangling, and to bring peace into the Church; that was the necessity; and in order to it was the determination of the Article. But for the Article it selfe, the Letter declares what opinion he had of that, and this Letter was by <hi>Socrates</hi> called <hi>a wonderfull exhortation, full of grace and sober councels;</hi> and such as <hi>Hosius</hi> himself, who was the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, pressed with all earnestnesse, with all the skill and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he had.</p>
                     <p>I know the opinion the world had of the Article afterward is quite differing from this censure given of it before; and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.</note> therefore they have put it into the Creed (I suppose) to bring the world to unity, and to prevent Sedition in this Question, and the accidentall blasphemies, which were occasioned by their curious talkings of such secret mysteries, and by their illiterate resolutions. But although the Article was determin'd with an excellent spirit, and we all with much reason professe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; yet it is another consideration, whether or no it might not have been better determin'd, if with more simplicity; and another yet, whether or no since many of the Bishops who did believe this thing, yet did not like the nicety and curiosity of expressing it, it had not been more agreeable to the practise of the Apostles to have made a determination of the Article by way of Exposition of the Apostles Creed, and to have left this in a rescript, for record to all posterity, and not to have enlarged the Creed with it; for since it was an Explication of an Article of the Creed of the Apostles, as Sermons are of places of Scripture, it was thought by some, that Scripture might with good profit, and great truth be expounded, and yet the expositions not put into the Canon, or goe for Scripture, but that left still in the naked Originall simplicity, and so much the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41208:53"/>
rather since that Explication was further from the foundation, and though most certainly true, yet not penn'd by so infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a spirit, as was that of the Apostles; and therefore not with so much evidence, as certainty. And if they had pleased, they might have made use of an admirable precedent to this and many other great and good purposes, no lesse then of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostles, whose Symbol they might have imitated, with as much simplicity as they did the Expressions of Scripture, when they first composed it. For it is most considerable, that although in reason, every clause in the Creed should be clear, and so inopportune and unapt to variety of interpretation, that there might be no place left for severall senses or variety of Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet when they thought fit to insert some mysteries into the Creed, which in Scripture were expressed in so mysterious words, that the last and most explicite sense would still be latent, yet they who (if ever any did) understood all the senses and secrets of it, thought it not fit to use any words but the words of Scripture, particularly in the Articles of [Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending into Hell, and sitting at the right hand of God] to shew us, that those Creeds are best which keep the very words of Scripture; and that Faith is best which hath greatest simplicity, and that it is better in all cases humbly to submit; then curiously to enquire and pry into the mystery under the cloud, and to hazard our Faith by improving our knowledge: If the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers had done so too, possibly the Church would never have repented it.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the experience, the Church had afterwards, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.</note> shewed that the Bishops and Priests were not satisfied in all circumstances, nor the schism appeased, nor the persons agreed, nor the Canons accepted, nor the Article understood, nor any thing right, but when they were overborn with Authority, which Authority when the scales turned, did the same service and promotion to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But it is considerable, that it was not the Article or the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.</note> thing it selfe that troubled the disagreeing persons, but the manner of representing it. For the five Dissenters, <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia, Theognis, Maris, Theonas,</hi> and <hi>Secundus,</hi> believed Christ to be very God of very God, but the clause of <gap reason="foreign">

they derided as being perswaded by their Logick, that he was neither of the substance of the Father, by division as a piece of a lump nor derivation as children from their Parents, nor by production as buds from trees, and no body could tell them any other way at that time, and that made the fire to burn still. And that was it I said; if the Article had been with more simplicity, and lesse nicety determin'd; charity would have gain'd more, and faith would have lost nothing. And we shall finde the wisest of them all, for so <hi>Eusebius Pamphilus</hi> was esteem'd, published a Creed or Confession in the Synod, and though he and all the rest believed that great mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesle, <note place="margin">Vide Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. lib. 2. c. 18.</note>

But without all Question, the Fathers determin'd the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.</note> with much truth, though I cannot say, the Arguments upon which they built their Decrees, were so good as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion it selfe was certain; But that which in this case is considerable, is whether or no they did well in putting a curse to the foot of their Decree, and the Decree it selfe into the Symbol, as if it had been of the same necessity? For the curse, <hi>Eusebius Pamphilus</hi> could hardly finde in his heart to subscribe, at last he did; but with this clause that he subscribed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the forme of curse did only <hi>forbid men to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with forraign speeches and unwritten languages,</hi> whereby confusion and discord is brought into the Church. So that it was not so much a magisteriall high assertion of the Article, as an endeavour to secure the peace of the Church. And to the same purpose for ought I know, the Fathers composed a Form of Confession, not as a prescript Rule of Faith to build the hopes of our salvation on but as a <hi>tessera</hi> of that Communion which by publike Authority was therefore established upon those Articles because the Articles were true, though not of prime necessity, and because that unity of confession was judg'd, as things then stood, the best preserver of the unity of minds.</p>
                     <p>But I shall observe this, that although the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.</note> in that case at that time, and in that conjuncture of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances did well (and yet their approbation is made by after Ages <hi>ex post facto)</hi> yet if this precedent had been followed by all Councels (and certainly they had equall power, if they had thought it equally reasonable) and that they had put all their Decrees into the Creed, as some have done since, to what a volume had the Creed by this time swell'd? and all the house had run into foundation, nothing left for super-structures. But that they did not, it appeares <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that since they thought all their Decrees true, yet they did not think them all necessary, at least not in that degree, and that they published such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, they did it <hi>declarando,</hi> not <hi>imperando,</hi> as Doctors in their Chaires, not masters of other mens faith and consciences. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And yet there is some more modesty, or warinesse or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity (what shall I call it?) then this comes too: for why are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41208:55"/>
not all controversies determin'd? but even when Generall Assemblies of Prelates have been, some controversies that have been very vexatious, have been pretermitted, and others of lesse consequence have been determind: Why did never any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell condemn in expresse sentence the <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresy, that great pest, that subtle infection of Cristendome? and yet divers Generall Councells did assemble while the heresy was in the world. Both these cases in severall degrees leave men in their liberty of believing and prophesying. The latter proclaimes that all controversies cannot be determind to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient purposes, and the first declares that those that are, are not all of them matters of Faith, and themselves are not so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but they may bee deceived; and therefore possibly it were better it were let alone; for if the latter leaves them divided in their opinions, yet their Communions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore probably their charities are not divided; but the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides their Communions, and hinders their interest; and yet for ought is certain, the accused person is the better Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. And yet after all this, it is not safety enough to say, let the Councell or Prelates determine Articles warily, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with great caution, and with much sweetnesse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty. For though this be better then to doe it rashly, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and furiously; yet if we once transgresse the bounds set us by the Apostles in their Creed, and not onely preach other truths, but determine them <hi>pro tribunali</hi> as well as <hi>pro cathedra,</hi> although there be no errour in the subject matter (as in <hi>Nice</hi> there was none) yet if the next Ages say they will determine another Article with as much care and caution, and pretend as great a necessity, there is no hindring them, but by giving reasons against it; and so like enough they might have done against the decreeing the Article at <hi>Nice;</hi> yet that is not sufficient; for since the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell hath grown to the heigth of a mountainous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice against him that should say it was ill done, the same reason and the same necessity may be pretended by any Age and in any Councell, and they think themselves warranted by the great precedent at <hi>Nice,</hi> to proceed as peremptorily as they did; but then if any other Assembly of learned men may
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41208:55"/>
possibly be deceiv'd, were it not better they should spare the labour, then that they should with so great pomp and solen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities engage mens perswasions, and determine an Article which after Ages must rescind; for therefore most certainly in their own Age, the point with safety of faith and salvation, might have been disputed and disbelieved: And that many mens faiths have been tyed up by Acts and Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels for those Articles in which the next Age did see a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had better beene preserved, because an errour was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, wee shall afterward receive a more certaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> did well, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> did well, so did <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> but it is <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.</note> because the Articles were truly determin'd (for that is part of my beliefe;) but who is sure it should be so before hand, and whether the points there determin'd were necessary or no to be believ'd or to be determin'd, if peace had been concern'd in it through the faction and division of the parties, I suppose the judgement of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour and the famous <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> of <hi>Corduba</hi> is sufficient to instruct us, whose authority I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urge then reasons, because it is a prejudice and not a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I am to contend against.</p>
                     <p>So that such determinations and publishing of Confessions with Authority of Prince and Bishop, are sometimes of very <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.</note> good use for the peace of the Church, and they are good also to determine the judgement of indifferent persons, whose rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of either side, are not too great to weigh down the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of that Authority: But for persons of confident and imperious understandings, they on whose side the determination is, are armed with a prejudice against the other, and with a weapon to affront them, but with no more to convince them; and they against whom the decision is, doe the more readily betake themselves to the defensive, and are engaged upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation and publike enmities, for such Articles which either might safely have been unknown, or with much charity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed. Therefore the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, although it have the advantage of an acquir'd and prescribing Authority, yet it must not become a precedent to others, least the inconveniences of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41208:56"/>
multiplying more Articles upon as great pretence of reason as then, make the act of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers in straightning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying, and enlarging the Creed, become accidentally an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. The first restraint, although if it had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind of, might possibly have been better consider'd of; yet the inconvenience is not visible, till it comes by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to usher in more. It is like an Arbitrary power, which although by the same reason it take six pence from the subject, it may take a hundred pound, and then a thousand, and then all, yet so long as it is within the first bounds, the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience is not so great; but when it comes to be a precedent or argument for more, then the first may justly be complaind of, as having in it that reason in the principle, which brought the inconvenience in the sequell; and we have seen very ill consequents from innocent beginnings.</p>

curious in their disputings, nor dogmaticall in their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations about that Question; and because the Church was not used to dispute in that Question, it were better to preserve the simplicity of Faith, then to ensnare mens consciences by a new Article. And when the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> was by his Faction engaged in a contrary practise, the inconvenience and unreasonablenesse was so great, that a prudent Heathen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and noted it in this character of <hi>Constantius, Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam religionem absolutam &amp; simplicem</hi> [N.

                        <hi>Athanasius</hi> (for we see the <hi>Nicene</hi> Symbol was the Father of many more, some twelve or thirteen Symbols in the space of a hundred years) I confesse I cannot see that moderate sentence and gentlenesse of charity in his Preface and Conclusion as there was in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. Nothing there but damnation

and perishing everlastingly, unlesse the Article of the Trinity be believed, as it is there with curiosity and minute particularities explaind. Indeed <hi>Athanasius</hi> had been soundly vexed on one side, and much cryed up on the other; and therefore it is not so much wonder for him to be so decretory and severe in his censure; for nothing could more ascertain his friends to him, and dis-repute his enemies, then the beliefe of that damnatory Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix; but that does not justifie the thing. For the Articles themselves, I am most heartily perswaded of the truth of them, and yet I dare not say all that are not so, are irrevocably damnd, because <hi>citra hoc Symbolum,</hi> the Faith of the Apostles Creed is intire, and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, that is, he that believeth such a beliefe as is sufficient dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be baptized, that Faith with the Sacrament is sufficient for heaven.

an opinion that is in it selfe damnable, and yet he not knowing it so, and being invincibly lead into it may goe to heaven; his opinion shall burn, and himselfe be saved.

But because there are no degrees either of truth or salshood, every true proposition being alike true; that an errour is more or lesse damnable, is not told us in Scripture, but is determind by the man and his manners, by circumstance and accidents; and therefore the censure in the Preface and end, are Arguments of his zeal and strength of his perswasion; but they are extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and accidentall to the Articles, and might as well have been spared. And indeed to me it seems very hard to put uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse into the Creed, and so to make it become as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, though perhaps this very thing was no Faith of <hi>Athanasius</hi> who if we may believe <hi>Aquinas,</hi> made this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of Faitth, <hi>non per modum Symboli, sed per modum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinae,</hi>

And since our blessed Saviour promised salvation to him that <hi>believeth</hi> (and the Apostles when they gave this word the greatest extent, enlarged it not beyond the borders of the Creed) how can any man warrant the condemning of any man to the flames of Hell that is ready to die in attestation of this Faith, so expounded and made explicite by the Apostles, and lives accordingly? And to this purpose it was excellently said by a wise and a pious Prelate, S. <hi>Hilary, Non per difficiles nos</hi>

                     <p>And that there was security enough, in the simple believing <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 40.</note> the first Articles, is very certain amongst them, and by their Principles who allow of an implicite faith to serve most persons to the greatest purposes; for if the Creed did contain in it the whole Faith, and that other Articles were in it implicitely,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41208:59"/>
(for such is the doctrine of the Schoole, and particularly of <hi>Aquinas)</hi> then he that explicirely believes all the Creed, does implicitely believe all the Articles contain'd in it, and then it <note place="margin">22<hi rend="sup">ae</hi>. q. 1. a. 10. cap.</note> is better the implication should still continue, then that by any explication (which is simply unnecessary) the Church should be troubled with questions, and uncertain determinations, and factions enkindled, and animosities set on foot, and mens soules endanger'd, who before were secur'd by the explicite beliefe of all that the Apostles requir'd as necessary, which beliefe also did secure them for all the rest, because it implied the belief of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was virtually in the first Articles, if such beliefe should by chance be necessary.</p>
                     <p>The summe of this discourse is this, if we take an estimate of the nature of Faith from the dictates and promises Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 41.</note> and from the practice Apostolicall, the nature of Faith and its integrity consists in such propositions which make the foundation of hope and charity, that which is sufficient to make us to doe honour to Christ, and to obey him, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us in both; and this is compleated in the Apostles Creed. And since contraries are of the same extent, heresy is to be judg'd by its proportion and analogy to faith, and that is heresy only which is against Faith. Now because Faith is not only a precept of Doctrines, but of manners and holy life, whatsoever is either opposite to an Article of Creed, or teaches ill life, that's heresy; but all those propositions which are extrinsecall to these two considerations, be they true or be they false, make not heresy, nor the man an Heretick; and therefore however hee may be an erring person, yet he is to be used accordingly, pittied and instructed, not condemned or Excommunicated; And this is the result of the first ground, the consideration of the nature of Faith and heresy.</p>

                     <p>But besides these things which are so plainly set down, some for doctrine as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, that is, for Articles and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, some for instruction, some for reproofe, some for comfort, that is, in matters practicall and speculative of severall tempers and constitutions, there are innumerable places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in them great mysteries, but yet either so enwrapped with a cloud, or so darkned with umbrages, or heigthened with expressions, or so covered with allegories and garments of

Rhetorick so profound in the matter, or so altered or made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate in the manner in the clothing and in the dressing that God may seeme to have left them as tryalls of our industry, and Arguments of our imperfections, and incentives to the longings after heaven, and the clearest revelations of eternity, and as occasions and opportunities of our mutuall charity and toleration to each other, and humility in our selves, rather then the repositories of Faith, and furniture of Creeds, and Articles of beliefe.</p>
                     <p>For wherever the word of God is kept, whether in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> alone, or also in Tradition, he that considers that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the one, and the truth or certainty of the other are things of great Question, will see a necessity in these things (which are the subject matter of most of the Questions of Christendome) that men should hope to be excused by an implicite faith in God Almighty. For when there are in the Explications of Scripture so many Commentaries, so many senses and Interpretations, so many Volumnes in all Ages, and all, like mens faces, exactly none like another, either this difference and inconvenience is absolutely no fault at all, or if it be, it is excusable, by a minde prepar'd to consent in that truth which God intended. And this I call an implicite Faith in God, which is certainly of as great excellency as an implicite Faith in any man or company of men. Because they who doe require an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Faith in the Church for Articles lesse necessary, and excuse the want of explicite Faith by the implicite, doe require an implicite Faith in the Church, because they believe that God hath required of them to have a minde prepared to believe whatever the Church sayes; which because it is a proposition of no absolute certainty, whosoever does in readinesse of minde believe all that God spake, does also believe that sufficiently, if it be fitting to be believ'd, that is, if it be true, and if God hath said so; for he hath the same obedience of understanding in this as in the other. But because it is not so certain God hath tyed him in all things to believe that which is called the Church, and that it is certain we must believe God in all things, and yet neither know all that either God hath revealed or the Church taught, it is better to take the certain then the uncertain, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41208:60"/>
believe God rather then men, especially since if God hath bound us to believe men, our absolute submission to God does involve that, and there is no inconvenience in the world this way, but that we implicitely believe one Article more, <hi>viz.</hi> the Churches Authority or infallibility, which may well be pardoned, because it secures our beliefe of all the rest, and we are sure if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that God said explicitely or implicitely, we also believe the Church implicitely in case we are bound to it; but we are not certain, that if we believe any company of men whom we call the Church, that we therefore obey God and believe what he hath said. But however, if this will not help us, there is no help for us, but good fortune or absolute predestination; for by choyce and industry, no man can secure himselfe that in all the mysteries of Religion taught in Scripture he shall certainly understand and explicitely believe that sense, that God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For to this purpose there are many considerations.</p>

In the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament the Jewes pretend that the Christians have corrupted many places, on purpose to make symphony between both the Testaments. On the other side, the Christians have had so much reason to suspect the Jewes, that when <hi>Aquila</hi> had translated the Bible in their Schooles, and had been taught by them, they rejected the Edition many of them, and some of them called it heresy to follow it. And <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> justified it to <hi>Tryphon,</hi> that the Jewes had defalk'd many sayings from the Books of the old Prophets, and amongst the rest, he instances in that of the Psalm, <hi>Dicite in nationibus quia Dominus regnavit à ligno.</hi> The last words they have cut off, and prevail'd so farre in it, that to this day none of our Bibles have it; but if they ought not to have it, then <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi> Bible had more in it then it should have, for there it was; so that a fault there was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under or over. But however, there are infinite Readings in the New Testament (for in that I will instance) some whole Verses in one that are not in another, and there was in some

Copies of S. <hi>Marks</hi> Gospel in the last Chapter a whole verse, a Chapter it was anciently called, that is not found in our Bibles, as S. <hi>Hierom. ad Hedibiam,</hi> q. 3. notes.

Now suppose that a <hi>Manichee</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation should urge this place, having found it in his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if a Catholike should answer him by saying it is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall, and not found in divers Greek Copies, might not the <hi>Manichee</hi> ask how it came in, if it was not the word of God, and if it was, how came it out? and at last take the same liberty of rejecting any other Authority which shall be alledged against him; it he can finde any Copy that may favour him, however that favour be procured; and did not the <hi>Ebionites</hi> reject all the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> upon pretence he was an enemy to the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> indeed it was boldly and most unreasonably done; but if one title or one Chapter of S. <hi>Mark</hi> be called Apocryphall, for being suspected of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheisme,</hi> it is a plea that will too much justify others in their taking and chusing what they list. But I will not urge it so farre; but is not there as much reason for the fierce <hi>Lutherans</hi> to reject the Epistle of S. <hi>James</hi> for favouring justification by works, or the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> upon pretence that the sixth and tenth Chapters doe favour <hi>Novatianisme;</hi> especially since it was by some famous Churches at first not accepted, even by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her selfe? The Parable of the woman taken in adultery, which is now in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>Eusebius</hi> sayes was not in any Gospel, but the Gospel <hi>secundum Hebraeos,</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom</hi> makes it doubtfull, and so does S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Euthimius,</hi> the first not vouchsafing to explicate it in Homilies upon S. <hi>John,</hi> the other affirming it not to be found in the exacter Copies.

Indeed there is so much evidence of this particular, that it hath encouraged the servants of the Vulgar Translation (for so some are now adayes) to preferre that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation before the Originall; for although they have attempted that proposition with very ill successe yet that they could think it possible to be prov'd, is an Argument there is much variety and alterations in divers Texts; for if they were not, it were impudence to pretend a Translation, and that none of the best, should be better then the Originall. But so it is that this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of reading is not of slight consideration; for although it be demonstrably true, that all things necessary to Faith and good manners are preserv'd from alteration and corruption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are of things necessary, and they could not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, unlesse they were delivered to us, God in his goodnesse and his justice having oblig'd himself to preserve that which he hath bound us to observe and keep; yet in other things which God hath not oblig'd himselfe so punctually to preserve, in these things since variety of reading is crept in, every reading takes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41208:62"/>
away a degree of certainty from any proposition derivative from those places so read: And if some Copies (especially if they be publike and notable) omit a verse or title, every argument from such a title or verse loses much of its strength and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and we finde it in a great instance. For when in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the mystery of the glorious Unity in Trinity, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that saying of S. <hi>John [there are three which bear witnesse in heaven, the Father, the Word and the Spirit, and these three are one:]</hi> the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> think they have answered the Argument by saying the <hi>Syrian</hi> Translation, and divers Greek Copies have not that verse in them, and therefore being of doubtfull Authority, cannot conclude with certainty in a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of Faith. And there is an instance on the Catholike part. For when the <hi>Arrians</hi> urge the saying of our Saviour, <hi>[No man knowes that day and houre</hi> (viz. of Judgement) <hi>no not the Sonne, but the Father only</hi>], to prove that the Sonne knowes not all things, and therefore cannot be God in the proper sense; S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> thinks he hath answered the Argument by saying, those words <hi>[no not the Sonne</hi>] was thrust into the Text by the fraud of the <hi>Arrians.</hi> So that here we have one objection, which must first be cleared and made infallible, before we can be ascertain'd in any such Question as to call them Hereticks that dissent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I consider that there are very many senses and designs of <note place="margin">

For put case a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were commenc'd concerning the degrees of glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as there is in the Schooles a noted one, To shew an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of reward, Christs Parable is brought of the reward of ten Cities, and of five according to the divers improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Talents; this sense is mysticall, and yet very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and understood by men for ought I know, to this very sense. And the result of the Argument is made good by S. <hi>Paul, as one starre differeth from another in glory;</hi> so shall it be in the resurrection of the dead. Now suppose another should take the same liberty of Expounding another Parable to a mysticall sense and Interpretation, as all Parables must be expounded; then the Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard, and though differing in labour, yet having an equall reward, to any mans understanding may seem very strongly to prove the contrary, and as if it were of purpose, and that it were <hi>primum intentum</hi> of the Parable, the Lord of the Vineyard determin'd the point resolutely upon the mutiny and repining of them that had born the burthen and heat of the day, <hi>I will give unto this last even as to thee;</hi> which to my sense seems to determine the Question of degrees; They that work but little, and they that work long, shall not be distinguished in the reward, though acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally they were in the work: And if this opinion could but answer S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, it stands as faire, and perhaps fairer then the other. Now if we look well upon the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> we shall finde he speaks nothing at all of diversity of degrees of glory in beatified bodies, but the differences of glory in bodies heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earthly. <hi>There are</hi> (sayes he) <hi>bodies earthly, and there are heavenly bodies: And one is the glory of the earthly, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the glory of the heavenly; one glory of the Sun, another of the Moone, &amp;c. So shall it be in the Resurrection; for it is</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41208:63"/>
                        <hi>sowne in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</hi> Plainly thus, our bodies in the Resurrection shall differ as much from our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies here in the state of corruption, as one Starre does from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And now suppose a Sect should be commenc'd upon this Question (upon lighter and vainer many have been) either side must resolve to answer the others Arguments, whether they can or no, and to deny to each other a liberty of expounding the parable to such a sense, and yet themselves must use it or want an Argument. But men use to be unjust in their own cases; And were it not better to leave each other to their liberty and seek to preserve their own charity? For when the words are capable of a mysticall or a divers sense, I know not why mens fancies or understandings should be more bound to be like one another then their faces: And either in all such places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a liberty must be indulg'd to every honest and peaceable wise man, or else all Argument from such places must be wholy declin'd. Now although I instanc'd in a Question, which by good fortune never came to open defiance, yet there have been Sects fram'd upon lighter grounds, more inconsiderable Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, which have been disputed on either side with Arguments lesse materiall and lesse pertinent. S. <hi>Austin</hi> laught at the <hi>Donatists,</hi> for bringing that saying of the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> to prove their Schism, <hi>Indica mihi ubi pascas, ubi cubes in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridie.</hi> For from thence they concluded the residence of the Church was only in the South part of the world, only in <hi>Africa.</hi> It was but a weak way of Argument; yet the Fathers were free enough to use such mediums, to prove mysteries of great <note place="margin">Hieron. in Matth. 13.</note> concernment; but yet againe, when they speak either against an Adversary, or with consideration, they deny that such my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall senses can sufficiently confirm a Question of Faith. But I shall instance in the great Question of Rebaptization of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, which many Saints, and Martyrs, and Confessors, and divers Councells, and almost all <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> did once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practise. Their grounds for the invalidity of the baptism by a Heretick, were such mysticall words as these, <hi>Oleum peccatoris non impinguet caput meum Ps.</hi> 140. And <hi>Qui baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à mortuo, quid proficit lavatio ejus? Ecclus</hi> 34. And <hi>ab aquâ alienâ abstinete, Prov.</hi> 5. And <hi>Deus peccatores non exaudit,</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:41208:63"/>
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. And <hi>he that is not with me is against me, Luk.</hi> 11. I am not sure the other part had Arguments so good. For the great one of <hi>una fides, unum baptisma,</hi> did not conclude it to their understandings who were of the other opinion, and men famous in their generations; for it was no Argument that they who had been baptized by <hi>Johns</hi> baptism should not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the name of Jesus, because <hi>unus Deus, unum baptisma;</hi> and as it is still one Faith which a man confesseth severall times, and one Sacrament of the Eucharist, though a man often communicates; so it might be one baptism though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ministred. And the unity of baptism might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the unity of the ministration, but from the unity of the Religion into which they are baptized; though baptized a thousand times, yet because it was still in the name of the holy Trinity, still into the death of Christ, it might be <hi>unum baptisma.</hi> Whether S. <hi>Cyprian, Firmilian,</hi> and their Collegues had this discourse or no (I know not) I am sure they might have had much better to have evacuated the force of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, although I believe they had the wrong cause in hand. But this is it that I say, that when a Question is so undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd in Scripture, that the Arguments rely only upon such mysticall places whence the best fancies can draw the greatest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and such which perhaps were never intended by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, it were good the rivers did not swell higher then the fountaine, and the confidence higher then the Argument and evidence; for in this case there could not any thing be so certainly proved, as that the disagreeing party should deserve to be condemn'd by a sentence of Excommunication for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing it, and yet they were; which I wonder at so much the more, because they (who as it was since judg'd) had the right cause, had not any sufficient Argument from Scripture, not so much as such mysticall Arguments, but did fly to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, in which also I shall afterward shew, they had nothing that was absolutely certaine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I consider that there are divers places of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> in them mysteries and Questions of great concernment, and yet the fabrick and constitution is such, that there is no certain mark to determine whether the sense of them should
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41208:64"/>
be literall or figurative; I speak not here concerning extrinsecall meanes of determination, as traditive Interpretation, Councels, Fathers, Popes, and the like; I shall consider them afterward in their severall places; but here the subject matter being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Scripture in its own capacity, I say there is nothing in the nature of the thing to determine the sense and meaning, but it must be gotten out as it can; and that therefore it is unreasonable, that what of it selfe is ambiguous should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in its own prime sense and intention, under the paine of either a sinne or an Anathema; I instance in that famous place from whence hath sprung that Question of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum.</hi> The words are plain and clear, apt to be understood in the literall sense and yet this sense is so hard as it does violence to reason, and therefore it is the Question whether or no it be not a figurative speech. But here what shall we have to determine it? What mean soever we take, and to what sense soever you will expound it, you shall be put to give an account why you expound other places of Scripture in the same case to quite contrary senses. For if you expound it literally, then besides that it seems to intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of our blessed Saviour, <hi>The words that I speak they are Spirit and they are life,</hi> that is, to be spiritually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood (and it is a miserable thing to see what wretched shifts are used to reconcile the literall sense to these words, and yet to distinguish it from the Capernaiticall fancy) but besides this, why are not those other sayings of Christ expounded literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I am a Vine, I am the Doore, I am a Rock?</hi> Why doe we flie to a figure in those parallel words? <hi>This is the Covenant which I make between me and you;</hi> and yet that Covenant was but the sign of the Covenant; and why doe we fly to a figure in a precept, as well as in mystery and a proposition? <hi>If thy right hand offend thee cut it off;</hi> and yet we have figures enough to save a limb. If it be said because reason tells us these are not to be expounded according to the letter; This will be no plea for them who retaine the literall exposition of the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against all reason, against all Philosophy, against all sense, and against two or three sciences. But if you expound these words figuratively, besides that you are to contest against
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41208:64"/>
a world of prejudices you give your selfe the liberty, which if others will use when either they have a reason or a necessity so to doe, they may perhaps turn all into Allegory, and so may evacuate any precept, and elude any Argument. Well, so it is that very wise men have expounded things <note n="*" place="margin">Sic S Hieron. In ad <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4. I consider that there are some places of Scripture that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> have the selfe same expressions, the same preceptive words, the same reason and account in all appearance, and yet either must be expounded to quite different senses, or else we must renounce the Communion, and the charities of a great part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And yet there is absolutely nothing in the thing or in its circumstances, or in its adjuncts that can determine it to different purposes. I instance in those great exclusive negatives for the necessity of both Sacraments. <hi>Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aquâ &amp;c. Nisi manducaveritis carnem filii hominis, &amp;c.</hi> a <hi>non introibit in regnum coelorum</hi> for both these. Now then the first is urg'd for the absolute indispensable necessity of baptism even in Infants, insomuch that Infants goe to part of Hell if (inculpably both on their own and their Parents part) they misse of baptism, for that is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they learnt from S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and others also
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41208:65"/>
doe from hence baptize Infants, though with a lesse opinion of its absolute necessity. And yet the same manner of precept in the same forme of words, in the same manner of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by an exclusive negative, shall not enjoyn us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Infants, though damnation (at least in forme of words) be exactly and <hi>per omnia</hi> alike appendant to the neglect of holy Baptism and the venerable Eucharist. If <hi>[nisi quis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>] shall conclude against the Anabaptist, for necessity of baptizing Infants (as sure enough we say, it does) why shall not an equall <hi>[nisi comederitis</hi>] bring Infants to the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? The Primitive Church for some two whole Ages did follow their own principles, where ever they lead them; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that upon the same ground equall results must follow, they did Communicate Infants as soon as they had baptized them. And why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should not doe so too, being she expounds <hi>[nisi comederitis</hi>] of orall manducation, I cannot yet learn a reason. And for others that expound it of a spirituall manducation, why they shall not allow the disagreeing part the same liberty of expounding <hi>[nisi quis renatus</hi>] too, I by no meanes can understand. And in these cases no externall determiner can bee pretended in answer. For whatsoever is extrinsecall to the words, as Councels, Tradition, Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Fathers, either have said nothing at all, or have concluded by their practise contrary to the present opinion, as is plaine in their communicating Infants by vertue of <hi>[nisi co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mederitis.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I shall not need to urge the mysteriousnesse of some points in Scripture, which <hi>ex natura rei</hi> are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.</note> though very plainly represented. For there are some <hi>secreta Theologiae,</hi> which are only to be understood by persons very holy and spirituall, which are rather to be felt then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of, and therefore if peradventure they be offered to publike consideration, they will therefore be opposed because they runne the same fortune with many other Questions, that is, not to be understood, and so much the rather because their understanding, that is, the feeling such secrets of the Kingdome, are not the results of Logick and Philosophy, nor yet of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like revelation, but of the publike spirit privately working,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41208:65"/>
and in no man is a duty but in all that have it, is a reward, and is not necessary for all, but given to some, producing its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, not regularly, but upon occasions, personall necessities and new emergencies. Of this nature are the spirit of obsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, beliefe of particular salvation, speciall influences and comforts comming from a sense of the spirit of adoption, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fervours and great complacencies in devotion spirituall joyes, which are little drawings aside of the curtaines of peace and eternity, and antepasts of immortality. But the not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the perfect constitution and temper of these mysteries (and it is hard for any man so to understand, as to make others doe so too that feele them not) is cause that in many Questions of secret Theology, by being very apt and easy to be mistaken, there is a necessity in forbearing one another; and this consideration would have been of good use in the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Catharinus,</hi> both for the preservation of their charity and explication of the mystery.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But here it will not be unseasonable to consider, that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> all systems and principles of science are expressed so that either by reason of the Universality of the termes and subject matter or the infinite variety of humane understandings, and these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure swayed by interest, or determin'd by things accidentall and extrinsecall, they seem to divers men, nay to the same men upon divers occasions to speak things extremly disparate and sometimes contrary, but very often of great variety. And this very thing happens also in Scripture; that if it were not in <hi>re sacrâ &amp; seria,</hi> it were excellent sport to observe how the same place of Scripture serves severall turns upon occasion, and they at that time believe the words sound nothing else, whereas in the liberty of their judgement and abstracting from that occasion, their Commentaries understand them wholy to a differing sense. It is a wonder of what excellent use to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>[tibi dabo claves:</hi>] It was spoken to <hi>Peter</hi> and none else (sometimes) and therefore it concerns him and his Successors only; the rest are to derive from him. And yet if you Question them for their Sacrament of Penance, and Priestly Absolution, then <hi>tibi dabo claves</hi> comes in, and that was spoken to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him to the whole Colledge of the Apostles,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41208:66"/>
and in them to the whole Hierarchy. If you question why the Pope pretends to free soules from Purgatory, <hi>tibi dabo claves</hi> is his warrant; but if you tell him the Keyes are only for bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and loosing on Earth directly, and in Heaven consequently; and that Purgatory is a part of Hell, or rather neither Earth nor Heaven nor Hell, and so the Keyes seem to have nothing to doe with it, then his Commission is to be enlarged by a suppleto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of reason and consequences, and his Keyes shall unlock this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for it is <hi>clavis scientiae</hi> as well as <hi>authoritatis.</hi> And these Keyes shall enable him to expound Scriptures infallibly, to determine Questions, to preside in Councels, to dictate to all the World Magisterially, to rule the Church, to dispence with Oaths, to abrogate Lawes: And if his Key of knowledge will not, the Key of Authority shall, and <hi>tibi dabo claves</hi> shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for all. We have an instance in the single fancy of one man, what rare variety of matter is afforded from those plain words of <hi>[Oravi pro te Petre] Luk.</hi> 22. for that place sayes <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is otherwise to be understood of <hi>Peter,</hi> otherwise of the Popes, and otherwise of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>[pro te</hi>] <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de Pontif. c. 3. § respondeo primò.</note> signifies that Christ prayed that <hi>Peter</hi> might neither erre personally nor judicially, and that <hi>Peters</hi> Successors if they did erre personally, might not erre judicially, and that the Roman Church might not erre personally. All this variety of sense is pretended by the fancy of one man, to be in a few words which are as plain and simple as are any words in Scripture. And what then in those thousands that are intricate? So is done with <hi>pasce oves,</hi> which a man would think were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission as innocent and guiltlesse of designs, as the sheep in the folds are. But if it be asked why the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Universall Bishop, <hi>pasce oves</hi> is his warrant? Why he pretends to a power of deposing Princes, <hi>Pasce oves,</hi> said Christ to <hi>Peter,</hi> the second time. If it be demanded why also he pretends to a power of authorizing his subjects to kill him, <hi>Pasce agnos</hi> said Christ the third time: And <hi>pasce</hi> is <hi>doce,</hi> and <hi>pasce</hi> is <hi>Impera,</hi> and <hi>pasce</hi> is <hi>occide.</hi> Now if others should take the same (unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse I will not say, but the same) liberty in expounding Scripture, or if it be not licence taken, but that the Scripture it selfe is so full and redundant in senses quite contrary, what
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41208:66"/>
man soever, or what company of men soever shall use this principle, will certainly finde such rare productions from seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, that either the unreasonablenesse of the thing will discover the errour of the proceeding, or else there will be a necessity of permitting a great liberty of judgement, where is so infinite variety without limit or mark of necessary deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. If the first, then because an errour is so obvious and ready to our selves, it will be great imprudence or tyranny to be hasty in judging others; but if the latter, it is it that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for: for it is most unreasonable, when either the thing it selfe ministers variety, or that we take licence to our selves in variety of interpretations, or proclaime to all the world our great weaknesse, by our actually being deceived, that we should either prescribe to others magisterially when we are in errour, or limit their understandings when the thing it selfe affords li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and variety.</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.</note> wayes of determining places of difficulty and Question, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly and certainly, but that we must hope to be sav'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of things plaine, necessary and fundamentall, and our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavour to finde out Gods meaning in such places which he hath left under a cloud for other great ends reserved to his own knowledge, we shall see a very great necessity in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a liberty in Prophesying without prescribing authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to other mens consciences, and becomming Lords and Masters of their Faith. Now the meanes of expounding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are either externall, or internall. For the externall, as Church Authority, Tradition, Fathers, Councels and Decrees of Bishops, they are of a distinct consideration, and follow after in their order. But here we will first consider the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity and uncertainty of all those meanes of expounding
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41208:67"/>
Scripture which are more proper and internall to the nature of the thing. The great Masters of Commentaries, some whereof have undertaken to know all mysteries, have propounded many wayes to expound Scripture, which indeed are excellent helps, but not infallible assistances, both because themselves are but morall instruments which force not truth <hi>ex abscondito,</hi> as also because they are not infallibly used and applyed. 1. Sometime the sense is drawn forth by the context and connexion of parts: It is well when it can be so. But when there is two or three antecedents, and subjects spoken of, what man or what rule shall ascertain me that I make my reference true by drawing the relation to such an antecedent; to which I have a minde to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, another hath not. For in a contexture where one part does not alwayes depend upon another, Where things of differing natures intervene and interrupt the first intentions, there it is not alwayes very probable to expound Scripture, take its meaning by its proportion to the neighbouring words. But who desires satisfaction in this, may read the observation verified in S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s moralls upon <hi>Job,</hi> lib. 5. c. 29. and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances he there brings are excellent proofe, that this way of Interpretation does not warrant any man to impose his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions upon the beliefe and understanding of other men too confidently and magisterially.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another great pretence of medium is the conference of places, which <hi>Illyricus</hi> calls <hi>ingens remedium &amp; faelicissimam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positionem</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>sanctae scripturae;</hi> and indeed so it is if well and temperately used; but then we are beholding to them that doe so; for there is no rule that can constrain them to it; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of places is of so indefinite capacity, that if there be ambiguity of words, variety of sense, alteration of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or difference of stile amongst Divine Writers, then there is nothing that may be more abused by wilfull people, or may more easily deceive the unwary, or that may amuse the most intelligent Observer. The Anabaptists take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage enough in this proceeding, (and indeed so may any one that list) and when we pretend against them the necessity of baptizing all, by authority of <hi>nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aquâ &amp; spiritu,</hi> they have a parallel for it, and tell us that Christ
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41208:67"/>
will <hi>baptize us with the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> and that one place expounds the other; and because by fire is not meant an Element or any thing that is naturall, but an Allegory and figurative expression of the same thing; so also by water may be meant the figure signifying the effect or manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Spirit. Fire in one place, and water in the other, doe but represent to us that Christs baptism is nothing else but the cleansing and purifying us by the holy Ghost; But that which I here note as of greatest concernment, and which in all reason ought to be an utter overthrow to this topique, is an universall abuse of it among those that use it most, and when two places seem to have the same expression, or if a word have a double signification, because in this place it may have such a sense, therefore it must, because in one of the places the sense is to their purpose, they conclude that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be so in the other too. An instance I give in the great Question between the <hi>Socinians</hi> and the Catholikes. If any place be urg'd in which our blessed Saviour is called God, they shew you two or three where the word God is taken in a depressed sense, for a <hi>quasi Deus,</hi> as when God said to <hi>Moses, Constitui te Deum Pharaonis;</hi> and hence they argue, because I can shew the word is used for a <hi>Deus factus,</hi> therefore no Argument is sufficient to prove Christ to be <hi>Deus verus</hi> from the appellative of <hi>Deus.</hi> And might not another argue to the exact contrary, and as well urge that <hi>Moses</hi> is <hi>Deus verus,</hi> because in some places the word <hi>Deus</hi> is used <hi>pro Deo aeterno:</hi> Both wayes the Argument concludes impiously and unreasonably. It is a fallacy <hi>à posse ad esse affirmativè;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause breaking of bread is sometimes used for an Eucharisticall manducation in Scripture; therefore I shall not from any testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture affirming the first Christians to have broken bread together, conclude that they liv'd hospitably and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon society. Because it may possibly be eluded, therefore it does not signifie any thing. And this is the great way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering all the Arguments that can be brought against any thing that any man hath a mind to defend; and any man that reads any controversies of any side, shall finde as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this vanity almost as he finds Arguments from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

But unlesse there were some <hi>intellectus universalis</hi> furnished with infallible propositions, by referring to which every man might argue infallibly, this Logick may deceive as well as any of the rest. For it is with reason as with mens tastes; although there are some generall principles which are reasonable to all men, yet every man is not able to draw out all its consequences, nor to understand them when they are drawn forth, nor to believe when he does understand them. There is a precept of S. <hi>Paul</hi> directed to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were gather'd into a body of a Church, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>To withdraw from every brother that walketh disorderly.</hi> But if this precept were now observed, I would faine know whether we should not fall into that inconvenience which S. <hi>Paul</hi> sought to avoyd in giving the same commandement to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>I wrote to you that yee should not company with fornicators;</hi> And <hi>yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, for then yee must goe out of the world:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he restrains it to a quitting the society of Christians li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ill lives. But now that all the world hath been Christians, if we should sin in keeping company with vitious Christians, must we not also goe out of this world? Is not the precept made null, because the reason is altered, and things are come about, and that the <gap reason="foreign">

And yet either this never was considered, or not yet believed; for it is generally taken to be obligatory, though (I think) seldome practised. But when we come to expound Scriptures to a certaine sense by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from prudentiall motives, then we are in a vast plain without any sufficient guide, and we shall have so many senses, as there are humane prudences. But that which goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then this, is a parity of reason from a plain place of Scripture to an obscure, from that which is plainly set down in a Text
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41208:68"/>
to another that is more remote from it. And thus is that place in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> forced, <hi>If thy brother refuse to be amended, Dic ecclesiae.</hi> Hence some of the Roman Doctors argue, If Christ commands to tell the Church in case of adultery or private injury, then much more in case of heresy. Well, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this to be a good Interpretation; Why must I stay here? Why may not I also adde by a parity of reason, If the Church must be told of heresy, much more of treason: And why may not I reduce all sinnes to the cognizance of a Church tribunall, as some men doe indirectly, and <hi>Snecanus</hi> does heartily and plainly? If a mans principles be good, and his deductions cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he need not care whether they carry him. But when an Authority is intrusted to a person, and the extent of his power expressed in his commission, it will not be safety to meddle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his commission upon confidence of a parity of reason. To instance once more; When Christ in <hi>pasce oves &amp; tu es Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus,</hi> gave power to the Pope to govern the Church (for to that sense the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> expounds those Authorities) by a certain consequence of reason, say they, he gave all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for exercise of this jurisdiction, and therefore in <hi>pasce oves</hi>] he gave him an indirect power over temporalls, for that is necessary that he may doe his duty: Well, having gone thus farre, we will goe further upon the parity of reason, therefore he hath given the Pope the gift of tongues, and he hath given him power to give it; for how else shall <hi>Xavier</hi> convert the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians?</hi> He hath given him also power to command the Seas and the winds, that they should obey him, for this also is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in some cases.

prescrib'd unto, by another mans reason; especially because such reasonings as usually are in explication of particular places of Scripture, depend upon minute circumstances and particularities, in which it is so easy to be deceived, and so hard to speak rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son regularly and alwayes, that it is the greater wonder if we be not deceived.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Others pretend to expound Scripture by the analogy of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> Faith, and that is the most sure and infallible way (as it is thought:) But upon stricter survey it is but a Chimera, a thing in <hi>nubibus</hi> which varies like the right hand and left hand of a Pillar, and at the best is but like the Coast of a Country to a Traveller out of his way; It may bring him to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end though twenty mile about; it may keep him from running into the Sea, and from mistaking a river for dry land; but whether this little path or the other be the right way it tells not. So is the analogy of Faith, that is, if I understand it right, the rule of Faith, that is the Creed. Now were it not a fine device to goe to expound all the Scripture by the Creed, there being in it so many thousand places which have no more relation to any Article in the Creed, then they have to <hi>Tityre tu patula?</hi> Indeed if a man resolves to keep the analogy of Faith, that is to expound Scripture, so as not to doe any violence to any fundamentall Article, he shall be sure however he erres, yet not to destroy Faith, he shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in his Exposition. And that was the precept given by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that all Prophesyings should be estimated <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12. and to this very purpose, S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Genesis,</hi> by way of Preface sets down the Articles of Faith, with this design and protestation of it, that if he sayes nothing against those Articles, though he misse the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sense of the place, there is no danger, or sinne in his Exposition; but how that analogy of Faith should have any other influence in expounding such places in which those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith are neither expressed, nor involv'd, I understand not. But then if you extend the analogy of Faith further then that which is proper to the rule of Symbol of Faith, then every man expounds Scripture according to the analogy of Faith; but what? His own Faith: which Faith if it be questioned, I am no
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41208:69"/>
more bound to expound according to the analogy of another mans Faith, then he to expound according to the analogy of mine. And this is it that is complain'd on of all sides that overvalue their own opinions. Scripture seems so clearly to speak what they believe, that they wonder all the world does not see it as clear as they doe; but they satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with saying that it is because they come with prejudice, whereas if they had the true beliefe, that is, theirs, they would easily see what they see. And this is very true: For if they did believe as others believe, they would expound Scriptures to their sense; but if this be expounding according to the analogy of Faith, it signifies no more then this, Be you of my mind and then my Arguments will seem concluding and my Authorities and Allegations pressing and pertinent: And this will serve on all sides, and therefore will doe but little service to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Questions, or prescribing to other mens consciences on any side.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Consulting the Originals is thought a great matter <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> to Interpretation of Scriptures. But this is to small purpose: For indeed it will expound the Hebrew and the Greek, and rectifie Translations. But I know no man that sayes that the Scriptures in Hebrew and Greek are easie and certaine to be understood, and that they are hard in Latine and English: The difficulty is in the thing however it be expressed, the least is in the language. If the Originall Languages were our mother tongue, Scripture is not much the easier to us; and a naturall Greek or a Jew, can with no more reason, nor authority ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude his Interpretations upon other mens consciences, then a man of another Nation. Adde to this that the inspection of the Originall, is no more certain way of Interpretation of Scripture now then it was to the Fathers and Primitive Ages of the Church; and yet he that observes what infinite variety of Translations of the Bible were in the first Ages of the Church (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> observes) and never a one like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; will think that we shall differ as much in our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations as they did, and that the medium is as uncertain to us as it was to them; and so it is; witnesse the great number of late Translations, and the infinite number of Commentaries,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41208:70"/>
which are too pregnant an Argument that wee neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the understanding of the words nor of the sense.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, all these wayes of Interpreting of Scripture which of themselves are good helps, are made either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> or by our infirmites wayes of intricating and involving Scriptures in greater difficulty, because men doe not learn their doctrines from Scripture, but come to the understanding of Scripture with preconceptions and idea's of doctrines of their own, and then no wonder that Scriptures look like Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, wherein every man in the roome believes they look on him only, and that wheresoever he stands, or how often soever he changes his station. So that now what was intended for a remedy, becomes the promoter of our disease, and our meat becomes the matter of sicknesses: And the mischiefe is, the wit of man cannot find a remedy for it; for there is no rule, no limit, no certain principle, by which all men may be guided to a certain and so infallible an Interpretation, that he can with any equity prescribe to others to believe his Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in places of controversy or ambiguity. A man would think that the memorable Prophesy of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that the Scepter should not depart from <hi>Judah</hi> till <hi>Shiloh</hi> come, should have been so clear a determination of the time of the <hi>Messias,</hi> that a Jew should never have doubted it to have been verified in Jesus of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> and yet for this so clear vaticination, they have no lesse then twenty six Answers. S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>James</hi> seem to speak a little diversly concerning Justification by Faith and Works, and yet to my understanding it is very easy to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them: but all men are not of my mind; for <hi>Osiander</hi> in his confutation of the book which <hi>Melanchton</hi> wrote against him, observes, that there are twenty severall opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Iustification, all drawn from the Scriptures, by the men only of the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession. There are sixteen severall opinions concerning originall sinne; and as many definitions of the Sacraments as there are Sects of men that disagree about them.</p>
                     <p>And now what help is there for us in the midst of these uncertainties? If we follow any one Translation, or any one <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> mans Commentary, what rule shall we have to chuse the right
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41208:70"/>
by? or is there any one man, that hath translated perfectly, or expounded infallibly? No Translation challenges such a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative as to be authentick, but the Vulgar Latine; and yet see with what good successe: For when it was declared authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick by the Councell of <hi>Trent, Sixtus</hi> put forth a Copy much mended of what it was, and tyed all men to follow that; but that did not satisfie; for Pope <hi>Clement</hi> reviews and corrects it in many places, and still the Decree remaines in a changed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And secondly, that Translation will be very unapt to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, in which one of their own men <hi>Isidore Clarius</hi> a Monk of <hi>Brescia,</hi> found and mended eight thousand faults, besides innumerable others which he sayes he pretermitted. And then thirdly, to shew how little themselves were satisfied with it, divers learned men amongst them did new translate the Bible, and thought they did God and the Church good service in it. So that if you take this for your precedent, you are sure to be mistaken infinitely: If you take any other, the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves doe not promise you any security. If you resolve to follow any one as farre only as you see cause, then you only doe wrong or right by chance; for you have certainty just proportionable to your own skill, to your own infallibility. If you resolve to follow any one, whether soever he leads, we shall oftentimes come thither where we shall see our selves become ridiculous, as it happened in the case of <hi>Spiridion</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who so resolv'd to follow his old book, that when an eloquent Bishop who was desired to Preach, read his Text, <hi>Tu autem tolle cubile tuum &amp; ambula; Spiridion</hi> was very angry with him, because in his book it was <hi>tolle lectum tuum,</hi> and thought it arrogance in the preacher to speak better Latine then his Translatour had done: And if it be thus in Translations, it is farre worse in Expositions: <hi>[Quia scil.

And in this topick, not only the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Articles are clear and plain, like as the fundamentals of Faith expressed in Scripture, but also it pretends to expound Scripture, and to determine Questions with so much clarity and certainty, as there shall neither be errour nor doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and therefore no disagreeing is here to be endured. And indeed it is most true if Tradition can performe these pretensions, and teach us plainly, and assure us infallibly of all truths, which they require us to believe, we can in this case have no reason to disbelieve them, and therefore are certainly Hereticks if we doe, because without a crime, without some humane interest or collaterall design, we cannot disbelieve tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditive Doctrine or traditive Interpretation, if it be infallibly prov'd to us that tradition is an infallible guide.</p>
                     <p>But here I first consider that tradition is no repository of <note place="margin">

                        <hi>instituta reperiuntur, credibile est ab Apostolorum traditione descendisse.</hi> Now suppose this rule probable, that's the most, yet it is not certaine; It might come by custome, whose Originall was not knowne, but yet could not derive from an Apostolicall principle. Now when they conclude of particular Traditions by a generall rule, and that generall rule not certain, but at the most probable in any thing, and certainly false in some things, it is wonder if the productions, that is, their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pretence faile so often. And if I should but instance in all the particulars, in which Tradition was pretended falsly or uncertainly in the first Ages, I should multiply them to a troublesome variety; for it was then accounted so glorious a thing to have spoken with the persons of the Apostles, that if any man could with any colour pretend to it, he might abuse the whole Church, and obtrude what he listed under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious title of Apostolicall Tradition, and it is very notorious to every man that will but read and observe the Recognitions or stromata of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> where there is enough of such false wares shewed in every book, and pretended to be no lesse then from the Apostles. In the first Age after the Apostles, <hi>Papias</hi> pretended he received a Tradition from the Apostles, that Christ before the day of Judgement should reign a thousand yeares upon Earth, and his Saints with him in temporall felicities; and this thing proceeding from so great an Authority as the testimony of <hi>Papias,</hi> drew after it all or most of the Christians in the first three hundred years. For besides, that the Millenary opinion is expresly taught by <hi>Papias, Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Irenaus, Origen, Lactantius, Severus, Victorinus, Apollinaris,</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:41208:74"/>
                        <hi>Nepos,</hi> and divers others famous in their time, <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue against <hi>Tryphon</hi> sayes, it was the beliefe of all Christians exactly Orthodox, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, and yet there was no such Tradition, but a mistake in <hi>Papias;</hi> but I find it nowhere spoke against, till <hi>Dionysins</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> confuted <hi>Nepo</hi>'s Book, and converted <hi>Coracion</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> from the opinion. Now if a Tradition whose begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of being called so began with a Scholar of the Apostles (for so was <hi>Papias)</hi> and then continued for some Ages upon the meer Authority of so famous a man, did yet deceive the Church: much more fallible is the pretence, when two or three hundred years after, it but commences, and then by some learned man is first called a Tradition Apostolicall. And so it hapned in the case of the <hi>Arrian</hi> heresy, which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers did confute by objecting a contrary Tradition Apostolicall, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; <note place="margin">Lib. 1. hist. c. 8.</note> and yet if they had not had better Arguments from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then from Tradition, they would have faild much in so good a cause; for this very pretence the <hi>Arrians</hi> themselves made, and desired to be tryed by the Fathers of the first three hundred years, which was a confutation sufficient to them who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Vide Peta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41208:75"/>
by an old Writer, out of whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> transcribes a large passage to reprove the vanity of the pretender. But I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from hence, that it was usuall to pretend to Tradition, and that it was easier pretended then confuted, and I doubt not but oftner done then discovered. A great Question arose in <hi>Africa</hi> concerning the Baptism of Hereticks, whether it were valid or no. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his party appealed to Scripture; <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his party, would be judged by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and Tradition Ecclesiasticall. See how much the nearer the Question was to a determination, either that probation was not accounted by S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the Bishops both of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> to be a good Argument, and sufficient to determine them, or there was no certain Tradition against them; for unlesse one of these two doe it, nothing could excuse them from opposing a known truth, unlesse peradventure, S. <hi>Cyprian, Firmilian,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Galatia, Cappadocia,</hi> and almost two parts of the World were ignorant of such a Tradition, for they knew of none such, and some of them expresly denyed it. And the sixth generall Synod approves of the Canon made in the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> under <hi>Cyprian</hi> upon this very ground, because in <hi>praedictorum praesulum locis &amp; solum se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum</hi>

And I shall observe this too, that this very Tradition was so obscure, and was so obscurely delivered, silently proclaimed, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> who disputed against the <hi>Donatists</hi> upon this very Question was not able to prove it, but <note place="margin">L. 5. de bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. contr. Donat. c. 23.</note> by a consequence which he thought probale and credible, as appears in his discourse against the <hi>Donatists. The Apostles,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin, prescrib'd nothing in this particular: But this custome which is contrary to Cyprian ought to be believed to have come from their Tradition, as many other things which the Catholike Church observes.</hi> That's all the ground and all the reason; nay the Church did waver concerning that Question, and before the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41208:75"/>
decision of a Councell, <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others might dissent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of charity. It was plain then there was no clear Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. c. 18.</note> in the Question, possibly there might be a custome in some Churches <hi>postnate</hi> to the times of the Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition Apostolicall. But this was a supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory device ready at hand when ever they needed it; and <note place="margin">De peccat. ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. l. 2. c. 40. contra Pelagi. &amp; Caelest.</note> S. <hi>Austin</hi> confuted the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> in the Question of Originall sinne, by the custome of exorcisme and insufflation, which S. <hi>Austin</hi> said came from the Apostles by Tradition, which yet was then, and is now so impossible to be prov'd, that he that shall affirm it, shall gaine only the reputation of a bold man and a confident.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I consider if the report of Traditions in the Primitive <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> times so neare the Ages Apostolicall was so uncertain, that they were fain to aym at them by conjectures, and grope as in the dark, the uncertainty is much encreased since, because there are many famous Writers whose works are lost, which yet if they had continued, they might have been good records to us, as <hi>Clemens Romanus, Egesippus, Nepos, Coracion, Dionysius Areopagite,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Corinth, Firmilian</hi> and many more: And since we see pretences have been made without reason in those Ages where they might better have been confuted, then now they can, it is greater prudence to suspect any later pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, since so many Sects have been, so many warres, so many corruptions in Authors, so many Authors lost, so much ignorance hath intervened, and so many interests have been ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that now the rule is to be altered; and whereas it was of old time credible, that that was Apostolicall whose beginning they knew not, now quite contrary we cannot safely believe them to be Apostolicall unlesse we doe know their beginning to have been from the Apostles. For this consisting of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and particulars, which put together make up a morall demonstration, the Argument which I now urge hath been growing these fifteen hundred years; and if anciently there was so much as to evacuate the Authority of Tradition, much more is there now absolutely to destroy it, when all the particulars, which time and infinite variety of humane accidents have been amassing together, are now concentred, and are united by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41208:76"/>
way of constipation. Because every Age and every great change, and every heresy, and every interest, hath increased the difficulty of finding out true Traditions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are very many Traditions which are lost, and yet they are concerning matters of as great consequence as most of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> those Questions for the determination whereof Traditions are pretended: It is more then probable, that as in Baptism and the Eucharist the very formes of ministration are transmitted to us, so also in confirmation and ordination, and that there were speciall directions for visitation of the sick, and explicite interpretations of those difficult places of S. <hi>Paul</hi> which S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> affirmed to be so difficult that the ignorant doe wrest them to their own damnation, and yet no Church hath conserved these or those many more which S. <hi>Basil</hi> affirms to be so many that <gap reason="foreign">

And if the Church hath fail'd in keeping the great variety of Traditions, it will hardly be thought a fault in a private person to neglect Tradition, which either the whole Church hath very much neglected inculpably, or else the whose Church is very much too blame. And who can ascertain us that she hath not entertained some which are no Traditions as well as lost thousands that are? That she did entertain some false Traditions, I have already prov'd; but it is also as probable that some of those which these Ages did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for Traditions, are not so, as it is certain that some which the first Ages cald Traditions, were nothing lesse.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There are some opinions which when they began to be publikely received, began to be accounted prime Traditions, <note place="margin">

For why should not Divines doe in the Question of reconfirmation as in that of rebaptization? Are not the grounds equall from an indelible character in one as in the other? and if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen such a Question as this after contestation should be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd not by any positive decree, but by the cession of one part, and the authority and reputation of the other, does not the next Age stand faire to be abused with a pretence of Tradition, in the matter of reconfirmation, which never yet came to a serious Question? For so it was in the Question of rebaptization for which there was then no more evident Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then there is now in the Question of reconfirmation, as I proved formerly, but yet it was carried upon that Title.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is great variety in the probation of Tradition, so that whatever is proved to be Tradition, is not equally and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> alike credible; for nothing but universall Tradition is of it selfe credible; other Traditions in their just proportion as they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the degrees of universality. Now that a Tradition be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41208:77"/>
universall, or which is all one that it be a credible Testimony, S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> requires that Tradition should derive from all the <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 4.</note> Churches Apostolicall. And therefore according to this rule there was no sufficient medium to determine the Question about Easter, because the Eastern and Western Churches had severall Traditions respectively, and both pretended from the Apostles. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> sayes, it was a secret Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Li. 1. Stromat.</note> from the Apostles that Christ preached but one year: But <note place="margin">L. 2. c. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Irenaeus</hi> sayes it did derive from Hereticks, and sayes that he <note place="margin">Omnes Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res testantur qui in Asiâ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Iohannem Discipulum Domini con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venerunt id ipsum tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disse eis Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannem, &amp;c. &amp; qui alios Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolos viderunt haec eadem ab ipsis audierunt, &amp; testantur de ejusmodi relatione.</note> by Tradition first from S. <hi>John,</hi> and then from his Disciples received another Tradition, that Christ was almost fifty years old when he dyed, and so by consequence preached almost twenty years; both of them were deceived, and so had all that had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the report of either pretending Tradition Apostolicall. Thus the custome in the Latine Church of fasting on Saturday was against that Tradition which the Greeks had from the Apostles; and therefore by this division and want of consent, which was the true Tradition was so absolutely indeterminable, that both must needs lose much of their reputation. But how then when not only particular Churches but single persons are all the proofe we have for a Tradition? And this often hapned; I think S. <hi>Austin</hi> is the chiefe Argument and Authority we have for the Assumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> the Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is called a Tradition by <hi>Origen</hi> alone at first, and from <note place="margin">Salmeron. disput. 51. in Rom.</note> him by others. The procession of the holy Ghost from the Sonne, which is an Article the Greek Church disavowes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from the Tradition Apostolicall, as it is pretended; and yet before S. <hi>Austin</hi> we heare nothing of it very cleerly or certainly, for as much as that whole mystery concerning the blessed Spirit was so little explicated in Scripture, and so little derived to them by Tradition, that till the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> you shall hardly find any form of worship or personall addresse of devotion to the holy Spirit, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> observes, and I think the contrary will very hardly be verified. And for this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in which I instance, whatsoever is in Scripture concerning it, is against that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls Tradition, which makes the Greeks so confident as they are of the point, and is an Argument of the vanity of some things which for no
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41208:77"/>
greater reason are called Traditions, but because one man hath said so, and that they can be proved by no better Argument to be true. Now in this case wherein Tradition descends upon us with unequall certainty, it would be very unequall to require of us an absolute beliefe of every thing not written, for feare we be accounted to slight Tradition Apostolicall. And since no thing can require our supreme assent, but that which is truly Catholike and Apostolike, and to such a Tradition is requir'd as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> sayes, the consent of all those Churches which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles planted, and where they did preside, this topick will be of so little use in judging heresies that (besides what is deposited in Scripture) it cannot be proved in any thing but in the Canon of Scripture it selfe, and as it is now received, even in that there is some variety.</p>
                     <p>And therefore there is wholy a mistake in this businesse; for when the Fathers appeal to Tradition, and with much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.</note> and some clamour they call upon Hereticks to conform to or to be tryed by Tradition, it is such a Tradition as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the fundamentall points of Christianity, which were also recorded in Scripture. But because the Canon was not yet perfectly consign'd, they call'd to that testimony they had, which was the testimony of the Churches Apostolicall, whose Bishops and Priests being the <hi>Antistites religionis,</hi> did believe and preach Christian Religion and conserve all its great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according as they had been taught. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls this a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Apostolicall, <hi>Christum accepisse calicem, &amp; dixisse san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem suum esse, &amp; docuisse novam oblationem novi Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, quam Ecclesia per Apostolos accipiens offert per totum mundum.</hi> And the Fathers in these Ages confute Hereticks by Ecclesiasticall Tradition, that is, they confront against their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and blaspemous doctrines that Religion which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles having taught to the Churches where they did preside, their Successors did still preach, and for a long while together suffered not the enemy to sow tares amongst their wheat. And yet these doctrines which they called Traditions, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but such fundamentall truths which were in Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">

what heresies they fought against, the heresies of <hi>Ebion, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus, Nicolaitans, Valentinians, Carpocratians,</hi> persons that <note place="margin">Vid. Irenae. l. 3 &amp; 4. cont. haeres.</note> denyed the Sonne of God, the Unity of the God-head, that preached impurity, that practised Sorcery and Witch-craft. And now that they did rather urge Tradition against them then Scripture was, because the publike Doctrine of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Churches was at first more known and famous then many parts of the Scripture, and because some Hereticks denyed S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel, some received none but S. <hi>Matthews,</hi> some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and it was a long time before the whole Canon was consign'd by universall Testimony, some Churches having one part some another, <hi>Rome</hi> her selfe had not all, so that in this case the Argument from Tradition was the most famous, the most certain, and the most prudent. And now according to this rule they had more Traditions then we have, and Traditions did by degrees lessen as they came to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and their necessity was lesse, as the knowledge of them was ascetained to us by a better Keeper of Divine Truths. All that great mysteriousnesse of Christs Priest-hood, the unity of his Sacrifice, Christs Advocation and Intercession for us in Heaven, and many other excellent. Doctrines might very well be accounted Traditions before S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> was publish'd to all the World; but now they are written truths; and if they had not, possibly we might either have lost them quite, or doubted of them as we doe of many other Traditions, by reason of the insufficiency of the propounder. And therefore it was that S. <hi>Peter</hi> took order that the Gospel <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 13.</note> should be Writ, for he had promised that he would doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which after his decease should have these things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. He knew it was not safe trusting the report of men where the fountain might quickly run dry, or be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so insensibly, that no cure could be found for it, nor any just notice taken of it till it were incurable. And indeed there is scarce any thing but what is written in Scripture, that can with any confidence of Argument pretend to derive from the Apostles, except ritualls, and manners of ministration; but no doctrines or speculative mysteries are so transmitted to us by so cleer a current, that we may see a visible channell,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41208:78"/>
and trace it to the Primitive fountaines. It is said to be a Tradition Apostolicall, that no Priest should baptize without chrism and the command of the Bishop: Suppose it were, yet we cannot be oblig'd to believe it with much confidence, because we have but little proofe for it, scarce any thing but the single testimony of S. <hi>Hierom.</hi> And yet if it were, this is but a rituall, of which in passing by, I shall give that account: That, <note place="margin">Dialog. adv. Lucifer.</note> suppose this and many more ritualls did derive clearly from Tradition Apostolicall (which yet but very few doe) yet it is hard that any Church should be charged with crime for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving such ritualls, because we see some of them which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did derive from the Apostles, are expir'd and gone out in a desuetude; such as are abstinence from blood, and from things strangled, the coenobitick life of secular persons, the colledge of widowes, to worship standing upon the Lords day, to give milk and honey to the newly baptized, and many more of the like nature; now there having been no mark to distinguish the necessity of one from the indifferency of the other, they are all alike necessary, or alike indifferent; if the former, why does no Church observe them? if the later, why does the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> charge upon others the shame of novelty, for leaving of some Rites and Ceremonies which by her own practice we are taught to have no obligation in them, but to be adiaphorous? S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave order, that a Bishop should be the husband of one wife; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not allow so much; other Churches allow more: The Apostles commanded Christians to Fast on Wednesday and Friday, as appeares in their Canons; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Fasts Friday and Saturday, and not on Wednesday: The Apostles had their Agapae or love Feasts, we should believe them scandalous: They used a kisse of charity in ordinary addresses, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> keeps it only in their Masse, other Churches quite omit it: The Apostles permitted Priests and Deacons to live in conjugall Society as appears in the 5. Can. of the Apostles (which to them is an Argument who believe them such) and yet the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by no meanes will endure it; nay more, <hi>Michael Medina</hi> gives Testimony that of 84 Canons Apostolicall which <hi>Clemens</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, <note place="margin">De sacr. hom, continent, li 5. c. 105.</note> scarce six or eight are observed by the Latine Church,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41208:79"/>
and <hi>Peresius</hi> gives this account of it, <hi>In illis contineri multa quae temporum corruptione non plenè observantur, aliis pro temporis</hi> &amp; <note place="margin">De Tradit. part. 3. c. de Author. Can. Apost.</note> 
                        <hi>materiae qualitate aut obliteratis, aut totius Ecclesiae magisterio abrogatis.</hi> Now it were good that they which take a liberty to themselves, should also allow the same to others. So that for one thing or other, all Traditions excepting those very few that are absolutely universall, will lose all their obligation, and become no competent medium to confine mens practises, or limit their faiths, or determine their perswasions. Either for the difficulty of their being prov'd, the incompetency of the testimony that transmits them, or the indifferency of the thing transmitted, all Traditions both rituall and doctrinall are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from determining our consciences either to a necessary believing or obeying.</p>

Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Basil</hi> pretend it an Apostolicall Tradition, to sign in the aire with the sign of the Crosse, but this was only consign'd to them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> But to instance once for all in the Epistle of <hi>Marcellus</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he affirmes that it is the Canon of the Apostles, <hi>praeter sententiam Romani Pontificis, non posse Conciliae celebrari.</hi> And yet there is no such Canon extant, nor ever was for ought appears in any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord we have; and yet the Collection of the Canons is so intire, that though it hath something more then what was Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, yet it hath nothing lesse. And now that I am casually fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon an instance from the Canons of the Apostles, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that there cannot in the world a greater instance be given how easy it is to be abused in the believing of Traditions. For 1. to the first 50. which many did admit for Apostolicall, 35
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41208:79"/>
more were added, which most men now count spurious, all men call dubious, and some of them universally condemned by peremptory sentence, even by them who are greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of that Collection, as 65. 67. and 8 ⅘ Canons. For the first 50, it is evident that there are some things so mixt with them, and no mark of difference left, that the credit of all is much impared, insomuch that <hi>Isidor</hi> of <hi>Sevill</hi> sayes, <hi>they were Apoeryphall, made by Hereticks, and published under the</hi>

One thing only I observe (and we shall find it true in most writings, whose Authority is urged in Questions of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy)</hi> that the Authority of the Tradition is not it which moves the assent, but the nature of the thing; and because such a Canon is delivered, they doe not therefore believe the sanction or proposition so delivered, but disbelieve the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they doe not like the matter, and so doe not judge of the matter by the Tradition, but of the Tradition by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> rejects the 84 or 85 Canon of the Apostles, not because it is delivered with lesse Authority, then the last 35 are, but because it reckons the Canon of Scripture otherwise then it is at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus also the fifth Canon amongst the first 50, because it approves the marriage of Priests and Deacons does not perswade them to approve of it too, but it selfe becomes suspected for approving it: So that either they accuse themselves of palpable contempt of the Apostolicall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or else that the reputation of such Traditions is kept up to serve their own ends, and therefore when they encounter them, they are more to be upheld; which what else is it but to teach all the world to contemn such pretences and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value Traditions, and to supply to others a reason why they should doe that, which to them that give the occasion is most unreasonable?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Testimony of the Ancient Church being the only <note place="margin">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41208:80"/>
imitated, it is considerable that men in their estimate of it, take their rise from severall Ages and differing Testimonies, and are not agreed about the competency of their Testimony; and the reasons that on each side make them differ, are such as make the Authority it selfe the lesse authentick and more repudiable. Some will allow only of the three first Ages, as being most pure, most persecuted, and therefore most holy, least interested, serving fewer designs, having fewest factions, and therefore more likely to speak the truth for Gods sake and its own, as best complying with their great end of acquiring Heaven in recompence of losing their lives: Others <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Card. Petron. lettre an Sieur Casaubon.</note> say, that those Ages being persecuted minded the present Doctrines proportionable to their purposes and constitution of the Ages, and make little or nothing of those Questions which at this day vex Christendome: And both speak true: The first Ages speak greatest truth, but least pertinently. The next Ages, the Ages of the foure generall Councels spake something, not much more pertinently to the present Questions, but were not so likely to speak true, by reason of their dispositions contrary to the capacity and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the first Ages; and if they speak wisely as Doctors, yet not certainly as witnesses of such propositions which the first Ages noted not; and yet unlesse they had noted, could not possibly be Traditions. And therefore either of them will be lesse uselesse as to our present affaires. For indeed the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions which now are the publike trouble, were not considered or thought upon for many hundred years, and therefore prime Tradition there is none as to our purpose, and it will be an insufficient medium to be used or pretended in the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to dispute concerning the truth or necessity of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, in the Questions of out times, is as if Historians dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about a Question in the English Story, should fall on wrangling whether <hi>Livie</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> were the best Writers: And the earnest disputes about Traditions are to no better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For no Church at this day admits the one halfe of those things, which certainly by the Fathers were called Traditions Apostolicall, and no Testimony of ancient Writers does consign the one halfe of the present Questions, to be or not to be Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So that they who admit only the Doctrine and Testimony
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41208:80"/>
of the first Ages cannot be determined in most of their doubts which now trouble us, because their Writings are of matters wholy differing from the present disputes, and they which would bring in after Ages to the Authority of a competent judge or witnesse, say the same thing; for they plainly confesse that the first Ages spake little or nothing to the present Question, or at least nothing to their sense of them; for therefore they call in aid from the following Ages, and make them suppletory and auxiliary to their designs, and therefore there are no Traditions to our purposes. And they who would willingly have it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yet have taken no course it should be otherwise; for they when they had opportunity in the Councels of the last Ages to determine what they had a mind to, yet they never nam'd the number, nor expressed the particular Traditions which they would faine have the world believe to be Apostolicall: But they have kept the bridle in their own hands, and made a reserve of their own power, that if need be, they may make new pretensions, or not be put to it to justifie the old by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of a conciliary declaration.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, We are acquitted by the Testimony of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers, from any other necessity of believing, then of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.</note> such Articles as are recorded in Scripture: And this is done by them, whose Authority is pretended the greatest Argument for Tradition, as appears largely in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who disputes professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the sufficiency of Scripture against certain Hereticks, who <note place="margin">L. 3. c. 2. contr. haeres.</note> affirm some necessary truths not to be written. It was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent saying of S. <hi>Basil</hi> and will never be wipt out with all the eloquence of <hi>Perron</hi> [in his Serm. <hi>de fide. Manifestus est fidei lapsus, &amp; liquidum superbiae vitium vel respuere aliquid eorum quae Scriptura habet, vel inducere quicquam quod scriptum non est.</hi>] And it is but a poore device to say that every particular Tradition is consigned in Scripture by those places which give Authority to Tradition; and so the introducing of Tradition is not a super-inducing any thing over or besides Scripture, because Tradition is like a Messenger, and the Scripture is like his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Credence, and therefore Authorizes whatsoever Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion speaketh. For supposing Scripture does consign the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Tradition (which it might doe before all the whole
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41208:81"/>
Instrument of Scripture it self was consign'd, and then afterwards there might be no need of Tradition) yet supposing it, it will follow that all those Traditions which are truly prime and Apostolicall, are to be entertain'd according to the intention of the Deliverers, which indeed is so reasonable of it selfe, that we need not Scripture to perswade us to it; it selfe is authentick as Scripture is, if it derives from the same fountain; and a word is never the more the Word of God for being written, nor the lesse for not being written; but it will not follow that whatsoever is pretended to be Tradition, is so, neither is the credit of the particular instances consign'd in Scripture; &amp; <hi>dolosus versatur in generalibus,</hi> but that this craft is too palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if a generall and indefinite consignation of Tradition be sufficient to warrant every particular that pretends to be Tradition, then S. <hi>Basil</hi> had spoken to no purpose by saying it is Pride &amp; Apostasy from the Faith, to bring in what is not written: For if either any man brings in what is written, or what he sayes is delivered, then the first being expresse Scripture, and the second being consign'd in Scripture, no man can be charged with superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing what is not written, he hath his Answer ready; And then these are zealous words absolutely to no purpose; but if such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consignation does not warrant every thing that pretends to Tradition, but only such as are truly proved to be Apostolicall; then Scripture is uselesse as to this particular; for such Tradition gives testimony to Scripture, and therefore is of it selfe first, and more credible, for it is credible of it selfe; and therefore unlesse S. <hi>Basil</hi> thought that all the will of God in matters of Faith and Doctrine were written, I see not what end nor what sense he could have in these words: For no man in the world except <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> and mad-men ever obtruded a Doctrine upon-the Church, but he pretended Scripture for it or Tradition, and therefore no man could be pressed by these words, no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, no man instructed, no not <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> or <hi>Montanists.</hi> For suppose either of them should say, that since in Scripture the holy Ghost is promised to abide with the Church for ever, to teach, whatever they pretend the Spirit in any Age hath taught them, is not to super-induce any thing beyond what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, because the truth of the Spirit, his veracity, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41208:81"/>
teaching being promised and attested in Scripture, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath just so consign'd all such Revelations, as <hi>Perron</hi> saith it hath all such Traditions. But I will trouble my selfe no more with Arguments from any humane Authorities; but he that is surprized with the beliefe of such Authorities, and will but consider the very many Testimonies of Antiquity to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as of <note n="a" place="margin">Orat. ad Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen.

                        <hi>Paul, Nemo sentiat super quod scriptum est,</hi> will see that there is reason, that since no man is materially a Heretick, but he that erres in a point of Faith, and all Faith is sufficienly recorded in Scripture, the judgement of Faith and Heresy is to be derived from thence, and no man is to be condemned for dissenting in an Article for whose probation Tradition only is pretended; only according to the degree of its evidence, let every one deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himselfe, but of this evidence we must not judge for others; for unlesse it be in things of Faith, and absolute certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, evidence is a word of relation, and so supposes two terms, the object and the faculty; and it is an imperfect speech to say a thing is evident in it selfe (unlesse we speak of first principles or clearest revelations) for that may be evident to one that is not so to another, by reason of the pregnancy of some appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, and the immaturity of others.</p>
                     <p>This Discourse hath its intention in Traditions Doctrinall and Rituall, that is such Traditions which propose Articles new <hi>in materiâ;</hi> but now if Scripture be the repository of all Divine Truths sufficient for us, Tradition must be considered as its instrument, to convey its great mysteriousnesse to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings; it is said there are traditive Interpretations as well as traditive propositions, but these have not much distinct consideration in them, both because their uncertainty is as great as the other upon the former considerations; as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in very deed, there are no such things as traditive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations universall: For as for particulars, they signifie no more but that they are not sufficient determinations of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions Theologicall, therefore because they are particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, and of infinite variety, and they are no more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41208:82"/>
then the particular authority of these men whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries they are, and therefore must be considered with them.</p>
                     <p>The summe is this: Since the Fathers who are the best <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> Witnesses of Traditions, yet were infinitely deceived in their account, since sometimes they guest at them and conjectured by way of Rule and Discourse, and not of their knowledge, not by evidence of the thing; since many are called Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were not so, many are uncertaine whether they were or no, yet confidently pretended; and this uncertainty which at first was great enough, is increased by infinite causes and accidents in the succession of 1600 yeares; since the Church hath been either so carelesse or so abused that shee could not, or would not preserve Traditions with carefulnesse and truth; since it was ordinary for the old Writers to set out their own fancies, and the Rites of their Church which had been Ancient under the specious Title of Apostolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; since some Traditions rely but upon single Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at first, and yet descending upon others, come to be attested by many, whose Testimony though conjunct, yet in value is but single, because it relies upon the first single Relator, and so can have no greater authority, or certainty, then they derive from the single person; since the first Ages who were most competent to consign Tradition, yet did consign such Traditions as be of a nature wholy discrepant from the present Questions, and speak nothing at all or very imperfectly to our purposes; and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ages are no fit Witnesses of that which was not transmitted to them, because they could not know it at all, but by such transmission and prior consignation; since what at first was a Tradition, came afterwards to be written, and so ceased its being a Tradition; yet the credit of Traditions commenc'd upon the certainty and reputation of those truths first delivered by word, afterward consign'd by writing; since what was certainly Tradition Apostolicall, as many Rituals were, are rejected by the Church in severall Ages, and are gone out into a desuetude; and lastly, since, beside the no necessity of Traditions, there being abundantly enough in Scripture, there are many things called Traditions by the Fathers, which they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41208:82"/>
themselves either proved by no Authors, or by Apocryphall and spurious and Hereticall, the matter of Tradition will in very much be so uncertain, so false, so suspitious, so contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, so improbable, so unproved, that if a Question be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested and be offered to be proved only by Tradition, it will be very hard to impose such a proposition to the beliefe of all men with any imperiousnesse or resolved determination, but it will be necessary men should preserve the liberty of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and prophesying, and not part with it, upon a worse merchandise and exchange then <hi>Esau</hi> made for his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>

If no private man can hope for it, then truth is not necessary to be found, nor we are not oblig'd to search for it, or else we are sav'd by chance: But if private men can by vertue of a promise, upon certain conditions be assured of finding out sufficient truth, much more shall a Generall Councell. So that I consider thus: There are many promises pretended to belong to Generall Assemblies in the Church; But I know not any ground, nor any pretence, that they shall be absolutely assisted, without any condition on their own parts, and whether they will or no: Faith is a vertue as well as charity, and therefore consists in liberty and choyce, and hath nothing in it of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity: There is no Question but that they are obliged to proceed according to some rule; for they expect no assistance by way of <hi>Enthusiasme;</hi> if they should, I know no warrant for that, neither did any Generall Councell ever offer a Decree which they did not think sufficiently prov'd by Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Tradition, as appears in the Acts of the Councels; now then, if they be tyed to conditions, it is their duty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them; but whether it be certaine that they will observe them, that they will doe all their duty, that they will not sin
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41208:85"/>
even in this particular in the neglect of their duty, that's the consideration. So that if any man questions the Title and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Generall Councels, and whether or no great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises appertain to them, I suppose him to be much mistaken; but he also that thinks all of them have proceeded according to rule and reason, and that none of them were deceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause possibly they might have been truly directed, is a stranger to the History of the Church, and to the perpetuall instances and experiments of the faults and failings of humanity. It is a famous saying of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> that he had the foure first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels in esteem and veneration next to the foure Evangelists; I suppose it was because he did believe them to have proceeded according to Rule, and to have judged righteous judgement; but why had not he the same opinion of other Councels too which were celebrated before his death; for he lived after the fifth Generall? not because they had not the same Authority; for that which is warrant for one is warrant for all; but because he was not so confident that they did their duty nor proceeded so without interest as the first foure had done, and the following Councels did never get that reputation which all the Catholike Church acknowledged due to the first foure. And in the next Order were the three following generalls; for the Greeks and Latines did never joyntly acknowledge but seven gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls to have been authentick in any sense, because they were in no sense agreed that any more then seven had proceeded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly and done their duty: So that now the Question is not whether Generall Councels have a promise that the holy Ghost will assist them; For every private man hath that promise, that if he does his duty he shall be assisted sufficiently in order to that end to which he needs assistance; and therefore much more shall Generall Councels in order to that end for which they convene, and to which they need assistance, that is, in order to the conservation of the Faith, for the doctrinall rules of good life, and all that concerns the essentiall duty of a Christian, but not in deciding Questions to satisfie conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or curious or presumptuous spirits. But now can the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops so conven'd be factious, can they be abused with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or transported with interests, can they resist the holy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41208:86"/>
Ghost, can they extinguish the Spirit, can they stop their eares, and serve themselves upon the holy Spirit and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his assistances, and cease to serve him upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by captivating their understandings to his dictates, and their wills to his precepts? Is it necessary they should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any condition? is there any one duty for them to perform in these Assemblies, a duty which they have power to doe or not doe? If so, then they may faile of it, and not doe their duty: And if the assistance of the holy Spirit be conditionall, then we have no more assurance that they are assisted, then that they doe their duty and doe not sinne.</p>
                     <p>Now let us suppose what this duty is: Certainly, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; and all that come to the knowledge of the truth, must come to it by such meanes which are spirituall and holy dispositions, in order to a holy and spirituall end. They must be shod with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Gospel of peace, that is, they must have peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and docible dispositions, nothing with them that is violent, and resolute to encounter those gentle and sweet assistances: and the Rule they are to follow, is the Rule which the holy Spirit hath consign'd to the Catholike Church, that is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, either <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Optat. Milev. l. 5. adv. Parm. Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. in eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem. &amp; S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. in Psa. 21. Expos. 2.</note> intirely or at least for the greater part of the Rule: So that now if the Bishops bee factious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest with perswasions depending upon interest, it is certain they may judge amisse; and if they recede from the Rule, it is certain they doe judge amisse: And this I say upon their grounds who most advance the authority of Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: For if a Generall Councell may erre if a Pope confirm it not, then most certainly if in any thing it recede from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it does also erre; because that they are to expect the Popes confirmation they offer to prove from Scripture: now if the Popes confirmation be required by authority of Scripture, and that therefore the defaillance of it does evacuate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Councell, then also are the Councels Decrees invalid, if they recede from any other part of Scripture: So that Scripture is the Rule they are to follow, and a man would have thought it had been needlesse to have proved it, but that we are fallen into Ages in which no truth is certaine, no reason

concluding, nor is there any thing that can convince some men. For <hi>Stapleton</hi> with extreme boldnesse against the piety of Christendome, against the publike sense of the ancient <note place="margin">Relect. cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov. 4. q. 1. a. 3</note> Church, and the practise of all pious Assemblies of Bishops af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the Decrees of a Councell to be binding, <hi>etiamsi non confirmetur ne probabili testimonio Scripturarum;</hi> nay, though it be quite <hi>extra Scripturam,</hi> but all wise and good men have ever said that sense which S. <hi>Hilary</hi> expressed in these words, <hi>Quae extra Evangelium sunt non defendam;</hi> This was it which the good Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> propounded to the Fathers <note place="margin">I. 2. ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</note> met at <hi>Nice, libri Evangelici, oracula Apostolorum, &amp; veterum Prophetarum clarè nos instruunt quid sentiendum in Divinis,</hi>

Now then put case a Councell should recede from Scripture; whether or no were we bound to believe its Decrees? I only aske the Question: For it were hard to be bound to believe what to our understanding seems contrary to that which we know to be the Word of God: But if we may lawfully recede from the Councels Decrees, in case they be contrariant to Scripture, it is all that I require in this Question. For if they be tyed to a Rule, then they are to be examined and understood according to the Rule, and then we are to give our selves that liberty of judgement which is requisite to distinguish us from beasts, and to put us into a capacity of reasonable people, following reasonable guides. But
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41208:87"/>
how ever if it be certaine that the Councells are to follow Scripture, then if it be notorious that they doe recede from Scripture, we are sure we must obey God rather then men, and then we are well enough. For unlesse we are bound to shut our eyes, and not to look upon the Sunne, if we may give our selves liberty to believe what seemes most plaine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Authority of a Councell be so great a prejudice as to make us to doe violence to our understanding, so as not to disbelieve the Decree, because it seemes contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to believe it agrees with Scripture, though we know not how, therefore because the Councell hath decreed it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I say we be bound in duty to be so obediently blind, and sottish, we are sure that there are some Councels which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Generall, that have retired from the publike notorious words and sence of Scripture. For what wit of man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Decree of the thirteenth Session of the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> with Scripture, in which Session the halfe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was decreed, in defiance of Scripture, and with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to Christs institution. For in the Preface of the Decree, Christs institution and the practise of the Primitive Church is expressed, and then with a <hi>non obstante,</hi> Communion in one kind is establisht. Now then suppose the <hi>non obstante</hi> in the form of words relates to the Primitive practise; yet since Christs institution was taken notice of in the first words of the Decree, and the Decree made quite contrary to it, let the <hi>non obstante</hi> relate whither it will, the Decree (not to call it a defiance) is a plaine recession from the institution of Christ, and therefore the <hi>non obstante</hi> will referre to that without any sensible error; and indeed for all the excuses to the contrary, the Decree was not so discreetly fram'd but that in the very form of words, the defiance and the <hi>non obstante</hi> is too plainly relative to the first words.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41208:87"/>
are as contrary as light and darknesse. Is it possible for any man to contrive a way to make the Decree of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> commanding the publike Offices of the Church to be in Latine, friends with the fourteenth chapter of the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> It is not amisse to observe how the Hyperaspists of that Councell sweat to answer the Allegations of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the wisest of them doe it so extremly poore, that it proclaimes to all the world that the strongest man, that is, cannot eat Iron or swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Rock. Now then, would it not be an unspeakable Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny to all wise persons, (who as much hate to have their soules enslaved as their bodies imprisoned) to command them to believe that these Decrees are agreeable to the word of God? Upon whose understanding soever these are imposed, they may at the next Session reconcile them to a crime, and make any sinne sacred, or perswade him to believe propositions contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a Mathematicall demonstration. All the Arguments in the world that can be brought to prove the infallibility of Councels, can not make it so certain that they are infallible, as these two instances doe prove infallibly that these were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and if ever we may safely make use of our reason and consider whether Councels have erred or no, we cannot by any reason be more assured, that they have or have not, then we have in these particulars: so that either our reason is of no manner of use, in the discussion of this Question, and the thing it selfe is not at all to be disputed, or if it be, we are certain that these actually were deceived, and we must never hope for a clearer evidence in any dispute. And if these be, others might have been, if they did as these did, that is, depart from their Rule. And it was wisely said of <hi>Cusanus: Notandum est expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimento rerum universale Concilium posse deficere:</hi> The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience <note place="margin">L. 2. c. 14. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Cathol.</note> of it is notorious, that Councels have erred: And all the Arguments against experience are but plain sophistry.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I make no scruple to slight the Decrees of such Councels, wherein the proceedings were as prejudicate <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> and unreasonable, as in the Councell wherein <hi>Abailardus</hi> was condemned, where the presidents having pronounced <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> they at the lower end being awaked at the noise, heard the latter part of it, and concurred as farre as <hi>Mnamus</hi> went, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41208:88"/>
that was as good as <hi>Damnamus,</hi> for if they had been awake at the pronouncing the whole word, they would have given sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence accordingly. But by this meanes S. <hi>Bernard</hi> numbred the <note place="margin">Epist. Abailar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di. ad Heliss. conjugem.</note> major part of voices against his Adversary <hi>Abailardus:</hi> And as farre as these men did doe their duty, the duty of Priests and Judges, and wise men; so we may presume them to be assisted: But no further. But I am content this (because but a private Assembly) shall passe for no instance: But what shall we say of all the Arrian Councels celebrated with so great fancy, and such numerous Assemblies? we all say that they erred. And it will not be sufficient to say they were not lawfull Councels: For they were conven'd by that Authority which all the world knowes did at that time convocate Councels, and by which (as it is <note n="*" place="margin">Cusanus, l. 2. cap. 25, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> confessed and is notorious) the first eight Generalls did meet, that is by the Authority of the Emperour all were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and as many and more did come to them, then came to the most famous Councell of <hi>Nice:</hi> So that the Councels were lawfull, and if they did not proceed lawfully, and therefore did erre, this is to say that Councels are then not deceiv'd, when they doe their duty, when they judge impartially, when they decline interest, when they follow their Rule; but this sayes also that it is not infallibly certain that they will doe so; for these did not, and therefore the others may be deceiv'd as well as these were. But another thing is in the wind; for Councels not confirmed by the Pope, have no warrant that they shall not erre, and they not being confirmed, therefore faild. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Popes confirmation after the Decree or before? It cannot be supposed before; for there is nothing to be confirmed till the Decree be made, and the Article composed. But if it be after, then possibly the Popes Decree may be requisite in solemnity of Law, and to make the Authority popular, publike and humane; but the Decree is true or false before the Popes confirmation, and is not at all altered by the supervening Decree, which being <hi>postnate</hi> to the Decree, alters not what went before, <hi>Nunquam enim crescit ex postfacto praeteriti aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio,</hi> is the voyce both of Law and reason. So that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it divine, and necessary to be heartily believed. It may make it lawfull, not make it true, that is, it may possibly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41208:88"/>
by such meanes become a Law but not a truth. I speak now upon supposition the Popes confirmation were necessary, and requir'd to the making of conciliary and necessary sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But if it were, the case were very hard: For suppose a heresy should invade, and possesse the Chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> what remedy can the Church have in that case, if a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell be of no Authority without the Pope confirm it? will the Pope confirm a Councell against himselfe; will he condemn his own heresy? That the Pope may be a Heretick appears in the <note n="*" place="margin">Dist. 40. Can. si Papa.</note> Canon Law, which sayes he may for heresy be deposed, and therefore by a Councell which in this case hath plenary Authority without the Pope. And therefore in the Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> held under Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second, the Censure of the Sixth Synod against <hi>Honorius</hi> who was convict of heresy, is approved with this Appendix, that in this case the case of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, <hi>minores possint de majoribus judicare:</hi> And therefore if a Pope were above a Councell, yet when the Question is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heresy, the case is altered; the Pope may be judg'd by his inferiours, who in this case which is the maine case of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Superiours. And it is little better then impudence to pretend that all Councells were confirmed by the Pope, or that there is a necessity in respect of divine obligation, that any should be confirmed by him, more then by another of the Patriarchs. For the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it selfe one of those foure which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> did revere next to the foure Evangelists, is rejected by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who in his 53 Epistle to <hi>Anatolius,</hi> and in his 54 to <hi>Martian,</hi> and in his 55 to <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> accuses it of ambition and inconsiderate temerity, and therefore no fit Assembly for the habitation of the holy Spirit, and <hi>Gelasius</hi> in his Tome <hi>de vinculo Anathematis,</hi> affirms that the Councell is in part to be receiv'd, in part to be rejected, and compares it to hereticall books of a mixt matter, and proves his assertion by the place of S. <hi>Paul, Omnia probate, quod bonum est retinete.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayes the same; <hi>In Concilio Chalcedonensi quaedam sunt bona, quaedam mala, quaedam recipienda, quaedam rejicienda;</hi>

And it is an evidence that there is some deception, and notable errour either in the thing or in the manner of their proceeding, when the Decrees of a Councell shall have no authority from the Compilers, nor no strength from the reasonablenesse of the decision, but from the accidentall approbation of Posterity: And if Posterity had pleased, <hi>Origen</hi> had believed well and been an Orthodox per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And it was pretty sport to see that <hi>Papias</hi> was right for two Ages together, and wrong ever since; and just so it was in Councels, particularly in this of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that had a fate alterable according to the Age, and according to the Climate, which to my understanding is nothing else but an Argument that the businesse of infallibility is a later device, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd to serve such ends as cannot be justified by true and substantiall grounds, and that the Pope should confirm it as of necessity, is a fit cover for the same dish.</p>
                     <p>In the sixth Generall Councell, <hi>Honorius</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was condemned; did that Councell stay for the Popes Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> before they sent forth their Decree? Certainly they did not think it so needfull, as that they would have suspended or cassated the Decree, in case the Pope had then disavowed it: For besides the condemnation of Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> for heresy, the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 55<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canons of that Councell are expressely against the custome of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this particular is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41208:89"/>
in that new Question, whether the Pope be above a Councell. Now since the Contestation of this Question, there was never any free or lawfull Councell <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. postea de Concil. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessane. §. 6. N. 9.</note> that determined for the Pope, it is not likely any should, and is it likely that any Pope will confirm a Councell that does not? For the Councell of <hi>Basil</hi> is therefore condemn'd by the last Lateran which was an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the Popes own Palace, and the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> is of no value in this Question, and slighted in a just proportion, as that Article is disbelieved. But I will not much trouble the Question with a long consideration of this particular; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is senselesse and illiterate, against reason and experience, and already determin'd by S. <hi>Austin</hi> sufficiently as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <note place="margin">Epist. 162. ad Glorium.</note> 
                        <hi>Ecce putemus illos Episcopos qui Romae judicaverunt non bonos judices fuisse, Restabat adhuc plenarium Ecclesiae universae Concilium ubi etiam cum ipsis judicibus causa possit agitari, ut si male judicasse convicti essent, eorum sententiae solverentur.</hi> For since Popes may be parties, may be Simoniacks, Schismaticks, Hereticks, it is against reason that in their own causes, they should be judges, or that in any causes they should be superior to their judges. And as it is against reason, so is it against all experience too; for the Councell <hi>Sinvessanum</hi> (as it said) was conven'd to take Cognisance of Pope <hi>Marcellinus;</hi> and divers Councels were held at <hi>Rome</hi> to give judgement in the causes of <hi>Damasus, Sixtus</hi> the III, <hi>Symmachus,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> III and IV, as is to be seen in <hi>Platina,</hi> and the <hi>Tomes</hi> of the Councels. And it is no answer to this and the like allegations to say in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact and humane constitution, the Pope may be judg'd by a Councell, but in matters of Faith all the world must stand to the Popes determination and authoritative decision: For if the Pope can by any colour pretend to any thing, it is to a suprem Judicature in matters Ecclesiasticall, positive and of fact; and if he failes in this pretence, he will hardly hold up his head for any thing else; for the ancient Bishops deriv'd their Faith from the fountaine, and held that in the highest tenure, even from Christ their Head; but by reason of the Imperiall <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Concil.

although he was <hi>major singulis,</hi> yet he was <hi>minor universis:</hi> And this is no more then what was decreed of the eighth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Act. ult. can. 21.</note> Synod; which if it be sense, is pertinent to this Question; for Generall Councels are appointed to take Cognizance of Questions and differences about the Bishop of <hi>Rome, non tamen audacter in eum ferre sententiam:</hi> By <hi>audactèr,</hi> as is supposed, is meant <hi>praecipitanter</hi> hastily and unreasonably; but if to give sentence against him bee wholy forbidden, it is non-sense, for to what purpose is an Authority of taking Cognizance, if they have no power of giving sentence, unlesse it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serre it to a superiour Judge, which in this case cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed? for either the Pope himselfe is to judge his own cause af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their examination of him, or the Generall Councell is to judge him: So that although the Councell is by that Decree enjoyn'd to proceed modestly and warily, yet they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to sentence, or else the Decree is ridiculous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
                     <p>But to cleare all, I will instance in matters of Question and opinion: For not only some Councels have made their Decrees <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> without or against the Pope, but some Councels have had the Popes confirmation, and yet have not been the more legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or obligatory, but are known to be hereticall. For the Canons of the sixth Synod although some of them were made against the Popes, and the custome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Pope a while after did confirm the Councell, and yet the Canons are impious and hereticall, and so esteem'd by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her selfe. I instance in the second Canon which approves of that Synod of <hi>Carthage</hi> under <hi>Cyprian</hi> for rebaptization of Hereticks, and the 72 Canon that dissolves marriage between persons of differing perswasion in matters of Christian Religion; and yet these Canons were approved by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> I. who in his Epistle to <hi>Tharasius,</hi> which is in the second action of the seventh Synod, calls them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones divinè &amp; legalitèr praedicatos.</hi> And these Canons were used by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> I. in his Epistle <hi>ad Michaclem,</hi> and by <hi>Innocent</hi> III. <hi>c. à multis. extra. de aetat. ordinandorum.</hi> So that now (that wee may apply this) there are seven Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels which by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are condemn'd

Now that these Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are condemn'd, is a sufficient Argument that Councels may erre; and it is no answer to say they were not confirm'd by the Pope; for the Popes confirmation I have shewn not to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or if it were, yet even that also is an Argument that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels may become invalid, either by their own fault, or by some extrinsecall supervening accident, either of which evacuates their Authority; and whether all that is required to the legitimation of a Councell, was actually observ'd in any Councell, is so hard to determine, that no man can be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sure that such a Councell is authentick and sufficient probation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that is the second thing I shall observe, There are so many Questions concerning the efficient, the forme, the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> matter of Generall Councells, and their manner of proceeding, and their finall sanction, that after a Question is determin'd by a Conciliary Assembly, there are perhaps twenty more Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions to be disputed before we can with confidence either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Councell upon its meere Authority, or obtrude it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others. And upon this ground, how easy it is to elude the pressure of an Argument drawn from the Authority of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, is very remarkable in the Question about the Popes or the Councels Superiority, which Question although it be defin'd for the Councell against the Pope by five Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> of <hi>Basil,</hi> of <hi>Pisa,</hi> and one of the <hi>Lateran's,</hi> yet the Jesuites to this day, account this Question <hi>pro non definitâ,</hi> and have rare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for their escape; as first, It is true, a Councell is above a Pope, in case there be no Pope, or he uncertain; which is <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>'s answer, never considering whether he spake sense or no,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41208:91"/>
nor yet remembring that the Councell of <hi>Basil</hi> deposed <hi>Eugenius</hi> who was a true Pope and so acknowledg'd. Secondly, sometimes the Pope did not confirm these Councels, that's their Answer: (And although it was an exception that the Fathers never thought of, when they were pressed with the Authority of the Councell of <hi>Ariminum</hi> or <hi>Syrmium,</hi> or any other <hi>Arrian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;) yet the Councell of <hi>Basil</hi> was conven'd by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V. then, in its sixteenth Session, declar'd by <hi>Eugenius</hi> the IV. to be lawfully continued and confirmed expresly in some of its Decrees by Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and so stood till it was at last rejected by <hi>Leo</hi> X. very many years after; but that came too late, and with too visible an interest; and this Councell did decree <hi>fide Catholicâ tenendum Concilium esse supra Papam:</hi> But if one Pope confirms it, and another rejects it, as it happened in this case and in many more, does it not destroy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of the Authority? and we see it by this instance, that it so serves the turns of men, that it is good in some cases, that is, when it makes for them, and invalid when it makes against them. Thirdly, but it is a little more ridiculous in the case of the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> whose Decrees were confirm'd by <hi>Martin</hi> V. But that this may be no Argument against them, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells you he only confirm'd those things <hi>quae facta fuerant Conciliaritèr, re diligenter examinatâ,</hi> of which there being no mark, nor any certain Rule to judge it, it is a device that may evacuate any thing we have a mind to, it was not done <hi>Conciliaritèr,</hi> that is, not according to our mind; for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliaritèr</hi> is a fine new nothing, that may signifie what you please. Fourthly, but other devices yet more pretty they have: As, Whether the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> was a Generall Councell or no, they know not, (no nor will not know) which is a wise and plaine reservation of their own advantages, to make it Generall or not Generall, as shall serve their turns. Fifthly, as for the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> they are not sure, whether it hath defin'd the Question <hi>satis apertè; apertè</hi> they will grant, if you will allow them not <hi>satis apertè.</hi> Sixthly and lastly, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Pisa</hi> is <hi>ne<expan>

And it is strange that the Decrees of Councels should be esteem'd authentick and infallible, and yet it is not infallibly certain, that the Councels themselves are infallible, because the beliefe of the Councels infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not prov'd to us by any medium, but such as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us.</p>

But for this allegation, we cannot want instances; The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> allowes picturing of God the Father; The Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> altogether disallowes it; The same <hi>Nicene</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sess. 25.</note> Councell, which was the seventh Generall, allows of picturing Christ in the form of a Lamb; But the sixth Synod by no <note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> meanes will endure it, as <hi>Caranza</hi> affirms: The Councell of <hi>Neocaesarea</hi> confirm'd by <hi>Leo</hi> IV, <hi>dist.</hi> 20. <hi>de libellis,</hi> and approv'd <note place="margin">Can. 82.</note> by the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell as it is said in the seventh Session of the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> forbids second Marriages, and imposes Penances on them that are married the second time, forbidding Priests to be present at such Marriage Feasts: Besides, that this is expresly against the Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is also against
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41208:92"/>
the Doctine of the Councell of <hi>Laodicea</hi> which took off such <note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> Penances, and pronounced second Marriages to be free and lawfull: Nothing is more discrepant then the third Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> about assignation of the Canon of Scripture, and yet the sixth Generall Synod ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves both: And I would faine know if all Generall Councels are of the same mind with the Fathers of the Councell of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> who reckon into the Canon five Books of <hi>Solomon.</hi> I am sure S. <hi>Austin</hi> reckoned but three, and I think all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">L. 17. de cul.

And if we look into the title of the Law <hi>de Conciliis,</hi> called <hi>Concordantia discordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum,</hi> we shall find instances enough to confirm that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of some Councels are contradictory to others, and that no wit can reconcile them: And whether they did or no, that they might disagree, and former Councels be corrected by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was the beliefe of the Doctors in those Ages in which the best and most famous Councels were conven'd, as appears in that famous saying of S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaking concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing of Hereticks; and how much the <hi>Africans</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in that Question, he answers the Allegation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Letters, and those Nationall Councels which confirmed S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> opinion by saying that they were no finall determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

And from hence hath risen a Question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be received the former or the later Councels, in case they contradict each other. The former are nearer the fountaines Apostolicall, the later are of greater consideration; The first, have more Authority, the later more reason; The first are more venerable, the later more inquisitive and seeing.

And now what rule shall we have to determine out beliefes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Authority, or Reason the Reason and the Authority both of them not being the highest in their kinde, both of them being repudiable, and at most but probable? And here it is that this great uncertainty is such as not to determine any body, but fit to serve every body; and it is sport to see that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will by all meanes have the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> preferr'd before the Councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> because it is later, and <note place="margin">L. 2. de Conc. c. 8. § respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo in primis.</note> yet he preferres the second <hi>Nicene</hi>

it by such an emendation as is a plain contradiction to the sense, and that so un-clerk-like, <hi>viz.</hi> by putting in two words and leaving out one, which whether it may be allowed them by any licence lesse then Poeticall let Criticks judge.

                        <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and that he suspected the same concerning the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councell: And in the fifth Synod there was a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prevarication, for there were false Epistles of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Menna</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> inserted, and so they passed for authentick till they were discovered in the sixth Generall Synod, Actions the 12. and 14: And not only false Decrees and Actions may creep into the Codes of Councels; but sometimes the authority of a learned man may abuse the Church with pretended Decrees, of which there is no Copy or shadow in the Code it selfe: And thus <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> sayes that the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was reckoned in the Canon <note place="margin">Comment. in Hebr.</note> by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, no shadow of which appears in those Copies we now have of it; and this pretence and the reputation of the man prevail'd so farre with <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> the learned Bishop of <hi>Canaries,</hi> that he believ'd it upon this ground, <hi>Vir sanctus rem adeo gravem non astrueret, nisi compertum habuisset;</hi> and there are many things which have prevail'd upon lesse reason and a more slight Authority.

Now if one Councell be corrupted, we see by the instance of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> that another may be suspected and so all; because he found the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> corrupted, he suspected also the <hi>Ephesine,</hi> and another might have suspected more, for the <hi>Nicene</hi> was tampered fouly with, and so three of the foure Generals were fullied and made suspicious, and therefore we could not be secure of any; If false Acts be inserted in one Councell, who can trust the actions of any, unlesse he had the keeping the Records himselfe, or durst swear for the Register: And if a very learned man (as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was,) did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilfully deceive us, or was himselfe ignorantly abused in Allegation of a Canon which was not, it is but a very fallible Topick at the best, and the most holy man that is, may be abused himselfe, and the wisest may deceive others.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And lastly, To all this and to the former instances, by way of Corollary, I adde some more particulars in which it is notorious <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> that Councels Generall, and Nationall, that is, such as were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generall by Originall, or by adoption into the Canon of the Catholike Church did erre, and were actually deceived. The first Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> admits to the Communion him that hath a Concubine, so he have no wife besides, and this Councell is approved by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in the 92 Epistle to <hi>Rusticus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Narbona: Gratian</hi> sayes that the Councell meanes by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, a wife married <hi>sine dote &amp; solennitate;</hi> but this is <note place="margin">Dist. 34. can. omnibus.</note> dawbing with untemper'd mortar. For though it was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome amongst the Jewes to distinguish Wives from their Concubines, by Dowry and legall Solennities, yet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian distinguished them no otherwise, then as lawfull and unlawfull, then as Chastity and Fornication: And besides, if by a Concubine is meant a lawfull wife without a Dowry, to what purpose should the Councell make a Law that such a one might be admitted to the Communion? for I suppose it was never thought to be a Law of Christianity, that a man should have a Portion with his Wife, nor he that married a poore Virgin should deserve to be Excommunicate. So that <hi>Gratian</hi> and his Followers are prest so with this Canon, that to avoid the impiety of it, they expound it to a signification without sense or purpose. But the businesse then was, that Adultery
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41208:94"/>
was so publike and notorious a practise that the Councell did chuse rather to endure simple Fornication, that by such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of a lesse, they might slacken the publike custome of a greater, just as at <hi>Rome</hi> they permit Stewes to prevent unnaturall sinnes; But that by a publike sanction Fornicators, habitually and notoriously such, should be admitted to the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was an act of Priests, so unfit for Priests, that no excuse can make it white or cleane. The Councell of <hi>Wormes</hi> does au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize a superstitious custome at that time too much used, of <note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> discovering stoln goods by the holy Sacrament, which <note n="a" place="margin">Part. 3. q 80. a. 6. ad 3 m.</note> 
                        <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> justly condemns for Superstition. The <note n="b" place="margin">Can. 72.</note> sixth Synod se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates persons lawfully married upon an accusation and crime of heresy: The Roman Councell under <note n="c" place="margin">Can ego Berengar. de consecrat. dist. 2.</note> Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> II. defin'd that not only the Sacrament of Christs body, but the very body it selfe of our blessed Saviour is handled and broke by the hands of the Priest, and chewed by the teeth of the Communicants, which is a manifest errour derogatory from the truth of Christs beatificall Resurrection, and glorification in the Heavens, and disavowed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that answers all the Arguments in the world, whither it be possible or not possible, would faine make the <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 8. de Concil.</note> matter faire, and the Decree tolerable, for sayes he, the Decree meanes that the body is broken not in it selfe but in the sign, and yet the Decree sayes that not only the Sacrament (which if any thing be, is certainly the sign) but the very body it selfe is broken and champed with hands and teeth respectively; which indeed was nothing but a plaine over-acting the Article in contradiction to <hi>Berengarius.</hi> And the answer of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is not sense; for he denies that the body it selfe is broken in it selfe (that was the errour we charg'd upon the Roman Synod) and the sign abstracting from the body is not broken, (for that was the opinion that Councell condemn'd in <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius)</hi> but sayes <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the body in the sign: What's that? for neither the sign, nor the body, nor both together are broken: For if either of them distinctly, they either rush upon the errour which the Roman Synod condemn'd in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius,</hi> or upon that which they would fain excuse in Pope <hi>Nicholas;</hi> but if both are broken then 'tis true to affirm
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41208:94"/>
it of either, and then the Councell is blasphemous in saying that Christ's glorified body is passible and frangible by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manducation: So that it is and it is not, it is not this way, and yet it is no way else, but it is some way, and they know not how, and the Councell spoke blasphemy, but it must be made innocent; and therefore, it was requisite a cloud of a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be raised, that the unwary Reader might be amused, and the Decree scape untoucht; but the truth is, they that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to justifie all that other men say, must be more subtle then they that said it, and must use such distinctions which possibly the first Authors did not understand. But I will multiply no more instances, for what instance soever I shall bring, some or other will be answering it, which thing is so farre from satisfying me in the particulars, that it increases the difficulty in the generall, and satisfies me in my first beliefe: For <note n="*" place="margin">Illa demùm cis videntur edicta &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia quae in rem suam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt; reliqua non pluris aestimant quam conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mulier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularum in textrinâ vel thermis. <hi>Ludo.

And what are we the nearer for a Decree, if any Sophister shall think his elusion enough to contest against the Authority of a Councell? yet this they doe, that pretend highest for their Authority, which consideration or some like it might possibly make <hi>Gratian</hi> preferre S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s single <note place="margin">36. q. 2. c. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit.</note> Testimony before a whole Councell, because hee had Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his side; which sayes, that the Authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels is not <gap reason="foreign">

And where we find such Councels, he that will not with all veneration believe their Decrees, and receive their sanctions, understands not that great duty he owes to them who have the care of our soules, whose <hi>faith we are bound to follow</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> that is so long as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ, and certainly many Councels have done so: But <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7.</note> this was then when the publike interest of Christendome was better conserv'd in determining a true Article, then in finding a discreet temper, or a wise expedient to satisfie disagreeing persons; (As the Fathers at <hi>Trent</hi> did, and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> did at <hi>Sendomir</hi> in <hi>Polonia;</hi> and the <hi>Sublapsarians</hi> and <hi>Supralapsarians</hi> did at <hi>Dort:)</hi> It was in Ages when the summe of Religion did not consist in maintaining the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezza</hi> of the Papacy; where there was no order of men with a fourth Vow upon them to advance S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire; when there was no man, nor any company of men, that esteem'd themselves infallible, and therefore they searched for truth as if they meant to find it, and would believe it if they could see it prov'd, not resolv'd to prove it because they had upon chance or interest believ'd it; then they had rather have spoken a truth, then upheld their reputation, but only in order to truth. This was done sometimes, and when it was done, God's Spirit never fail'd them, but gave them such assistances as were sufficient to that good end for which they were Assembled, and did implore his aid: And therefore it is that the foure generall Councels so called by way of eminency, have gained so great a reputation above all others, not because they had a better promise, or more speciall assistances, but because they proceeded better according to the Rule, with lesse

faction, without ambition and temporall ends.</p>
                     <p>And yet those very Assemblies of Bishops had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by their Decrees to make a Divine Faith, or to constitute <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> new objects of necessary Credence; they made nothing true that was not so before, and therefore they are to be apprehended in the nature of excellent Guides, and whose Decrees are most certainly to determine all those who have no Argument to the contrary of greater force and efficacy then the Authority or reasons of the Councell. And there is a duty owing to every Parish Priest, and to every Dioecesan Bishop; these are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over us and to answer for our soules, and are therefore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to guide us, as reasonable Creatures are to be guided, that is, by reason and discourse: For in things of judgement and understanding, they are but in forme next above Beasts, that are to be ruled by the imperiousnesse and absolutenesse of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unlesse the Authority be Divine, that is, infallible. Now then in a juster height, but still in its true proportion, Assemblies of Bishops are to guide us with a higher Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, because in reason it is supposed they will doe it better, with more Argument and certainty, and with Decrees, which have the advantage by being the results of many discourses of very wise and good men: But that the Authority of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels, was never esteem'd absolute, infallible and unlimited, appears in this, that before they were obliging, it was necessary that each particular Church respectively should accept them, <hi>Concurrente universali totius Ecclesiae consensu, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>in declaratione veritatum quae credendae sunt &amp;c.</hi> That's the way of making the Deerees of Councels become authentik, and be turn'd into a Law as <hi>Gerson</hi> observes; and till they did, their Decrees were but a dead letter (and therefore it is that these later Popes have so labour'd, that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> should be received in <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Carolus Molineus</hi> a great Lawyer, and of the Roman Communion disputed <note n="*" place="margin">So did the third Estate of <hi>France</hi> in the Convention of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states under <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend against it.</note> against the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) and this is a known condition in the Canon Law, but it proves plainly that the Decrees of Councels have their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the voluntary submission of the particular Churches, not from the prime sanction and constitution of the Councell. And there is great reason it should; for as the representative
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41208:96"/>
body of the Church derives all power from the diffusive body which is represented, so it resolves into it, and though it may have all the legall power, yet it hath not all the naturall; for more able men may be unsent, then sent; and they who are sent may be wrought upon by stratagem, which cannot happen to the whole diffusive Church; it is therefore most fit that since the legall power, that is, the externall was passed over to the body representative, yet the efficacy of it, and the internall should so still remaine in the diffusive, as to have power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether their representatives did their duty yea or no, and so to proceed accordingly: For unlesse it be in matters of justice, in which the interest of a third person is concern'd, no man will or can be supposed to passe away all power from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of doing himselfe right, in matters personall, proper, and of so high concernment: It is most unnaturall and unreasonable. But besides, that they are excellent instruments of peace, the best humane Judicatories in the world, rare Sermons for the determining a point in Controversy, and the greatest probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from humane Authority, besides these advantages (I say) I know nothing greater that generall Councels can pretend to with reason and Argument sufficient to satisfie any wise man: And as there was never any Councell so generall, but it might have been more generall; for in respect of the whole Church, even <hi>Nice</hi> it selfe was but a small Assembly; so there is no Decree so well constituted, but it may be prov'd by an Argument higher then the Authority of the Councell: And therefore generall Councels, and Nationall, and Provinciall, and Dioecesan in their severall degrees, are excellent Guides for the Prophets and directions and instructions for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesyings, but not of weight and Authority to restraine their Liberty so wholy, but that they may dissent when they see a reason strong enough so to perswade them, as to be willing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confidence of that reason and their own sincerity, to answer to God for such their modesty, and peaceable, but (as they believe) their necessary disagreeing.</p>

But however, there are many that hope to make it good, that the Pope is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall and the infallible Doctor, that he breathes Decrees as Oracles, that to dissent from any of his Cathedrall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is absolute heresy, the Rule of Faith being nothing else but consormity to the Chaire of <hi>Peter.</hi> So that here we have met a restraint of Prophecy indeed; but yet to make amends, I hope we shall have an infallible Guide, and when a man is in Heaven, he will never complaine that his choyce is taken from him, and that he is confin'd to love and to admire, since his love and his admiration is fixt, upon that which makes him happy, even upon God himselfe.

so, and no choice left us for our understandings to discover or our wills to chuse, because though we be limited, yet we are pointed out where we ought to rest, we are confin'd to our Center, and there where our understandings will be satisfied, and therefore will be quiet, and where after all our strivings, studies and endeavours we desire to come, that is, to truth, for there we are secur'd to find it, because we have a Guide that is infallible: If this prove true, we are well enough.

And if not, then for all this Argument, the Popes may deny Christ as well as their cheife and Decessor <hi>Peter.</hi> But it would not be forgotten how the Roman Doctors will by no meanes allow that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was then the chiefe Bishop or Pope, when he denyed his Master. But then much lesse was he chosen chiefe Bishop, when the prayer was made for him, because the prayer was made before his fall; that is, before that time in which it is confessed, he was not as yet made Pope: And how then the whole Succession of the Papacy should be intitled to it, passes the length of my hand to span. But then also if it be supposed and allowed, that these words shall intaile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility upon the Chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> why shall not also all the Apostolicall Sees bee infallible as well as <hi>Rome?</hi> why shall not <hi>Constaentinople</hi> or <hi>Byzantium</hi> where S. <hi>Andrew</hi> sate? why shall not <hi>Ephesus</hi> where S. <hi>John</hi> sate? or <hi>Jerusalem</hi> where S. <hi>James</hi> sate? for Christ prayed for them all, <hi>ut Pater sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caret eos sua veritate,</hi> Joh. 17.</p>

For if S. <hi>Peter</hi> was chiefe of the Apostles, and Head of the Church, he might faire enough be the representative of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41208:98"/>
whole Colledge, and receive it in their right as well as his own; which also is certain that it was so, for the same promise of binding and loosing, (which certainly was all that the keyes were given for) was made afterward to all the Apostles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and the power of remitting and retaining which in reason and according to the stile of the Church is the same thing in other words, was actually given to all the Apostles, and unlesse that was the performing the first and second promise, we find it not recorded in Scripture how or when or whether yet or no, the promise be performed: That promise I say which did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to <hi>Peter</hi> principally and by origination, and to the rest by Communication, society and adherence, but that promise which was made to <hi>Peter</hi> first, but not for himselfe, but for all the Colledge and for all their Successors, and then made the second time to them all, without representation but in diffusion, and perform'd to all alike in presence except S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> And if he went to S. <hi>Peter</hi> to derive it from him, I know not; I find no record for that, but that Christ convey'd the promise to him by the same Commission, the Church yet never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor had she any reason. But this matter is too notorious: I say no more to it, but repeat the words and Argument of S. <hi>Austin, Si hoc Petro tantum dictum est, non facit hoc Ecclesia:</hi> If the Keyes were only given and so promised to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that <note place="margin">Tra. 50. in Ioann.</note> the Church hath not the Keyes, then the Church can neither bind nor loose, remit nor retaine, which God forbid; if any man should endevour to answer this Argument, I leave him and S. <hi>Austin</hi> to contest it.</p>

So did all those Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> that in that troublesome and unprofitable Question of Easter, being unsatisfied in the supputation of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the definitions of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Bishops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> did yet require and intreat S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> to tell them his opinion, as he himselfe witnesses; If <hi>pasce oves</hi> belongs only to the Pope by primary title, in these <note place="margin">L. 10.

And although all these witnesses concurring cannot make a proposition to be true, yet they are sufficient witnesses, that it was not the Universall beliefe of Christendome that the Church was built upon S. <hi>Peters</hi> person. Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> hath a fine fancy to elude this variety of Exposition, and the consequents of it; For (saith he) these Expositions are not contrary or exclusive of each other, but inclusive and consequent to each other: For the Church is founded causally upon the confession of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> formally upon the ministry of his person, and this was a reward or a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the former: So that these Expositions are both true, but they are conjoyn'd as mediate and immediate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and collaterall, literall and morall, originall and perpetuall, accessory and temporall, the one consign'd at the beginning, the other introduc'd upon occasion: For before the spring of the <hi>Arrian</hi> heresy, the Fathers expounded these words of the person of <hi>Peter;</hi> but after the <hi>Arrians</hi> troubled them, the Fathers finding great Authority, and <hi>Energy</hi> in this confession
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41208:100"/>
of <hi>Peter</hi> for the establishment of the naturall siliation of the Son of God, to advance the reputation of these words and the force of the Argument, gave themselves lience to expound these words to the present advantage, and to make the confession of <hi>Peter</hi> to be the foundation of the Church, that if the <hi>Arrians</hi> should encounter this Authority, they might with more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their persons declaime against their cause by saying they overthrew the foundation of the Church. Besides that this answer does much dishonour the reputation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers integrity, and makes their interpretations lesse credible as being made not of knowledge or reason but of necessity and to serve a present turn, it is also false: For <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. ad Philadelph. In c. 16. Mat. tract. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Ignatius</hi> expounds it in a spirituall sense, which also the Liturgy attibuted to S. <hi>James</hi> cals <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: And <hi>Origen</hi> expounds it mystically to a third purpose, but exclusively to this: And all these were before the Arrian Controversy. But if it be lawfull to make such unproved observations, it would have been to better purpose, and more reason to have observed it thus: The Fathers so long as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> kept himselfe to the limits prescrib'd him by Christ, and indulged to him by the Constitution or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Church, were unwary and apt to expound this place of the person of <hi>Peter;</hi> but when the Church began to enlarge her phylacteries by the favour of Princes, and the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of a prosperous fortune, and the Pope by the advantage of the Imperiall Seat, and other accidents began to invade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other Bishops and Patriarchs, then that he might have no colour from Scripture for such new pretensions, they did most generally turn the stream of their expositions from the person to the confession of <hi>Peter,</hi> and declar'd that to be the foundation of the Church. And thus I have required fancy with fancy; but for the maine point, that these two Expositions are inclusiue of each other, I find no warrant; for though they may consist together well enough, if Christ had so intended them; yet unlesse it could be shown by some circumstance of the Text, or some other extrinsecall Argument that they must be so, and that both senses were actually intended. it is but <hi>gratis dictum</hi> and a begging of the Question, to say that they are so, and the fancy so new, that when S. <hi>Austin</hi> had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41208:100"/>
expounded this place of the person of <hi>Peter,</hi> he reviewes it againe, and in his Retractations leaves every man to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which to take; as having nothing certaine in this Article: which had been altogether needlesse if he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them to be inclusively in each other, neither of them had need to have beene retracted, both were alike true, both of them might have been believed: But I said the fancy was new, and I had reason; for it was so unknown till yesterday, that even the late Writers of his own side, expound the words of the confession of S. <hi>Peter</hi> exclusively to his person or any thing else, as is to be seen in <note n="a" place="margin">Desens. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis part. 2. c. 28.</note>

But first Apostles secondarily Prophets, &amp;c. And whatsoever is first, either is before all things else, or at least nothing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: So that at least S. <hi>Peter</hi> is not before all the rest of the Apostles, which also S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly averres, <hi>I am in nothing inferiour to the very chiefest of the Apostles,</hi> no not in the very being a Rock and a foundation; and it was of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> said in particular it was <hi>columna &amp; firmamentum veritatis,</hi> that Church was, not excluding others,

For how will it appear that these promises and Commissions did relate to him as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bishop, and not as a publike Apostle? Since this later is so much the more likely, because the great pretence of all seemes in reason more proportionable to the founding of a Church, then its continuance: And yet if they did relate to him as a particular Bishop (which yet is a further degree of improbability, removed further from certainty) yet why shall S. <hi>Clement</hi> or <hi>Linus</hi> rather succeed in this great office of head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship then S. <hi>Iohn</hi> or any of the Apostles that survived <hi>Peter:</hi> It is no way likely a private person should skip over the head of an Apostle; or why shall his Successors at <hi>Rome</hi> more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of it then his Successors at <hi>Antioch,</hi> since that he was at <hi>Antioch</hi> and preached there, we have a Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but that he did so at <hi>Rome</hi> at most we have but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; and if it be replyed that because he dyed at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was Argument enough that there his Successors were to inherit his priviledge, this besides that at most it is but one little degree of probability, and so not of strength sufficient to support an Article of faith: it makes that the great Divine Right of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Apostolicall presidency was so contingent and fallible as to depend upon the decree of <hi>Nero;</hi> and if he had sent him to <hi>Antioch</hi> there to have suffered Martyrdome, the Bishops of that Town had been heads of the Catholike Church.

And yet again another degree of uncertainty is, to whom the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> doe succeed: For S. <hi>Paul</hi> was as much Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> was; there he presided, there he preach'd, and he it was that was the Doctor of the Uncircumcision and of the Gentiles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> of the Circumcision, and of the Jewes only; and therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Jewes at <hi>Rome,</hi> might with better reason claim the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> then the Romans and the Churches in her Communion, who doe not derive from Jewish Parents.</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> communicated to his Successors, yet of what value will the consequent be? what prerogative is entail'd upon the Chaire of <hi>Rome?</hi> For that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Ministeriall Head of the Church, is the most that is desir'd to be prov'd by those and all other words brought for the same purposes, and interests of that Sea: Now let the Ministerall Head have what Dignity can be imagined, let him be the first (and in all Communities that are regular, and orderly there must be something that is first, upon certain occasions where an equall power cannot be exercised, and made pompous or ceremoniall:) But will this Ministeriall Headship inferre an infallibility? will it inferre more then the Headship of the Jewish Synagogue, where clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the High Priest was supreme in many senses, yet in no sense
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41208:102"/>
infallible? will it inferre more to us, then it did amongst the Apostles? amongst whom if for orders sake, S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the first, yet he had no compulsory power over the Apostles; there was no such thing spoke of, nor any such thing put in practise. And that the other Apostles were by a personall priviledge as infallible as himselfe, is no reason to hinder the exercise of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction or any compulsory power over them; for though in Faith they were infallible, yet in manners and matter of fact as likely to erre as S. <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe was, and certainly there might have something hapned in the whole Colledge, that might have been a Record of his Authority, by transmitting an example of the exercise of some Judiciall power over some one of them: If he had but withstood any of them to their faces as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did him, it had been more then yet is said in his behalfe. Will the Ministeriall Headship inferre any more then when the Church in a Community or a publike capacity, should doe any Act of Ministery Ecelesiasticall, he shall be first in Order? Suppose this to be a dignity to preside in Councels, which yet was not alwayes granted him; Suppose it to be a power of taking cognisance of the Major Causes of Bishops when Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels cannot be called; Suppose it a double voyce or the last decisive, or the negative in the causes exteriour; Suppose it to be what you will of dignity or externall regiment, which when all Churches were united in Communion, and neither the interest of States, nor the engagement of opinions had made disunion, might better have been acted then now it can; yet this will fall infinitely short of a power to determine Controversies infallibly, and to prescribe to all mens faith and consciences. A Ministeriall Headship or the prime Minister cannot in any capacity become the foundation of the Church to any such purpose. And therefore men are causlessely amused with such premises, and are afraid of such Conclusions which will never follow from the admission of any sense of these words that can with any probability be pretended.</p>

erred, and greater certainty of demonstration, then these places can be that they are infallible, as will appear by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and perpetuall experiment of their being deceived, of which there is no Question, but of the sense of these places there is: And indeed, if I had as clear Scripture for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, as I have against their halfe Communion, against their Service in an unknown tongue, worshipping of Images, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Articles, I would make no scruple of believing, but limit and conform my understanding to all their Dictates, and believe it reasonable all Prophecying should be restrain'd: But till then, I have leave to discourse, and to use my reason; And to my reason, it seemes not likely that neither Christ nor any of his Apostles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, not S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> should speak the least word or tittle of the infallibility of their Bishops, for it was certainly as convenient to tell us of a remedy, as to foretell that certainly there must needs be heresies, and need of a remedy. And it had been a certain determination of the Question, if when so rare an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was ministred in the Question about Circumcision that they should have sent to <hi>Peter,</hi> who for his infallibility in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and his power of Headship would not only with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son enough as being infallibly assisted, but also for his Authority have best determin'd the Question, if at least the first Christians had known so profitable and so excellent a secret; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have but little Record, that the first Councell at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did much observe the solennities of Law, and the forms of Conciliary proceedings, and the Ceremonials; yet so much of it as is recorded, is against them, S. <hi>James</hi> and not S. <hi>Peter</hi> gave the finall sentence, and although S. <hi>Peter</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the Question <hi>pro libertate,</hi> yet S. <hi>James</hi> made the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and the Assumentum too, and gave sentence they should abstaine from some things there mentioned, which by way of temper he judg'd most expedient: And so it passed.

                        </gap>, by what meanes shall we infallibly find the sense of them? The Popes interpretation though in all other cases it might be pretended, in this cannot; for it is the thing in Question, and therefore cannot determine for it selfe; either therefore we have also another infallible guide besides the Pope, and so we have two Foundations and two Heads (for this as well as the other upon the same reason) or else (which is indeed the truth) there is no infallible way to be infallibly assured that the Pope is infallible. Now it being against the common condition of men, above the pretences of all other Governours Ecclesiasticall, against the Analogy of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the deportment of the other Apostles, against the Oeconomy of the Church, and S. <hi>Peters</hi> own entertainment, the presumption lies against him, and these places, are to be left to their prime intentions and not put upon the rack, to force them to confesse what they never thought.</p>
                     <p>But now for Antiquity, if that be deposed in this Question, there are so many circumstances to be considered to reconcile <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> their words and their actions, that the processe is more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, then the Argument can be concluding, or the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable: But I shall a little consider it, so farre at least as to shew either Antiquity said no such thing as is pretended, or if they did, it is but little considerable, because they did not believe themselves; their practise was the greatest evidence in the world against the pretence of their words. But I am much cased of a long disquisition in this particular (for I love not to prove a Question by Arguments whose Authority is in it selfe as fallible, and by circumstances made as uncertain as the Question) by the saying of <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> that before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell every men liv'd to himselfe, and small respect was had to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which practise could not well consist with the Doctrine of their Bishops infallibility, and by consequence supreme judgement and last resolution in matters of Faith; but especially by the insinuation and consequent <note place="margin">De Rom. Pont. l, 4. c. 2. § se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> acknowledgement of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that for 1000 years together the Fathers knew not of the Doctrine of the Popes infallibility,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41208:103"/>
for <hi>Nilus, Gerson, Alemain,</hi> the Divines of <hi>Paris, Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> VI, persons who liv'd 1400 after Christ, affirm, that infallibility is not seated in the Popes person, that he may erre and sometimes actually hath, which is a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that the Church knew no such Doctrine as this; there had been no Decree nor Tradition, nor generall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fathers, or of any age before them; and therefore this opinion which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would faine blast if he could, yet in his Conclusion he sayes it is not <hi>propriè haeretica.</hi> A device, and an expression of his own without sense or precedent. But if the Fathers had spoken of it and believed it, why may not a disagreeing person as well reject their Authority when it is in behalf of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they of <hi>Rome</hi> without scruple cast them off when they speak against it? For as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> being pressed with the Authority of <hi>Nilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> and other Fathers, he sayes that the Pope acknowledges no Fathers but they are all his children, and therefore they cannot depose against him; and if that be true, why shall we take their Testimonies for him? for if Sonnes depose in their Fathers behalfe, it is twenty to one, but the adverse party will be cast, and therefore at the best it is but <hi>suspectum Testimonium.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this discourse signifies nothing, but a perpetuall uncertainty in such topicks, and that where a violent prejudice, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning interest is engag'd, men by not regarding what any man sayes, proclaim to all the world that nothing is certain, but Divine Authority.</p>
                     <p>But I will not take advantage of what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayes, nor what <hi>Stapleton,</hi> or any one of them all say, for that will bee <note place="margin">

Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the sixth Generall Synod, and his Epistles burnt, and in the seventh action of the eigth Synod, the Acts of the Romane Councell under <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second are recited, in which it is said that <hi>Honorius</hi> was justly Anathematiz'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was convict of heresy. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayes it is probable that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and the Roman Councell were deceived with false Copies of the sixth Synod, and that <hi>Honorius</hi> was no Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. To this I say, that although the Roman Synod and the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41208:106"/>
eighth generall Synod, and Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> altogether are better witnesses for the thing then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conjecture is against it, yet if we allow his conjecture wee shall lose nothing in the whole, for either the Pope is no infallible Doctor, but may be a Heretick as <hi>Honorius</hi> was, or else a Councell is to us no infallible determiner; I say, as to us, for if <hi>Adrian</hi> and the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Councell &amp; the eighth Generall were all cozen'd with false Copies of the sixth Synod, which was so little a while before them, and whose acts were transacted &amp; kept in the Theatre and Records of the Catholike Church; he is a bold man that will be confident that he hath true Copies now. So that let which they please stand or fall, let the Pope be a Heretick or the Councels be deceived and palpably abused, (for the other, we will dispute it upon other instances and arguments when we shall know which part they will choose) in the meane time we shall get in the generall what we loose in the particular. This only, this device of saying the Copies of the Councels were false, was the stratagem of <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> 900 years after the thing was <note place="margin">Vid. diatrib. de act. 6. &amp; 7<hi rend="sup">ae</hi>. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. praefatione ad Lectorem &amp; Dominicum Bannes 22<hi rend="sup">ae</hi>. q. 1. a. 10. dub. 2.</note> done, of which invention <hi>Pighius</hi> was presently admonished, blamed, and wished to recant. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> explicated the Mystery of the Sacrament with so much ignorance and zeale that in condemning <hi>Berengarius</hi> he taught a worse impiety. But what need I any more instances; it is a confessed case by <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> by <hi>Biel,</hi> by <hi>Stella, Almain, Occham,</hi> and <hi>Canus,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the best Scholars in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that a Pope <note place="margin">Picus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit. theorem. 4.</note> may be a Heretick, and that some of them actually were so, and no lesse then three generall Councels did beleive the same thing: <hi>viz.</hi> sixth, seaventh, and eighth, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is pleased to acknowledge in his fourth book <hi>de Pontifice Romano.</hi> c. 11. <hi>resp. ad Arg.</hi> 4. And the Canon <hi>si Papadist.</hi> 40. affirms it in expresse termes, that a Pope is judicable and punishable in that case. But there is no wound but some Emperick or other will pretend to cure it, and there is a cure for this too. For though it be true that if a Pope were a Heretick, the Church might depose him, yet no Pope can be a Heretick, not but that the man may, but the Pope cannot, for he is <hi>ipso facto</hi> no Pope, for he is no Christian; so <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> and so when you think you have <note place="margin">L. 2. c. 30. ubi supra. §. est ergo.</note> him fast, he is gone, and nothing of the Pope left; but who
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41208:107"/>
sees not the extream folly of this evasion? For besides that out of feare and caution he grants more then he needs, more then was sought for in the Question, the Pope hath no more priviledge then the Abbot of <hi>Cluny,</hi> for he cannot be a Heretick, nor be deposed by a Councell, for if he be <hi>manifestly</hi> a Heretick he is <hi>ipso facto</hi> no Abbot, for he is no Christian; and if the Pope be a Heretick <hi>privaetely and occultly,</hi> for that, he may be accused and judged sayd the Glosse upon the Canon <hi>si Papa dist.</hi> 40. And the Abbot of <hi>Cluny</hi> and one of his meanest Monks can be no more, therefore the case is all one. But <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons. à Castr. l b. 1. adv. haeres. c. 4. hoc lemma riden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem affabrè.</note> this is fitter to make sport with then to interrupt a serious discourse. And therefore although the Canon <hi>Sanctae Romana</hi> approves all the Decretals of Popes, yet that very Decretall hath not decreed it firm enough, but that they are so warily receiv'd by them, that when they list they are pleased to dissent from them; And it is evident in the Extravagant of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. <hi>Com.

And therefore 'tis a most intolerable folly to pretend that the Pope cannot erre in his Chaire, though he may erre in his Closet, and may maintaine a false opinion even to his death: For besides that, it is sottish to think that either he would not have the world of his own opinion (as all men naturally would) or that if he were set in his Chaire, he would determine contrary to himselfe in his study (and therefore to represent it as possible, they are faine to flie to a Miracle for which they have no colour, neither instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, nor insinuation, nor warrant, nor promise; besides that, it were impious and unreasonable to depose him for heresy, who may so easily, even by setting himselfe in his Chaire and reviewing his Theorems, be cured:) it is also against a very great experience: For besides the former Allegations it is most notorious, that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> III in a Councell at <hi>Rome</hi> of 300 Archbishops and Bishops <hi>A. D.</hi> 1179. condemn'd <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> of heresy in a matter of great concernment, no lesse then something about the incarnation; from which sentence he was, after 36 years abiding it, absolv'd by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41208:108"/>
without repentance or dereliction of the opinion: Now if this sentence was not a Cathedrall Dictate, as solemn and great as could be expected, or as is said to be necessary to oblige all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, let the great Hyperaspists of the Roman Church be Judges, who tell us that a particular Councell with the Popes confirmation is made Oecumenicall by adoption, and is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obliges all Christendome; so <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> And therefore he sayes, that it is <hi>temerarium, erroneum, &amp; proximum haeresi,</hi> to <note place="margin">L. 2. de. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. cap. 5.</note> deny it, but whether it be or not it is all one, as to my purpose: For it is certain, that in a particular Councell confirm'd by the Pope, if ever; then and there the Pope sate himselfe in his Chaire, and it is as certain that he sate besides the cushion and determined ridiculously and falsly in this case: But this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <note place="margin">De Pontif.

And then the Doctors of his Church, need not trouble themselves with study, nor writing explications of Scripture, but might wholly attend to practicall devotion, and leave all their Scholasticall wranglings, the distinguishing opinions of their Orders, and they might have a fine Church, something like Fairy land, or <hi>Lucians</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the Moone: But if they say they cannot doe this when they list, but when they are mov'd to it by the Spirit, then we are never the nearer; for so may the Bishop of <hi>Angolesme</hi> write infallible Commentaries when the holy Ghost moves him to it, for I suppose his motions are not ineffectuall, but hee will sufficiently assist us in performing of what he actually moves us to: But among so many hundred Decrees which the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have made or confirmed and attested (which is all one) I would faine know in how many of them did the holy Ghost assist them? If they know it, let them declare it, that it may be certain which of their Decretals are <hi>de fide;</hi> for as yet none of his own Church knowes: If they doe not know, then neither can we know it from them, and then we are as uncertaine as ever, and besides, the holy Ghost may possibly move him, and he by his ignorance of it may neglect so profitable a motion, and then his promise of infallible assistance will be to very little purpose, because it is with very much fallibility ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to practise: And therefore it is absolutely uselesse to any man or any Church, because, suppose it settled in <hi>Thesi,</hi> that the Pope is infallible, yet whether he will doe his duty, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41208:109"/>
perform those conditions of being assisted which are required of him, or whether he be a secret Simoniack (for if he be, he is <hi>ipso facto,</hi> no Pope) or whether he be a Bishop, or Priest, or a Christian, being all uncertain; every one of these depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intention and power of the Baptizer or Ordainer, which also are fallible, because they depend upon the honesty and power of other men; we cannot be infallibly certain of any Pope that he is infallible, and therefore when our Questions are dermin'd, we are never the nearer, but may hugge our selves in an imaginary truth, the certainty of finding truth out depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon so many fallible and contingent circumstances. And therefore, the thing, if it were true, being so to no purpose, it is to be presum'd that God never gave a power so impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from whence no benefit can accrue to the Christian Church, for whose use and benefit, if at all, it must needs have been appointed.</p>
                     <p>But I am too long in this impertinency: If I were bound <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.</note> to call any man Master upon earth, and to believe him upon his own affirmative and authority; I would of all men least follow him that pretends he is infallible and cannot prove it. For that he cannot prove it, makes me as uncertaine as ever, and that he pretends to infallibility makes him carelesse of using such meanes which will morally secure those wise persons, who knowing their own aptnesse to be deceiv'd, use what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours they can to secure themselves from errour, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the better and more probable guides.</p>
                     <p>Well! Thus farre we are come: Although we are secured in fundamentall points from involuntary errour, by the plaine, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.</note> expresse, and dogmaticall places of Scripture, yet in other things we are not but may be invincibly mistaken, because of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity and difficulty in the controverted parts of Scripture, by reason of the incertainty of the meanes of its Interpretation, since Tradition is of an uncertain reputation, and sometimes evidently false, Councels are contradictory to each other, and therefore certainly are equally deceiv'd many of them, and therefore all may; and then the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are very likely to mislead us, but cannot ascertain us of truth in matter of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and in this world we believe in part, and prophecy in

part, and this imperfection shall never be done away till we be translated to a more glorious state; either we must throw our chances, and get truth by accident or predestination, or else we must lie safe in a mutuall toleration, and private liberty of perswasion, unlesse some other Anchor can bee thought upon where wee may fasten our floating Vessels, and ride safely.</p>

And it would not be inconsiderable to observe, that if any Synod, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Nationall, or Provinciall, be receded from by the Church of the later Age, (as there have been very many) then, so many Fathers as were then assembled and united in opinion are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Authority to determine our perswasions. Now suppose 200 Fathers assembled in such a Councell, if all they had writ Books, and Authorities, 200 Authorities had beene alleadged in confirmation of an opinion, it would have made a mighty noise, and loaded any man with an insupportable prejudice that should dissent: And yet every opinion maintained against the Authority of any one Councell, though but Provinciall, is in its proportion such a violent recession and neglect of the Authority and doctrine of so many Fathers as were then assembled, who did as much declare their opinion in those Assemblies by their Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as if they had writ it in so many books; and their opinion is more considerable in the Assembly then in their writings, because it was more deliberate, assisted, united and more dogmaticall.

in peace, and their memories in honour; for if I should enquire into the particular probations of this Article, I must doe to them as I should be forced to doe now; if any man should say that the Writings of the School-men were excellent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Authority to determine mens perswasions; I must consider their writings, and observe their defaillances, their contradictions, the weaknesse of their Arguments, the mis-alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Scripture, their inconsequent deductions, their false opinions, and all the weaknesses of humanity, and the failings of their persons, which no good man is willing to doe, unlesse he be compel'd to it by a pretence that they are infallible, or that they are followed by men even into errors or impiety. And therefore since there is enough in the former instances, to cure any such misperswasion and prejudice, I will not instance in the innumerable particularities that might perswade us to keep our Liberty intire or to use it discreetly. For it is not to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that great advantages are to be made by their writings, <hi>&amp; probabile est quod omnibus, quod pluribus, quod sapientibus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur;</hi> If one wise man sayes a thing, it is an Argument to me to believe it in its degree of probation, that is, proportionable to such an assent as the Authority of a wise man can produce, and when there is nothing against it that is greater; and so in proportion higher and higher as more wise men (such as the old Doctors were) doe affirm it. But that which I complain of is that we look upon wise men that lived long agoe with so much veneration and mistake, that we reverence them not for having been wise men, but that they lived long since. But when the Question is concerning Authorty, there must bee something to build it on; a Divine Commandment, humane Sanction, excellency of spirit, and greatnesse of understanding, on which things all humane Authority is regularly built. But now if we had lived in their times (for so we must look upon them now, as they did who without prejudice beheld them) I suppose we should then have beheld them, as we in <hi>England</hi> look on those Prelates, who are of great reputation for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and sanctity; here only is the difference; when persons are living, their authority is depressed by their personall defail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances, and the contrary interests of their contemporaries,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41208:112"/>
which disband when they are dead, and leave their credit intire upon the reputation of those excellent books, and monuments of learning and piety which are left behind: But beyond this why the Bishop of <hi>Hippo</hi> shall have greater Authority then the Bishop of the <hi>Canaries, caeteris paribus,</hi> I understand not. For did they that liv'd (to instance) in S. <hi>Austine</hi>'s time believe all that he wrote? If they did, they were much too blame, or else himselfe was too blame for retracting much of it a little before his death; And if while he lived, his affirmative was no more Authority, then derives from the credit of one very wise man, against whom also very wise men were opposed; I know not why his Authority should prevaile further now; For there is nothing added to the strength of his reason, since that time, but only that he hath been in great esteem with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity: And if that be all, why the opinion of the following Ages, shall be of more force then the opinion of the first Ages, against whom S. <hi>Austin</hi> in many things clearly did oppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, I see no reason; or whether the first Ages were against him or no, yet that he is approved by the following Ages is no better Argument; for it makes his Authority not to be innate, but derived from the opinion of others, and so to be <hi>precaria,</hi> and to depend upon others, who if they should change their opinions, and such examples there have been many, then there were nothing left to urge our consent to him; which when it was at the best, was only this, because he had the good Fortune to be believed by them that came after, he must be so still; and because it was no Argument for the old Doctors before him, this will not be very good in his behalfe: The same I say of any company of them, I say not so of all of them, it is to no purpose to say it, for there is no Question this day in contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the explication of which all the old Writers did consent: In the assignation of the Canon of Scripture, they never did consent for six hundred yeares together, and then by that time the Bishops had agreed indiffently well, and but indifferently, upon that, they fell out in twenty more; and except it be in the Apostels Creed, and Articles of such nature, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may with any colour be called a consent, much lesse Tradition Universall.</p>

For the Church either speaks by Tradition, or by a representative body in a Councel, by Popes, or by the Fathers: for the Church is not a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> not a shadow, but a company of men beleeving in Jesus Christ, which men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speak by themselves immediately, or by their Rulers, or by their proxies and representatives; now I have considered it in all senses but in its diffusive capacity; in which capacity she cannot be supposed to be a Judge of Controversies, both because in that capacity she cannot teach us, as also because if by a Judge we mean all the Church diffused in all its parts and members, so there can be no controversie, for if all men be of that opinion, then there is no question contested; if they be not all of a mind, how can the whole diffusive Catholike Church be pretended in defiance of any one article, where the diffusive Church being divided, part goes this way, and part another? But if it be said, the greatest part must carry it; Besides that it is impossible for us to know which way the greatest part goes in many questions, it is not alwaies true that the greater part is the best, sometimes the contrary is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and it is often very probable, but it is alwayes possible. And when paucity of followers was objected to <hi>Liberius,</hi> he gave this in answer, There was a time when but three Children of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity <note place="margin">Theod. l. 2. c. 16. hist.</note> resisted the Kings Decree.

But if there could in this case be any distinct consideration of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> the Church, yet to know which is the true Church is so hard to be found out, that the greatest questions of Christendome are jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before you can get to your Judge, and then there is no need of him. For those questions which are concerning the Judge of questions must be determined before you can submit to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if you can your selves determine those great questions which consist much in universalities, then also you may determine the particulars as being of less difficulty. And he that considers how many notes there are given to know the true Church, no less then 15. by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and concerning every one of them almost whether it be a certaine note or no there are very many questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and uncertainties, and when it is resolved which are the notes, there is more dispute about the application of these notes then of the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And there is one note amongst the rest, Holiness of Doctrine, that is, so as to have nothing false either in <hi>Doctrina fidei or morum,</hi> (for so <hi>Bellarmine</hi> explicates it) which supposes all your Controversies, judged before they can be tryed by the authority of the Church, and when we have found out all true Doctrine (for that is necessary to judge of the Church by, that as Saint <hi>Austin's</hi> councell is <hi>Ecclesiam in verbis Christi investigemus)</hi> then we are bound to follow because we judge it true, not because the Church hath said it, and this is to judge of the Church by her Doctrine, not of the Doctrine by the Church. And indeed it is the best and only way; But then how to judge of that Doctrine will be afterwards inquired into. In the meane time, the Church, that is, the Governours of the Churches are to judge for themselves, &amp; for all those who cannot judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For others, they must know that their Governours judge for them too, so as to keepe them in peace and obedience, though not for the determination of their private perswasions. For the Oeconomy of the Church requires that her authority be received by all her children. Now this authority is divine in its originall, for it derives immediately from Christ, but it is humane in its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration. We are to be lead like men not like beasts; A rule is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41208:115"/>
prescribed for the guides themselves to follow, as we are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the guides; and although in matters indeterminable or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous the presumption lyes on behalfe of the Governours, (for we do nothing for authority if we suffer it not to weigh that part down of an indifferency and a question which she chooses) yet if there be <hi>error manifestus,</hi> as it often happens, or if the Church-Governours themselves be rent into innumerable sects, as it is this day in Christendome, then we are to be as wise as we can in choosing our guides, and then to follow so long as that reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for which we first chose them. And even in that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was an immediate sanction of God, I mean the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall government of the Synagogue, where God had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd the High-Priests authority with a menace of death to them that should disobey, that all the world might know the meaning and extent of such precepts, and that there is a limit beyond which they cannot command, and we ought not to obey: it came once to that pass, that if the Priest had been obeyed in his Conciliary decrees, the whole Nation had been bound to beleeve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of our blessed Saviour to have been just, and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time the Apostles must no more have preached in the name of JEsus. But here was manifest error. And the case is the same to every man that invincibly and therefore innocently beleeves it so. <hi>Deo potius quàm hominibus</hi> is our rule in such cases. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every man is bound to follow his guide, unless he beleeves his guide to mislead him; yet when he sees reason against his guide, it is best to follow his reason: for though in this he may fall into error, yet he will escape the sin; he may doe violence to truth, but never to his own conscience; and an honest error is better then an hypocriticall profession of truth, or a violent lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation of the understanding, since if he retains his honesty and simplicity, he cannot erre in a matter of faith or absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: Gods goodness hath secur'd all honest and carefull persons from that; for other things, he must follow the best guides he can, and he cannot be obliged to follow better then God hath given him.</p>
                     <p>And there is yet another way pretended of infallible <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> Expositions of Scripture; and that is, by the Spirit. But of this I shall say no more, but that it is impertinent as to this question.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41208:116"/>
For put case the Spirit is given to some men enabling them to expound infallibly, yet because this is but a private assistance, and cannot be proved to others, this infallible assistance may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine my own assent, but shall not inable me to prescribe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because it were unreasonable I should, unless I could prove to him that I have the Spirit, and so can secure him from being deceived, if he relyes upon me. In this case I may say as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the case of praying with the Spirit, <hi>He verily giveth thanks well, but the other is not edified.</hi> So that let this pretence be as true as it will, it is sufficient that it cannot be of consideration in this question.</p>
                     <p>The result of all is this; Since it is not reasonable to limit and prescribe to all mens understandings by any externall rule in the <note place="margin">

But he that gives himselfe up wholly to a guide is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (I meane, if he be a discerning person) forc'd to doe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his own understanding, and to lose all the benefit of his owne discretion, that he may reconcile his reason to his guide. And of this we see infinite inconveniences in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:41208:117"/>
for we finde persons of great understanding, oftentimes so amused with the authority of their Church, that it is pity to see them sweat in answering some objections, which they know not how to doe, but yet beleeve they must, because the Church hath said it. So that if they reade, study, pray, search records, and use all the means of art and industry in the pursuite of truth, it is not with a resolution to follow that which shall seem truth to them, but to confirm what before they did beleeve: and if any argument shall seeme unanswerable against any Article of their Church, they are to take it for a temptation, not for an illumination, and they are to use it accordingly: which makes them make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to be the Author of that which Gods Spirit hath assisted them to find in the use of lawfull means and the search of truth. And when the Devill of falshood is like to be cast out by Gods Spirit, they say that it is through <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> which was one of the worst things that ever the Pharisees said or did: And was it not a plain stifling of the just and reasonable demands made by the Emperour, by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Divines among them which was used in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> when they demanded the restitution of Priests to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of marriage, the use of the Chalice, the Service in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue, and these things not onely in pursuance of Truth, but for other great and good ends, even to take away an infinite scandall and a great schisme? And yet when they themselves did profess it, and all the world knew these reasonable demands were denyed meerly upon a politick consideration, yet that these things should be fram'd into articles, and decrees of faith, and they for ever after bound not onely not to desire the same things, but to think the contrary to be divine truths: never was Reason made more a slave or more useless. Must not all the world say, either they must be great hypocrites, or doe great violence to their understanding, when they not onely cease from their claim, but must also beleeve it to be unjust? If the use of their reason had not been restrained by the tyrannie &amp; imperiousness of their guide, what the Emperour, and the Kings, and their Theologues would have done, they can best judge who consider the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the demand, and the unreasonableness of the denyall. But we see many wise men who with their <hi>Optandum esset ut Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia</hi>

Our guides must direct us, and yet if they faile, God hath not so left us to them, but he hath given us enough to our selves to discover their failings, and our own duties in all things necessary.

But it is best to follow our guides, if we know nothing better; but if we doe, it is better to follow the pillar of fire, than a pillar of cloud, though both possibly may lead to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi> But then also it is possible that it may be otherwise.

For take the Proselites of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even in their greatest submission of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they seem to themselves to follow their reason most of all. For if you tell them, Scripture and Tradition are their rules to follow, they will beleeve you when they know a reason for it,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41208:118"/>
and if they take you upon your word, they have a reason for that too, either they beleeve you a learned man, or a good man, or that you can have no ends upon them, or something that is of an equall height to fit their understandings. If you tell them they must beleeve the Church, you must tell them why they are bound to it, and if you quote Scripture to prove it, you must give them leave to judge, whether the words alledged speak your sense or no, and therefore to dissent if they say no such thing. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all men are not wise, and proceed discreetly, yet all make their choice some way or other. He that chooses to please his fancie takes his choice as much as he that chooses prudently. And no man speaks more unreasonably, then he that denyes to men the use of their Reason in choice of their Religion. For that I may by the way remove the common prejudice, Reason and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are not things incompetent or repugnant, especially when the Authority is infallible and supreme: for there is no greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the world then to beleeve such an authority. But then we must consider, whether every authority that pretends to be such, is so indeed. And therefore <hi>Deus dixit, ergo hoc verum est,</hi> is the greatest demonstration in the world for things of this nature. But it is not so in humane dictates, and yet reason and humane authority are not enemies. For it is a good argument for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low such an opinion, because it is made sacred by the authority of Councells and Ecclesiasticall Tradition, and sometimes it is the best reason we have in a question, and then it is to be strictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; but there may also be at other times a reason greater than it that speaks against it, and then the authority must not carry it. But then the difference is not between reason and authority, but between this reason and that, which is greater: for authority is a very good reason, and is to prevaile, unless a stronger comes and disarms it, but then it must give place. So that in this question by <hi>[Reason</hi>] I doe not meane a distinct Topick, but a transcendent that runs through all Topicks; for Reason, like Logick, is instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all things else, and when Revelation, and Philosophie, and publick Experience, and all other grounds of probability or demonstration have supplyed us with matter, then Reason does but make use of them; that is, in plain terms, there being so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes of arguing, so many sects, such differing interests, such
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41208:119"/>
variety of authority, so many pretences, and so many false be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes, it concernes every wise man to consider which is the best argument, which proposition relies upon the truest grounds: &amp; if this were not his only way, why doe men dispute and urge argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, why do they cite Councels &amp; Fathers, why do they alledge Scripture and Tradition, and all this on all sides, and to contrary purposes? If we must judge, then we must use our reason; if we must not judge, why doe they produce evidence? Let them leave disputing and decree propositions magisterially, but then we may choose whether we will believe them or no; or if they say we must believe them, they must prove it, and tell us why. And all these disputes concerning Tradition, Councells, Fathers, &amp;c. are not arguments against or besides reason, but contestations and pretences to the best arguments, and the most certain satisfaction of our reason. But then all these comming into question, submit themselves to reason, that is, to be judged by humane understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, upon the best grounds and information it can receive. So that Scripture, Tradition, Councells, and Fathers, are the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a question, but Reason is the Judge: That is, we being the persons that are to be perswaded, we must see that we be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reasonably, and it is unreasonable to assent to a lesser evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when a greater and cleerer is propounded, but of that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man for himselfe is to take cognisance if he be able to judge, if he be not, he is not bound under the tye of necessity to know any thing of it; that, that is necessary shall be certainly conveyed to him, God that best can, will certainly take care for that; for if he does not, it becomes to be not necessary; or if it should still remain necessary, and he damned for not knowing it, and yet to know it be not in his power, then who can help it? there can be no further care in this business. In other things, there being no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and prime necessity, we are left to our liberty to judge that way that makes best demonstration of our piety and of our love to God and truth, not that way that is alwayes the best argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an excellent understanding, for this may be a blessing, but the other onely is a duty.</p>

And (1.) the variety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane understandings is so great, that what is plaine and apparent to one, is difficult and obscure to another; one will observe a consequent from a common principle, and another from thence will conclude the quite contrary. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> saw the vision of the sheet let downe with all sorts of beasts in it, and a voice say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Surge Petre, macta &amp; manduca,</hi> if he had not by a particular assistance beene directed to the meaning of the holy Ghost, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he might have had other apprehensions of the meaning of that vision, for to my selfe it seemes naturally to speake nothing but the abolition of the Mosaicall rites, and the restitution of us to that part of Christian liberty which consists in the promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eating of meates; and yet besides this, there want not some understandings in the world, to whom these words seeme to give Saint <hi>Peter</hi> a power to kill hereticall Princes. Me thinkes it is a strange understanding that makes such extractions, but <hi>Bozius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> did so. But men may understand what they please, especially when they are to expound Oracles. It was an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some wit, but of singularity of understanding, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the great contestation betweene the Missalls of Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregory.</hi> The lot was throwne, and God made
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41208:120"/>
to be Judge, so as he was tempted to a miracle, to answer a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion which themselves might have ended without much trouble. The two Missals were laid upon the Altar, &amp; the Church door shut and sealed. By the morrow Mattins they found S. <hi>Gregories</hi> Missall torne in pieces (saith the story) and thrown about the Church, but S. <hi>Ambrose's</hi> open'd and laid upon the Altar in a posture of being read. If I had been to judge of the meaning of this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, I should have made no scruple to have said it had been the will of God that the Missall of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> which had been anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently used, and publickly tryed and approved of, should still be read in the Church, and that of <hi>Gregory</hi> let alone, it being torn by an Angelicall hand as an argument of its imperfection, or of the inconvenience of innovation. But yet they judg'd it otherwise, for by the tearing and scattering about, they thought it was meant, it should be used over all the world, and that of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> read onely in the Church of <hi>Millaine.</hi> I am more satisfied that the former was the true meaning, then I am of the truth of the story: But we must suppose that. And now there might have been eternal disputings about the meaning of the miracle, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to determine, when two fancies are the litigants, and the contestations about probabilities <hi>hinc inde.</hi> And I doubt not this was one cause of so great variety of opinions in the Primitive Church, when they proved their severall opinions which were my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious questions of Christian Theologie, by testimonies out of the obscurer Prophets, out of the Psalmes and Canticles, as who please to observe their arguments of discourse and actions of Councel shall perceive they very much used to doe. Now although mens understandings be not equall, and that it is fit the best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings should prevaile, yet that will not satisfie the weaker understandings, because all men will not think that another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is better then his own, at least not in such a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in which with fancy he hath pleased himself. But commonly they that are least able, are most bold, and the more ignorant is the more confident, therefore it is but reason if he would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother beare with him, he also should beare with another, and if he will not be prescribed to, neither let him prescribe to others. And there is the more reason in this; because such modesty is commonly to be desired of the more imperfect; for wise men
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41208:120"/>
know the ground of their perswasion, and have their confidence proportionable to their evidence, others have not, but over-act their trifles: and therefore I said it is but a reasonable demand, that they that have the least reason should not be most imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and for others it being reasonable enough, for all their great advantages upon other men, they will be soone perswaded to it; for although wise men might be bolder, in respect of the persons of others less discerning, yet they know there are but few things so certaine as to create much boldness and confidence of assertion, If they doe not, they are not the men I take them for.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When an action or opinion is commenc'd with zeale and piety against a knowne vice or a vitious person, commonly all the <note place="margin">

There is a memorable instance in one of the greatest questions of Christendome, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning Images. For when <hi>Philippicus</hi> had espyed the images of the six first Synods upon the front of a Church, he caused them to be pulled down; now he did it in hatred of the sixth Synod: for he being a Monothelite, stood condemn'd by that Synod. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques that were zealous for the sixth Synod, caused the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and representments to be put up againe, and then sprung the question concerning the lawfullness of images in Churches; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippicus</hi> and his party strived by suppressing images to do dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the sixth Synod: the Catholiques to preserve the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">Vid. Paulum Diaconum.</note> of the sixth Synod, would uphold images. And then the question came to be changed, and they who were easie enough to be perswaded to pull downe images, were over-awed by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice against the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> and the <hi>Monothelites</hi> striv'd to maintain the advantage they had got by a just and pious pretence against images. The <hi>Monothelites</hi> would have secur'd their error by the advantage and consociation of a truth, &amp; the other would rather defend a dubious and disputable error, than lose and let
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41208:121"/>
goe a certain truth. And thus the case stood, and the successors of both parts were led invincibly. For when the Heresie of the Monothelites disbanded, (which it did in a while after) yet the opinion of the Iconoclasts, &amp; the question of Images grew stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Yet since the Iconoclasts at the first were Heretiques, not for their breaking Images, but for denying the two wils of Christ, his Divine and his Humane: that they were called Iconoclasts was to distinguish their opinion in the question concerning the Images, but that then Iconoclasts so easily had the reputation of Hereticks, was because of the other opinion which was conjunct in their persons; which opinion men afterwards did not easily distinguish in them, but took them for Hereticks in gross, and whatsoever they held to be hereticall. And thus upon this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice grew great advantages to the veneration of Images, and the persons at first were much to be excused, because they were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided by that which might have abused the best men. And if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> who was as zealous against Images in Churches as <hi>Philippicus</hi> or <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> had but begun a publike contestation, and engaged Emperours to have made Decrees against them, Christendom would have had other apprehensions of it, then they had when the Monothelites began it. For few men will endure a truth from the mouth of the Devill, and if the person be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so are his wayes too. And it is a great subtlety of the Devill so to temper truth and falshood in the same person, that truth may lose much of its reputation by its mixture with error, and the error may become more plausible by reason of its conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with truth. And this we see by too much experience, for we see many truths are blasted in their reputation, because persons whom we think we hate upon just grounds of Religion, have taught them. And it was plain enough in the case of <hi>Maldonat,</hi> that said of an explication of a place of Scripture, that it was <note place="margin">In cap 6. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</note> most agreeable to Antiquity, but because <hi>Calvin</hi> had so expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, he therefore chose a new one. This was malice. But when a prejudice works tacitely, undiscernably, and irresistabl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And therefore it hath been usuall to discredit doctrines by the personall defaillan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them that preach them: or with the disreputation of that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41208:121"/>
sect that maintains them in conjunction with other perverse do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. <hi>Faustus</hi> the Manichee in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> glories much, that in their Religion God was worshipped purely and without Images. <note place="margin">L. 20. c. 3. cont.

L. 1. c. ult. de Imagin.</note> S. <hi>Austin</hi> liked it well, for so it was in his too, but from hence <hi>Sanders</hi> concludes, that to pull down Images in Churches was the heresie of the Manichees. The Jews endure no Images, therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes it to be a piece of Judaisme to oppose them. He might as well have concluded against saying our prayers, and Church musick, that it is Judaicall, because the Jews used it. And <note place="margin">De reliq. SS. l. 2. c. 6. Sect.

But there are a sort of men that are even with them, and hate some good things which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, because she who teaches so many errors, hath been the publisher, and is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticer of those things. I confess the thing is alwayes unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but sometimes it is invincible and innocent; and then may serve to abate the fury of all such decretory sentences, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all the world but their own Disciples.</p>

For where they once had entertain'd a feare of God, and apprehension of his so sensible declaration, such a feare produces scruple, and a scrupulous conscience is alwayes to be pityed, because though it is seldome wise, it is alwayes pious. And this very thing hath prevail'd so farre upon the understandings even of wise men, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes it a note of the true Church. Which opinion when it prevailes is a ready way to make, that instead of Martyrs all men should prove hereticks or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates in persecution; for since men in misery are very suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41208:122"/>
out of strong desires to finde out the cause, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it they may be relieved, they apprehend that to be it that is first presented to their fears; and then if ever truth be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, she shall also be destroyed. I will say nothing in defiance of this fancy, although all the experience in the world sayes it is false, and that of all men Christians should least believe it to be true, to whom a perpetuall crosse is their certain expectation, (and the argument is like the Moone, for which no garment can be fit, it alters according to the success of humane affairs, and in one age will serve a Papist, and in another a Protestant) yet when such an opinion does prevaile upon timerous persons, the malignity of their error (if any be consequent to this fancie, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up upon the reputation of a prosperous heresie) is not to be considered simply and nakedly, but abatement is to be made in a just proportion to that feare, and to that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>

For men doe not alwayes call them principles which are the prime fountaines of reason, from whence such consequents naturally flow, as are to guide the actions and discourses of men; but they are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which they are first taught, which they suckt in next to their milke, and by a proportion to those first principles they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take their estimate of propositions. For whatsoever is taught to them at first they believe infinitely, for they know nothing to the contrary, they have had no other masters, whose theoremes might abate the strength of their first perswasions, and it is a great advantage in those cases to get possession; and before their first principles can be dislodg'd, they are made habituall and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xionall, it is in their nature then to believe them, and this is hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward very much by the advantage of love and veneration which we have to the first parents of our perswasions. And we see it in the orders of Regulars in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which was the opinion of their Patron or Founder, or of some eminent Personage of the Institute, is enough to engage all the Order to be of that opinion; and it is strange that all the Dominicans should be of one opinion in the matter of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination

and immaculate conception, and all the Franciscans of the quite contrary, as if their understandings were form'd in a different mold, and furnished with various principles by their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rule. Now this prejudice works by many principles, but how strongly they doe possess the understanding is visible in that great instance of the affection and perfect perswasion the weaker sort of people have to that which they call the Religion of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.

But the observation and experience of all wise men can justifie this truth. All that I shall say to the present purpose, is this, that consideration is to be had to the weakness of persons when they are prevail'd upon by so innocent a prejudice, and when there cannot be arguments strong enough to over-master an habituall perswasion bred with a man, nourish'd up with him, that alwayes eat at his table, and lay in his bosome, he is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be called Heretique, for if he keeps the foundation of faith, other articles are not so cleerly demonstrated on either side, but that a man may innocently be abused to the contrary.

are the rather to be tolerated, because the indirect practices and impostures of their adversaries have confirmed them, that those opinions which they disavow, are not from God, as being upheld by means not of Gods appointment: For it is no unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable discourse to say, that God will not be served with a lye, for he does not need one, and he hath means enough to support all those truths which he hath commanded, and hath supplyed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honest cause with enough for its maintenance, and to contest against its adversaries. And (but that they which use indirect arts will not be willing to lose any of their unjust advantages, nor yet be charitable to those persons, whom either to gain or to undoe, they leave nothing unattempted) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath much reason not to be so decretory in her sentences against persons of a differing perswasion, for if their cause were entirely the cause of God, they have given wise people reason to suspect it, because some of them have gone to the Devill to defend it. And if it be remembred what tragedies were stirred up against <hi>Luther,</hi> for saying, the Devill had taught him an argument against the Mass, it will be of as great advantage against them, that they goe to the Devill for many arguments to support not onely the Mass, but the other distinguishing Articles of their Church: I instance in the notorious forging of Miracles, and framing of false and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Legends. For the former I need no other instances then what hapned in the great contestation about the immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, when there were Miracles brought on both sides to prove the contradictory parts; and though it be more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that both sides play'd the jugglers, yet the Dominicans had the ill luck to be discovered, and the actors burn'd at <hi>Berne.</hi> But this discovery hapned by providence; for the Dominican opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath more degrees of probability then the Franciscan; is cleerly more consonant both to Scripture and all antiquity, and this part of it is acknowledged by the greatest Patrons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as <hi>Salmeron, Posa</hi> and <hi>Wadding,</hi> yet because they played the knaves in a just question, and used false arts to maintain a true proposition, God Almighty to shew that he will not be served by a lye, was pleased rather to discover the imposture in the right opinion then in the false, since nothing is more dishonourable to God, then to offer a sin in sacrifice to him, and nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41208:123"/>
in the nature of the thing, then that truth and falshood should support each other, or that true doctrine should live at the charges of a lye. And he that considers the arguments for each opinion will easily conclude, that if God would not have truth confirmed by a lye, much lesse would he himself attest a lye with a true miracle. And by this ground it will easily follow, that the Franciscan party, although they had better luck then the Dominicans, yet had not more honesty, because their cause was worse, and therefore their arguments no whit the better. And although the argument drawn from miracles is good to attest a holy doctrine, which by its own worth will support it selfe, after way is a little made by miracles, yet of it selfe and by its owne reputation it will not support any fabrick; for instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a doctrine to be true, it makes that the miracles themselves are suspected to be illusions, if they be pretended in behalfe of a doctrine, which we think we have reason to account false. And therefore the Jews did not beleeve Christs doctrine for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but dis-beleeved the truth of his Miracles, because they did not like his doctrine. And if the holinesse of his doctrine, and the Spirit of God by inspirations and infusions, and by that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>a surer word of prophecy,</hi> had not attested the Divinity both of his Person and his Office, we should have wanted many degrees of confidence which now we have upon the truth of Christian Religion. But now since we are fore-told by this <hi>surer word of prophecy,</hi> that is, the prediction of Jesus Christ, <note place="margin">Vid. Baron. AE. D. 68. n. 22. Philostrat. l. 4. T. 485. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. Cedren. p. 202.</note> that Antichrist should come in all wonders, and signs, and lying miracles, and that the Church saw much of that already verified in <hi>Simon Magus, Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> and <hi>Manetho,</hi> and divers <note n="*" place="margin">Stapleton. prompt. Moral. pars aestiva, p. 627.</note> Heretiques, it is now come to that passe, that the argument in its best advantage proves nothing so much as that the doctrine which it pretends to prove, is to be suspected, because it was foretold that false doctrine should be obtruded under such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. But then when not onely true miracles are an insufficient argument to prove a truth since the establishment of Christianity, but that the miracles themselves are false and spurious, it makes that doctrine in whose defence they come, justly to be suspected, because they are a demonstration that the interested persons use all means, leave nothing unattempted to prove their propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41208:124"/>
but since they so faile as to bring nothing from God, but something from the Devill for its justification, it's a great signe that the doctrine is false, because we know the Devill, unlesse it be against his will, does nothing to prove a true proposition that makes against him. And now then those persons who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no man of another opinion, might doe well to remember how by their exorcismes, their Devils tricks at <hi>Lowdon,</hi> and the other side pretending to cure mad folkes and persons bewitched, and the many discoveries of their jugling, they have given so much reason to their adversaries to suspect their doctrine, that either they must not be ready to condemne their persons who are made suspicious by their indirect proceeding in attestation of that which they value so high as to call their Religion, or else they must condemne themselves for making the scandall active and effectuall.</p>

                        </note> Dialogue was a reall story, and acted in his owne dayes. The Epistle is worth the reading to this purpose; but he sayes this abuse grew to such a height, that scarce any life of any Saint or Martyr is truly related, but is full of lyes and lying wonders, and some persons thought they served God if they did honour to God's Saints by inventing some prodigious story, or miracle for their reputation. So that now it is no wonder if the most pious men are apt to believe, and the greatest historians are easie enough to report such stories, which serving to a good end, are also consigned by the report of persons, otherwise pious and prudent enough. I will not instance in <hi>Vincentius</hi> his <hi>speculum, Turonensis, Thomas Cantipratanus, John Herolt, Vitae Patrum,</hi> nor the revelations of <note place="margin">Vid.

They doe no good and much hurt; but yet accidentally they may procure this advantage to charity, since they doe none to faith; that since they have so abused the credit of story that our confidences want much of that support we should receive from her records of antiquity, yet the men that dissent and are scandaliz'd by such proceedings should be excused if they should chance to be afraid of truth that hath put on garments of imposture: and since much violence is done to the <hi>truth &amp; certainty</hi> of their judging, let none be done to their <hi>liberty</hi> of judging: since they cannot meet a right guide, let them have a charitable judge.

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> from the weaknesse of some understandings. Some men by a Proverb or a common saying are determin'd to the beliefe of a proposition, for which they have no argument better then such a Proverbiall sentence. And when divers of the common People in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were ready to yeild their understandings to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Messias, they were turn'd cleerly from their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions by that proverb, <hi>looke and see, does any good thing come from Galilee?</hi> And this, <hi>when Christ comes, no man knowes from whence he is;</hi> but this man was knowne of what parents, of what City. And thus the weaknesse of their understanding was abused, and that made the argument too hard for them. And the whole seventh Chapter of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell is a perpetuall instance of the efficacy of such trifling prejudices, and the vanity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of popular understandings. Some whole ages have beene abused by a definition, which being once received, as most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are upon slight grounds, they are taken for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes in any science respectively, and for principles, and upon their reputation men use to frame conclusions, which must be false or uncertaine according as the definitions are. And he that hath observ'd anything of the weaknesses of men, and the successions of groundlesse doctrines from age to age, and how seldome definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are put into systemes, or that derive from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or approved among Shool-men are examined by persons of the same interests, will beare me witnesse, how many and great inconveniences presse hard upon the perswasions of men, who are abused and yet never consider who hurt them. Others, and they very many, are lead by authority or examples of Princes, &amp; great personages, <hi>Numquis credit ex Principibus?</hi> Some by the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one learned man are carryed into any perswasion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. <note place="margin">Joh. 7.</note> And in the middle and latter ages of the Church, this was the more considerable, because the infinite ignorance of the Clerks, and the men of the long robe gave them over to be lead by those few guides which were mark'd to them by an eminency,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41208:125"/>
much more then their ordinary: which also did the more amuse them, because most commonly they were fit for nothing but to admire what they understood not; their learning then was in some skill in the Master of the Sentences, in <hi>Aquinas</hi> or <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> whom they admir'd next to the most intelligent order of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; hence came opinions that made Sects &amp; division of names, Thomists, Scotists, Albertists, Nominalls, Realls, and I know not what monsters of names; and whole families of the same opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the whole institute of an Order being ingag'd to believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of some leading man of the same Order, as if such an opinion were imposed upon them <hi>in vitute sanctae obedientiae.</hi> But this inconvenience is greater when the principle of the mistake runs higher, when the opinion is deriv'd from a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive man and a Saint, for then it often happens that what at first was but a plain innocent seduction, comes to be made sacred by the veneration which is consequent to the person for having lived long agone; and then, because the person is also since ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniz'd, the error is almost made eternall, and the cure despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. These and the like prejudices which are as various as the miseries of humanity or the variety of humane understandings are not absolute excuses, unlesse to some persons, but truly if they be to any, they are exemptions to all, from being pressed with too peremptory a sentence against them, especially if we consider what leave is given to all men by the church of <hi>Rome</hi> to follow any one probable Doctor in an opinion which is contested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by many more. And as for the Doctors of the other side, they being destitute of any pretences to an infallible <hi>medium</hi> to determine questions, must of necessity allow the same liberty to the people, to be as prudent as they can in the choice of a fallible guide; and when they have chosen, if they doe follow him into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the matter is not so inexpiable for being deceiv'd in using the best guides we had, which guides because themselves were abused, did also against their wills deceive me. So that this prejudice may the easier abuse us, because it is almost like a duty to follow the dictates of a probable Doctor, or if it be over-acted or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally passe into an inconvenience, it is therefore to be excused because the principle was not ill, unlesse we judge by our event, not by the antecedent probability.

in all ages of the church.

But in these cases and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, (for the causes of deception increase by all accidents, and weaknesses, and illusions) no man can give certaine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the persons of men in particular, unlesse the matter of fact and crime be accident and notorious.

(which must needs be notorious, voluntary, vincible and criminal) or that there be a palpable serving of an end accidentall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall to the opinion.</p>
                     <p>But this latter is very hard to be discerned, because those acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall and adherent crimes which makes the man a heretique, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> in questions not simply fundamentall or of necessary practice, are actions so internall and spirituall, that cognizance can but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be taken of them. And therefore (to instance) though the opinion of Purgatory be false, yet to beleeve it cannot be heresie, if a man be abused into the beliefe of it invincibly, because it is not a Doctrine either fundamentally false or practically impious, it neither proceeds from the will, nor hath any immediate or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect influence upon choice and manners. And as for those other ends of upholding that opinion which possibly its Patrons may have, as for the reputation of their Churches infallibility, for the advantage of Derges, Requiems, Masses, Monthly minds, Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and other offices for the dead, which usually are very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, rich and easie, these things may possibly have sole influences upon their understanding, but whether they have or no God only knowes. If the proposition and article were true, these ends might justly be subordinate and consistent with a true propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And there are some truths that are also profitable, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of maintenance to the Clergy, the Doctrine of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, giving Almes, lending freely, remitting debts in cases of great necessity: and it would be but an ill argument that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of these doctrines speake false, because possibly in these articles they may serve their owne ends. For although <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> and the Crafts-men were without excuse for resisting the Preaching of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> because it was notorious they resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth upon ground of profit and personall emoluments, and the matter was confessed by themselves, yet if the Clergie should maintaine their just rites and Revenues which by pious dedications and donatives were long since ascertained upon them, is it to be presumed in order of Law and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that this end is in the men subordinate to truth, because it is so in the thing it selfe, and that therefore no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in prejudice of these truths can be made from that obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> too, may with more ease be reproved, because matter of fact being evident, and nothing being so certaine as the experiments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires, and these being the immediate consequents of such doctrines, are with some more certainty of observation redargued, then the speculative; whose judgement is of it self more difficult, more remote from matter and humane observation, and with lesse curiosity and explicitenesse declared in Scripture as being of lesse consequence and concernment in order to Gods and Man's great end. In other things which end in notion and ineffective contemplation, where neither the doctrine is malicious, nor the person apparently criminall, he is to be left to the judgement of God, and as there is no certainty of humane judicature in this case, so it is to no purpose it should be judged. For if the person may be innocent with his Error, and there is no rule whereby he can certainly be pronounced, that he is actually criminall; (as it happens in matters speculative.) Since the end of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is love out of <hi>a pure conscience, and faith unfained;</hi> and the Commandment may obtaine its end in a consistence with this simple speculative Errour, Why should men trouble themselves with such opinions, so as to disturbe the publicke charity or the private confidence? Opinions and persons are just so to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as other matters and persons criminall. For no man can judge any thing else: it must be a crime, and it must be open, so as to take cognizance, and make true humane judgement of it. And this is all I am to say concerning the causes of heresies, and of the distinguishing rules for guiding of our judgments towards others.</p>

                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:41208:128"/>
As for guiding our judgements and the use of our reason <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> in judging for our selves, all that is to be said is reducible to this one proposition. Since errors are then made sinnes when they are contrary to charity or inconsistent with a good life and the honour of God, that judgement is the truest, or at least that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion most innocent that 1. best promotes the reputation of Gods Glory, and 2. is the best instrument of holy life. For in questions and interpretations of dispute, these two analogies are the best to make propositions, &amp; conjectures and determinations. Diligence and care in obtaining the best guides, and the most convenient as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances, prayer, and modesty of spirit, simplicity of purposes and intentions, humility and aptnesse to learn, &amp; a peaceable dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are therefore necessary to finding out truths, because they are parts of good life, without which our truths will doe us little advantage, and our errours can have no excuse, but with these dispositions as he is sure to find out all that is necessary, so what truth he inculpably misses of, he is sure is therefore not necessary, because he could not finde it when he did his best and his most innocent endeavours. And this I say to secure the persons; because no rule can antecedently secure the proposition in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters disputable. For even in the proportions and explications of this rule there is infinite variety of disputes: And when the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is concerning free will, one partie denyes it because he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it magnifies the grace of God, that it workes irresistably; the other affirmes, because he beleeves it engages us upon grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care and piety of our endeavours. The one opinion thinks God reapes the glory of our good actions, the other thinks it charges our bad actions upon him. So in the question of merit, one part chooses his assertion because he thinks it incourages us to doe good works, the other beleeves it makes us proud, and therefore he rejects it. The first beleeves it increases piety, the second beleeves it increases spirituall presumption and vanity. The first thinks it magnifies God's justice, the other thinks it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from his mercy. Now then, since neither this nor any ground can secure a man from possibility of mistaking, we were infinitely miserable if it would not secure us from punishment, so long as we willingly consent not to a crime, and doe our best endeavour to avoid an errour. Onely by the way, let me observe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41208:128"/>
that since there are such great differences of apprehension con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the consequents of an article, no man is to be charged with the odious consequences of his opinion. Indeed his doctrine is, but the person is not, if he understands not such things to be consequent to his Doctrine; for if he did, and then avows them, they are his direct opinions, &amp; he stands as chargeable with them as with his first propositions; but if he dis-avowes them, he would certainly rather quit his opinion then avow such errours or impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, which are pretended to be consequent to it, because every man knows that can be no truth, from whence falshood naturally and immediately does derive, and he therefore beleeves his first proposition, because he beleeves it innocent of such errors as are charg'd upon it directly or consequently.</p>
                     <p>So that now, since no error neither for its selfe nor its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> is to be charg'd as criminall upon a pious person, since no simple errour is a sin, nor does condemne us before the throne of God, since he is so pittifull to our crimes, that he pardons many <hi>de toto &amp; integro,</hi> in all makes abatement for the violence of temptation, and the surprizall and invasion of our faculties, and therefore much lesse will demand of us an account for our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; and since the strongest understanding cannot pretend to such an immunity and exemption from the condition of men, as not to be deceived and confesse its weaknesse; it remaines we inquire what deportment is to be used towards persons of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering perswasion, when we are (I doe not say doubtfull of a proposition, but) convinc'd that he that differs from us is in Errour, for this was the first intention, and the last end of this discourse.</p>

any man upon just grounds did change his opinion, then he was in the right and was sure of it too, and although confidence is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a just perswasion many times, yet some men are confident, and have reason so to be. Now when this happens, the question is what deportment they are to use towards persons that disagree from them, and by consequence are in error.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then no Christian is to be put to death, dismembred, or otherwise directly persecuted for his opinion, which does not <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> teach impiety or blasphemy. If it plainly and apparently brings in a crime, and himselfe does act it or incourage it, then the matter of fact is punishable according to its proportion or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; as if he preaches treason or sedition, his opinion is not his excuse, because it brings in a crime, and a man is never the lesse traitor, because he beleeves it lawful to commit treason; &amp; a man is a murtherer if he kills his brother unjustly, although he thinks he does God good service in it. Matters of fact are equally ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicable whether the principle of them be from within or from without: And if a man could pretend to innocence in being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, blasphemous, or perjur'd by perswading himself it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, there were as great a gate opened to all iniquity, as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine all the pretences, the designes, the impostures, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises of the world. And therefore God hath taken order that all rules concerning matters of fact and good life shall be so cleerely explicated, that without the crime of the man, he cannot be ignorant of all his practicall duty. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and primitive Doctors made no scruple of condemning such persons for hereticks, that did dogmatize a sinne. He that teaches others to sinne, is worse then he that commits the crime, whether he be tempted by his owne interest, or incouraged by the others doctrine. It was as bad in <hi>Basilides</hi> to teach it to be lawfull to renounce Faith and Religion, and take all manner of Oathes and Covenants in time of persecution, as if himselfe had done so; nay it is as much worse, as the mischeife is more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, or as a fountaine is greater then a drop of water taken from it. He that writes Treason in a booke, or preaches Sedition in a Pulpit, and perswades it to the people, is the greatest Traitor and incendiary, and his opinion there is the fountaine of a sinne, and therefore could not be entertain'd in his understanding
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41208:129"/>
upon weaknesse, or inculpable or innocent prejudice; he cannot from Scripture or divine revelation have any pretence to colour that so fairely as to seduce either a wise or an honest man. If it rest there and goes no further, it is not cognoscible, and so scapes that way; but if it be published and comes <hi>à stylo ad Machae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> (as <hi>Tertullians</hi> phrase is) then it becomes matter of fact in principle and in perswasion, and is just so punishable, as is the crime that it perswades: such were they of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, who brought in damnable doctrines and lusts. S. <hi>Pauls</hi>

Such were those of whom God spake in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. If any Prophet tempts to idolatry, saying, let us goe after other Gods, he shall be slaine. But these doe not come into this question. But the proposition is to be understood concerning questions disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>materiâ intellectuali,</hi> which also for all that law of killing, such false Prophets were permitted with impunity in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, as appeares beyond exception in the great divisions and disputes betweene the Pharisees and the Sadduces. I deny not but certaine and knowne idolatry or any other sort of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call impiety with its principiant doctrine may be punished cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, because it is no other but matter of fact, but no matter of meere opinion, no errors that of themselves are not sins are to be persecuted or punished by death or corporall inflictions. This is now to be proved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All the former discourse is sufficient argument how easie it is for us in such matters to be deceived. So long as Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <note place="margin">

But when divinity is swell'd up to so great a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when the severall questions which the peevishnesse and wantonnesse of sixteene ages have commenc'd, are concentred into one, and from all these questions something is drawne into the body of <hi>Theologie</hi> till it hath ascended up to the greatnesse of a mountaine, and the summe of Divinity collected by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> makes a volume as great as was that of <hi>Livy</hi> mock'd at in the <hi>Epigramme,</hi>

                     <p>It is impossible for any industry to consider so many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the infinite numbers of questions as are necessary to be consider'd before we can with certainty determine any. And after all the considerations which we can have in a whole age, we are not sure <hi>not to be deceived.</hi> The obscurity of some questions, the nicety of some articles, the intricacy of some revelations, the variety of humane understandings, the windings of <hi>Logicke,</hi> the tricks of adversaries, the subtilty of Sophisters, the ingagement of educations, personall affections, the portentous number of writers, the infinity of authorities, the vastnesse of some argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as consisting in enumeration of many particulars, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of others, the severall degrees of probability, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Scripture, the invalidity of probation of tradition, the opposition of all exteriour arguments to each other, and their open contestation, the publicke violence done to authors and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, the private arts and supplantings, the falsifyings, the indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable industry of some men to abuse all understandings, and all perswasions into their owne opinions, these and thousands more, even all the difficulty of things, and all the weaknesses of man &amp; all the arts of the Devill, have made it impossible for any man in so great variety of matter not to be deceived. No man pretends to it but the Pope, and no man is more deceived then he is in that very particular.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From hence proceeds a danger which is consequent to this proceeding, for if we, who are so apt to be deceived, &amp; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secure <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> in our resolution of questions disputable, should persecute a dis-agreeing person, we are not sure we doe not fight against God, for if his proposition be true and persecuted, then, because all truth derives from God, this proceeding is against God, and therefore this is not to be done upon <hi>Gamaliel's</hi> ground, lest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure we be found to fight against God, of which because we can have no security (at least) in this case, we have all the guilt of a doubtfull or an uncertaine Conscience. For if there be no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in the thing as I have largely proved, the Conscience in such cases is as uncertaine as the question is, and if it be not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full where it is uncertaine, it is because the man is not wise, but as confident as ignorant, the first without reason, and the second
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41208:130"/>
without excuse. And it is very disproportionable for a man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute another certainly, for a proposition, that if he were wise, he would know is not certaine, at least, the other person may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently be uncertaine of it. If he be kill'd, he is certainly kill'd, but if he be call'd hereticke, it is not so certaine that he is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke. It were good therefore, that proceedings were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to evidence, and the rivers not swell over the banks, nor a certaine definitive sentence of death pass'd upon such perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which cannot certainly be defin'd. And this argument is of so much the more force, because we see that the greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions that ever have been, were against truth, even against Christianity it selfe, and it was a prediction of our blessed Saviour, that persecution should be the lot of true beleevers: and if we compute the experience of suffering Christendome, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that truth should suffer, with those few instances of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hereticks, it is odds, but persecution is on the wrong side, and that it is errour and heresie, that is, cruell and tyrannicall, especially since the truth of Jesus Christ, and of his Religion are so meeke, so charitable, and so mercifull: and we may in this case, exactly use the words of S. <hi>Paul, But as then, he that was borne after the flesh, persecuted him that was borne after the spirit; even so it is now:</hi> and so it ever will be till Christs second coming. <note place="margin">

If he sayes, that he is to be spared because he beleeves true, but the other was justly persecuted because he was in errour, he is ridiculous. For he is as confidently beleeved to be a heretick, as he beleeves his adversary such, and whether he be or no, being the thing in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of this he is not to be his owne judge, but he that hath authority on his side, will be sure to judge against him. So that, what either side can indifferently make use of, it is good that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would, because neither side can with reason sufficient doe it in prejudice of the other. If a man will say, that every man must take his adventure, and if it happens authority to be with
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41208:131"/>
him, he will persecute his adversaries, and if it turnes against him he will bear it as well as he can, and hope for a reward of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and innocent suffering; besides that this is so equall to be said of all sides, and besides, that this is a way to make an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall disunion of hearts and charities, and that it will make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome nothing but a shambles, and a perpetuall butchery, and as fast as mens wits grow wanton, or confident, or proud, or abused, so often there will be new executions and massacres. Besides all this, it is most unreasonable and unjust, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant to those Lawes of Justice and Charity, whereby we are bound with greater zeale to spare and preserve an innocent, then to condemne a guilty person, and there's lesse malice and iniquity in sparing the guilty, then in condemning the good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is in the power of men to remit a guilty person to divine judicature, and for divers causes, not to use severity, but in no case is it lawfull, neither hath God at all given to man a power to condemne such persons as cannot be proved other than pious and innocent. And therefore it is better, if it should so happen, that we should spare the innocent person, and one that is actually deceiv'd, then that upon the turn of the wheele, the true believers should be destroyed.</p>
                     <p>And this very reason, he that had authority sufficient, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute to make Lawes, was pleased to urge as a reasonable induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> for the establishing of that Law which he made for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity of erring persons. It was in the parable of the tares ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the good seed in <hi>Agro dominico</hi> the good seed (Christ himselfe being the interpreter) are the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the tares are the children of the wicked one, upon this comes the precept, <hi>gather not the tares by themselves, but let them both grow together till the harvest,</hi> that is, till the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Parable hath been tortur'd infinitely to make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse its meaning, but we shall soone dispatch it. All the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and variety of exposition is reducible to these two questions; What is meant by <hi>[Gather not,</hi>] and what by <hi>[Tares.</hi>] That is, what kind of sword is forbidden, and what kind of persons are to be tolerated. The former is cleare; for the spirituall sword is not forbidden to be used to any sort of criminals, for that would destroy the power of excommunication. The prohibition
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41208:131"/>
therefore lyes against the use of the temporall sword, in cutting off some persons. Who they are, is the next difficulty. But by <hi>tares,</hi> or the <hi>children of the wicked one,</hi> are meant either persons of ill lives, wicked persons onely <hi>in re practicâ,</hi> or else another kind of evill persons, men criminall or faulty <hi>in re intellectuali.</hi> One or other of these two must be meant; a third I know not. But the former cannot be meant, because it would destroy all bodies politique, which cannot consist without lawes, nor lawes without a compulsory and a power of the sword, therefore if criminalls were to be let alone till the day of Judgement, bodies politique must stand or fall <hi>ad arbitrium impiorum,</hi> and nothing good could be protected, not Innocence it selfe, nothing could be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure but violence and tyrannie. It followes then that since a kind of persons which are indeed faulty are to be tolerated, it must be meant of persons faulty in another kind, in which the Gospell had not in other places cleerely established a power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally compulsory, and therefore since in all actions practically criminall a power of the sword is permitted, here where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed must meane a crime of another kind, and by consequence errors intellectuall, commonly call'd heresie. <note place="margin">

And upon that very reason Saint <hi>Martin</hi> was zealous to have procured a revocation of a Commission granted to certaine Tribunes to make enquiry in <hi>Spaine</hi> for sects and opinions; for under colour of rooting out the Priscilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, there was much mischiefe done, and more likely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Orthodox. For it happened then, as oftentimes since, <hi>Pallore potius &amp; veste quam fide haeretieus dijudicari sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat aliquando per Tribunos Maximi.</hi> They were no good inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41208:132"/>
of hereticall pravity, so <hi>Sulpitius</hi> witnesses. But secondly, the reason sayes, that therefore these persons are so to be permitted as not to be persecuted, lest when a revolution of humane affaires sets contrary opinions in the throne or chaire, they who were persecuted before, should now them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves become persecutors of others, and so at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before or after, the wheat be rooted up, and the truth be persecuted.

Now if these great personages had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted or destroyed for their opinions, who should have answered the invaluable losse the Church of God should have sustained in missing so excellent, so exemplary, and so great lights? But then if these persons erred, and by consequence, might have been destroyed, what should have become of others whose understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was lower, and their security lesse, their errors more, and their danger greater? At this rate all men should have passed through the fire, for who can escape, when Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Saint <hi>Austin</hi> cannot? Now to say these persons were not to be persecuted because although they had errors, yet none condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church, at that time or before, is to say nothing to the purpose, nor nothing that is true. Not true, because Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41208:132"/>
sense of the prevailing party in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church. Not to the purpose; because it is nothing else but to say that the Church did tolerate their errors. For since those opinions were open and manifest to the world, that the Church did not condemne them, it was either because those opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were by the Church not thought to be errors, or if they were, yet she thought fit to tolerate the error and the erring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And if she would doe so still, it would in most cases be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then now it is. And yet if the Church had condemned them, it had not altered the case as to this question, for either the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon the condemnation of their error should have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted or not. If not, why shall they now, against the instance and precedent of those ages who were confessedly wise &amp; pious, and whose practice are often made to us arguments to follow? If yea, and that they had been persecuted, it is the thing which this argument condemnes, and the losse of the Church had been invaluable in the losing or the provocation and temptation of such rare personages: and the example and the rule of so ill consequence, that all persons might upon the same ground have suffered, and though some had escaped, yet no man could have any more security from punishment then from error.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Either the disagreeing person is in error, or not, but a true believer; in either of the cases to persecute him is extremely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 9</note> For if he be a true beleever, then it is a cleere case that we doe open violence to God, and his servants, and his truth. If he be in error, what greater folly and stupidity then to give to error the glory of Martyrdome, and the advantages which are accidentally consequent to a persecution? For as it was true of the Martyrs <hi>Quoties morimur toties nascimur,</hi> and the increase of their trouble was the increase of their confidence and the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of their perswasions: so it is in all false opinions; for that an opinion is true or false is extrinsecall or accidentall to the consequents and advantages it gets by being afflicted. And there is a popular pity that followes all persons in misery, and that compassion breeds likenesse of affections, and that very often produces likenesse of perswasion; and so much the rather, because there arises a jealousie and pregnant suspicion that they who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41208:133"/>
an opinion are destitute of sufficient arguments to confute it, and that the hangman is the best disputant. For if those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which they have for their owne doctrine were a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground of confidence &amp; perswasion, men would be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to use those means arguments which are better complyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with humane understanding, which more naturally doe satisfie it, which are more humane and Christian, then that way which satisfies none, which destroyes many, which provokes more, which makes all men jealous. To which adde that those who dye for their opinion, leave in all men, great arguments of the hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their beliefe, of the confidence of their perswasion, of the piety and innocencie of their persons, of the purity of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and simplicity of purposes; that they are persons totally disinterest, and separate from designe. For no interest can be so great as to be put in balance against a mans life and his soul, &amp; he does very imprudently serve his ends who seeingly &amp; fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly loses his life in the prosecution of them. Just as if <hi>Titius</hi> should offer to dye for <hi>Sempronius</hi> upon condition he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive twenty talents when he had done his work. It is certainly an argument of a great love, and a great confidence, and a great sincerity, and a great hope when a man layes downe his life in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of a proposition. <hi>Greater love then this hath no man, then to lay downe his life,</hi> saith our Blessed Saviour. And although lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a wager is an argument of confidence more then truth, yet laying such a wager, staking of a mans Soule, and pawning his life gives a hearty testimony that the person is honest, confident, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, Charitable and Noble. And I know not whether truth can doe a person or a cause more advantages, then these can doe to an error. And therefore besides the impiety, there is great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence in Canonizing a hereticke, and consecrating an errour by such meanes, which were better preserv'd as incouragements of truth, and comforts to reall and true Martyrs. And it is not amisse to observe that this very advantage was taken by hereticks who were ready to shew and boast their Catalogues of Martyrs, in particular the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> did so, and the Donatists, and yet the first were heretickes, the second Schismaticks. And it was remarkeable in the Schollers of <hi>Priscillian,</hi> who, as they had their Master in the reputation of a Saint while he was living, so when
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41208:133"/>
he was dead, they had him in veneration as a Martyr; they with reverence and devotion carryed his, and the bodies of his slaine companions to an honourable sepulture, and counted it Religion to sweare by the name of <hi>Priscillian.</hi> So that the extinguishing of the person, gives life and credit to his doctrine, and when he is dead he yet speaks more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.</p>

It is in <hi>alienâ republicâ,</hi> a matter of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; you may as well cure the colick by brushing a mans clothes, or fill a mans belly with a syllogisme: these things doe not communicate in matter, and therefore neither in action nor passion; and since all punishments in a prudent government punish the offender to prevent a future crime, and so it proves more medicinall then vindictive, the punitive act being in order to the cure and prevention: and since no punishment of the body can cure a disease in the soule, it is disproportionable in nature, and in all civill government, to punish where the punishment can doe no good. It may be an act of tyrannie, but never of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. For is an opinion ever the more true or false for being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted? Some men have beleeved it the more, as being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into a confidence, and vexed into a resolution, but the thing it selfe is not the truer, and though the hangman may confute a man with an inexplicable dilemma, yet not convince his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, for such premises can inferre no conclusion, but that of a mans life: and a Wolfe may as well give lawes to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as he whose dictates are onely propounded in violence, and writ in bloud. And a dog is as capable of a law as a man, if there be no choice in his obedience, nor discourse in his choice, nor reason to satisfie his discourse. And as it is unnaturall, so it is unreasonable, that <hi>Sempronius</hi> should force <hi>Caius</hi> to be of his opinion, because <hi>Sempronius</hi> is Consul this yeare, and commands the <hi>Lictors:</hi> As if he that can kill a man cannot but be infallible: and if he be not, why should I doe violence to my conscience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can doe violence to my person?</p>

apt to doe hurt; for no man can change his opinion when he will, or be satisfied in his reason that his opinion is false, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause discountenanced. If a man could change his opinion when he lists, he might cure many inconveniences of his life: all his feares and his sorrowes would soone disband, if he would but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his opinion, whereby he is perswaded, that such an accident that afflicts him is an evill, and such an object formidable; let him but beleeve himselfe impregnable, or that he receives a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit when he is plundered, disgraced, imprisoned, condemned, and afflicted, neither his sleeps need to be disturbed, nor his quietnesse discomposed. But if a man cannot change his opinion when helists, nor ever does heartily or resolutely but when he cannot do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then to use force, may make him an hypocrite, but never to be a right beleever, and so instead of erecting a trophee to God and true Religion, we build a Monument for the Devill. Infinite examples are recorded in Church story to this very purpose: But <hi>Socrates</hi> instances in one for all; for when <hi>Eleusius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cyzicum</hi> was threatned by the Emperour <hi>Ualens</hi> with banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confiscation, if he did not subscribe to the decree of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> at last he yeilded to the <hi>Arrian</hi> opinion, and presently fell into great torment of Conscience, openly at <hi>Cyzicum</hi> recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the errour, asked God and the Church forgivenesse, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Emperours injustice, and that was all the good the <hi>Arrian</hi> party got by offering violence to his Conscience.

Now things are best conserved with that which gives it the first being, and which is agreeable to its temper and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. That precept which it chiefly preaches in order to all the blessednesse in the world, that is, of meekness, mercy and charity, should also preserve it selfe and promote its owne interest. For indeed nothing will doe it so well, nothing doth so excellently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate it selfe into the understandings and affections of men, as when the actions and perswasions of a sect, and every part and principle and promotion are univocall. And it would be a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty disparagement to so glorious an institution, that in its principle it should be mercifull and humane, and in the promotion and propagation of it so inhumane: And it would be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and unreasonable that the sword should be used in the perswasion of one proposition, and yet in the perswasion of the whole Religion nothing like it. To doe so, may serve the end of a temporall Prince, but never promote the honour of Christs Kingdome; it may secure a designe of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much disserve Christendome, to offer to support it by that which good men believe to be a distinctive cognisance of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan Religion, from the excellencie and piety of Christianity, whose sense and spirit is described in those excellent words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>The servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, in meeknesse instructing those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging the truth.</hi> They that oppose themselves, must not be strucken by any of Gods servants; and if yet any man will smite these who are his opposites in opinion, he will get nothing by that, he must quit the title of being a servant of God for his paines.

And yet possibly the understanding is lesse subject to humane power then the will, for that humane power hath a command over externall acts which naturally and regularly flow from the will, <hi>&amp; ut plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimùm</hi> suppose a direct act of will, but alwayes either a direct or indirect volition, primary or accidentall; but the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a naturall faculty subject to no command, but where the command is it selfe a reason fit to satisfie and perswade it. And therefore God commanding us to beleeve such revelations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades and satisfies the understanding, by his commanding and revealing: for there is no greater probation in the world that a proposition is true, then because God hath commanded us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. But because no mans command is a satisfaction to the understanding, or a verification of the proposition, therefore the understanding is not subject to humane authority. They may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, but not enjoyne where God hath not; and where God hath, if it appeares so to him, he is an Infidell if he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it. And if all men have no other efficacie or authority on the understanding but by perswasion, proposall and intreaty, then a man is bound to assent but according to the operation of the argument, and the energie of perswasion, neither indeed can he, though he would never so faine, and he that out of feare and too much complyance and desire to be safe, shall desire to bring his understanding with some luxation to the beliefe of humane di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates and authorities, may as often misse of the truth as hit it, but is sure alwaies to lose the comfort of truth, because he beleeves it upon indirect, insufficient, and incompetent arguments: and as his desire it should be so is his best argument that it is so, so the

Saint <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it by not <hi>eating</hi> with them, not bidding them <hi>God speed,</hi> but the persons against whom he decrees so severely, are such as denyed Christ to become in the flesh, direct Antichrists: and let the sentence be as high as it lists in this case, all that I observe is, that since in so damnable doctrines nothing but spirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, separation from the communion of the faithfull was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and prescribed, we cannot pretend to an Apostolicall precedent, if in matters of dispute and innocent question, and of great uncertainty and no malignity we should proceed to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death.</p>

Because it is indefinite, and incompleat, and in order to a further punishment, which if it happens, then the excommunication was the inlet to it, if it does not, the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41208:136"/>
did not signifie halfe so much as the losse of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, much lesse, death. For it may be totally ineffectuall, either by the iniquity of the proceeding, or repentance of the person: and in all times and cases it is a medicine if the man please; if he will not, but perseveres in his impiety, then it is himselfe that brings the Censure to effect, that actuates the judgement and gives a sting, and an energy upon that which otherwise would be <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Secondly, but when it is at worst, it does not kill the Soule, it onely consignes it to that death which it had deserved, and should have received independently from that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Church. Thirdly, and yet excommunication is to admirable purpose; for whether it referres to the person censured or to others, it is prudentiall in it selfe, it is exemplary to others, it is medicinall to all. For the person censured, is by this meanes threatned into piety, and the threatning made the more energe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall upon him because by fiction of Law, or as it were by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall representment the paines of hell are made presentiall to him; and so becomes an act of prudent judicature, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent discipline, and the best instrument of spirituall Government: Because the neerer the threatning is reduced to matter, &amp; the more present and circumstantionable it is made, the more operative it is upon our spirits while they are immerged in matter. And this is the full sense and power of excommunication in its direct intention: consequently and accidentally other evills might follow it, as in the times of the Apostles, the censured persons were buffeted by Satan, and even at this day there is lesse security even to the temporall condition of such a person whom his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall parents have Anathematiz'd. But besides this, I know no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to affirme any thing of excommunication, for the sentence of the Church does but declare, not effect the finall sentence of damnation. Whoever deserves excommunication deserves damnation; and he that repents shall be saved, though he dye out of the Churches externall Communion, and if he does not repent, he shall be damn'd though he was not excommunicate.</p>
                     <p>But suppose it greater then the sentence of corporall death, yet <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> it followes not, because hereticks may be excommunicate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kill'd, for from a greater to a lesse, in a severall kind of things the argument concludes not. It is a greater thing to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41208:136"/>
discourse then to make a shooe, yet he that can doe the greater cannot doe this lesse. An Angell cannot beget a man, &amp; yet he can doe a greater matter in that kind of operations which we terme spirituall and Angelicall. And if this were concluding that whoever may be excommunicate may be kill'd, then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of excommunications the Church is confessed the sole and intire Judge, she is also an absolute disposer of the lives of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. I beleeve this will be but ill doctrine in <hi>Spaine:</hi> for in <hi>Bullâ Coenae Domini</hi> the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> is every year excommunicated on Maunday Thursday; but if by the same power he might also be put to death (as upon this ground he may) the Pope might with more ease be invested in that part of S. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony which that King hath invaded and surpriz'd. But besides this, it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme harsh Doctrine in a Roman Consistory, from whence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications issue for trifles, for fees, for not suffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves infinitely to be oppressed, for any thing; if this be greater then death, how great a tyrannie is that which does more then kill men for less then trifles, or else how inconsequent is that argument which concludes its purpose upon so false pretence &amp; supposition?</p>
                     <p>Well, however zealous the Apostles were against hereticks, yet none were by them, or their dictates put to death. The death of <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and the blindnesse of <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer amount not to this, for they were miraculous inflictions: and the first was a punishment to Vow-breach and Sacriledge, the second of Sorcery, and open contestation against the Religion of Jesus Christ; neither of them concerned the case of this present questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or if the case were the same, yet the authority is not the same: For he that inflicted these punishments was infallible, and of a power competent: But no man at this day is so. But as yet, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were converted by Miracles, &amp; Preaching, and Disputing, and Hereticks by the same meanes were redargued, and all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, none tortured for their opinion. And this continued till Christian people were vexed by disagreeing persons, and were impatient and peevish, by their owne too much confidence and the luxuriancy of a prosperous fortune: but then they would not endure persons that did dogmatize any thing which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon their reputation or their interest. And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that no man, nor no age did ever teach the lawfullnesse of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41208:137"/>
putting hereticks to death, till they grew wanton with prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But when the reputation of the Governours was concerned, when the interests of men were indangered, when they had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lose, when they had built their estimation upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of disputable questions, when they began to be jealous of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, when they over-valued themselves and their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, when some persons invaded Bishopricks upon pretence of new opinions, then they as they thrived in the favour of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and in the successe of their disputes, sollicited the temporall power to banish, to fine, to imprison, and to kill their adversaries.</p>
                     <p>So that the case stands thus. In the best times, amongst the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> best men, when there were fewer temporall ends to be served, when Religion and the pure and simple designes of Christianity were onely to be promoted; in those times and amongst such men, no persecution was actuall, nor perswaded nor allowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards disagreeing persons. But as men had ends of their owne and not of Christs, as they receded from their duty, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from its purity, as Christ anity began to be compounded with interests, and blended with temporall designes, so men were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted for their opinions. This is most apparent, if we consider when persecution first came in, and if we observe how it was chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the holiest and the wisest persons.</p>
                     <p>The first great instance I shall note was in <hi>Priscillian</hi> and his <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> followers, who were condemned to death by the Tyrant <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Which instance although S. <hi>Hierom</hi> observes as a punishment, and judgement for the crime of heresie, yet is of no use in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent question, because <hi>Maximus</hi> put some Christians of all sorts to death promiscuously, Catholike and Heretick without choyce, and therefore the Priscilianists might as well have called it a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Catholiques, as the Catholiques upon them.</p>
                     <p>But when <hi>Ursatus</hi> and <hi>Stacius,</hi> two Bishops, procured the Priscilianists death by the power they had at Court: S. <hi>Martin</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> was so angry at them for their cruelty, that he excommunicated them both. And S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon the same stock denyed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to the <hi>Itaciani.</hi> And the account that <hi>Sulpitius</hi> gives of the story is this, <hi>Hoc modo</hi> (sayes he) <hi>homines luce indignissimi pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo exemplo necati sunt.</hi> The example was worse then the men.

And there were some Divines in the Lower <hi>Germany,</hi> who upon great reasons spake against the tyrannie of the Inquisition, and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Prophesying, who yet when they had shaked off the Spanish yoke, began to persecute their Brethren. It was unjust in them, in all men unreasonable and uncharitable, and often increases the error, but never lessens the danger.</p>
                     <p>But yet although the Church, I mean, in her distinct &amp; Clericall capacity, was against destroying or punishing difference in opinion, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> till the Popes of Rome did super-seminate and perswade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yet the Bishops did perswade the Emperours to make Lawes against Heretiques, and to punish disobedient persons with fines, with imprisonment, with death and banishment respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This indeed calls us to a new account. For the Church-men might not proceed to bloud nor corporall inflictions, but might they not deliver over to the Secular arme, and perswade Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes to doe it? For this, I am to say, that since it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that the doctrine of the Clergie was against punishing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, the Lawes which were made by the Emperours against them might be for restraint of differing Religion in order to the preservation of the publique peace, which is too frequently viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the division of opinions. But I am not certaine whether that was alwayes the reason, or whether or no some Bishops of the Court did not also serve their owne ends in giving their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces such untoward counsell; but we find the Lawes made severally

If the Judges be good and prudent, the error of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will not be great, nor ordinary, and there can be no better establishment of humane judicature, then is a fallible proceeding upon an infallible ground; And if the judgement of heresie be made by estimate and proportion of the opinion to a good or a bad life respectively, supposing an error in the deduction, there will be no malice in the conclusion; and that he endeavours to secure piety according to the best of his understanding, and yet did mistake in his proceeding, is onely an argument that he did his duty after the manner of men, possibly with the piety of a Saint, though not with the understanding of an Angel. And the little inconvenience that happens to the person injuriously judged is abundantly made up in the excellency of the Discipline, the goodnesse of the example, the care of the publike, and all those great influences into the manners of men which derive from such an act so publiquely consign'd. But such publique judgement in matters of opinion must be seldome and curious, and never but to secure piety, and a holy life; for in matters speculative, as all determinations are fallible, so scarce any of them are to purpose, nor ever able to make compensation of either side, either for the publike fraction, or the particular injustice if it should so happen in the censure.</p>
                     <p>But then as the Church may proceed thus far, yet no Christian man, or Community of men may proceed farther. For if they <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> be deceived in their judgement and censure, and yet have passed onely spirituall censures, they are totally ineffectuall, and come to nothing, there is no effect remaining upon the soule, and such censures are not to meddle with the body so much as indirectly. But if any other judgement passe upon persons erring, such judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whose effects remaine, if the person be unjustly censured nothing will answer and make compensation for such injuries. If a person be excommunicate unjustly, it will doe him no hurt, but if he be killed or dismembred unjustly, that censure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is not made ineffectuall by his innocence, he is certainly kill'd and dismembred. So that as the Churches authority in such cases so restrained and made prudent, cautelous, and orderly, is just and competent: so the proceeding is reasonable, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident

And as there may be pertinacy in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, so there may be pertinacy in judging, and both are faults. The peace of the Church and the unity of her doctrine is best conserved when it is judged by the proportion it hath to that rule of unity which the Apostles gave, that is the Creed for Articles of meer beliefe, and the precepts of Jesus Christ, and the practicall rules of piety, which are most plaine and easie, and without controversie, set downe in the Gospels, and Writings of the Apostles. But to multiply articles, and adopt them into the family of the faith, and to require assent to such articles which (as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase is) are of doubtfull disputation, equall to that assent wee give to matters of faith, is to build a Tower upon the top of a Bulrush, and the further the effect of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings does extend, the worse they are; the very making
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41208:140"/>
such a Law is unreasonable, the inflicting spirituall censures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that cannot doe so much violence to their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as to obey it, is unjust and ineffectuall; but to punish the person with death, or with corporall infliction, indeed it is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, but it is therefore tyrannicall. We have seen what the Church may doe towards restraining false or differing opinions, next I shall consider by way of Corollarie what the Prince may doe as for his interest, and onely in securing his people, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ends of true Religion.</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.</note> that great question, Whether it be lawfull for a Prince to give toleration to severall Religions.</p>
                     <p>For first, it is a great fault that men will call the severall sects of Christians by the names of severall Religions. The Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of JESUS CHRIST is the forme of sound doctrine and wholsome words, which is set downe in Scripture indefinitely, actually conveyed to us by plaine places, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as for the question of necessary or not necessary by the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the Apostles. Those impertinencies which the wantonness and vanity of men hath commenced, which their interests have promoted, which serve not truth so much as their own ends, are farre from being distinct Religions; for matters of opinion are no parts of the worship of God, nor in order to it, but as they promote obedience to his Commandments; and when they contribute towards it, are in that proportion as they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute parts and actions, and minute particulars of that Religion to whose end they doe, or pretend to serve. And such are all the sects and all the pretences of Christians, but pieces and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of Christianity, if they doe serve the great end, as every man for his owne sect and interest beleeves for his share it does.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41208:141"/>
2. Tolleration hath a double sense or purpose, for sometimes by it men understand a publick licence and exercise of a sect: Sometimes it is onely an indemnity of the persons privately to convene and to opine as they see cause, and as they meane to ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to God. Both these are very much to the same purpose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse some persons whom we are bound to satisfie be scandaliz'd, and then the Prince is bound to doe as he is bound to satisfie. To God it is all one. For abstracting from the offence of persons, which is to be considered just as our obligation is to content the persons, it is all one whether we indulge to them to meet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely or privately, to do actions of Religion concerning which we are not perswaded that they are truely holy. To God it is just one to be in the dark and in the light, the thing is the same, onely the Circumstance of publick and private is different, which cannot be concerned in any thing, nor can it concerne any thing but the matter of Scandall and relation to the minds and fantasies of certaine persons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. So that to tolerate is not to persecute. And the question <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> whether the Prince may tollerate divers perswasions, is no more then whether he may lawfully persecute any man for not being of his opinion. Now in this case he is just so to tollerate diversity of perswasions as he is to tolerate publike actions, for no opinion is judicable, nor no person punishable, but for a sin, and if his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by reason of its managing, or its effect, be a sinne in it selfe, or becomes a sinne to the person, then as he is to doe towards other sinnes, so to that opinion or man so opining. But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve so, or not so, when there is no more but meere beleeving, is not in his power to enjoyne, therefore not to punish. And it is not onely lawfull to tollerate disagreeing perswasions, but the authority of God onely is competent to take notice of it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to determine it, and fit to judge, and therefore no humane authority is sufficient to doe all those things which can justifie the inflicting temporall punishments upon such as doe not conforme in their perswasions to a rule or authority which is not only fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, but supposed by the disagreeing person to be actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>But I consider that in the toleration of a different opinion, <note place="margin">

Religion is not properly and immediately concerned, so as in any degree to be endangered. For it may be safe in diversity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, and it also a part of Christian <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Humani iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis peteslatis, unicuique quod putaverit, cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Sed nec re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis est co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere religionem, quae suscipi sponte debet, non vi.</hi> Tertul. ad Scapulam.</note> Religion that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mens Consciences should be preserved in all things, where God hath not set a limit and made a restraint; that the soule of man should be free, and acknowledge no master but Jesus Christ; that matters spirituall should not be restrain'd by purishments corporall; that the same meekenesse and charity should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the promotion of Christianity, that gave it foundation and increment, &amp; firmness in its first publication; that conclusions should not be more dogmaticall then the vertuall resolution and efficacy of the premises: And that the persons should not more certainly be condemned then their opinions confuted; and lastly, that the infirmities of men and difficulties of things should be both put in ballance to make abatement in the definitive sentence against mens persons. But then because tolleration of opinions is not properly a question of Religion, it may be a question of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And although a man may be a good Christian, though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve an errour not fundamentall, and not directly or evidently impious, yet his opinion may accidentally disturbe the publick peace through the over-activenesse of the person, and the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their beliefe and the opinion of its appendant necessity, and therefore tolleration of differing perswasions in these cases is to be considered upon politicall grounds, and is just so to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or denyed as the opinions or tolleration of them may consist with the publicke and necessary ends of Government. Onely this: As Christian Princes must looke to the interest of their Government, so especially must they consider the interests of Christianity, &amp; not call every redargution or modest discovery of an established errour, by the name of disturbance of the peace. For it is very likely that the peevishness and impatience of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Governours may break the peace. Let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but the gentlenesse of Christianity, the Liberty of Consciences which ought to be preserved, and let them doe justice to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whoever they are that are peevish, provided no mans person be over-born with prejudice. For if it be necessary for all men to subscribe to the present established Religion, by the same reason
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41208:142"/>
at another time a man may be bound to subscribe to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, and so to all Religions in the world. And they only, who by their too much confidence intitle God to all their fancies, and make them to be questions of Religion, and evidences for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or consignations to Hell, they onely think this doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, and they are the men that first disturb the Churches peace, and then thinke there is no appeasing the tumult but by getting the victory. But they that consider things wisely, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that since salvation and damnation depend not upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, and yet that publick peace and tranquillity may, the Prince is in this case to seeke how to secure Government, and the issues and intentions of that, while there is in these cases di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly no insecurity to Religion, unlesse by the accidentall uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse of them that dispute: Which uncharitablenesse is also much prevented when the publike peace is secured, and no person is on either side ingaged upon <note n="*" place="margin">Dextera prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuè capit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgentia men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The first consideration is, that since diversity of opinions does <note place="margin">

persons truely weake, and but pretending so. For all that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, are to be allowed the same liberty whatsoever it be; for no mans spirit is knowne to any, but to God and himselfe: and therefore pretences and realityes in this case, are both alike in order to the publike toleration. And this very thing is one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perswade a Negative. For the chiefe thing in this case is the concernment of publique government, which is then most of all violated, when what may prudently be permitted to some purposes, may be demanded to many more, and the piety of the Lawes abused to the impiety of other mens ends. And if laws be made so malleable, as to comply with weak consciences, he that hath a mind to disobey, is made impregnable against the coercitive power of the Law by this pretence. For a weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science signifyes nothing in this case, but a dislike of the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a contrary perswasion. For if some weak consciences doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the law, and others doe not, it is not their weaknesse inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely that is the cause of it, but a definite and particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion to the contrary. So that if such a pretence be excuse suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient from obeying, then the law is a sanction obliging every one to obey that hath a mind to it, and he that hath not, may choose, that is, it is no Law at all, for he that hath a mind to it may doe it if there be no Law, and he that hath no mind to it need not for all the Law.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the wit of man cannot prudently frame a law <note place="margin">

If therefore there be any on the right side as confident and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as they who are on the wrong side, then the disagreeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not to be complyed with, to avoid giving offence; for if they be, offence is given to better persons, and so the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, which such complying seeks to prevent, is made greater and more unjust, obedience is discouraged, and disobedience is legally canonized for the result of a holy and a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> the totall overthrow of all Discipline, and it is better to make no Lawes of publique worship, then to rescind them in the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: and there can be no end in making the sanction, but to make the Law ridiculous, and the authority contemptible. For to say that complying with weake consciences in the very framing of a Law of Discipline, is the way to preserve unity, were all one as to say, To take away all Lawes is the best way to prevent disobedience. In such matters of indifferencie, the best way of cementing the fraction, is to unite the parts in the authority, for then the question is but one, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the authority must be obeyed or not? But if a permission be given of disputing the particulars, the questions become next to infinite. A Mirrour when it is broken represents the object multiplyed and divided: but if it be entire and through one centre transmits the species to the eye, the Vision is one and naturall. Lawes are the Mirrour in which men are to dresse and compose their actions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must not be broken with such clauses of exception which may without remedy be abused to the prejudice of authority, and peace, and all humane sanctions. And I have knowne in some Churches that this pretence hath been nothing but a designe to discredit the Law, to dismantle the authority that made it, to

raise their owne credit, and a trophey of their zeale, to make it a characteristick note of a sect, and the cognisance of holy persons, and yet the men that claim'd exemption from the Lawes, upon pretence of having weake consciences, if in hearty expression you had told them so to their heads, they would have spit in your face, and were so farre from confessing themselves weake, that they thought themselves able to give Lawes to Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to instruct the greatest Clerks, and to Catechize the Church her selfe; And which is the worst of all, they who were perpetually clamorous that the severity of the Lawes should slacken as to their particular, and in matter adiapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (in which, if the Church hath any authority, she hath power to make Lawes) to indulge a leave to them to doe as they list, yet were the most imperious amongst men, most decretory in their sentences, and most impatient of any disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them though in the least minute and particular: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by all the justice of the world, they who perswade such a complyance in matters of fact, and of so little question, should not deny to tolerate persons that differ in questions of great difficulty and contestation.</p>

And therefore if there be a publike disposition in some persons to dislike Lawes of a certaine quality, if it before-seene it is to be considered <hi>in lege dicendâ;</hi> and whatever inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or particular offence is fore-seene, is either to be directly avoided in the Law, or else a compensation in the excellency of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41208:144"/>
the Law, and certaine advantages, made to out-weigh their pretensions: But <hi>in lege jam dictâ,</hi> because there may be a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty some persons should have a liberty indulged them, it is necessary that the Governours of the Church should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with a power to consider the particular case, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a liberty to the person, and grant personall dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This I say is to be done at severall times, upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular instance, upon singular consideration, and new emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But that a whole kind of men, such a kind to which all men without possibility of being confuted may pretend, should at once in the very frame of the Law be permitted to disobey, is to nullifie the Law, to destroy Discipline, and to hallow dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; it takes away the obliging part of the Law, and makes that the thing enacted shall not be enjoyn'd, but tolerated onely: it destroyes unity and uniformity, which to preserve was the very end of such lawes of Discipline: it bends the rule to the thing which is to be ruled, so that the law obeyes the subject, not the subject the law: it is to make a law for particulars, not upon generall reason and congruity, against the prudence and designe of all Lawes in the world, and absolutely without the example of any Church in Christendome; it prevents no scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, for some will be scandalized at the authority it selfe, some at the complying, and remisnesse of Discipline, and severall men at matters, and upon ends contradictory: All which cannot, some ought not to be complyed withall.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The summe is this. The end of the Lawes of Discipline are in an immediate order to the conservation and ornament of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.</note> publique, and therefore the Lawes must not so tolerate, as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving persons to destroy themselves and the publike benefit, but if there be cause for it, they must be cassated, or if there be no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause, the complyings must be so as may best preserve the particulars in conjunction with the publike end, which because it is primarily intended, is of greatest consideration. But the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars whether of case or person are to be considered occasionally and emergently by the Judges, but cannot antecedently and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly be determined by a Law.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>A particular consideration of the opinions of the Anabaptists.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the Anabaptists I consider onely their two capitall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one against the baptisme of infants, the other against <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.</note> Magistracy: and because they produce different judgements and various effects, all their other fancyes which vary as the Moon does, may stand or fall in their proportion and likenesse to these.</p>
                     <p>And first I consider their denying baptisme to infants; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a doctrine justly condemned by the most sorts of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> Christians, upon great grounds of reason, yet possibly their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence may be so great, as to take off much, and rebate the edge of their adversaries assault. It will be neither unpleasant nor unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to draw a short scheme of plea for each party, the result of which possibly may be, that though they be deceived, yet they have so great excuse on their side, that their errour is not impudent or vincible. The baptisme of infants rests wholly upon this discourse.</p>
                     <p>When God made a covenant with Abraham for himselfe and his posterity, into which the Gentiles were reckoned by sprituall <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> adoption, he did for the present consigne that covenant with the Sacrament of circumcision. The extent of which rite, was to all his family, from the <hi>Major domo,</hi> to the <hi>Proselytus domicilio,</hi> and to infants of eight dayes old. Now the very nature of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being a covenant of faith for its formallity, and with all faithfull people for the object; and circumcision being a seale of this covenant, if ever any rite doe supervene to consigne the same covenant, that rite must acknowledge circumcision for its type and precedent. And this the Apostle tels us in expresse doctrine. Now the nature of types, is to give some proportions to its suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour the Antitype, and they both being seales of the same righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of faith, it will not easily be found where these two seales have any such distinction in their nature or purposes, as to appertaine to persons of differing capacity, and not equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all, and this argument was thought of so much force by some of those excellent men which were Bishops in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive church, that a good Bishop writ an Epistle to <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41208:146"/>
know of him whether or no it were lawfull to baptize infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eighth day, because the type of baptisme was ministred in that circumcision, he in his discourse supposing that the first rite was a direction to the second, which prevailed with him so farre as to believe it to limit every circumstance.</p>
                     <p>And not onely this type, but the acts of Christ which were <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> previous to the institution of baptisme did prepare our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by such impresses as were sufficient to produce such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion in us, that Christ intended this ministery for the actuall advantage of infants as well as of persons of understanding. For Christ commanded that children should be brought unto him, he took them in his armes, he imposed hands on them and blessed them, and without question did by such acts of favour consigne his love to them, and them to a capacity of an eternall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of it. And possibly the invitation which Christ made to all to come to him, all them that are heavy laden, did in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion concerne infants as much as others, if they be guilty of Originall sinne, and if that sinne be a burthen, and presses them to any spirituall danger or inconvenience. And it is all the reason of the world, that since the grace of Christ is as large as the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication of <hi>Adam,</hi> all they who are made guilty by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> should be cleansed by the second. But as they are guilty by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans act, so they should be brought to the Font, to be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by others, there being the same proportion of reason, that by others acts, they should be relieved who were in danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing by the act of others. And therefore <hi>S. Austin</hi> argues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently to this purpose. <hi>Accommodat illis mater Ecclesia aliorum pedes, ut veniant; aliorum cor, ut credant; aliorum linguam, ut fate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur: ut quoniam quod aegri sunt, alio peccante praegravantur, sic cum</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But whether they have originall sinne or no, yet take them <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> they cannot goe to God, or attaine to eternity: <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> to which they were intended in their first being and creation, and therefore much lesse since their naturals are impair'd by the curse on humane nature, procur'd by <hi>Adams</hi> prevarication. And if a naturall agent cannot <hi>in puris naturalibus</hi> attaine to heaven,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41208:146"/>
which is a supernaturall end, much lesse when it is loaden with accidentall and grievous impediments. Now then since the only way revealed to us of acquiring Heaven is by Jesus Christ; and the first inlet into Christianity, and accesse to him is by Baptism, as appears by the perpetuall Analogy of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; either Infants are not persons capable of that end which is the perfection of humane nature, and to which the soule of man in its being made immortall was essentially design'd, and so are miserable and deficient from the very end of humanity, if they die before the use of reason; or else they must be brought to Christ by the Church doores, that is by the Font and waters of Baptism.</p>
                     <p>And in reason, it seemes more pregnant and plausible that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants rather then men of understanding should be baptized: For <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> since the efficacy of the Sacraments depends upon Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and immediate benediction, and that they produce their effects independently upon man, in them that doe not hinder their operation; since Infants cannot by any act of their own promote the hope of their own salvation, which men of reason and choice may, by acts of vertue &amp; election; it is more agreeable to the goodnesse of God, the honour and excellency of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the necessity of its institution that it should in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants supply the want of humane acts and free obedience. Which the very thing it selfe seemes to say it does, because its effect is from God, and requires nothing on man's part, but that its efficary bee not hindered: And then in Infants, the disposition is equall, and the necessity more: they cannot <hi>ponere obicens,</hi> and by the same reason cannot doe others acts, which without the Sacraments doe advantage us towards our hopes of heaven, and therefore have more need to be supplyed by an act, and an Institution Divine and supernaturall.</p>
                     <p>And this is not only necessary in respect of the condition of Infants in capacity, to doe acts of grace, but also in obedience <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> to Divine precept. For Christ made a Law whose Sanction is with an exclusive negative to them that are not baptized, <hi>[Unlesse a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the Kingdome of heaven;</hi>] If then Infants have a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being co-heires with Christ in the Kingdome of his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41208:147"/>
Father, as Christ affirms they have, by saying <hi>[for of such is the kingdome of heaven</hi>] then there is a necessity that they should be brought to Baptism, there being an absolute exclusion of all persons unbaptized, and all persons not spirituall from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</p>
                     <p>But indeed, it is a destruction of all the hopes and happinesse of Infants, a denying to them an exemption from the finall <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.</note> condition of Beasts and Insectiles, or else a designing of them to a worse misery, to say that God hath not appointed some externall or internall meanes of bringing them to an eternall happinesse: Internall they have none; for Grace being an improvement and heigthning the faculties of nature, in order to a heigthen'd and supernaturall end, Grace hath no influence or efficacy upon their faculties, who can do no naturall acts of understanding: And if there be no externall meanes, then they are destitute of all hopes, and possibilities of salvation.</p>
                     <p>But thanks be to God, he hath provided better and told us <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> accordingly, for he hath made a promise of the holy Ghost to Infants as well as to men: <hi>The Promise is made to you and to your children,</hi> said S. <hi>Peter; The Promise of the Father, the Promise that he would send the holy Ghost:</hi> Now if you ask how this Promise shall be convey'd to our children, we have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse out of the same Sermon of S. <hi>Peter, Be baptized, and ye</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Act. 2. 38. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost;</hi> So that therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the holy Ghost is promised, and Baptism is the meanes of receiving the Promise, therefore Baptism pertaines to them, to whom the Promise which is the effect of Baptism does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine. And that we may not think this Argument is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, or of humane collection, observe that it is the Argument of the same Apostle in expresse termes: For in the case of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> and his Family, he justified his proceeding by this very medium, <hi>Shall we deny Baptism to them who have received the gift of the holy Ghost as well as we?</hi> Which Discourse if it be reduced to form of Argument sayes this; They that are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the same Grace are receptive of the same sign; but then (to make the Syllogism up with an assumption proper to our present purpose) Infants are capable of the same Grace, that is of the holy Ghost (for the Promise is made to our Children
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41208:147"/>
as well as to us, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes the Children of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are holy, and therefore have the holy Ghost who is the Fountaine of holinesse and sanctification) therefore they are to receive the sign and the seale of it, that is, the Sacrament of Baptism.</p>
                     <p>And indeed since God entred a Covenant with the Jewes, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> which did also actually involve their Children, and gave them a sign to establish the Covenant, and its appendant Promise, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God does not so much love the Church as he did the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and the mercies of the Gospel are more restrain'd, then the mercies of the Law, God having made a Covenant with the Infants of <hi>Israel,</hi> and none with the Children of Christian Parents; or if he hath, yet we want the comfort of its Consignation; and unlesse our Children are to be baptiz'd, and so intitled to the Promises of the new Covenant, as the Jewish Babes were by Circumcision, this mercy which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to Infants is so secret and undeclar'd and unconsign'd, that wee want much of that mercy and outward Testimony which gave them comfort and assurance.</p>
                     <p>And in proportion to these Precepts and Revelations was the practise Apostolicall: For they (to whom Christ gave in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.</note> Precept to make Disciples all Nations baptizing them, and knew that Nations without Children never were, and that therefore they were passively concern'd in that commission,) baptized whole Families, particularly that of <hi>Stephanus</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, in which it is more then probable there were some Minors if not sucking Babes. And this practise did descend upon the Church in after Ages by Tradition Apostolicall: Of this we have sufficient Testimony from <hi>Origen, Pro hoc Ecclesia</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In Rom. 6. tom. 2. pag. 543.</note> 
                        <hi>ab Apostolis traditionem accepit, etiam parvulis baptismum dare:</hi> And S. <hi>Austin, Hoc Ecclesia à majorum fide percepit:</hi> And <note place="margin">Serm. 10. de verb. Apost. c. 2.</note> generally all Writers (as <hi>Calvin</hi> sayes) affirm the same thing: For <hi>nullus est Scriptor tam vetustus, qui non ejus originem ad Apostolorum saeculum pro certo referat.</hi> From hence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion <note place="margin">4. Instir. cap. 16. §. 8.</note> is, that Infants ought to be baptiz'd, that it is simply necessary, that they who deny it are Hereticks, and such are not to be endured because they deny to Infants hopes and take away the possibility of their salvation, which is revealed to us
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41208:148"/>
on no other condition of which they are capable but Baptism. For by the insinuation of the Type, by the action of Christ, by the title Infants have to Heaven, by the precept of the Gospel, by the Energy of the Promise, by the reasonablenesse of the thing, by the infinite necessity on the Infants part, by the practise Apostolcall, by their Tradition, and the universall practise of the Church; by all these God and good people proclaime the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, the conveniency, and the necessity of Infants Baptism.</p>
                     <p>To all this, the <hi>Anabaptist</hi> gives a soft and gentle Answer, that it is a goodly harangue, which upon strict examination will <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> come to nothing, that it pretends fairely and signifies little; That some of these Allegations are false, some impertinent, and all the rest insufficient.</p>
                     <p>For the Argument from Circumcision is invalid upon infinite <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.</note> considerations; Figures and Types prove nothing, unlesse a Commandement goe along with them, or some expresse to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie such to be their purpose: For the Deluge of Waters and the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> were a figure of Baptism said <hi>Peter;</hi> and if therefore the circumstances of one should be drawn to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we should make Baptism a prodigy rather then a Rite: The Paschall Lamb was a Type of the Eucharist which succeeds the other as Baptism does to Circumcision; but because there was in the manducation of the Paschall Lamb, no prescription of Sacramentall drink, shall we thence conclude that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is to be ministred but in one kind? And even in the very instance of this Argument, supposing a correspondence of analogy between Circumcision and Baptism, yet there is no correspondence of identity: For although it were granted that both of them did consign the Covenant of Faith, yet there is nothing in the circumstance of childrens being circumcised that so concernes that Mystery, but that it might very well be given to Children, and yet Baptism only to men of reason; because Circumcision left a Character in the flesh, which being imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon Infants did its work to them when they came to age; and such a Character was necessary because there was no word added to the sign; but Baptism imprints nothing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines on the body, and if it leaves a Character at all it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soule, to which also the word is added which is as much
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41208:148"/>
a part of the Sacrament as the signe it selfe is; for both which reasons, it is requisite that the persons baptized should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reason, that they may be capable both of the word of the Sacrament, and the impresse made upon the Spirit: Since therefore the reason of this parity does wholly faile, there is no thing left to inferre a necessity of complying in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of age any more then in the other annexes of the Type: And the case is cleare in the Bishop's Question to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> for why shall not Infants be baptized just upon the <note place="margin">L. 3. Epist. 8. ad Fidum.</note> eighth day as well as circumcised? If the correspondence of the Rites be an Argument to inferre one circumstance which is impertinent and accidentall to the mysteriousnesse of the Rite, why shall it not inferre all? And then also Femals must not be baptiezd, because they were not circumcised: But it were more proper if we would understand it right, to prosecute the analogy from the Type to the Anti-type by way of letter and spirit, and signification, and as Circumcision figures Baptism, so also the adjuncts of the Circumcision shall signifie something, spirituall, in the adherencies of Baptism: And therefore as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were circumcised, so spirituall Infants shall be baptized, which is spirituall Circumcision; for therfore Babes had the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Type, to signifie that we must when we give our names to Christ become <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> children in malice, <hi>[for unlesse you become like one of these little ones, you cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven</hi>] said our blessed Saviour, and then the Type is made compleat. And this seemes to have been the sense of the Primitive Church; for in the Age next to the Apostles they gave to all baptized persons milk and honey to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to them their duty, that though in age and understanding they were men, yet they were Babes in Christ, and children in malice. But to inferre the sense of the Paedo-baptists is so weak a manner of arguing that <hi>Austin</hi> whose device it was (and men use to bee in love with their own fancies) at the most pretended it but as probable and a meare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
                     <p>And as ill successe will they have with the other Arguments as with this; For from the action of Christs blessing Infants <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.</note> to inferre that they are to be baptized, proves nothing so much
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41208:149"/>
as that there is great want of better Arguments; The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion would be with more probability derived thus: Christ blessed children and so dismissed them, but baptized them not, therefore Insants are not to be baptized: But let this be as weak as its enemy, yet that Christ did not baptize them, is an Argument sufficient that Christ hath other wayes of bringing them to heaven then by baptism, he passed his act of grace upon them by benediction and imposition of hands.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, although neither Infants nor any man in <hi>puris naturalibus</hi> can attain to a supernaturall end without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.</note> of some instrument or meanes of Gods appointing ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and regularly, yet where God hath not appointed a Rule nor an Order, as in the case of Infants we contend he hath not, the Argument is invalid. And as we are sure that God hath not commanded Infants to be baptized; so we are sure God will doe them no injustice, nor damn them for what they cannot help.</p>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</note> laid to the charge of Infants, so as to be sufficient to condemn them; or if it could, yet the mercy and absolute goodnesse of God will secure them, if he takes them away before they can glorifie him with a free obedience; <hi>Quid ergo festinat innocens aetas ad remissionem peccatorum,</hi> was the Question of <hi>Tertullian, (lib. de bapt.)</hi> he knew no such danger from their Originall guilt as to drive them to a laver of which in that Age of innocence they had no need, as he conceived. And therefore, there is no necessity of flying to the help of others, for tongue, and heart, and faith, and predispositions to baptism; for what need all this stirre? as Infants without their own consent, without any act of their own; and without any exteriour solennity contracted the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, and so are lyable to all the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which can with justice descend upon his posterity who are personally innocent; so Infants shall be restored without any solennity or act of their own, or of any other men for them, by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> by the redemption of Jesus Christ, by his righteousnesse and mercies applyed either immediatly, or how or when he shall be pleased to appoint. And so <hi>Austin's</hi>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:41208:149"/>
Argument will come to nothing without any need of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, or the faith of any body else. And it is too narrow a conception of God Almighty, because he hath tyed us to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Ceremonies of his own institution, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath tyed himselfe to it. Many thousand wayes there are by which God can bring any reasonable soule to himselfe: But nothing is more unreasonable, then because he hath tyed all men of years and discretion to this way, therefore we of our own heads shall carry Infants to him that way without his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: The conceit is poore and low, and the action conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to it is too bold and ventrous, <hi>mysterium meum mihi &amp; filiis domus meae:</hi> Let him doe what he please to Infants, wee must not.</p>
                     <p>Only this is certain, that God hath as great care of Infants as of others, and because they have no capacity of doing such acts <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.</note> as may be in order to acquiring salvation, God will by his own immediate mercy bring them thither where he hath intended them; but to say that therefore he will doe it by an externall act and ministery, and that confin'd to a particular, <hi>viz.</hi> This Rite and no other, is no good Argument, unlesse God could not doe it without such meanes, or that he had said he would not: And why cannot God as well doe his mercies to Infants now immediately, as he did before the institution either of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision or Baptism?</p>
                     <p>However, there is no danger that Infants should perish for want of this externall Ministery, much lesse for prevaricating <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.</note> Christs precept of <hi>Nisiquis renatus fuerit, &amp;c.</hi> For first, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Spirit in this place signifie the same thing; and by Water is meant the effect of the Spirit, cleansing and purifying the Soule, as appears in its parallel place of Christ baptizing with the Spirit and with Fire. For although this was literally fulfilled in Pentecost, yet morally there is more in it, for it is the sign of the effect of the holy Ghost, and his productions upon the soule; and it was an excellency of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's office, that he baptizes <hi>all</hi> that come to him with the holy Ghost and with fire; for so S. <hi>John</hi> preferring Christs mission and office before his own, tells the Jewes, not Christ's Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that Christ shall baptize them with Fire and the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41208:150"/>
that is, <hi>all that come to him, as John the Baptist</hi> did with water, for so lies the Antithesis: And you may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Infants must also passe through the fire as through the water. And that we may not think this a trick to elude the pressure of this place, <hi>Peter</hi> sayes the same thing; for when he had said that Baptism saves us, he addes by way of explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>[not the washing of the flesh, but the confidence of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science towards God</hi>] plainly saying that it is not water, or the purifying of the body, but the cleansing of the Spirit, that does that which is supposed to be the effect of Baptism; and if our Saviour's exclusive negative be expounded by analogy to this of <hi>Peter,</hi> as certainly the other parallel instance must, and this may, then it will be so farre from proving the necessity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptism, that it can conclude for no man that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to the Rite; and the doctrine of the Baptism is only to derive from the very words of Institution, and not be forced from words which were spoken before it was Ordain'd. But to let passe this advantage, and to suppose it meant of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Baptism, yet this no more inferres a necessity of Infant's Baptism, then the other words of Christ inferre a necessity to give them the holy Communion, <hi>Nisi comederitis carnem filii hominis, &amp; biberitis sangninem, non introibitis in regnum coelonum;</hi> and yet we doe not think these words sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to communicate them; if men therefore will doe us Justice, either let them give both Sacraments to Infants, as some Ages of the Church did, or neither. For the wit of man is not able to shew a disparity in the Sanction, or in the Energie of its expression. And therefore they were honest that understood the obligation to be parallel, and performed it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and yet because we say they were deceived in one instance, and yet the obligation (all the world cannot reasonably say but) is the same; they are as honest and as reasonable that doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And since the Ancient Church did with an equall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of necessity give them the Communion, and yet men now<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>adayes do not, why shall men be more burthened with a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and a name of obloquy, for not giving the Infants one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more then they are disliked for not affording them the other. If <hi>Anabaptist</hi> shall be a name of digrace, why shall not some
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41208:150"/>
other name be invented for them that deny to communicate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which shall be equally disgracefull, or else both the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions signified by such names, be accounted no disparagement, but receive their estimate according to their truth?</p>
                     <p>Of which truth since we are now taking account from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.</note> of Scripture, it is considerable that the discourse of S. <hi>Peter</hi> which is pretended for the intitling Infants to the Promise of the holy Ghost, and by consequence to Baptism, which is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be its instrument and conveyance, is wholly a fancy, and hath in it nothing of certainty or demonstration, and not much probability. For besides that the thing it selfe is unreasonable, and the holy Ghost works by the heigthning and improving our naturall faculties, and therefore is a promise that so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes them as they are reasonable creatures, and may have a title to it, in proportion to their nature, but no possession or reception of it, till their faculties come into act; besides this, I say, the words mentioned in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon (which are the only record of the promise) are interpreted upon a weak mistake: The promise belongs to you and to your children, therefore Infants are actually receptive of it in that capacity. That's the Argument; but the reason of it is not yet discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor ever will, for <hi>[to you and your children</hi>] is to you and your posterity, to you &amp; your children when they are of the same capacity, in which you are effectually receptive of the promise: But he that when ever the word <hi>[children</hi>] is used in Scripture shall by <hi>[children</hi>] understand Infants, must needs believe that in all <hi>Israel</hi> there were no men, but all were Infants; and if that had been true, it had beene the greater wonder they should overcome the <hi>Anakims</hi> and beat the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> and march so farre, and discourse so well, for they were all called the children of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the Allegation of S. <hi>Paul</hi> that Infants are holy, if <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.</note> their Parents be faithfull, it signifies nothing but that they are holy by designation, just as <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>John Baptist</hi> were sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their Mothers womb, that is they were appointed and design'd for holy Ministeries; but had not received the Promise of the Father the gift of the holy Ghost, for all that sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and just so the Children of Christian Parents are sanctified,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41208:151"/>
that is design'd to the service of Jesus Christ, and the future participation of the Promises.</p>
                     <p>And as the Promise appertaines not (for ought appears) to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</note> Infants in that capacity and consistence, but only by the title of their being reasonable creatures, and when they come to that act of which by nature they have the faculty; so if it did, yet Baptism is not the meanes of conveying the holy Ghost. For that which <hi>Peter</hi> sayes, <hi>be baptized and ye shall receive the holy Ghost,</hi> signifies no more then this: First be baptized and then by imposition of the Apostles hands (which was another my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and rite,) ye shall receive the Promise of the Father: And this is nothing but an insinuation of the rite of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is to this sense expounded by divers Ancient Authors, and in ordinary ministry the effect of it is not bestowed upon any unbaptized persons; for it is in order next after Baptism; and upon this ground <hi>Peter</hi>'s Argument in the case of <hi>Cornelius</hi> was concluding enough <hi>à majori ad minus:</hi> Thus the holy Ghost was bestowed upon him and his Family, which gift by ordinary ministery was consequent to Baptism, (not as the effect is to the cause or to the proper instrument, but as a consequent is to an antecedent in a chaine of causes accidentally and by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive institution depending upon each other) God by that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle did give testimony, that the persons of the men were in great dispositions towards Heaven, and therefore were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to those Rites, which are the ordinary inlets into the Kingdome of Heaven. But then from hence to argue that wherever there is a capacity of receiving the same grace, there also the same sign is to be ministred, and from hence to inferre Paedo-baptism, is an Argument very fallacious upon severall grounds. First, because Baptism is not the sign of the holy Ghost, but by another mystery it was conveyed ordinarily, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, it was conveyed independently from any mystery, and so the Argument goes upon a wrong supposition. Secondly, if the supposition were true, the proposition built upon it is false; for they that are capable of the same grace, are not alwayes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the same sign; for women under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were capable of the righteousnesse of Faith, yet they were not capable of the sign of Circumcision: For God does not
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41208:151"/>
alwayes convey his graces in the same manner, but to some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, to others immediatly; and there is no better instance in the world of it, then the gift of the holy Ghost (which is the thing now instanc'd in this contestation) for it is certain in Scripture, that it was ordinarily given by imposition of hands, and that after Baptism; (And when this came into an ordinary ministery, it was called by the Ancient Church Chrism or Confirmation) but yet it was given sometimes without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, as at Pentecost and to the Family of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> sometimes before Baptism, sometimes after, sometimes in conjunction with it.</p>
                     <p>And after all this, least these Arguments should not ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.</note> their Cause, they fall on complaining against God, and will not be content with God, unlesse they may baptize their Children, but take exceptions that God did more for the Children of the Jewes. But why so? Because God made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their Children actually as Infants, and consign'd it by Circumcision: Well; so he did with our children too in their proportion. He made a Covenant of spirituall Promises on his part, and spirituall and reall services on ours; and this pertains to Children when they are capable, but made with them as soon as they are alive, and yet not so as with the Jewes Babes; for as their rite consign'd them actually, so it was a Nationall and temporall blessing and Covenant, as a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them from the portion of the Nations, a marking them for a peculiar people, (and therefore while they were in the Wildernesse and separate from the commixture of all people, they were not at all circumcised) but as that rite did seale the righteousnesse of Faith, so by vertue of its adherency, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency in their flesh, it did that work when the Children came to age. But in Christian Infants the case is otherwise; for the new Covenant being establish'd upon better Promises, is not only to better purposes, but also in distinct manner to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; when their spirits are as receptive of a spirituall act or impresse as the bodies of Jewish Children were of the sign of Circumcision, then it is to be consign'd: But this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is quickly at an end, by saying that God hath done no lesse for ours, then for their Children; for hee will doe the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41208:152"/>
mercies of a Father and Creator to them, and he did no more to the other; but he hath done more to ours; for he hath made a Covenant with them and built it upon Promises of the greatest concernment; he did not so to them: But then for the other part which is the maine of the Argument, that unlesse this mercy be consign'd by Baptism, as good not at all in respect of us, because we want the comfort of it; this is the greatest vanity in the world: For when God hath made a Promise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining also to our Children (for so our Adversaries contend, and we also acknowledge in its true sense) shall not this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, this word of God be of sufficient truth, certainty, and efficacy to cause comfort, unlesse we tempt God and require a sign of him? May not Christ say to these men as sometime to the Jewes, <hi>a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, but no sign shall be given unto it?</hi> But the truth on't is, this Argument is nothing but a direct quarrelling with God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                     <p>Now since there is no strength in the Doctrinall part, the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.</note> practise and precedents Apostolicall and Ecclesiasticall, will be of lesse concernment, if they were true as is pretended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause actions Apostolicall are not alwayes Rules for ever; it might be fit for them to doe it <hi>pro loco &amp; tempore</hi> as divers others of their Institutions, but yet no engagement past thence upon following Ages; for it might be convenient at that time, in the new spring of Christianity, and till they had engag'd a considerable party, by that meanes to make them parties against the Gentiles Superstition, and by way of pre-occupation to ascertain them to their own sect when they came to be men; or for some other reason not trasmitted to us, because the Question of fact it selfe is not sufficiently determin'd. For the insinuation of that precept of baptizing <hi>all Nations,</hi> of which Children certainly are a part, does as little advantage as any of the rest, because other parallel expressions of Scripture doe determine and expound themselves to a sence that includes not all persons absolutely, but of a capable condition, as <hi>adorate eum omnes gentes, &amp; psallite Deo omnes nationes terrae</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers more.</p>
                     <p>As for the conjecture concerning the Family of <hi>Stephanus,</hi>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.</note>
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:41208:152"/>
at the best it is but a conjecture, and besides that it is not prov'd that there were Children in the Family; yet if that were granted, it followes not that they were baptized, because by <hi>[whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>] in Scripture is meant all persons of reason and age within the Family; for it is said, of the Ruler at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>that he believed and all his house:</hi> Now you may also suppose that in his house were little Babes, that is likely enough, and you may suppose that they did believe too before they could understand, but that's not so likely; and then the Argument from baptizing of <hi>Stephen</hi>'s houshold may bee allowed just as probable: But this is unman-like to build upon such slight aery conjectures.</p>
                     <p>But Tradition by all meanes must supply the place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.</note> and there is pretended a Tradition Apostolicall, that Infants were baptized: But at this we are not much moved; For we who rely upon the written Word of God as sufficient to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish all true Religion, doe not value the Allegation of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And however the world goes, none of the Reformed Churches can pretend this Argument against this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they who reject Tradition when tis against them, must not pretend it at all for them: But if wee should allow the Topick to be good, yet how will it be verified? for so farre as it can yet appeare, it relies wholly upon the Testimony of <hi>Origen,</hi> for from him <hi>Austin</hi> had it. Now a Tradition Apostolicall if it be not consign'd with a fuller Testimony then of one person whom all after-Ages have condemn'd of many errors, will obtain so little reputation amongst those who know that things have upon greater Authority pretended to derive from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and yet falsly, that it will be a great Argument that he is credulons and weak, that shall be determin'd by so weak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in matters of so great concernment. And the truth of the businesse is, as there was no command of Scripture to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Children to the susception of it, so the necessity of Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism was not determin'd in the Church till in the eighth Age after Christ, but in the yeare 418 in the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, a Provinciall of <hi>Africa,</hi> there was a Canon made for Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-baptism; never till then! I grant it was practiz'd in <hi>Africa</hi> before that time, and they or some of them thought well of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41208:153"/>
it, and though that be no Argument for us to think so, yet none of them did ever before, pretend it to be necessary, none to have been a precept of the Gospel. S. <hi>Austin</hi> was the first that ever preach'd it to be absolutely necessary, and it was in his heat and anger against <hi>Pelagius</hi> who had warm'd and chafed him so in that Question that it made him innovate in other doctrines possibly of more concernment then this. And that although this was practised anciently in <hi>Africa,</hi> yet that it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an opinion of necessity, and not often there, nor at all in other places, we have the Testimony of a learned Paedo-baptist, <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> who in his Annotations upon S. <hi>Austin, De Civit. Dei. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27. affirms, <hi>Neminem nisi adultum antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùs solere baptizari.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But besides that the Tradition cannot be proved to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall; we have very good evidence from Antiquity, that it <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.</note> was the opinion of the Primitive Church, that Infants ought not to be baptiz'd; and this is clear in the sixth Canon of the Councell of <hi>Neocaesarea,</hi> The words are these, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: The sence is this, A woman with child may be baptized when she please; For her Baptism concernes not the child. The reason of the connexion of the parts of that Canon is in the following words, because every one in that Confession is to give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of his own choyce and election: Meaning plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if the Baptism of the Mother did also passe upon the child, it were not fit for a pregnant woman to receive Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, because in that Sacrament there being a Confession of Faith, which Confession supposes understanding, and free choyce, it is not reasonable the child should be consign'd with such a mystery, since it cannot doe any act of choyce or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: The Canon speaks reason, and it intimates a practise which was absolutely universall in the Church, of interrogating the Catechumens concerning the Articles of Creed: Which is one Argument that either they did not admit Infants to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, or that they did prevaricate egregiously in asking Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of them, who themselves knew were not capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving answer.</p>

                        <hi>shall be damned;</hi> plainly thus, Faith and Baptism in conjunction will bring a man to heaven; but if he have not Faith, Baptism shall doe him no good. So that if Baptism be necessary then, so is Faith, and much more; for want of Faith damnes abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; it is not said so of the want of Baptism. Now if this decretory sentence be to be understood of persons of age, and if Children by such an Answer (which indeed is reasonable enough) be excused from the necessity of Faith, the want of which regularly does damne, then it is sottish to say the same incapacity of reason and Faith shall not excuse from the actuall susception of Baptism, which is lesse necessary, and to which Faith and many other acts are necessary predisposions when it is reasonably and humanely received. The Conclusion is, that Baptism is also to be deferr'd till the time of Faith: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infants have Faith or no, is a Question to be disputed by persons that care not how much they say, nor how little they prove.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Personall and actuall Faith they have none; for they have <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.</note> no acts of understanding; and besides how can any man know that they have, since he never saw any sign of it, neither was he told so by any one that could tell? 2. Some say they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putative Faith; but then so let the Sacrament be too, that is, if they have the Parents Faith or the Churches, then so let Baptism be imputed also by derivation from them, that as in their Mothers womb, and while they hang on their breasts, they live upon their Mothers nourishment, so they may upon the Baptism of their Parents or their Mother the Church. For since Faith is necessary to the susception of Baptism (and they themselves confesse it by striving to finde out new kinds of Faith to dawb the matter up) such as the Faith is, such must be the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41208:154"/>
Sacrament: for there is no proportion between an actuall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and an imputative Faith, this being in immediate and necessary order to that: And whatsoever can be said to take off from the necessity of actuall Faith, all that and much more may be said to excuse from the actuall susception of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. 3. The first of these devices was that of <hi>Luther</hi> and his Scholars, the second of <hi>Calvin</hi> and his; and yet there is a third device which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, and that is, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have habituall Faith: But who told them so? how can they prove it? what Revelation, or reason teaches any such thing? Are they by this habite so much as disposed to an actuall beliefe without a new master? Can an Infant sent into a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> Province be more confident for Christianity when he comes to be a man, then if he had not been baptized? Are there any acts precedent, concomitant or consequent to this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded habit? This strange invention is absolutely without art, without Scripture, Reason or Authority: But the men are to be excused unlesse there were a better; But for all these stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes, the Argument now alledged against the Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is demonstrative and unanswerable.</p>
                     <p>To which also this consideration may be added, that if Baptism <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.</note> be necessary to the salvation of Infants, upon whom is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position laid? To whom is the command given? to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or to the Children? not to the Children, for they are not capable of a Law; not to the Parents, for then God hath put the salvation of innocent Babes into the power of others; and Infants may be damn'd for their Fathers carelessnesse or malice. It followes that it is not necessary at all to be done to them, to whom it cannot be prescrib'd as a Law, and in whose behalfe it cannot be reasonably intrusted to others with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant necessity; and if it be not necessary, it is certain it is not reasonable, and most certain it is nowhere in termes prescribed, and therefore it is to be presumed, that it ought to be understood and administred according as other precepts are with reference to the capacity of the subject, and the reasonablenesse of the thing.</p>
                     <p>For I consider, that the baptizing of Infants does rush us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.</note> such inconveniences which in other Questions we avoid like Rocks, which will appear if we Discourse thus.</p>

Either Baptism produces spirituall effects, or it produces them not: If it produces not any, why is such contention about it, what are we the nearer heaven if we are baptized? and if it be neglected, what are we the farther off? But if (as without all peradventure all the <hi>Paedo-baptists</hi> will say) Baptism does doe a work upon the soule, producing spirituall benefits and advantages, these advantages are produc'd by the externall work of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alone, or by that as it is help'd by the co-operation and predispositions of the <hi>suscipient.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If by the externall work of the Sacrament alone, how does this differ from the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the Papists, save that it is worse? for they say the Sacrament does not produce its effect but in a <hi>suscipient</hi> disposed by all requisites and due preparatives of piety, faith, and repentance; though in a subject so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they say the Sacrament by its own vertue does it; but this opinion sayes it does it of it selfe without the help, or so much as the coexistence of any condition but the meare reception.</p>
                     <p>But if the Sacrament does not doe its work alone, but <hi>per modum recipientis</hi> according to the predispositions of the susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, then because Infants can neither hinder it, nor doe any thing to further it, it does them no benefit at all. And if any man runs for succour to that exploded <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have Faith, or any other inspir'd habite of I know not what or how, we desire no more advantage in the world, then that they are constrained to an answer without Revelation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason, common sense, and all the experience in the world.</p>
                     <p>The summe of the Argument in short, is this though under another representment.</p>
                     <p>Either Baptism is a meare <hi>Ceremony,</hi> or it implyes a <hi>Duty</hi> on our part. If it be a Ceremony only, how does it sanctifie us, or <hi>make the commers therunto perfect?</hi> If it implyes a <hi>Duty</hi> on our part, how then can Children receive it, who cannot doe duty at all?</p>
                     <p>And indeed, this way of Ministration makes Baptism to be wholly an outward duty, a work of the Law, a carnall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it makes us adhere to the letter, without regard of the Spirit, to be satisfied with shadowes, to return to bondage,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41208:155"/>
to relinquish the mysteriousnesse, the substance and Spirituality of the Gospel. Which Argument is of so much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, because under the Spirituall Covenant, or the Gospel of Grace, if <hi>the mystery</hi> goes not before the <hi>Symbol</hi> (which it does when the Symbols are Seales and Consignations of the Grace, as it is said the Sacraments are) yet it alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it, but never followes in order of time: And this is clear in the perpetuall analogy of holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>For Baptism is never propounded, mentioned or enjoyn'd as a meanes of remission of sinnes, or of eternall life, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of duty, choyce and sanctity is joyn'd with it, in order to production of the end so mentioned, <hi>Know ye not that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

                        </gap>. All of us who were baptized into one, were baptized into the other, Not only into the Name of Christ, but into his death also: But the meaning of this as it is explained in the following words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> makes much for our purpose: For to bee baptized into his death, signifies <hi>to be buried with him in Baptism, that as Christ rose from the dead, wee also should walk in newnesse of life:</hi> That's <note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> the full mystery of Baptism; For being baptized into his death, or which is all one in the next words, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>into the likenesse of his death,</hi> cannot goe alone; <hi>if we be so plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>

                        <hi>into Christ, we shall be partakers of his Resurrection,</hi> and that is not here instanced in precise <hi>reward,</hi> but in <hi>exact Duty,</hi> for all this is nothing but <hi>crucifixion of the old man, a destroying the</hi>

                        <hi>body of sinne, that wee no longer serve sinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This indeed is truly to be baptized both in the <hi>Symbol</hi> and the <hi>Mystery:</hi> Whatsoever is lesse then this, is but the <hi>Symbol</hi> only, a <hi>meare Ceremony,</hi> an <hi>opus operatum,</hi> a dead letter, an empty shadow, an instrument without an agent to manage, or force to actuate it.</p>
                     <p>Plainer yet: <hi>Whosoever are baptized into Christ have put on Christ, have put on the new man:</hi> But to put on this new man, is <hi>to be formed in righteousnesse, and holinesse, and truth:</hi> This whole Argument is the very words of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> The Major pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is dogmatically determin'd, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27.

                        <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. The Conclusion then is obvious, that they who are not formed new <hi>in righteousnesse, and holinesse, and truth,</hi> they who remaining in the present incapacites cannot <hi>walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life,</hi> they have not been <hi>baptized into Christ,</hi> and then they have but one member of the distinction, used by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> they have that Baptism <hi>which is a putting away the filth of the flesh;</hi> but they have not that Baptism <hi>which is the answer of a</hi>

                        <hi>good conscience towards God,</hi> which is the onely <hi>Baptism that saves us:</hi> And this is the case of children; And then the case is thus.</p>
                     <p>As Infants by the force of nature cannot put themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a supernaturall condition, (and therefore say the <hi>Paedo-baptists,</hi> they need Baptism to put them into it:) so if they be baptized before the use of reason, before the <hi>works of the Spirit,</hi> before the operations of Grace, before they can throw off <hi>the works of darknesse, and live in righteousnesse and newnesse of life,</hi> they are never the nearer: From the paines of Hell they shall be saved by the mercies of God and their own innocence, though they die <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> and Baptism will carry them no further. For that <hi>Baptism that saves us,</hi> is not the only <hi>washing with water,</hi> of which only, Children are capable, <hi>but the answer of a good conscience towards God,</hi> of which they are not capable till the use of reason, till they know to chuse the good and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the evill.</p>
                     <p>And from thence I consider anew, That all vowes made by persons under others Names, stipulations made by <hi>Minors,</hi> are not valid till they by a supervening act after they are of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient age doe ratifie them. Why then may not Infants as well make the vow <hi>de novo,</hi> as <hi>de novo</hi> ratifie that which was made for them <hi>ab antiquo</hi> when they come to years of choice? If the <hi>Infant</hi> vow be invalid till the <hi>Manly</hi> confirmation, why were it <note place="margin">Vide Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. in Matth.</note> not as good they staid to make it till that time, before which if they doe make it, it is to no purpose? This would bee considered.</p>
                     <p>And in Conclusion, Our way is the the surer way, for not to baptize Children till they can give an account of their Faith, is <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.</note> the most proportionable to an act of reason and humanity, and it can have no danger in it: For to say that Infants may be damn'd
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41208:156"/>
for want of Baptism, (a thing which is not in their power to acquire, they being persons not yet capable of a Law) is to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that of God which we dare not say of any wise and good man. Certainly it is much derogatory to Gods Justice and a plaine defiance to the infinite reputation of his goodnesse.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, who ever will pertinaciously persist in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">

It is certain that Christ and his Apostles, and Christian Religion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41208:157"/>
did comply with the most absolute Government, and the most imperiall that was then in the world; and it could not have been at all indured in the world if it had not; for indeed the world it selfe could not last in regular and orderly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, but be a perpetuall confusion, if Princes and the Supreme Power in Bodies Politick, were not armed with a coercive power to punish Malefactors: The publike necessity, and universall experience of all the world convinces those men of being most unreasonable, that make such pretences which destroy all Lawes, and all Communities, and the bands of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Societies, and leave it arbitrary to every vaine or vitious person whether men shall be safe, or Lawes be established, or a Murderer hang'd, or Princes Rule. So that in this case men are not so much to Dispute with particular Arguments, as to consider the Interest and concernment of Kingdomes and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Societies: For the Religion of Jesus Christ is the best establisher of the felicity of private persons, and of publick Communities; it is a Religion that is prudent and innocent, humane, and reasonable, and brought infinite advantages to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but no inconvenience, nothing that is unnaturall, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable, or unjust. And if it be certain that this world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be governed without Lawes, and Lawes without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsory signifie nothing, then it is certain, that it is no good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that teaches Doctrine whose consequents will destroy all Government; and therefore it is as much to be rooted out, as any thing that is the greatest pest and nuisance to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick interest: And that we may guesse at the purposes of the men, and the inconvenience of such Doctrine; these men that did first intend by their Doctrine to disarme all Princes, and bodies Politick, did themselves take up armes to establish their wild, and impious fancie; and indeed that Prince or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that should be perswaded by them; would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to all the insolencies of forraingners, and all mutinies of the teachers themselves, and the Governours of the people could not doe that duty they owe to their people of protecting them from the rapine and malice which will be in the world as long as the world is. And therefore, here they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from preaching such Doctrine, if they mean to preserve
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41208:158"/>
their Government, and the necessity of the thing will justifie the lawfulnesse of the thing: If they think it to themselves, that cannot be helped; so long it is innocent as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Publick; but if they preach it, they may be accounted Authors of all the consequent inconveniences, and punisht ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: <hi>No Doctrine that destroyes Government is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured;</hi> For although those Doctrines are not alwayes good that serve the private ends of Princes, or the secret designes of State, which by reason of some accidents or imperfections of men may be promoted by that which is false and pretending, yet no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine can be good that does not comply with the formality of Government it selfe, and the well being of bodies Politick; <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur cum esset Cato, dicere ausus est, optimis auspiciis ea geri</hi>

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.</note> will proceed another way, and not consider the truth or falsity of the Doctrines; for that is not the best way to determine this Question concerning permitting their Religion or Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; because that a thing is not true, is not Argument suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conclude that he that believes it true is not to bee endured; but we are to consider what inducements there are that possesse the understanding of those men; whether they be reasonable and innocent, sufficient to abuse or perswade wise and good men, or whether the Doctrines be commenc'd upon designe, and manag'd with impiety, and then have effects not to be endured.</p>
                     <p>And here first, I consider that those Doctrines that have <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> had long continuance and possession in the Church, cannot easily be supposed in the present Professors to be a design, since they have received it from so many Ages, and it is not likely that all Ages should have the same purposes, or that the same Doctrine should serve the severall ends of divers Ages. But however; long prescription is a prejudice, oftentimes so insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, that it cannot with many Arguments be retrench'd, as relying upon these grounds, that truth is more ancient then falshood, that God would not for so many Ages forsake his Church, and leave her in an errour; that whatsoever is new, is not only suspicious, but false; which are suppositions, pious and plausible enough. And if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Infants so long as she hath prayed to Saints, or baptized Infants, the communicationg would have been believed with as much confidence, as the other Articles are, and the dissentients with as much impatience rejected. But this consideration is to be enlarg'd upon all those particulars, which as they are apt to abuse the persons of the men and amuse their understandings,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41208:159"/>
so they are instruments of their excuse, and by making their errours to be invincible, and their opinions, though false, yet not criminall, make it also to be an effect of reason and charity, to permit the men a liberty of their Conscience, and let them answer to God for themselves and their own opinions: Such as are the beauty and splendor of their Church; their pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Service; the statelinesse and solennity of the Hierarchy; their name of Catholick, which they suppose their own due, and to concern no other Sect of Christians; the Antiquity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Doctrines; the continuall Succession of their Bishops; their immediate derivation from the Apostles; their Title to succeed S. <hi>Peter;</hi> the supposall and pretence of his personall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives; the advantages which the conjunction of the Imperiall Seat with their Episcopall hath brought to that Sea; the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering expressions of minor Bishops, which by being old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, have obtain'd credibility; the multitude and variety of people which are of their perswasion; apparent consent with Antiquity in many Ceremonialls which other Churches have rejected; and a pretended, and sometimes an apparent consent with some elder Ages in many matters doctrinall; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which is derived to them by entertaining some perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall opinions of the Fathers, which they with infinite clamours see to bee cryed up to be a Doctrine of the Church of that time; The great consent of one part with another in that which most of them affim to be <hi>de fide;</hi> the great differences which are commenc'd amongst their Adversaries, abusing the Liberty of Prophecying unto a very great licentiousnesse; their happinesse of being instruments in converting divers Nations; the advantages of Monarchicall Government, the benefit of which as well as the inconveniences (which though they feele they consider not) they daily doe enjoy; the piety and the austerity of their Religious Orders of men and women; the single life of their Priests and Bishops; the riches of their Church; the severity of their Fasts and their exteriour obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; the great reputation of their first Bishops for Faith and sanctity; the known holinesse of some of those persons whose Institutes the Religious Persons pretend to imitate; their Miracles false or true, substantiall or imaginary; the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41208:159"/>
casualties and accidents that have hapned to their Adversaries, which being chances of humanity are attributed to severall causes according as the fancies of men and their Interests are pleased or satisfied; the temporall selicity of their Professors; the oblique arts &amp; indirect proceedings of some of those who depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them; and amongst many other things, the names of Heretick and Schismatick, which they with infinite pretinacy fasten upon all that disagree from them; These things and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others may very easily perswade persons of much reason and more piety, to retain that which they know to have been the Religion of their fore-Fathers, which had actuall possession and seizure of mens understandings before the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite professions had a name; And so much the rather because Religion hath more advantages upon the fancy and affections, then it hath upon Philosophy and severe discourses, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the more easily perswaded upon such grounds as these, which are more apt to amuse then to satisfie the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If we consider the Doctrines themselves, we shall <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> finde them to be superstructures ill built, and worse manag'd, but yet they keep the foundation, they build upon God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, they professe the Apostles Creed, they retain Faith and Repentance as the supporters of all our hopes of Heaven, and believe many more truths then can be proved to be of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and originall necessity to salvation: And therefore all the wisest Personages of the adverse party allowed to them possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of salvation, whilst their errours are not faults of their will, but weaknesses and deceptions of the understanding. So that there is nothing in the <hi>foundation of Faith,</hi> that can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably hinder them to be permitted: The foundation of Faith stands secure enough for all their vaine and unhandsome super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures.</p>
                     <p>But then on the other side, if we take account of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as they relate to good life, or are consistent or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with civill Government, we shall have other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For I consider, that many of their Doctrines doe <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> accidentally teach or lead to ill life, and it will appeare to any
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41208:160"/>
man that considers the result of these propositions: Attrition (which is a low and imperfect degree of sorrow for sin, or as others say a sorrow for sinne commenc'd upon any reason of temporall hope, or feare or desire or any thing else) is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent disposition for a man in the Sacrament of penance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive absolution, and be justified before God, by taking away the guilt of all his sinnes, and the obligation to eternall paines. So that already the feare of Hell is quite removed upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions so easie, that many men take more paines to get a groat, then by this Doctrine we are oblig'd to, for the curing and acquitting all the greatest sinnes of a whole life, of the most vitious person in the world: And but that they affright their people with a feare of Purgatory, or with the severity of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in case they will not venter for Purgatory (for by their Doctrine they may chuse or refuse either) there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their Doctrine or Discipline to impede and slacken their proclivity to sinne; but then they have as easy a cure for that too, with a little more charge sometimes, but most commonly with lesse trouble: For there are so many confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, so many priviledged Churches, Altars, Monasteries, Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meteries, Offices, Festivals, and so free a concession of Indulgences appendant to all these, and a thousand fine devices to take away the feare of Purgatory, to commute or expiate Penances, that in no sect of men, doe they with more ease and cheapnesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile a wicked life with the hopes of heaven, then in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion.</p>
                     <p>And indeed if men would consider things upon their true <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> grounds, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should be more reproved upon Doctrines that inferre ill life, then upon such as are contrariant to Faith. For false superstructures doe not alwayes destroy: Faith; but many of the Doctrines they teach if they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted to the utmost issue would destroy good life: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my quarrell with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is greater and stronger upon such points which are not usually considerd, then it is upon the ordinary disputes, which have to no very great purpose so much disturb'd Christendome: And I am more scandaliz'd at her for teaching the sufficiency of Attrition in the Sacrament, for indulging Penances so frequently, for remitting
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41208:160"/>
all Discipline, for making so great a part of Religon to consist in externalls and Ceremonialls, for putting more force and Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and exacting with more severity the commandments of men then the precepts of Justice, and internall Religion: Lastly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other things, for promising heaven to persons after a wicked life upon their impertinent cryes and Ceremon alls trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the Priest and the dying Person: I confesse I wish the zeale of Christendome were a little more active against these and the like Doctrines, and that men would write and live more earnestly against them then as yet they have done.</p>
                     <p>But then what influence this just zeale is to have upon the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> persons of the Professors is another consideration: For as the Pharisees did preach well and lived ill, and therefore were to be heard not imitated: So if these men live well though they teach ill, they are to be imitated not heard: their Doctrines by all meanes, Christian and humane, are to be discountenanc'd, but their persons tolerated <hi>eatenùs;</hi> their Profession and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to be rejected and condemn'd, but the persons to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, because by their good lives they confute their Doctrines, that is, they give evidence, that they think no evill to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to such opinions, and if they did, that they live good lives, is argument sufficient that they would themselves cast the first stone against their own opinions, if they thought them guilty of such misdemeanours.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But if we consider their Doctrines in relation to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> Government, and Publick societies of men, then if they prove faulty, they are so much the more intolerable by how much the consequents, are of greater danger and malice: Such Doctrines as these, The Pope may dispence with all oathes taken to God or man: He may absolve Subjects from their Allegiance to their naturall Prince: Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, Hereticall Princes may be slaine by their Subjects. These Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are so deprest, and doe so immediately communicate with matter, and the interests of men, that they are of the same consideration with matters of fact, and are to be handled accordingly. To other Doctrines ill life may be consequent; but the connexion of the antecedent and the consequent is not (peradventure) perceiv'd or acknowledged by him that believes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41208:161"/>
the opinion with no greater confidence then he disavowes the effect, and issue of it. But in these, the ill effect is the direct profession and purpose of the opinion, and therefore the man and the mans opinion is to be dealt withall, just as the matter of fact is to be judg'd; for it is an immediate, a perceiv'd, a direct event, and the very purpose of the opinion. Now these opinions are a direct overthrow to all humane society, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall commerce, a destruction of Government, and of the lawes and duty and subordination which we owe to Princes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that doe hold them, and preach them, cannot pretend to the excuses of innocent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hearty perswasion, to the weaknesse of humanity, and the difficulty of things; for God hath not left those truths which are necessary for conservation of publike societies of men, so intricate and obscure, but that every one that is honest and desirous to understand his duty, will certainly know that no Christian truth destroyes a mans being sociable and a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body Politick, co-operating to the conservation of the whole as well as of it selfe. However, if it might happen that men should sincerely erre in such plaine matters of fact (for there are fooles enough in the world) yet if he hold his peace, no man is to persecute or punish him, for then it is meare opinion which comes not under Politicall Cognisance, that is, that Cognisance which onely can punish corporally; but if he preaches it, he is actually a Traytor, or Seditious, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Perjury, or a destroyer of humane Society, respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the nature of the Doctrine; and the preaching such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines cannot claime the priviledge and immunity of a meare opinion, because it is as much matter of fact, as any the actions of his disciples and confidents, and therefore in such cases is not to be permitted, but judg'd according to the nature of the effect it hath or may have upon the actions of men.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly: But lastly, In matters mearly speculative, the case is wholly altered, because the body Politick which only may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.</note> use the sword, is not a competent Judge of such matters which have not direct influence upon the body Politick, or upon the lives and manners of men as they are parts of a Community (not but that Princes or Judges Temporall may
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41208:161"/>
have as much ability as others, but by reason of the incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the Authority;) And <hi>Gallio</hi> spoke wisely, when he discoursed thus to the Jewes, <hi>If it were a matter of wrong or</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Act. 18. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>wicked lewdnesse ô ye Jewes, reason would that I should hear you; But if it be a question of words, and names, and of your Law, look ye to it, for I will be no Judge of such matters:</hi> The man spoke excellent reason; for the Cognisnance of these things did appertain to men of the other robe: but the Ecclesiasticall power, which only is competent to take notice of such questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is not of capacity to use the Temporall sword or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inflictions: The meare doctrines and opinions of men are things Spirituall, and therefore not Cognoscible by a temporall Authority; and the Ecclesiasticall Authority, which is to take Cognisance is it selfe so Spirituall, that it cannot inflict any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment corporall.</p>
                     <p>And it is not enough to say that when the Magistrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> the preaching such opinions, if any man preaches them he may be punished (and then it is not for his opinion but his disobedience that he is punish'd) for the temporall power ought not to restraine Prophecyings, where the publick peace and interest is not certainly concern'd. And therefore it is not sufficient to excuse him, whose Law in that case being by an incompetent power made a scruple where there was no sinne.</p>
                     <p>And under this consideration, come very many Articles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are wholly speculative, which doe <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> not derive upon practise, which begin in the understanding and rest there, and have no influence upon life and government, but very accidentally, and by a great many removes, and therefore are to be considered only so farre as to guide men in their perswasions, but have no effect upon the persons of men, their bodies, or their temporall condition: I instance in two; Prayer for the dead, and the Doctrine of Transubstantion, these two to be instead of all the rest.</p>
                     <p>For the first, This Discourse is to suppose it false, and we are <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.</note> to direct our proceedings accordingly: And therefore I shall not need to urge with how many faire words and gay pretences, this Doctrine is set off, apt either to conzen or instruct the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41208:162"/>
of the wisest according as it is true or false respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But we finde (sayes the Romanist) in the History of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that the Jewes did pray and make offerings for the dead (which also appeares by other Testimonies, and by their forme of prayers still extant which they used in the Captivity) it is very considerable, that since our blessed Saviour did reprove all the evill Doctrines and Traditions of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, and did argue concerning the dead and the Resurrection against the Sadduces, yet he spake no word against this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick practise, but left it as he found it, which he who came to declare to us all the will of his Father would not have done, if it had not been innocent, pious and full of charity. To which by way of consociation, if we adde that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did pray for <hi>Onesiphorus, That God would shew him a mercy in that day,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 18.</note> that is, according to the stile of the New Testament, the day of Judgement: The result will be, that although it be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> at that time was dead (because in his salutations he salutes his houshold, without naming him who was the <hi>Major domo,</hi> against his custome of salutitions in other places:) Yet besides this, the prayer was for such a blessing to him whose demonstration and reception could not be but after death; which implies clearly, that then there is a need of mercy, and by consequence the dead people even to the day of Judgement inclusively are the subject of a misery, the object of Gods mercy, and therefore fit to be commemorated in the duties of our piety and charity, and that we are to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their condition to God, not only to give them more glory, in the reunion, but to pitty them to such purposes in which they need; which because they are not revealed to us in particular, it hinders us not in recommending the persons in particular to Gods mercy, but should rather excite our charity and devotion: For it being certaine that they have a need of mercy, and it being uncertain how great their need is, it may concern the prudence of charity to be the more earnest as not knowing the greatnesse of their necessity.</p>
                     <p>And if there should be any uncertainty in these Arguments, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> yet its having been the universall practise of the Church of God in all places, and in all Ages till within these hundred
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41208:162"/>
yeares, is a very great inducement for any member of the Church to believe that in the first Traditions of Christianity, and the Institutions Apostolicall, there was nothing delivered against this practise, but very much to insinuate or enjoyn it; because the practise of it was at the first, and was universall. And if any man shall doubt of this, he shewes nothing but <note place="margin">De corona milit. c. 3. &amp; de monogam. c. 10.</note> that hee is ignorant of the Records of the Church, it being plaine in <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 66.</note> 
                        <hi>Cyprian</hi> (who were the eldest Writers of the Latine Church) that in their times it was <hi>ab antiquo,</hi> the custome of the Church to pray for the Soules of the Faithfull departed, in the dreadfull mysteries: And it was an Institution Apostolicall (sayes one of them) and so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the following Ages of the Church, and when once it began upon slight and discontent to be contested against by <hi>Aërius,</hi> the man was presently condemn'd for a Heretick, as appeares in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I am not to consider the Arguments for the Doctrine <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.</note> it selfe, although the probability and faire pretence of them may help to excuse such persons who upon these or the like grounds doe heartily believe it. But I am to consider that whether it be true or false, there is no manner of malice in it, and at the worst, it is but a wrong errour upon the right side of charity, and concluded against by its Adversaries upon the confidence of such Arguments, which possibly are not so probable as the grounds pretended for it.</p>
                     <p>And if the same judgement might be made of any more of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.</note> their Doctrines, I think it were better men were not furious, in the condemning such Questions which either they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not upon the grounds of their proper Arguments, or at least consider not, as subjected in the persons, and lessened by circumstances, by the innocency of the event, or other pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall considerations.</p>
                     <p>But the other Article is harder to be judged of, and hath made greater stirres in Christendome, and hath been dasht at <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.</note> with more impetuous objections, and such as doe more trouble the Question of Toleration. For if the Doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation be false (as upon much evidence we believe it is) then tis accused of introducing Idolatry, giving Divine worship
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41208:163"/>
to a Creature, adoring of bread and wine, and then comes in the precept of God to the Jewes, that those Prophets who perswaded to Idolatry should be slaine.</p>
                     <p>But here we must deliberate, for it is concerning the lives <note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> of men, and yet a little deliberation may suffice: For Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</note> is a forsaking the true God, and giving Divine Worship to a Creature or to an Idoll, that is, to an imaginary god, who hath no foundation in essence or existence: And is that kind of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition which by Divines is called the superstition of an undue object: Now it is evident that the Object of their Adoration (that which is represented to them in their minds, their thoughts, and purposes, and by which God principally if not solely takes estimate of humane actions) in the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the only true and eternall God, hypostatically joyned with his Holy humanity, which humanity they believe actually present under the veile of the Sacramentall signes: And if they thought him not present, they are so farre from worshipping the bread in this case, that themselves professe it to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to doe so, which is a demonstration that their soule hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it that is Idololatricall. If their confidence and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full opinion hath engag'd them upon so great mistake (as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it hath) yet the will hath nothing in it, but what is a great enemy to Idolatry, <hi>Et nihil ardet in inferno nisi propria voluntas:</hi> And although they have done violence to all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and the reason of man, and undone and cancelled the principles of two or three Sciences, to bring in this Article, yet they have a Divine Revelation whose literall and Grammaticall sense, if that sense were intended, would warrant them to doe violence to all the Sciences in the Circle; and indeed that, Transubstantiation is openly and violently against naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is an Argument to make them disbelieve, who believe the mystery of the Trinity in all those niceties of explication which are in the Schoole (and which now adayes passe for the Doctrine of the Church) with as much violence to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of naturall and supernaturall Philosophy, as can be imagin'd to be in the point of Transubstantiation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But for the Article it selfe, we all say that Christ is there <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.</note> present some way or other extraordinary; and it will not be
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41208:163"/>
amisse to worship him at that time, when he gives himselfe to us in so mysterious a manner, and with so great advantages; especially since the whole Office is a Consociation of divers actions of Religion and Divine Worship. Now in all opinions of those men who think it an act of Religion to communicate and to offer; a Divine Worship is given to Christ, and is transmitted to him by mediation of that action and that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and it is no more in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that they differ and mistake infinitely in the manner of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; which errour is wholly seated in the Understanding, and does not communicate with the will; for all agree that the Divinity and the Humanity of the Sonne of God is the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and adequate object of Divine Adoration, and that it is incommunicable to any creature whatsoever, and before they venture to passe an Act of Adoration, they believe the bread to be annihilated or turn'd into his substance who may lawfully be worshipped; and they who have these thoughts, are as much enemies of Idolatry, as they that understand better how to avoid that inconvenience which is supposed to be the crime, which they formally hate, and we materially avoid: This consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration was concerning the Doctrine it selfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And now for any danger to mens persons for suffering <note place="margin">

have cald for fire to destroy them even as <hi>Elias</hi> did under <hi>Moses</hi> Law, Christ distinguished the spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> from his own Spirit, and taught them a lesson of greater sweetnesse, and consign'd this truth to all Ages of the Church, that such severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not consistent with the meekenesse which Christ by his example and Sermons hath made a precept Evangelicall: At most it was but a Iudiciall Law and no more of Argument to make it necessary to us, then the Mosaicall precepts of putting Adulterers to death, and trying the accused persons by the waters of jealousie.</p>
                     <p>And thus in these two Instances, I have given account what <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.</note> is to be done in Toleration of diversity of opinions: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of which is principally this: Let the Prince and the Secular Power have a care the Common-wealth be safe. For whether such or such a Sect of Christians be to be permitted is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion rather Politicall then Religious; for as for the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion, these instances have furnished us with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to determine us in our duties as to that particular, and by one of these all particulars may be judged.</p>
                     <p>And now it were a strange inhumanity to permit Jewes in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</note> a Common-wealth, whose interest is served by their inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet upon equall grounds of State and Policy, not to permit differing Sects of Christians: For although possibly there is more danger, mens perswasions should be altered in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of divers Sects of Christians, yet there is not so much danger when they are changed from Christian to Christian, as if they be turn'd from Christian to Iew, as many are daily in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is not to be excused by saying the Church hath no <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.</note> power over them <hi>qui foris sunt</hi> as Iewes are: For it is true the Church in the capacity of Spirituall regiments hath nothing to doe with them, because they are not her Diocesse: Yet the Prince hath to doe with them, when they are subjects of his regiment: They may not be Excommunicate any more then a stone may be kild, because they are not of the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but they are living persons parts of the Common-Wealth, infinitely deceived in their Religion, and very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous if they offer to perswade men to their opinions, and are
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41208:164"/>
the greatest enemies of Christ whose honour and the interest of whose Service a Christian Prince is bound with all his power to maintaine. And when the Question is of punishing disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing persons with death, the Church hath equally nothing to doe with them both, for she hath nothing to doe with the temporall sword, but the Prince whose Subjects equally Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Iewes are, hath equall power over their persons; for a Christian is no more a subject then a Iew is, The Prince hath upon them both the same power of life and death, so that the Iew by being no Christian is not <hi>foris,</hi> or any more an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt person for his body, or his life then the Christian is: And yet in all Churches where the secular power hath temporall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to tolerate the Iewes, they are tolerated without any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Religion; which thing is of more consideration, because the Iewes are direct Blasphemers of the Sonne of God, and Blasphemy by their own Law the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall; And might with greater reason be inflicted upon them, who acknowledge its obligation then urg'd upon Christians as an Authority, enabling Princes to put them to death, who are accused of accidentall and consequutive Blasphemy and Idolatry respectively, which yet they hate and disavow with much zeale and heartinesse of perswasion. And I cannot yet learn a reason why we shall not be more complying with them, who are of the houshold of Faith; for at least they are children though they be but rebellious children (and if they were not, what hath the Mother to doe with them any more then with the Iewes?) they are in some relation or habitude of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, for they are consigned with the same Baptism, professe the same Faith delivered by the Apostles, are erected in the same hope, and look for the same glory to be reaveled to them, at the comming of their Common Lord and Saviour, to whose Service according to their understanding they have vowed themselves: And if the disagreeing persons be to be esteemed as Heathens and Publicans, yet not worse, <hi>Have no company with them,</hi> that's the worst that is to be done to such a man in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, <hi>Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</hi>

                     <p>AS for the duty of particular men in the Question of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with Churches of different perswasions, it is <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.</note> to be regulated according to the Lawes of those Churches; for if they require no impiety, or any thing unlawfull as the condition of their Communion, then they communicate with them as they are Servants of Christ, as Disciples of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and subjects to his Laws, and the particular distinguishing Doctrine of their Sect hath no influence or communication with him who from another Sect is willing to communicate with all the Servants of their Common Lord: For since no Church of one name is infallible, a wise man may have either the misfortune or a reason to believe of every one in particular, that she erres in some Article or other, either he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with any, or else he may communicate with all, that doe not make a sinne or the profession of an errour to be the condition of their Communion. And therefore, as every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church is bound to Tolerate disagreeing persons in the senses and for the reasons above explicated; so every particular person is bound to Tolerate her, that is, not to refuse her Communion when he may have it upon innocent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For what is it to me if the Greek Church denies Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the third Person from the second, so she will give me the right hand of Fellowship, (though I affirm it) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41208:166"/>
because I professe the Religion of Jesus Christ, and retain all matters of Faith and necessity? But this thing will scarce be reduced to practise, for few Churches that have fram'd bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Confession, and Articles, will endure any person that is not of the same confession; which is a plaine demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that such bodies of Confession and Articles doe much hurt, by becomming instruments of separating and dividing Communions, and making unnecessary or uncertain propositions a certaine meanes of Schism and disunion: But then men would doe well to consider whether or no such proceedings doe not derive the guilt of Schism upon them who least think it, and whether of the two is the Schismatick? he that makes unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and (supposing the state of things) inconvenient imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or he that disobeyes them, because hee cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing violence to his conscience believe them? Hee that parts Communion, because without sinne hee could not entertain it, or they that have made it necessary for him to separate, by requiring such conditions which to man are simply necessary, and to his particular are either sinfull or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible?</p>
                     <p>The Summe of all is this, There is no security in any thing <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> or to any person, but in the pious and hearty endeavours of a good life, and neither sinne nor error does impede it from producing its proportionate and intended effect: because it is a direct deletery to sin and an excuse to errors, by making them innocent, and therefore harmlesse. And indeed this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment and design of Faith: For (that we may joyn both ends of this Discourse together) therefore certain Articles are prescribed to us, and propounded to our understanding, that so we might be supplyed with instructions, with motives and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to incline and determine our wills to the obedience of Christ. So that obedience is just so consequent to Faith, as the acts of will are to the dictates of the understanding: Faith therefore being in order to obedience, and so farre excellent as it selfe is a part of obedience or the promoter of it, or an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to it; it is evident that if obedience and a good life be secured upon the most reasonable and proper grounds of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41208:167"/>
Christianity, that is, upon the Apostles Creed, then Faith also is secur'd. Since whatsoever is beside the duties, the order of a good life, cannot be a part of Faith, because upon Faith, a good life is built; all other Articles by not being necessary, are no otherwise to be requir'd, but as they are to be obtain'd and fourd out, that is, morally, and fallibly, and humanely; It is fit all truths be promoted fairely and properly, and yet but few Articles prescribed Magisterially, nor framed into Symbols and bodies of Confession; least of all after such composures, should men proceed so furiously as to say all disagreeing after such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations to be damnable for the future, and capitall for the present. But this very thing is reason enough to make men more limited in their prescriptions, because it is more charitable in such suppositions so to doe.</p>
                     <p>But in the thing it selfe, because few kinds of errours are damnable, it is reasonable as few should be capitall. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> every thing that is damnable in it selfe and before Gods Judgement Seat, is not discernable before men (and questions disputable are of this condition) it is also very reasonable that fewer be capitall then what are damnable, and that such Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should bee permitted to men to believe because they must be left to God to judge. It concernes all persons to see that they doe their best to finde out truth, and if they doe, it is certain that let the errour be never so damnable, they shall escape the errour or the misery of being damn'd for't. And if God will not be angry at men for being invincibly deceiv'd, why should men be angry one at another? For he that is most displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at another mans errour, may also be tempted in his own will, and as much deceived in his understanding: For if he may faile in what he can chuse, he may also faile in what he cannot chuse: His understanding is no more secur'd then his will, nor his Faith more then his obedience. It is his own fault if he offends God in either but whatsoever is not to be avoided; as errours, which are incident oftentimes even to the best and most inquisitive of men, are not offences against God, and therefore not to be punished, or restrained by men; but all such opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which the publick interests of the

I shall give no other character of the whole, but that the publike disrelish which I finde amongst persons of great piety, of all qualities, not only of great, but even of ordinary understandings, is to, me some argument that it lies so open to the objections even of common spirits, that the Compilers of it did intend more to prevaile by the successe of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then the strength of reason, and the proper grounds of perswasion, which yet most wise and good men believe to be the more Christian way of the two. But Sir, you have engaged me to say something in particular to satisfie your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.

If the thing were good and pious, I should learn to submit to the imposition, and never quarrell at the incompetency of his authority that engaged me to doe pious and holy things. And it may be when I am a little more used to it, I shall not wonder at a Synod, in which not one Bishop sits (in the capacity of a Bishop) though I am most certain this is the first example in <hi>England,</hi> since it was first Christned. But for present it seemes something hard to digest it, because I know so well that all Assemblies of the Church have admitted Priests to consultation and dispute, but never to authority and decision, till the Pope enlarging the phylacteries of the Archimandrites and Abbots, did sometimes by way of priviledge and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation give to some of them decisive voyces in publike Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. But this was one of the things in which he did inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and invade against the publike resolutions of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, though he durst not doe it often, and when he did it, it was in very small and inconsiderate numbers.</p>

                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</note> purposes of theirs then at what they publiquely professe, which is the abolition and destruction of the Book of Common-Prayer; which great change, because they are pleased to call Reformation, I am content in charity to believe they think it so, and that they have <hi>Zelum Dei,</hi> but whether <hi>secundum scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> according to knowledge or no, must be judged by them who consider the matter and the forme.</p>
                  <p>But because the matter is of so great variety and minute consideration, every part whereof would require as much scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> as I purpose to bestow upon the whole, I have for the present chosen to consider only the form of it; and because it pretends against the form of set Lyturgy; and that <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> forms doe succeed in room of the established and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined services, I shall give you my judgement of it, without any sharpnesse or bitternesse of spirit, for I am resolved not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41208:170"/>
to be angry with any man of another perswasion, as knowing that I differ just as much from them as they doe from me.</p>
                  <p>And first, I consider that the true state of the Question is only this, Whether it is better to pray to God with considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> or without? whether is the wiser man of the two, hee who thinks, and deliberates what to say, or he that utters his mind as fast as it comes? Whether is the better man, he who out of reverence to God is most carefull and curious that he offend not in his tongue, and therefore he himselfe deliberates and takes the best guides he can, or he who out of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own abilities or other exteriour assistances, speaks what ever comes uppermost?</p>
                  <p>And here I have the advice and councell of a very wise man, no lesse than <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven and thou upon earth, therefore, let thy words be few.</hi> The consideration of the vast distance between God and us, Heaven and Earth, should create such apprehensions in us, that the very best and choycest of our offertoryes are not acceptable but by Gods gracious vouchsafeing and condescension: and therefore since we are so much indebted to God for accepting our best, it is not safe ventured to present him with a dowbaked sacrifice, and put him off with that which in nature and humane consideration is absolutely the worst; for such is all the crude and imperfect utterance of our more imperfect conceptions. But let <hi>Solomons</hi> reason be what it will, good we are sure it is. Let us consider who keeps the precept best; He that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, or he that considers not but when he speakes: What man in the world is hasty <hi>to offer any thing before God,</hi> if he bee not who prayes <hi>ex tempore?</hi> And then adde to it but the weight of <hi>Solomons</hi> reason, and let any man answer me if he thinks it can well stand with that reverence we owe to the Immense, the infinite, and to the eternall God, the God of wisdome, to offer him a sacrifice which we durst not present to a Prince, or a prudent Governour in <hi>re seriâ,</hi> such as our prayers ought to be.</p>
                  <p>And that this may not be dashed with a pretence it is carnall <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41208:171"/>
reasoning I desire it may be remembred, that it is the argument God himselfe uses against lame, maimed, and imperfect sacrifices, <hi>Goe and offer this to thy Prince,</hi> see if he will accept it: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that the best person is to have the best present; and what the Prince will slight as truly unworthy of him, much more is it unfit for God. For God accepts not of any thing we give or doe, as if he were bettred by it: for therefore its esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is not taken by its relation or naturall complacency to him, it is all alike to him, for in it selfe it is to him as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But God accepts it by its proportion, and commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to us. That which we call our best, and is truly so in humane estimate, that pleases God, for it declares that if we had better, we would give it him. But to reserve the best, sayes too plainly, that we think any thing is good enough for him. As therefore God in the Law would not be served by that which was imperfect in <hi>genere naturae:</hi> so neither now nor ever will that please him which is imperfect in <hi>genere morum,</hi> or <hi>materiâ intellectuali,</hi> when we can give a better.</p>
                  <p>Well then, in the nature of the thing, <hi>ex tempore</hi> forms have much the worse of it. But it is pretended that there is such <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.</note> a thing as the gift of Prayer, a praying with the Spirit, <hi>Et nescit tarda molimina spiritus sancti gratia.</hi> Gods Spirit (if he pleases) can doe his work as well in an instant, as in long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation. And to this purpose are pretended those places of Scripture which speak of the assistance of Gods Spirit in our prayers, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>And I will poure upon the house of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi> But especially <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it selfe maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered, &amp;c.</hi> From whence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion that is inferred is in the words of Saint <hi>Paul, That we must pray with the spirit,</hi> therefore not with set forms, therefore <hi>ex tempore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Collection is somewhat wild; for there is great inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence in the severall parts, and much more is in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> then was virtually in the premises. But such as it is, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41208:171"/>
Authors of it I suppose will own it. And therefore we will examine the maine design of it and then consider the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meanes of its perswasion, quoted in the objection.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the priviledges of the Gospel, and the benefit of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> Christs ascension, that the holy Ghost is given unto the Church, and is become to us the fountaine of gifts and graces. But these gifts and graces are improvements and helps of our naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, of our art and industry not extraordinary, miraculous, and immediate infusions of habits and gifts. That without Gods Spirit we cannot pray aright; that our infirmities need his help; that we know not what to ask of our selves, is most true: and if ever any Heretique was more confident of his own naturals, or did ever more undervalue Gods grace then ever the <hi>Pelagians</hi> did, yet he denyes not this. But what then? Therefore without study, without art, without premeditation, without learning, the spirit gives the gift of prayer, and it is his grace, that without any naturall or artificiall help makes us pray <hi>ex tempore?</hi> No such thing: The Objection proves nothing of this.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore we will joyn issue, whether the gifts and helps <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.</note> of the Spirit be immediate infusions of the Faculties, and powers, and perfect abilities? Or that he doth assist us only by his aydes externall and internall, in the use of such means which God and nature hath given to man, to ennoble his soul, better his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to improve his understanding? That the aydes of the holy Ghost are only assistances to us in the use of naturall and artificiall means, I will undertake to prove, and from thence it will evidently follow, that labour, and hard study, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation will soonest purchase the gift of prayer, and ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us of the assistance of the spirit; and therefore set forms of prayer, studyed and considered of are in a true and proper sense, and without enthusiasm, the fruits of the spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Gods Spirit did assist the Apostles by wayes extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note> and fit for the first institution of Christianity: but doth assist us now by the expresses of those first assistances which he gave to them immediately. So that the holy Ghost is the author of our saith, and we believe with the spirit (it is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41208:172"/>
and yet our beliefe comes by hearing and reading the holy Scriptures and their interpretations. Now reconcile these two together, Faith comes by hearing, and yet is the gift of the Spirit, and it sayes, that the gifts of the Spirit are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, and immediate infusions of habits, but helps from God to enable us upon the use of the meanes of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe, to speak, to understand, to prophecy, and to pray.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that these are for this reason called gifts, and graces, and issues of the Spirit, is so evident and notorious, that the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.</note> speaking of an ordinary revealed truth, is called in Scripture <hi>a speaking by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 8. <hi>No man can say that Jesus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Act. 19. 21. Act. 16. 7, 8, 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost.</hi> For if the holy Ghost supplyes us with materials, and fundamentals for our building, it is then enough to denominate the whole edifice to be of him, although the labour and the workmanship be ours, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers stock. And this is it which the Apostles speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Which things also we speak, not in the words which mans wisdome teacheth, but which the holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spirituall things with spirituall.</hi> The holy Ghost teaches, yet it is upon our co-operation, our study and endeavour, while we compare spirituall things with spirituall; the holy Ghost is said to teach us, because these spirituals were of his suggestion and revelation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For it is a rule of the Schools, and there is much reason <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.</note> in it. <hi>Habitus infusi infunduntur per modum acquisitorum,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is infused into us, is in the same manner infused as other things are acquired, that is, step by step, by humane meanes and co-operation, and grace does not give us new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and create another nature, but meliorates and improves our own. And what S. <hi>Paul</hi> said in the Resurrection, is also true in this Question. <hi>That is not first which is spirituall, but that which is naturall, and then that which is spirituall.</hi> The graces and gifts of the Spirit are postnate, and are additions to art and nature. God directs our councels, opens our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, regulates our will, orders our affections, supplies us with Objects, and Arguments, and opportunities, and revelations <hi>in scriptis,</hi> and then most when we most imploy our own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41208:172"/>
God loving to blesse all the meanes, and instruments of his service, whether they be naturall or acquisite.</p>
                  <p>But whosoever shall look for any other gifts of the spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.</note> the parts of nature helped by industry and Gods blessing upon it, and the revelations or the suppplyes of matter in holy Scripture, will be very farre to seek, having neither reason, promise, nor experience of his side. For why should the spirit of Prayer be any other than as the gift and spirit of saith (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13) acquired by humane meanes using divine aids? that is, by our endeavours in hearing, reading, Catechizing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to obey, and all this blessed and promoted by God, this produces faith. And if the spirit of Prayer be of greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and hath a promise of a speciall prerogative, let the first be proved, and the second be shewn in any good record, and then I will believe it too.</p>
                  <p n="3">4. And the parallel of this Argument I the rather urge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</note> I find praying in the holy Ghost joyned with graces, which are as much Gods gifts and productions of the spirit as any thing in the world, and yet which the Apostle presses upon us as duties and things put into our power, and to be improved by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and those are faith (in which I before instanced) and charity, <hi>Epist. Jud. ver.</hi> 20. <hi>But ye (beloved) building up your selves on your most holy Faith, praying in the holy Ghost, keep your selves in the love of God.</hi> All of the same consideration, Faith, and Prayer and Charity, all gifts of the Spirit, and yet build up your selves in faith, and keep your selves in love and therefore by a parity of reason, improve your selves in the spirit of prayer, that is, God by his Spirit having supplyed us with matter, let our industry and co-operations <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> improve these gifts, and build upon this foundation.</p>
                  <p>So that in effect, praying in the holy Ghost or with the Spirit, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.</note> is nothing but prayer for such things and in such manner which God by his Spirit hath taught us in holy Scripture. Holy prayers, spirituall songs, so the Apostle calls one part of prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charisticall or thanksgiving, that is, prayers or songs which are spirituall <hi>in materiâ.</hi> And if they be called spirituall for the efficient cause too, the holy Ghost being the Author of them, it comes all to one, for therefore he is the cause and giver of them,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41208:173"/>
because he hath in his word revealed, what things we are to pray for, and there also hath taught us the manner.</p>
                  <p>And this is exactly the Doctrine I plainly gather from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.</note> words of Saint <hi>Paul, (The spirit helpeth our infirmities)</hi> How so? it followes immediately, <hi>For we know not what we should pray for as we ought:</hi> So that therefore he is the Spirit of suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and prayer, because he teaches us what to ask, and how to pray, so he helps our infirmities, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is in the Greek <hi>Collaborantem adjuvat.</hi> It is an ingeminate expression of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping us in our labours together with him. Now he that shall say this is not sufficiently done by Gods Spirit in Scripture by Prayers, and Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall Songs, and precepts concerning prayer, set down in that holy repository of truth and devotion, undervalues that inestimable treasure of the Spirit; and if it be sufficiently done there, he that will multiply his hopes farther, then what is sufficient, may possibly deceive himself, but never deceive God, and make him multiply and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue miracles, to justifie his fancy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Better it is to follow the Scriptures for our guide, as in all <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.</note> things else, so in this particular, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Praying alwayes with all prayer and supplication in the spirit.</hi> The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit; praying in the Spirit is one way of using it, indeed the only way that he here specifies. Praying in the Spirit then being the using of this Sword, and this Sword being the Word of God, it followes evidently, that praying in the Spirit, is praying in or according to the Word of God, that is, in the directions, rules and expresses of the Word of God, that is, of the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The summe is this. Whatsoever this gift is, or this spirit of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.</note> Prayer, it is to be acquired by humane industry, by learning of the Scriptures, by reading, by conference, and by whatsoever else faculties are improved, and habits enlarged. Gods Spirit hath done his work sufficiently this way, and he loves not either in nature or grace (which are his two great sanctions) to multiply miracles when there is no need.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So that now I demand, Whether or no, since the expiration <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</note> of the Age of Miracles, does not Gods Spirit most assist us, when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41208:173"/>
we most endeavour and most use the meanes? He that sayes, No, discourages all men from reading the Scriptures, from industry, from meditation, from conference, from humane Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and from whatsoever else God and good Lawes provoke us to by proposition of rewards: But if, Yea, (as most certainly God will best crown the best endeavours) then the spirit of Prayer is greatest in him, who (supposing the like capacities and opportunities) studies hardest, reads most, practices most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, deliberates most prudently; and then by how much want of meanes is worse then the use of meanes, by so much <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> Prayers are worse then deliberate and studyed. Excellent therefore is the councell of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>If any man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God,</hi> (not lightly then and inconsiderately) <hi>If any man minister, let him doe it as of the ability which God giveth:</hi> (great reason then to put all his abilities and faculties to it) and whether of the two does most likely doe that, he that takes paines, and considers, and discusses, and so approves and practises a form, or he that never considers what he sayes, till hee sayes it, needs not much deliberation to passe a sentence.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Lastly, did not the Penmen of the Scripture, write the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles and Gospels respectively all by the Spirit? Most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.</note> holy men of God <hi>spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> And certainly they were moved by a more immediate motion, and a motion nearer to an Enthusiasme, then now adayes in the gift and spirit of Prayer. And yet in the midst of those great assistances and motions they did use study, art, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and humane abilities. This is more then probable in the different styles of the severall Books, some being of admirable art, others lower and plaine. The words were their own, at least sometimes, not the holy Ghosts. And if the Fathers and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians were not deceived by false Copies, but that they truly did observe, sometimes to be propriety of expression in the language, sometimes not true Greek, who will think those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours or imperfections in Grammar, were (in respect of the words I say precisely) immediate inspirations and dictates of the holy Ghost, and not rather their own productions of industry and humanity? But clearely some of their words were the words
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41208:174"/>
of <hi>Aratus,</hi> some of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> some of <hi>Menander,</hi> some of Saint <hi>Paul, [This speak I, not the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.] and yet because the holy Ghost renewed their memory, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their understanding, supplyed to some their want of humane learning, and so assisted them that they should not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an errour in fact or opinion, neither in the narrative nor dogmaticall parts, therefore they writ by the Spirit. Since then we cannot pretend upon any grounds of probability to an inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration so immediate as theirs, and yet their assistances which they had from the Spirit did not exclude humane arts, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, but that the ablest Scholler did write the best, much rather is this true in the gifts and assistances we receive, and particularly in the gift of Prayer, it is not an <hi>ex tempore</hi> and an inspired fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but the faculties of nature and the abilities of art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry are improved and ennobled by the supervening assistances of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And now let us take a man that pretends he hath the gift of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.</note> Prayer, and loves to pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> I suppose his thoughts goe a little before his tongue; I demand then, Whether cannot this man, when it is once come into his head, hold his tongue, and write down what he hath conceived? If his first conceptions were of God, and Gods Spirit, then they are so still, even when they are written. Or is the Spirit departed from him, upon the sight of a pen and Ink-horn? It did use to be otherwise among the old and new Prophets, whether they were Prophets of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or of ordinary Ministery. But if his conception may be written, and being written is still a production of the Spirit, then it follows that set-forms of Prayer deliberate and described, may as well be a praying with the Spirit, as sudden forms and <hi>ex tempore</hi> out lets.</p>
                  <p>Now the case being thus put, I would faine know what the difference is between deliberate and <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayers, save <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.</note> only that in these there is lesse consideration and prudence; for that the other are (at least as much as them) the productions of the Spirit, is evident in the very case put in this very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and whether to consider and to weigh them, be any disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our devotions, I leave it to all wise men to determine. So that in effect, since after the pretended assistance of the Spirit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41208:174"/>
in our Prayers, we may write them down, consider them, try the spirits, and ponder the manner, the reason and the religion of the addresse; let the world judge whether this sudden ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance and <hi>ex tempore</hi> forms be any thing else, but a direct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution not to consider before-hand what we speak.</p>
                  <p>But let us look a little further into the mystery, and see what <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.</note> is meant in Scripture by <hi>praying with the Spirit.</hi> In what sense the holy Ghost is called the <hi>spirit of Prayer,</hi> I have already shewn, <hi>viz.</hi> by the same reason, as he is the <hi>spirit of faith,</hi> of <hi>prudence,</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> of <hi>understanding,</hi> and the like. But <hi>praying with the spirit</hi> hath besides this other senses also in Scripture. I finde in one place, that then we pray with the Spirit, when the holy Ghost does actually excite us to desires and earnest tendencies to the obtaining our holy purposes, when he gives us zeale and devotion, charity and fervour, spirituall violence and holy impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. This sense is also in the latter part of the objected words of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The Spirit it selfe maketh intercession for us with groanings, &amp;c.</hi> Indeed this is truly a praying in the spirit; but this will doe our reverend Brethren of the Assembly little advantage as to the present Question. For this spirit is not a spirit of utterance; not at all clamorous in the eares of the people, but cryes loud in the eares of God with <hi>[groanes unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable</hi>] so it followes, and only <hi>[He that searcheth the heart, he understandeth the meaning of the spirit.</hi>] This is the spirit of the Son, which God hath sent into our hearts, (not into our tongues) whereby we cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. And this is the great <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> for mentall Prayer, which is properly and truly praying by the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Another praying with the Spirit I find in that place of S <hi>Paul,</hi>

                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.</note> from whence this expression is taken, and commonly used, <hi>I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.</hi> Here they are opposed, or at least declared to be things severall and disparate: where by the way observe, that praying with the spirit, even in sense of Scripture, is not alwayes most to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people. Not alwayes with understanding. And when these two are separated, St <hi>Paul</hi> prefers five words with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, before ten thousand in the spirit. For this praying with the spirit was indeed then a gift extraordinary and miraculous,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41208:175"/>
like as prophecying with the spirit, and expired with it. But while it did last, it was the lowest of gifts, <hi>Inter dona linguarum,</hi> it was but a gift of the tongue, and not to be the benefit of the Church directly or immediately.</p>
                  <p>By the way only. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did so undervalve the praying <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.</note> with the Spirit, that he preferred edifying the Church a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand degrees beyond it. I suppose he would have been of the same mind, if this Question had been between praying with the Spirit and obeying our superiors, as he was when it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween praying with the Spirit and edification of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (if I be not mistaken) it is matter of great concernment towards the edification of the Church to obey our superiours, not to innovate in publick formes of worship, especially with the scandall and offence of very wise and learned men, and to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the dead Martyrs, who sealed our Liturgy with their blood.</p>
                  <p>But to return. In this place praying with the Spirit, is no <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.</note> more then my spirit praying. For so S. <hi>Paul</hi> joynes them as terms identicall, and expressive one of anothers meaning, as you may please to read <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and my Spirit truly prayeth.</hi> It is the act of our inner man, praying holy and spirituall Prayers. But then indeed at that time there was something extraordinary joyned, for it was in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, the practice of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> there dislikes. This also will be to none of their purposes. For whether it were <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or by premeditation, is not here expressed; or if it had, yet that assistance extraordinary in prayer, if there was any beside the gift of tongues (which I much doubt) is no more transmitted to us, then the speaking tongues in the spirit, or prophecying <hi>ex tempore</hi> and by the spirit.</p>
                  <p>But I would adde also one experiment which S. <hi>Paul</hi> also there addes by way of instance. If praying with the spirit in this place <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.</note> be praying <hi>ex tempore,</hi> then so is singing too. For they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the same place, in the same manner, to the same end, and I know no reason why there should be differing senses put upon them to serve purposes. And now let us have some Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musick too, though the Organs be pulled down, and let any the best Psalmist of them all, compose a hymne in metricall forme,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41208:175"/>
and sing it to a new tune with perfect and true musick, and all this <hi>ex tempore.</hi> For all this the holy Ghost can doe if he pleases. But if it be said that the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Christians composed their songs and hymnes according to art and rules of musick, by study and industry, and that to this they were assisted by the Spirit; and that this together with the devotion of their spirit, was sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the spirit, then say I, so composing set forms of Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by skill and prudence, and humane industry, may be as much praying with the spirit as the other is singing with the spirit. Plainly enough. In all the senses of praying with the spirit, and in all its acceptations in Scripture, to pray or sing with the spirit, neither of them of necessity implyes <hi>ex tempore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The summe or <hi>Collecta</hi> of the premises is this, Praying with <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.</note> the spirit, is either when the spirit stirres up our desires to pray, <hi>Per motionem actualis auxilii,</hi> or when the spirit teaches us what, or how to pray, telling us the matter, and manner of our prayers. Or lastly, dictating the very words of our prayers. There is no other way in the world to pray with the spirit, or in the holy Ghost, that is pertinent to this Question. And of this last manner the Scripture determines nothing, nor speaks any thing expressely of it, and yet suppose it had, we are certaine the holy Ghost hath supplyed us with all these, and yet in set formes of prayer best of all, I meane there where a difference can be. For as for the desires, and actuall motions or incitements to pray, they are indifferent to one or the other, to set-forms or to <hi>ex tempore.</hi> 2. But as to the matter and manner of prayer, it is clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the expresses, and set forms of Scriptures, and it is supplyed to us by the spirit, for he is the great Dictator of it.</p>
                  <p>Now then for the very words. No man can assure me that the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.</note> words of his <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayer are the words of the holy Spirit: it is not reason nor modesty to expect such immediate assistances to so little purpose, he having supplyed us with abilities more then enough to expresse our desires <hi>aliunde,</hi> otherwise then by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate dictate. But if we will take <hi>Davids</hi> Psalter, or the other hymnes of holy Scripture, or any of the Prayers which are respersed over the Bible, we are sure enough that they are the words of Gods Spirit, mediately or immediately, by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion or extasie, by vision, or at least by ordinary assistance. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41208:176"/>
now then, what greater confidence can any man have for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Prayer, and the probability of their being accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then when he prayes his Psalter, or the Lords Prayer, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther office which he finds consigned in Scripture? When Gods Spirit stirs us up to an actuall devotion, and then we use the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee hath described and taught, and the very words which Christ, and Christs Spirit, and the Apostles, and other persons full of the holy Ghost did use; if in the world there be any praying with the Spirit, (I mean in vocall prayer) this is it.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have examined the intire and full scope of this Question, and rifled their Objection. Now I shall proceed to some few Arguments which are more extrinsecall to the nature of the thing.</p>
                  <p>It is a practice prevailing among those of our Brethren that are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.</note> zealous for <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers, to pray their Sermons over, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their doctrine into Devotion and Lyturgy. I mislike it not for the thing it selfe, if it were done regularly for the manner, and the matter were alwayes pious and true. But who shall assure me when the preacher hath disputed, or rather dogmatically decreed a point of predestination, or of prescience, of contingency, or of liberty, or any of the most mysterious parts of Divinity, and then prayes his Sermon over, that he then prayes with the Spirit? Unlesse I be sure that he also preached with the Spirit, I cannot be sure that he prayes with the spirit, for all he prayes <hi>ex tempore.</hi> Nay, if I heare a Protestant preach in the morning, and an Anabaptist in the afternoone, to day a Presbyterian, to morrow an Independent, am I not most sure that when they have preached Contradictories, and all of them pray their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons over, that they doe not all pray with the spirit? More than one in this case cannot pray with the spirit, possibly all may pray against him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From whence I thus argue in behalfe of set forms of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.</note> prayer. That in the case above put, how shall I or any man else say Amen to their prayers that preach and pray contradictories? At least I am much hindred in my devotion. For besides that, it derives our opinions into our devotions, makes every schoole point become our religion, and makes God a party, (so farre as we can) intitling him to our impertinent wranglings. Besides
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41208:176"/>
this, I say, while we should attend to our addresses towards God, we are to consider whether the point be true or no, and by that time we have tacitly discoursed it, we are upon another point which also perhaps is as Questionable as the former, and by this time our spirit of devotion is a little discomposed and something out of countenance, there is so much other imployment for the spirit, the spirit of discerning and judging. All which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are avoyded in set formes of Liturgy. For we know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand the conditions of our Communion, and to what we are to say Amen, to which if we like it we may repaire; if not, there is no harm done; your devotion shall not be surprized, nor your Communion invaded, as it may be and often is in your <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers. And this thing hath another collaterall inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, which is of great consideration; for upon what confidence can we sollicite any Recusants to come to our Church, where we cannot promise them that the devotions there to be used, shall be innocent, nor can we put him into a condition to judge for himselfe? If hee will venture he may, but we can use no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make him choose our Churches, though he should quit his own.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But again, let us consider with sobriety. Are not those <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 34.</note> prayers and hymnes in holy Scripture, excellent compositions, admirable instruments of devotion, full of piety, rare and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable addresses to God? Dare any man with his gift of prayer pretend, that he can <hi>ex tempore</hi> or by study make better? Who dares pretend that he hath a better spirit then <hi>David</hi> had, or then the Apostles and Prophets, and other holy persons in Scripture, whose Prayers and Psalmes are by Gods Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the use of the Church for ever? Or will it be denyed but that they also are excellent directories and patterns for prayer? And if patterns, the nearer we draw to our example, are not the imitations and representments the better? And what then if we took the samplers themselves, is there any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in them, and can we mend them and correct <hi>Magnificat?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a just porportion and commensuration, I argue so concerning the primitive and ancient forms of Church service, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.</note> according to those so excellent patterns, which if they had remained pure as in their first institution, or had alwayes been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41208:177"/>
as they have been reformed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they would against all defiance put in for the next place to those formes or Liturgy which <hi>Mutatis mutandis</hi> are nothing but the Words of Scripture. But I am resolved at this present not to enter into Question concerning the matter of prayers. But for the forme this I say further.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Church of God hath the promise of the spirit made to her in generall, to her in her Catholick and united ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 36.</note> to the whole Church first, then to particular Churches, then in the lowest seat of the Category to single persons. Now then I infer, if any single persons will have us to believe without all possibility of proofe (for so it must be) that they pray with the Spirit, (for how shall they be able to prove the spirit actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to abide in those single persons) then much rather must we believe it of the Church, which by how much the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall it is, so much the more of the spirit she is likely to have; and then if there be no errours in the matter, the Church hath the advantage and probability on her side, and if there be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in matter in either of them, they faile of their pretences, neither of them have the spirit. But the publick spirit in all reason is to be trusted before the private, when there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, the Church being <hi>Prior &amp; potior in premissis,</hi> she hath a greater and <hi>prior</hi> title to the spirit. And why the Church hath not the spirit of prayer in her compositions as well as any of her children, I desire once for all to be satisfied upon true grounds either of reason or revelation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Or if the Church shall be admitted to have the gift, and the spirit of prayer given unto her by virtue of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 37.</note> of the spirit, to abide with her for ever, yet for all this she is taught to pray in a set form of prayer, and yet by the spirit too. For what think we? When Christ taught us to pray in that incomparable modell, the Lords Prayer, if we pray that prayer devoutly, and with pious and actuall intention, doe we not pray in the Spirit of Christ, as much as if we prayed any other form of words pretended to be taught us by the Spirit? Wee are sure that Christ and Christs Spirit taught us this Prayer; they only gather by conjectures and opinions, that in their <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> forms the spirit of Christ teaches them. So much then as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41208:177"/>
certainties are better then uncertaines, and God above man, so much is this set form (besides the infinite advantages in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) better then their <hi>ex tempore</hi> forms in the form it selfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If I should descend to minutes and particulars, I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 38.</note> in the behalfe of set forms, that God prescribed to <hi>Moses</hi> a set form of prayer and benediction to be used when he did blesse the people. 7. That <hi>Moses</hi> composed a song or hymne for the children of Israel to use to all their generations. 8. That <hi>David</hi> composed many for the service of the tabernacle. 9. That <hi>Solomon</hi> and the holy Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> brought them in and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued them in the ministration of the temple. 10. That all Scripture is written for our learning, and since all these and many more set forms of prayer are left there upon record, it is more then probable that they were left there for our use and devotion. 11. That S. <hi>John</hi> Baptist taught his Disciples a forme of prayer. 12. And that Christs Disciples begged the same favour, and it was granted as they desired it. 13. And that Christ gave it not only <hi>in massâ materiae,</hi> but <hi>in forma verborum;</hi> not in a confused heap of matter, but in an exact composure of words, it makes it evident, he intended it not only <hi>pro regula petendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> for a direction of what things we are to ask, but also <hi>pro forma orationis,</hi> for a set form of Prayer. In which also I am most certainly confirmed (besides the universall testimony of Gods Church so attesting it) in the precept which Christ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>When ye pray, pray after this manner:</hi> and indeed it points not the matter only of our prayers, but the form of it, the manner and the matter of the addresse both. But in the repetition of it by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> the preceptive words seeme to limit us, and direct us to this very form of words, <hi>when ye pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> 14. I could also adde the example of all the Jewes, and by consequence of our blessed Saviour, who sung a great part of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalter in their feast of Passeover, which part is called by the Iewes the great <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> it begins at the 113 Psalm, and ends at the 118 inclusively. And the Scripture mentions it as part of our blessed Saviours devotion, and of his Disciples, that they sung a Psalme. 15. That this afterward became a Precept Evangelicall, that we should praise God in Hymnes, Psalmes, and spirituall Songs, which is a form of Liturgy, in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41208:178"/>
which we sing with the spirit, but yet cannot make our Hymnes <hi>ex tempore,</hi> (it would be wild stuffe if we should goe about it.) 16. And lastly, that a set form of worship and addresse to God was recorded by Saint <hi>John,</hi> and sung in heaven, and it was <note place="margin">Apoc. 15.</note> composed out of the songs of <hi>Moses, (Exod.</hi> 15.) of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 145.) and of <hi>Jeremy, (Chap.</hi> 10. 6, 7.) which certainly is a very good precedent for us to imitate, although but revealed to Saint <hi>John</hi> by way of vision and extasie. All which and many more are to me as so many Arguments of the use, excellency, and necessity of set forms of Prayer for publick Liturgies, and of greatest conveniencie, even for private devotions.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And so the Church of God in all Ages did understand it. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 39.</note> I shall not multiply Authorities to this purpose, for they are too many and various; but shall only observe two great instances of their beliefe and practise in this particular. 1. The one is the perpetuall use and great Eulogies of the Lords Prayer, assisted by the many Commentaries of the Fathers upon it. 2. The other is that solemn form of benediction and mysticall prayer (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Trinit. c.</hi> 4.) which all Churches (and themselves said it was by Ordinance Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call) used in the Consecration of the blessed Sacrament. But all of them used the Lords Prayer in the Canon, and office of Consecration, and other prayers taken from Scripture, (so <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> testifies, that the Consecration is made <hi>per preces verbi Dei,</hi> by the prayers taken from the Word of God) and the whole Canon was short, determined and mysterious.</p>
                  <p>Who desires to be further satisfied in this particular, shall <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 40.</note> find enough in <hi>Walafridus Strabo, Aymonius, Cassander, Elacius Illyrious, Josephus Vicecomes,</hi> and the other Ritualists, and the other Ritualists, and in the old offices themselves. So that I need not put you in mind of that famous doxology of <hi>Gloria Patria, &amp;c.</hi> nor the <hi>Trisagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nor any of those memorable hymnes used in the Ancient Church, so knownly and frequently, that the beginning of them came to bee their name, and they were known more by their own words, then the Authors inscription.</p>
                  <p>At last when some men that thought themselves better gifted <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 41.</note> would be venturing at conceived formes of their own, there was a timely restraint made in the Councell of <hi>Milevis</hi> in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41208:178"/>
                     <hi>Africa, Placuit ut preces quae probatae fuerint in Concilio ab omnibus celebrentur, nec aliae omnino dicantur in Ecclesia, nisi quae à pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioribus factae fuerint in Synodo.</hi> That's the restraint and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, publick prayers must be such as are publickly appointed, and prescribed by our Superiours; and no private forms of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving must be used in the Church. The reason followes, <hi>Ne forte aliquid contra fidem, vel per ignorantiam, vel per minus studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um sit compositum:</hi> Lest through ignorance or want of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any thing be spoken in our prayers against faith [and good manners.] The reason is good, and they are eare-witnesses of it that hear the variety of prayers before and after Sermons, there, where the Directory is practised, where (to speak most modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) not only their private opinions, but also humane interests, and their own personall concernments, and wild fancies, born per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not two dayes before, are made the objects of the peoples hopes, of their desires, and their prayers, and all in the meane time pretend to the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>I will not now instance in the vaine-glory that is appendant <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 42.</note> to these <hi>ex tempore</hi> formes of prayer, where the gift of the man is more then the devotion of the man: nor will I consider that then his gift is best, when his prayer is longest: and if he take a complacency in his gift (as who is not apt to doe it?) he will be sure to extend his Prayer, till a suspicious and scrupulous man would be apt to say, his prayer pressed hard upon that which our blessed Saviour reprehended in the Pharisees, who thought to bee heard for their much babling. But these things are accidentall to the nature of the thing. And therefore though they are too certainly consequent to the person, yet I will not be too severe, but preserve my selfe on the surer side of charitable construction, which truly I desire to keep, nor only to their persons whom I much reverence, but also to their actions. But yet I durst not doe the same thing, even for these last reasons, though I had no other.</p>
                  <p>But it is objected, that in set forms of Prayer, we restrain and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 43.</note> confine the blessed Spirit; and in conceived forms, when every man is left to his liberty, then the Spirit is free, unlimited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrained.</p>
                  <p>I answer, either their conceived formes (I use their own words, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 44.</note>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41208:179"/>
though indeed the expression is very inartificiall) are premeditate and described or they are <hi>ex tempore.</hi> If they be premeditate and described, then the Spirit is as much limited in their conceived forms as in the Churches conceived forms. For as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it is all one who describes and limits the form, whether the Church, or a single man does it, still the Spirit is in constraint and limit. So that in this case they are not angry at set forms of Prayer, but that they do not make them. And if it be replyed, that if a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle person composes a set form, he may alter it if he please, and so his spirit is at liberty. I answer, so may the Church, if she see cause for it: and unlesse there be cause the single person will not alter it, unlesse he do things unreasonable and without cause. So that it will be an unequall and a peevish quarrell to allow of set forms of prayer made by private persons, and not of set forms made by the publick spirit of the Church. It is evident, that the Spirit is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in both alike.</p>
                  <p>But if by <hi>[Conceived forms</hi>] in this objection they meane <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 45.</note> 
                     <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers (for so they most generally practice it) and that in the use of these the liberty of the spirit is best preserved. To this I answer, that the being <hi>ex tempore</hi> or premeditate will be wholly impertinent to this Question of limiting the spirit. For there may be great liberty in set forms, even when there is much variety; and there may be great restraint in <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers, even then when it shall be called unlawfull to use set forms. That the spirit is restrained, or that it is free in either, is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall to them both; for it may be either free or not free in both as it may happen.</p>
                  <p>But the restraint is this, that every one is not left to his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 46.</note> to pray how he list, (with premeditation or without, it makes not much matter) but that he is prescribed unto by the spirit of another. But if it be a fault thus to restraine the spirit, I would faine know, is not the spirit restrained when the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation shall be confined to the form of this one mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing? or it shall be unlawfull, or at least a disgrace and dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to use any set forms, especially of the Churches compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. More plainly thus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doth not the Minister confine and restraine the spirit of the Lords People, when they are tyed to his form? It would <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 47.</note>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41208:179"/>
sound of more liberty to their spirits, that every one might make a prayer of his own and all pray together; and not be forced or confined to the Ministers single dictate, and private spirit. It is true, it would breed confusions, and therefore they might pray silently till the Sermon began, and not for the avoiding one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience runne into a greater, and to avoid the disorder of a popular noyse restraine the blessed Spirit; for even in this case as well as in the other, <hi>Where the spirit of God is, there must be liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the spirit must be at liberty, who shall assure us this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty must be in forms of prayer? And if so, whether also it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 48.</note> must be in publike prayer, and will it not suffice that it be in private? And if in publike prayers, is not the liberty of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit sufficiently preserved in that the publike spirit is free? That is, the Church hath power upon occasion to alter and encrease her Litanyes. By what Argument shall any man make it so much as probable, that the holy Ghost is injured, if every private Ministers private spirit shall be guided (and therefore by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence limited) by the Authority of the Churches publick spirit?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Does not the Directory that thing which is here called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 49.</note> of the spirit? Does it not appoint every thing but the words? And after this is it not a goodly <hi>Palladium</hi> that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, and a princely liberty that they leave unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to be free only in the supplying the place of a Vocabulary and a <hi>Copia Verborum?</hi> For as for the matter, it is all there described and appointed, and to those determined senses the spirit must assist or not at all only for the words he shall take his choyce. Now I desire it may be considered sadly and seriously: Is it not as much injury to the spirit to restraine his matter, as to appoint his words? Which is the more considerable of the two, sense or Language, Matter or Words? I meane when they are taken singly and separately. For so they may very well be (for as if men prescribe the matter only, the spirit may cover it with severall words and expressions, so if the spirit prescribe the words, I may still abound in variety of sense, and preserve the liberty of my meaning; we see that true in the various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the same words of Scripture.) So that in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41208:180"/>
greater of the two, the Spirit is restrained, when his matter is appointed, and to make him amends, for not trusting him with the matter without our directions and limitations, we trust him to say what he pleases, so it be to our sense, to our purposes. A goodly compensation surely!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Did not Christ restrain the spirit of his Apostles, when he <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 50.</note> taught them to pray the Lords Prayer, whether his precept to his Disciples concerning it, was <hi>Pray this,</hi> or <hi>Pray thus, Pray these words,</hi> or <hi>pray after this manner?</hi> or though it had been lesse then either, and been only a Directory for the matter, still it is a thing which our Brethren in all other cases of the same nature are resolved perpetually to call a restraint. Certainly then this pretended restraint, is no such formidable thing. These men themselves doe it by directing all the matter, and much of the manner, and Christ himselfe did it, by prescribing both the matter, and the words too.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. These restraints (as they are called) or determinations of the Spirit are made by the Spirit himselfe. For I demand, when <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 51.</note> any Assembly of Divines appointed the matter of Prayers to all particular Ministers as this hath done, is that appointment by the Spirit or no? If no, then for ought appears, this Directory not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by Gods Spirit, may be an enemy to it. But if this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment be by the Spirit, then the determination and limitation of the Spirit, is by the Spirit himself, and such indeed is every pious and prudent constitution of the Church in matters spirituall: Such as was that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when he prescribed orders for publike prophecying, and interpretation, and speaking with tongues. The spirit of some he so restrained, that he bound them to hold their peace, he permitted but two or three to speak at one meeting, the rest were to keep silence, though possibly six or seven might at that time have the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Is it not a restraint of the Spirit to sing a Psalm in meeter by appointment? Cleerely as much as appointing formes of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 52.</note> prayer or Eucharist. And yet that we see done daily, and no scruple made. Is not this to be partiall in judgement, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate of what wee doe?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And now after all this strife, what harm is there in restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the spirit in the present sense? What prohibition, what law, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 53.</note>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41208:180"/>
what reason or revelation is against it? What inconvenience in the nature of the thing? For can any man be so weak as to imagine a despite is done to the spirit of grace, when those gifts to his Church are used regularly and by order? As if prudence were no gift of Gods spirit, as if helps in Government, and the ordering spirituall matters were none of those graces which Christ when he ascended up on high gave unto Men. But this whole matter is wholly a stranger to reason, and never seen in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>For Divinity never knew any other vitious restraining of the Spirit, but either suppressing those holy incitements to virtue and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 54.</note> good life, which Gods Spirit ministers to us externally or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, or else a forbidding by publick Authority the Ministers of the Word and Sacraments, to speak such truths as God hath commended, and so taking away the liberty of Prophecying. The first is directly vitious <hi>In materia speciale,</hi> the second is tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Antichristian. And to it persecution of true Religion is to be reduced. But as for this pretended limiting or restraining the spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> by appointing a regular form of prayer, it is so very a Chimera, that it hath no footing or foundation upon any ground where a wise man may build his confidence.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But lastly, how if the spirit must be restrained, and that by <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 55.</note> precept Apostolicall? That calls us to a new account. But if it be not true, what meanes S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by saying <hi>The spirits of the Prophets must be subject to the Prophets?</hi> What greater restraint then subjection? If subjected, then they must be ruled; if ruled, then limited, prescribed unto, and as much under restraint as the spirits of the superiour Prophets shall judge convenient. I suppose by this time this objection will trouble us no more. But perhaps another will.</p>
                  <p>For why are not the Ministers to be left as well to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in making their Prayers as their Sermons? I answer, the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 56.</note> Church may if she will, but whether she doth well or no, let her consider. This I am sure, there is not the same reason, and I fear the experience the world hath already had of it, will make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration enough of the inconvenience. But however the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are many.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our prayers offered up by the Minister, are in behalfe and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41208:181"/>
in the name of the people, and therefore great reason they should know before-hand, what is to be presented, that if they like not the message, they may refuse to communicate; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally since people are so divided in their opinions, in their hopes, and in their faiths: it being a duty to refuse Communion with those prayers which they think to have in them the matter of sin or doubting. Which reason on the other part ceases, for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being to speak from God to the people, if he speaks what he ought not, God can right himselfe, however is not partner of the sinne, as in the other case, the people possibly may be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is more fit a liberty be left in preaching then praying, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 58.</note> because the addresse of our discourses and exhortations are to be made according to the understanding and capacity of the audience, their prejudices are to be removed, all advantages to be taken, and they are to be surprized that way they lie most open <hi>[But being crafty I caught you,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>] and discourses and arguments <hi>ad hominem,</hi> upon their particular principles and practices may more move them then the most polite and accurate that doe not comply and wind about their fancies and affections. S. <hi>Paul</hi> from the absurd practice of being baptized for the dead, made an excellent Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of the Resurrection. But this reason also ceases in our prayers. For God understandeth what we say sure enough, he hath no prejudices to be removed, no infirmities to be wrought upon, and a fine figure of Rhetorick, a pleasant cadence, and a curious expression, move not him at all; no other twinings and complyances stirre him but charity, and humility, and zeale, and importunity, which all are things internall and spirituall. And therefore of necessity there is to be great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of discourses to the people, and permissions accordingly, but not so to God, with whom a <hi>Deus miserere</hi> prevailes as soon as the great office of 40 houres not long since invented in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other prayers spun out to a length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the extension of the office of a Pharisee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I feare it cannot stand with our reverence to God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 59.</note> to every spirit a liberty of publike addresse to him in behalfe of the people. Indeed he that is not fit to pray, is not alwayes fit to preach; but it is more safe to be bold with the people then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41208:181"/>
with God, if the persons be not so fit. In that there may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion, but there may be impiety and irreligion in this The people may better excuse and pardon an indiscretion or a rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (if any such should happen) then we may venture to offer it to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a latitude of Theology, much whereof is left to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 60.</note> us, so, without precise and clear determination, that without breach either of faith or charity, men may differ in opinion: and if they may not be permitted to abound in their own sense, they will be apt to complaine of tyrannie over consciences, and that men Lord it over their faith. In Prayer this thing is so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that it is imprudent and full of inconvenience to derive such things into our prayers, which may with good profit be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sermons. Therefore here a liberty may well enough be granted, when there it may better be denyed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But indeed, if I may freely declare my opinion, I think <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 61.</note> it were not amisse if the liberty of making Sermons were something more restrained then it is, and that either such persons only were intrusted with liberty for whom the Church her selfe may safely bee responsall, that is, to men learned and pious, and that the other part, the <hi>Vulgus Cleri,</hi> should instruct the people out of the fountaines of the Church, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the publick stock, till by so long exercise and discipline in the Schooles of the Prophets, they may also be intrusted to minister of their own unto the people. This I am sure was the practice of the Primitive Church when Preaching was as ably and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously performed as now it is. But in this I prescribe nothing. But truly I think the reverend Divines of the Assembly are many of my mind in this particular, and that they observe a liberty indulged to some persons to preach, which I think they had rather should hold their peace, and yet think the Church better edified in your silence then their Sermons.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But yet me thinks the Argument objected, if it were <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 62.</note> turned with the edge the other way would have more reason in it: and instead of arguing <hi>[Why should not the same be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in praying as in preaching</hi>] it were better to substitute this. If they can pray with the spirit, why also doe they not preach with the spirit? and if praying with the spirit be praying <hi>ex</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41208:182"/>
                     <hi>tempore,</hi> why shall they not preach <hi>ex tempore</hi> too, or else con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that they preach without the spirit, or that they have not the gift of Preaching? For to say that the gift of prayer, is a gift <hi>ex tempore,</hi> but the gift of Preaching is with study and deliberation, is to become vaine and impertinent. <hi>Quis enim discrevit?</hi> Who hath made them of a different consideration? I mean as to this particular, as to their efficient cause. Nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor revelation, nor God, nor man.</p>
                  <p>To summe up all. If any man hath a mind to exercise his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 63.</note> gift of Prayer, let him set himself to work, and compose Books of Devotion, (we have great need of them in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so apparent need, that the Papists have made it an objection against us) and this his gift of Prayer will bee to edification. But otherwise, I understand it is more fit for osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then any spirituall advantage. For God hears us not the sooner for our <hi>ex tempore,</hi> long, or conceived prayers; possibly they may become a hindrance, as in the cases before instanced. And I am sure if the people be intelligent, and can discern, they are hindred in their Devotion, for they dare not say <hi>Amen</hi> till they have considered; and many such cases will occurre in <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers, that need much considering before we attest them. But if the people bee not intelligent, they are apt to swallow all the inconveniencies which may multiply in so great a licence; and therefore it were well that the Governours of the Church who are to answer for their soules, should judge for them, before they say <hi>Amen,</hi> which judgement cannot bee without set-forms of Liturgy. My sentence therefore is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Let us be as we are already. Few changes are for the better.</p>
                  <p>For if it be pretended, that in the Liturgy of the Church of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 64.</note> 
                     <hi>England,</hi> which was composed with much art and judgement by a Church that hath as much reason to be confident she hath the Spirit and gifts of Prayer, as any single person hath, and each learned man that was at its first composition, can as much prove that he had the Spirit, as the objectors now adayes: (and he that boasts most, certainly hath the least.) If I say it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, there are many errours and inconveniences both in the order and the matter of the Common-Prayer Book, made by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41208:182"/>
such men, with so much industry: How much more, and with how much greater reason may we all dread the inconveniencies and disorders of <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers? where there is neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of heads, nor premeditation, nor industry, nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, nor art, nor any of those things (or at least not in the same degree) which were likely to have exempted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Book from errours and disorders. If these things be in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?</p>
                  <p>But if it be said, the <hi>ex tempore</hi> and conceived prayers will <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 65.</note> be secured from errour by the Directory, because that chalks them out the matter. I answer, it is not sufficient, because if when men study both the matter and the words too, they may be (and it is pretended are actually) erroneous; much more may they when the matter is left much more at liberty, and the words under no restraint at all. And no man can avoid the pressure and the weight of this, unlesse the Compilers of the Directory were infallible, and that all their followers were so too, of the certainty of which I am not yet fully satisfied.</p>
                  <p>And after all this I would fain know, what benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 66.</note> shall the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her united capacity, and every particular in the diffused capacity receive by this new device? For the publike it is cleare, that whether the Ministers pray before they study, or study before they pray, there must needs be infinite deformity in the publike worship, and all the benefits which were before the consequents of conformity and unity, will be lost, and if they be not valuable, I leave it to all them to consider, who know the inconveniences of publike dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, and the publike disunion that is certainly consequent to them who doe not communicate in any common formes of worship. And to think that the Directory will bring conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is as if one should say, that all who are under the same He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere are joyned <hi>in communi patriâ,</hi> and will love like Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; for under the Directory there will be as different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and as different desires, and as differing formes as there are severall varieties of men and manners under the one halfe of heaven, who yet breath under the same halfe of the Globe. But I ask again, what benefit can the publike receive by this forme, or this no form, for I know not whether to call it. Shall the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41208:183"/>
matter of prayers be better in all Churches? shall God be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter served? shall the word of God and the best patterns of prayers be alwayes exactly followed? It is well if it be. But there is security given us by the Directory; for the matter is left at every mans dispose for all that, and we must depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the honesty of every particular for it; and if any man proves a Heretick, or a Knave, then he may introduce what impiety he please, into the publick formes of Gods worship; and there is no law made to prevent it, and it must be cured afterwards if it can; but before-hand it is not prevented at all by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, which trusts every man. But I observe, that all the benefit which is pretended, is, that it will make an able Ministery, which I confesse I am very much from believing, and so will every man be that considers what kind of men they are that have been most zealous for that way of conceived prayer. I am sure that very few of the learnedst, very many ignorants, most those who have made least abode in the Schools of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. And that I may disgrace no mans person, we see Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the most illiberall arts, and women pretend to it, and doe it with as many words (and that's the maine thing) with as much confidence, and speciousnesse, and spirit, as the best among them. And it is but a small portion of learning that will serve a man to make conceived formes of prayer, which they have easily upon the stock of other men, or upon their own fancie, or upon any thing in which no learning is required. He that knowes nothing of the craft may be in the Preachers trade. But what? Is God better served? I would faine see any Authority, or any reason, or any probability for that. I am sure ignorant men offer him none of the best sacrifices <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and learned men will be sure to deliberate, and know. God is then better <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

although the Common-prayer Book in the Preface to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory bee charged with unnecessary length, yet we see that most of these men, they that are most eminent or would be so, make their prayers longer, and will not lose the benefits which their credit gets, and they by their credit, for making their prayers.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this that there is no promise in Scripture, that he who prayes <hi>ex tempore</hi> shall be heard the better, or that he shall bee assisted at all to such purposes; and therefore to innovate in so high a matter without a warrant to command us, or a promise to warrant us, is no better then vanity in the thing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in the person. He therefore that considers that this way of prayer is without all manner of precedent in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, against the example of all famous Churches in all Christendome in the whole descent of 15. Ages, without all command and warrant of Scripture, that it is unreasonable in the nature of the thing, against prudence and the best wisedome of humanity, because it is without deliberation, that it is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in a high degree without that Authority which is truly and by inherent and ancient right to command and prescribe to us in externall forms of worship, that it is much to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the first reformers of our Religion, that it gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Papists, to quarrell with some reason and more pretence against our Reformation, as being by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory confessed to have been done in much blindnesse, and therefore might erre in the excesse as well as in the defect, in the throwing out too much, as casting off too little, which is the more likely, because they wanted zeale to carry it farre enough. He that considers the universall deformity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worship and the no meanes of union, no Symbol of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like communion being publikely consigned, that all Heresies may with the same Authority bee brought into our prayers, and offered to God in behalfe of the people, with the same Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that any truth may all the matter of our prayers being left to the choyce of all men, of all perswasions, and then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that actually there are in many places, heresie, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy, and impertinency, and illiterate rudenesses put into the devotions of the most Solemne dayes, and the most publike
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41208:184"/>
meetings; and then lastly, that there are divers parts of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, for which no provisions at all is made in the Directory, and the very administration of the Sacraments left so loosely, that if there be any thing essentiall in the forms of Sacraments the Sacrament may come ineffectuall by want of due words, and due ministration. I say, he that considers all these things (and many more he may consider) will finde that particular men are not fit to be intrusted to offer in publike with their private spirit, to God, for the people, in such solemnities, in matters of so great concernment, where the honour of God, the benefit of the people, the interest of Kingdomes, the being of a Church, the unity of minds, the conformity of practice, the truth of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, and the salvation of soules, are so very much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as they are in the publike prayers of a whole Nationall Church. An unlearned man is not to be trusted, and a wise man dare not trust himselfe; hee that is ignorant cannot, he that is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM ingag'd in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a Great Truth, and J would willingly finde a shrowd to cover my selfe from danger, and calumny; and although the cause both is &amp; ought to be defended by Kings, yet my person must
<pb facs="tcp:41208:186"/>
not goe thither to Sanctuary, unlesse it be to pay my devotion, and I have now no other left for my defence, I am robd of that which once did blesse me, and indeed still does, (but in another manner) and I hope will doe more; but those distillations of coelestiall dewes are conveyed in Channels not pervious to an eye of sense, and now adayes we seldome look with other, be the object never so beauteous or alluring. You may then think, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am forc'd upon You; may that beg my pardon and excuse, but I should do an injury to Your Noblenesse, if I should onely make You a refuge for my need, (pardon this truth) you are also of the fairest choice, not only for Your love of Learning, (for although that be eminent in You, yet it is not Your eminence) but for Your duty to H. Church, for Your loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to His sacred <hi>Majestie.</hi> These did prompt me with the greatest confidence to hope for Your faire incouragement, and assistance in my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> in which cause Religion, and <hi>Majesty,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested as parties of mutuall concernment.</p>
                  <p>There was an odde observation made long
<pb facs="tcp:41208:186"/>
agoe, and registred in the Law to make it au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, <hi>Laici sunt infensi Clericis.</hi> Now the Clergy pray, but fight not, and therefore if not specially protected by the King <hi>contra Ecclesiam Malignantium,</hi> they are made obnoxious to all the contumelies, and injuries, which an envious multitude will inflict upon them. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd enough in King <hi>Edgars</hi> time, <hi>Quamvis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta</hi>

Idcirco Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vimus Nos &amp;c.</hi> There was a sad example of it in K. <hi>Iohn's</hi> time. For when he threw the Clergy from his Protection, it is incredible what inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, what affronts, what robberies, yea what murders were committed upon the Bishops, and Priests of H. Church, whom neither the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crednesse of their persons, nor the Lawes of God, nor the terrors of Conscience, nor feares of Hell, nor Church-censures, nor the Lawes of Hospitality could protect from Scorne, from blowes, from slaughter. Now there being so
<pb facs="tcp:41208:187"/>
neer a tye as the necessity of their own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the midst of so apparent danger, it will tye the <hi>Bishops</hi> hearts, and hands to the King faster then all the tyes of Lay-Allegiance, (all the Politicall tyes I mean,) all that are not precisely religious, and obligations in the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the interest of the <hi>Bishops</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with the prosperity of the <hi>King,</hi> besides the interest of their own securitie; by the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of secular advantages. For they who have their livelyhood from the <hi>King,</hi> and are in expectance of their fortune from him are more likely to pay a tribute of exacter duty, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whose fortunes are not in such immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate dependancy on His Majesty. <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> once gave a merry reason why Clerks advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Pope above a Councell, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Pope gave spirituall promotions, but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels gave none. It is but the Common expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gratitude, that a Patron Paramount shall be more assisted by his Beneficiaries in cases of necessity, then by those, who receive nothing from him but the common influences of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb facs="tcp:41208:187"/>
3. But the <hi>Bishops</hi> duty to the <hi>King</hi> derives it selfe from a higher fountaine. For it is one of the maine excellencies in Christianity, that it advances the State, and well being of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and Bodies Politique. Now then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Religion the Reverend <hi>Bishops,</hi> whose peculiar office it is to promote the interests of Christianity, are by the nature and essentiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites of their office bound to promote the Honour and Dignity of <hi>Kings,</hi> whom Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity would have so much honour'd, as to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the just subordination of people to their Prince, upon better principles then ever, no lesse then their precise duty to God, and the hopes of a blissefull immortality. Here then is <hi>utile, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,</hi> and <hi>necessarium,</hi> to tye <hi>Bishops</hi> in duty to <hi>Kings,</hi> and a threefold Cord is not easily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>In pursuance of these obligations <hi>Episcopacy</hi> payes three returnes of tribute to Monarchy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is the Duty of their people. For they being by God himselfe set over soules, judges of the most secret recesses of our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the venerable Priests under them,
<pb facs="tcp:41208:188"/>
have more power to keep men in their duteous subordination to the Prince, then there is in any secular power, by how much more forcible the impressions of the Conscience are, then all the externall violence in the world. And this power they have fairely put into act, for there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Protestant <hi>Bishop</hi> yet in Rebellion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he turn'd recreant to his Order, and it is the honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that all her Children, and obedient people are full of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against Rebells, be they of any interest, or party whatsoever. For here (&amp; for it wethanke God and good Princes) <hi>Episcopacy</hi> hath been preserv'd in faire priviledges and honour, and God hath blest and honour'd <hi>Episcopacy</hi> with the conjunction of a loyall people. As if because in the law of Nature the Kingdome and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood were joyned in one person, it were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and consonant to the first justice, that Kings should defend the rights of the Church, and the Church advance the honour of <hi>Kings.</hi> And when I consider that the first <hi>Bishop</hi> that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctorated was a Prince too, Prince, and <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> me thinks it was an ill <hi>Omen,</hi> that the
<pb facs="tcp:41208:188"/>
cause of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> should be in Conjunction ever after.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A second returne that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> makes to <hi>Royalty</hi> is that which is the Duty of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, the paying tributes, and impositions. And though all the <hi>Kings</hi> Leige people doe it, yet the issues of their duty, and liberality are mightily disproportionate if we consider their unequall Number, and Revenues. And if Clergy-subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be estimated according to the smallnesse of their revenue, and paucity of persons, it will not be half so short of the number, and weight of Crownes from Lay Dispensation, as it does farre exceed in the proportion of the Donative.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the assistance that the Kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland had in their Counsells, and affaires of greatest difficulty, from the great ability of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> and other the Ministers of the Church, I desire to represent in the words of K. <hi>Alvred</hi> to <hi>Walfsigeus</hi> the <hi>Bishop,</hi> in an Epistle where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the misery of his owne age by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the former times, when the <hi>Bishops</hi> were learn'd, and exercis'd in publike Counsels. <hi>Faelicia tum tempora fuerunt inter omnes Angliae</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>His next onset was by <hi>Iulian,</hi> and <hi>occidere Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium,</hi> that was his Province. To shut up publick Schooles, to force Christians to ignorance, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish, and disgrace the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to make them vile, and dishonourable, these were his arts; and he did the Divell more service in this finenesse of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining, then all the open battery of the ten great Rammes of persecution. But this would not take. For, <hi>that which is without cannot defile a man.</hi> So it is in the <hi>Church</hi> too. <hi>Cedunt in bonum, all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences ab extrà.</hi>

But therefore besides these he attempted by <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi> to rent the Churches bowels all in pieces; but the good <hi>Bishops</hi> gathered up the scattered pieces &amp; reunited them at <hi>Nice,</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> at <hi>Carthage, at Rome,</hi> and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous place of Christendome, and by God's goodnesse, and the <hi>Bishops</hi> industry Catholick reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was conserved in Vnity, and integrity. Well! however it is, <hi>Antichrist</hi> must come at last, and the great <hi>Apostacy</hi> foretold must be, and this, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means proportionable to the production of so great declensions of Christianity. <hi>When ye heare of warres, and rumors of warres, be not afraid</hi> (said our B. Saviour,) <hi>the end is not yet.</hi> It is not <hi>warre</hi> that will doe <hi>this great work of destruction,</hi> for then it might have been done long 'ere now. What then will doe it? We shall know when we see it. In the meane time when we shall find <hi>a new device,</hi> of which indeed the platforme was laid, in <hi>Aërius,</hi> and the <hi>Acephali,</hi> brought to a good possibility of compleating, a thing that <hi>whosoever shall heare, his ears shall tingle, an abhomination of desolation stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where it ought not, in sacris,</hi> in <hi>holy persons,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>offices,</hi> it is too probable that this is the <hi>praeparatory</hi> for <hi>the Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>grand Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall exalt himselfe above all that is <hi>called God,</hi> and in Scripture none but <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> are <hi>such, Dii vocati, Dii facti,</hi> I think we have great reason to be suspitious, that he that devests <hi>both</hi> of their power (and they are, if the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41208:194"/>
King be Christian, in very neer conjunction,) does the work of <hi>Antichrist</hi> for him; especially if the men, whom it most concernes, will but call to mind, that the discipline, or Government, which Christ hath instituted, is that Kingdome, by which he governes all Christendome (so themselves have taught us) so that, in case it be proved, that <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> is <hi>that government,</hi> then they (to use their own expressions) throw <hi>Christ</hi> out of <hi>his Kingdome;</hi> and then, either they leave the Church without a <hi>head,</hi> or else put <hi>Antichrist</hi> in substitution.</p>
                  <p>We all wish, that our feares in this, and all things else, may be vaine, that what we feare, may not come upon us; but yet that the <hi>abolition of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> is <hi>the fore-runner,</hi> and <hi>praeparatory to the great Apostacy,</hi> I have these reasons to shew, at least the probability. <hi>First,</hi> Because here is a concurse of <note place="margin">1.</note> times; for now after that these times have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>last</hi> times, for 1600 years together, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the <hi>Great revelation</hi> is very neer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing; &amp; what a <hi>Grand innovation</hi> of <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall government,</hi> contrary to the <hi>faith, &amp; practice of Christendome,</hi> may portend now in these times, when we all expect <hi>Antichrist</hi> to be revealed is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a jealous mans inquiry. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, <note place="margin">2.</note> if we consider the finall cause, was instituted as an <hi>obstructive to the diffusion of Schisme and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy.</hi> So <note place="margin">in 1. <hi>ad Titu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>But be this conjecture vaine, or not, the thing, of it selfe is of deep consideration, and the <hi>Catholick practise of Christendome for</hi> 1500 <hi>years</hi> is so insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable a prejudice against the enemies of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, that they must bring admirable evidence of Scripture, or a cleare <hi>revelation proved by Miracles,</hi> or a contrary <hi>undoubted tradition Apostolicall</hi> for themselves, or else hope for no beliefe against the prescribed possession of so many ages.</p>
                  <p>But before I begin, mee thinks in this contestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ubi potior est conditio possidentis,</hi> it is a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Question; what will the Adversaries stake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

it? For if <hi>Episcopacy</hi> cannot make its title good, they loose the benefit of their prescribed possession. If it can; I feare they will scarce gain so much, as the <hi>obedience</hi> of the adverse party by it, which yet already is their due. It is very unequall; but so it is ever, when <hi>Authority</hi> is the matter of the Question. Authority never gaines by it; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the cause goe on its side, yet it looses <hi>costs,</hi> and <hi>dammages;</hi> for it must either by faire condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to gain the adversaries, loose something of it selfe, or, if it asserts it selfe to the utmost, it is but where it was; but that seldome or never happens, for the very questioning of any authority, <hi>hoc ipso,</hi> makes a great intrenchment even to the very skirts of its cloathing.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>hûc deventumest.</hi> Now we are in, we must goe over.</p>
                  <p>FIrst then, that wee may build upon a Rock. <note place="margin">§. 1. Christ did institute a governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Church.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> did institute a <hi>government</hi> to order and rule his Church by his authority, according to his lawes, and by the assistance of the B. Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If this were not true, how shall the Church be governed? For I hope the adversaries of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, that are so punctuall to pitch all upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ground, will be sure to produce cleare Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for so maine a part of Christianity, as is the forme of the Government of Christs Church. And, if for our private actions; and duties <hi>Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> they will pretend a text, I suppose, it will not be thought possible, Scripture should make default
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41208:196"/>
in assignation of the <hi>publick Government,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all lawes intend the publick, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall directly; the private, and the particular, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence only, and comprehension within the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Christ himselfe did not take order for a government, then we must derive it from <hi>humane prudence,</hi> and emergency of conveniences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse of new circumstances, and then the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must often be <hi>changed,</hi> or else time must stand still, and things be ever in the same state and possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Both the consequents are extreamely full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. For if it be left to <hi>humane prudence,</hi> then either the government of the Church is not in immediate order to the good, and benison of soules, or if it be, that such an institution, in such immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate order to eternity, should be dependant upon <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence,</hi> it were to trust such a rich commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in a cock-boat, that no wise Pilot will be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to doe.

The name and dignity of these seaven was no lesse, but even the dignity of Presbyters, only for the time they were appointed to dispense the goods of the Church for the good of the faithfull people.

                     </gap>, Prophets and Teachers and Ministers. More then ordinary Ministers, for they were Doctors or Teachers, and that's not all, for they were Prophets too. This even at first sight is more then the ordinary office of the Presbytery. We shall see this cleare enough in S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> where the ordinary office of Prophets is reckoned before Pastors, before Evangelists, next to Apostles, that is next to such Apostles <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> there expresses it, next to those Apostles to whom Christ hath given immediate mission. And these are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Apostles too, Apostles <hi>secundi ordinis,</hi> none of the twelve, but such as S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe. To be sure they were such Prophets as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for they are reckoned in the number by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> for here it was that S. <hi>Paul</hi> although he had immediate vocation by Christ, yet he had particular ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this Apostolate or Ministery of the Gentiles. It is evident then what Prophets these were, they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41208:205"/>
they were at the least more then ordinary Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and therefore they impos'd hands, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And yet to make the businesse up compleat, S. <hi>Marke</hi> was amongst them, but he impos'd no hands, he was there as the Deacon and Minister <hi>[vers.</hi> 5.] but he medled not, S. <hi>Luke</hi> fixes the whole action upon the Prophets, such as S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe was, and so did the Holy Ghost too, but neither did S. <hi>Marke</hi> who was an Evangelist, and one of the 72 Disciples (as he is reckoned in the Primitive Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Dorotheus)</hi> nor any of the Colledge of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Presbyters, that were lesse then Prophets, that is, who were not more then meere Presbyters.</p>
                  <p>The summe is this: Imposition of hands is a duty &amp; office necessary for the perpetuating of a Church, <hi>ne Gens sit Vnius aetatis,</hi> least it expire in one age: this power of imposition of hands for Ordination was fix't upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> and Apostolike men, and not communicated to the 72 <hi>Disciples</hi> or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi> for the Apostles, and Apostolike men, did so <hi>de facto,</hi> and were commanded to doe so, and the 72 never did so, therefore this office and Ministery of the <hi>Apostolate</hi> is distinct, and superiour to that of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and this distinction must be so continued to all ages of the Church, for the thing was not temporary but productive of issue and succession, and therefore as perpetuall as the Clergy, as the Church it selfe.</p>

2. THe Apostles did impose hands for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">§ 8. And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</note> of Baptized people, and this was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall act of a power to be succeeded to, and yet not communicated, nor executed by the 72, or any other <hi>meere Presbyter.</hi> That the Apostles did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Baptized people, and others of the inferiour Clergie could not, is beyond all exception cleare in the case of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Christians. <hi>Acts.</hi> 8. For when S. <hi>Philip</hi> had converted, and Baptized the Men of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Apostles sent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to lay their hands on them that they might receive the Holy Ghost. S. <hi>Philip</hi> he was an Evangelist, he was one of the 72 Disciples, <note n="*" place="margin">S. Cyprian: ad Iubajan.</note> a Presbyter, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the same ministration that S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the poore Widdowes, yet he could not doe this, the Apostles must and did. This giving of the Holy Ghost by imposition of the Apostles hands, was not for a miraculous gift, but an ordinary Grace. For S. <hi>Philip</hi> could, and did doe miracles enough, but this Grace he could not give, the Grace of consigning or confirmation. The like case is in <hi>Acts.</hi> 19. where some people having been Baptized at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> confirmed them, giving them the Holy Ghost by imposition of hands. The Apostles did it; not the twelue only, but Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like men, the other Apostles. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did it. S. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> could not, nor any of the 72, or any other <hi>meere Presbyters</hi> ever did it, that we find in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Yea; but this imposition of hands, was for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41208:206"/>
issue, for the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Christians received the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied, which effect because it is ceased, certainly the thing was temporary and long agoe expired. 1. Not for this reason to be sure. For extraordinary effects may be temporary, when the function which they attest may be eternall, and therefore are no signes of an extraordinary Ministery. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles preaching was attended by Miracles, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary conversions of people  <q>
                        <hi>[ut in exordio, Apostolos divinorum signorum comitabantur effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus &amp; Spiritûs Sancti gratia, itdut videres unâ alloquutione integros simul populos ad cultum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae religionis adduci, &amp; praedicantium verb is non esse tardiorem audientium fidem,</hi>

                     <hi>Eusebius</hi> tels of the successe of the preaching of some Evangelists; yet I hope preaching must not now cease because no Miracles are done, or that to convert one man now would be the greatest Miracle. The Apostles when they curs'd and anathematiz'd a delinquent, he dyed suddainly, as in the case of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> flew with the word of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, and yet now although these extraordinary issues cease, it is not safe venturing upon the curses of the Church. When the Apostles did excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a sinner, he was presently delivered over to Sathan to be buffeted, that is, to be afflicted with corporall punishments, and now although no such exterminating Angels beat the bodyes of persons excommunicate, yet the power of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I hope still remaines in the Church, and the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41208:207"/>
power of the Keyes is not also gone: So also in the power of <hi>confirmation,</hi>

                  <p>Now then that this right of imposing hands for confirming of baptiz'd people, was not to expire with the persons of the Apostles, appeares from these considerations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because Christ made a promise of sending <hi>Vicarium suum Spiritum,</hi> the Holy Ghost in his stead; and this by way of appropriation is called <hi>the promise of the Father;</hi> This was pertinent to all Christendome. <hi>Effundam de spiritu meo super om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem carnem,</hi> so it was in the Prophecy.

Now then this promise being to be communicated <hi>to all,</hi> and that <hi>for ever,</hi> must either come to us by <hi rend="sup">1</hi> extraordinary and miraculous mission, or by <hi rend="sup">2</hi> an ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.

                     </gap> the first; for we might as well expect the gift of Miracles. If the second (as it is most
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41208:207"/>
certaine so) then the mayne Question is evicted, viz: that something perpetually necessary was in the power of the Apostles, which was not in the power of the inferiour Ministers, nor of any, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Colleagues, to wit, <hi>Ministerium S. Spiritûs,</hi> or the ordinary office of giving the holy Ghost by imposition of hands. For this promise was performed to the Apostles in <hi>Pentecost,</hi> to the rest of the faithfull after Baptisme, <hi>Quodn. nunc in confirmandis Neophyt is manûs impositio tribuit singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, hoc tunc spiritûs sancti descensio, in credentium populo donavit Vniversis,</hi> saith <hi>Eusebius Emissenus.</hi> Now we find no other way of performing it, nor <note place="margin">Serm. de Penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coste.</note> any ordinary conveyance of the Spirit to all people, but this; and we find that the H. Ghost actually was given this way. Therefore the effect, to wit, the H.

                  <p n="2">2 This Ministery of imposition of hands for confirmation of baptized people is so farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a temporary Grace, and to determine with the persons of the Apostles, that it is a fundamentall point of Christianity, an essentiall ingredient to it's co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position. S. <hi>Paul</hi> is my Author. [Therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 2.</note> the <hi>principles of the doctrine of Christ,</hi> let us goe on unto perfection, not laying againe the <hi>foundation</hi> of Repentance from dead works, faith to wards God, the doctrine of baptisme, <hi>and of laying on of hands.</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41208:208"/>
&amp;c. Here is imposition of hands reckoned as part of the foundation and a principle of Christianity in <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Catechisme. Now, imposition of hands is used by Name in Scripture but for two Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi rend="sup">1</hi> For ordination, &amp; <hi rend="sup">2</hi> for this whatsover it is. Imposition of hands for ordination does indeed give the Holy Ghost, but not as he is that promise which is called <hi>the promise of the Father.</hi> For the Holy Ghost for ordination was given before the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20. But the promise of the H. Ghost the comforter [the <hi>Paraclete,</hi> I say, not the <hi>Orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or fountaine of Priestly order,</hi> that] was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till the day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> and besides, it was promis'd to all Christian people, and the other was given onely to the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>* Adde to this, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> having laid this in the foundation makes his progresse from this to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (as he calls it) that is to higher mysteries, and then his discourse is immediately of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood Evangelicall, which is Originally in Christ, ministerially in the Clergy; so that unlesse we will either confound the termes of his progresse, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him to make the Ministery of the Clergy, the foundation of Christs Priesthood, and not rather contrary, it is cleare that by imposition of hands, S. <hi>Paul</hi> meanes not ordination, and therefore confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, there being no other ordinary Ministery of imposition of hands but these two specifyed in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture. For, as for benediction in which Christ used the ceremony, and as for healing in which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> and the Apostles us'd it; the first is clearely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41208:208"/>
no Principle or fundamentall point of Christianity; and the Second is confessedly extraordinary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the argument is still firme upon it's first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, the Primitive Church did <hi>de facto,</hi> and beleiv'd themselves to be tyed <hi>de jure</hi> to use this rite of Confirmation and giving of the Holy Ghost after Baptisme.</p>

only could doe it, I shall make evident in the descent of this discourse.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41208:210"/>
Scripture, that the Apostles had such superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency over the inferior Clergy (Presbyters I mean and Deacons) and a superiority of jurisdiction, and therefore it is certain that Christ gave it them, for none of the Apostles took this honour, but he that was called of God as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our blessed Saviour gave to the Apostles <hi>plenitudinem potestatis.</hi> It was <hi>sicut misit me Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi> As my Father sent, so I send. You, my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles whom I have chosen. This was not said to Presbyters, for they had no commission at all given to them by Christ, but at their first mission to preach repentance, I say no commission at all, they were not spoken to, they were not present. Now then consider. Suppose that as <hi>Aërius</hi> did deny the Divine institution of Bishops over the Presbyters <hi>cum grege,</hi> another as confident as he should deny the Divine institution of Presbyters, what proof were there in all the holy Scripture to shew the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution of them as a distinct order from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles or Bishops. Indeed Christ selected 72. and gave them commission to preach, but that commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was temporary and expired before the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion for ought appeares in Scripture. If it be said the Apostles did ordaine Presbyters in every City, it is true, but not sufficient, for so they ordained Deacons at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in all established Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet this will not tant' amount to an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Divine institution for Deacons, and how can it then for Presbyters? If we say a constant Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick traditive interpretation of Scripture, does
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41208:210"/>
teach us, that Christ did institute the <hi>Presbyterate</hi> together with <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and made the Apostles Presbyters as well as Bishops; this is true. But then 1. We recede from the plain words of Scripture, and rely upon tradition, which in this question of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy will be of dangerous consequence to the enimies of it, for the same tradition, if that be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for good probation, is for Episcopall prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence over Presbyters, as will appeare in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel. 2. Though no use be made of this advantage, yet to the allegation it will be quickly answered, that it can never bee proved from Scripture, that Christ made the Apostles Priests first, and then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops or Apostles, but only that Christ gave them severall commissions, and parts of the office Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall, all which being in one person, cannot by force of Scripture prove two orders. Truth is, if we change the scene of warre, and say that the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterate,</hi> as a distinct order from the ordinary office of Apostleship, is not of Divine institution, the proof of it would be harder then for the Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> Especially if we consider, that in all the enumerations of the parts of Clericall <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 1. Corinth. 12.</note> offices, there is no enumeration of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but of <hi>Apostles</hi> there is; and the other members of the induction are of guifts of Christianity, or parts of the Apostolate, and either must inferre many more orders, then the Church ever yet admitted of, or none, distinct from the Apostolate, insomuch as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were Pastors, and Teachers, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, and Rulers, and had the guift of tongues, of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41208:211"/>
healing, and of Miracles. This thing is of great consideration, and this use I will make of it: That either Christ made the 72 to be Presbyters, and in them instituted the distinct order of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as the ancient Church alwaies did believe, or else he gave no distinct commission for any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct order. If the second be admitted, then the Presbyterate is not of <hi>immediate divine</hi> institution, but of <hi>Apostolicall</hi> only, as is the Order of Deacons, and the whole plenitude of power is in the order A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall alone, and the Apostles did constitute Presbyters with a greater portion of their own power, as they did Deacons with a lesse. But if the first be said, then the commission to the 72 Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being only of preaching that we find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, all the rest of their power which now they have is by Apostolicall ordinance, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Apostles did admit them <hi>in partem solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudinis,</hi> yet they did not admit them <hi>in plenitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem potestatis,</hi> for then they must have made them Apostles, and then there will be no distinction of order neither by <hi>Divine</hi> nor <hi>Apostolicall</hi> institution neither.</p>
                  <p>I care not which part be chosen, one is certain; but if either of them be true, then since to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles only, Christ gave a <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that either the Presbyters have no power of jurisdiction, as affixed to a distinct order, and then the Apostles are to rule them by vertue of the order and ordinary commission Apostolicall; or if they have jurisdiction they doe derive it <hi>à fonte Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:41208:211"/>
and then the Apostles have superiority of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction over Presbyters, because Presbyters on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have it by delegation Apostolicall. And that I say truth (besides that there is no possibility of shewing the contrary in Scripture, by the producing any other commission given to Presbyters, then what I have specified,) I will hereafter shew it to have been the faith and practise of Christendome not only that Presbyters were <hi>actually subordinate</hi> to Bishops (which I contend to be the ordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Apostleship) but that Presbyters have no Iurisdiction <hi>essentiall</hi> to their order, but <hi>derivative</hi> only from Apostolicall preheminence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us now see the <hi>matter of fact.</hi> They that can inflict censures upon Presbyters have certainly superiority of Iurisdiction over Presbyters, for <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualis aequalem coercere non potest,</hi> saith the Law. Now it is evident in the case of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and a Bishop <hi>Would be,</hi> that for his perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory rejection of some faithfull people from the Catholick communion without cause, and without authority, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle threatned him in his Epistle to <hi>Gajus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; <hi>c. Wherefore when I come I will remember him,</hi> and all that would have been to very little purpose, if he had not had <hi>coercitive</hi> jurisdiction to have punish't his delinquency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Presbyters many of them did succeed the Apostles by a new ordination, as <hi>Matthias</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Iudas,</hi> who before his new ordination was one of the 72. as <note n="a" place="margin">

affirme, and in Scripture is expressed to be of the number of them that went in and out with Iesus; S. <hi>Clement</hi> succeeded S. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>Simeon Cleophae</hi> succeeded S. <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> S. <hi>Philip</hi> succeeded S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> &amp; diverse others of the 72, reckoned by <hi>Dorotheus, Eusebius,</hi> &amp; others of the Fathers, did governe the severall Churches after the Apostles death which before they did not. Now it is cleare that he that receives no more power after the Apostles, then he had under them, can no way be said to succeed them in their Charge, or Churches. It followes then, since (as will more fully appeare anon) Presbyters did succeed the Apostles, that under the Apostles they had not such jurisdiction as afterwards they had. But the Apostles had the same to which the Presbyters succeeded to, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greater then the Presbyters had before they did succeed. When I say Presbyters succeeded the Apostles, I meane, not as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but by a new ordination to the dignity of <hi>Bishops,</hi> so they succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and so they prove an evidence of fact, for a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Iurisdiction in the Apostolicall Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. *** Now that this superiority of Iurisdiction was not temporary, but to be succeeded in, appeares from Reason, and from ocular demonstration, or of the thing done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If superiority of Iurisdiction was necessary in the ages Apostolicall for the regiment of the Church, there is no imaginable reason why it should not be necessary in succession, since upon the emergency of Schismes and Heresies which were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41208:212"/>
foretold should multiply in descending ages, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and superiority of jurisdiction, unity of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and coërcion was more necessary then at first, when extraordinary gifts might supply, what now we expect to be performed by an ordinary authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatsoever was the regiment of the Church in the Apostles times that must be perpetuall (not so as to have <note n="*" place="margin">Ut puta, viduarum collegium, &amp; Diaconorum, &amp; coenobium fidelium. &amp;c:</note> 
                     <hi>all</hi> that which was personall, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, but so as to have <hi>no other)</hi> for that, and that only is of Divine institution which Christ commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Apostles, and if the Church be not now governed as then, We can shew no Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for our government, which we must contend to doe, and doe it too, or be call'd usurpers. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apostles did governe the Church as Christ commanded them, or not. If not, then they fayl'd in the founding of the Church, and the Church is not built upon a Rock. If they did (as most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did) then either the same disparity of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction must be retayn'd, or else we must be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an Unlawfull and unwarranted equality, because not by that which only is of immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution; and then it must needs be a fine government, where there is no authority, and where no man is superiour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see a disparity in the Regiment of Churches warranted by Christ himselfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Holy Ghost in fayrest intimation. I meane the seaven Angel-Presidents of the seaven <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Churches. If these seaven <hi>Angels</hi> were seaven
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41208:213"/>
                     <hi>Bishops,</hi> that is, Prelates or Governours of these seaven Churches, in which it is evident and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed of all sides, there were many Presbyters, then it is certaine that a Superiority of Iurisdiction was intended by Christ himselfe, and given by him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as he is the fountaine of all power derived to the Church; For Christ writes to these seaven Churches, and directs his Epistles to the seaven Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of these Churches calling them Angels, which it will hardly be suppos'd he would have done, if the function had not been a ray of the Sunne of righteousnesse, they had not else been Angels of light, nor starres held in Christ's owne right hand.</p>
                  <p>This is certaine, that the function of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (whatsoever it be) is a Divine institution. Let us then see what is meant by these starres and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>[The seaven starres are the Angells of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Then it is evident, that although the Epistles were sent with a finall intention for the edification and confirmation of the whole Churches or people of the Diocesse, with an <hi>[Attendite quid Spiritus dicit Ecclesijs</hi>] yet the personall direction was not to the whole Church, for the whole Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Candlestick,</hi> and the superscription of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles is not to the seaven <hi>Candlesticks,</hi> but to the seaven <hi>starres</hi> which are the Angels of the seaven Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> the lights shining in the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.

                  <p>The <hi>Summe</hi> of all is this; that Christ did insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Apostles and Presbyters or 72 Disciples. To the Apostles he gave a <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, for the whole commission was given to them in as great
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41208:215"/>
and comprehensive clauses as were imaginable, for by vertue of it, they received a power of giving the Holy Ghost in confirmation, and of giving his grace in the collation of holy Orders, a power of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and authority to governe the Church: and this power was not <hi>temporary,</hi> but <hi>successive</hi> and <hi>perpetuall,</hi> and was intended as an <hi>ordinary</hi> office in the Church, so that the <hi>successors</hi> of the Apostles had the same right and institution that the Apostles <hi>themselves</hi> had, and though the <hi>personall</hi> mission was not immediate, as of the Apostles it was, yet the commission and institution of the <hi>function</hi> was all one. But to the 72 Christ gave no commission but of <hi>preaching,</hi> which was a very limited commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. There was all the immediate Divine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Presbyterate as a distinct order, that can be fairely pretended. But yet farther, these 72 the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did admit <hi>in partem sollicitudinis,</hi> and by new ordination or delegation Apostolicall, did give them power of administring Sacraments, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving sinners, of governing the Church in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and subordination to the Apostles, of which they had a capacity by Christs calling them at first <hi>in sortem Ministerii,</hi> but the exercise, and the actuating of this capacity they had from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. So that not by <hi>Divine</hi> ordination, or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> commission from Christ, but by <hi>derivation</hi> from the <hi>Apostles</hi> (and therefore in minority and subordination to them) the Presbyters did exercise acts of order and jurisdiction in the absence of the Apostles or Bishops, or in conjunction consiliary,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41208:216"/>
and by way of advice, or before the consecration of a Bishop to a particular Church. And all this I doubt not, but was done by the direction of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, as were all other acts of Apostolicall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, and particularly the institution of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order, <hi>viz.</hi> of Deacons. This is all that can be proved out of Scripture concerning the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion given in the institution of Presbyters, and this I shall afterwards confirme by the practise of the Catholick Church, and so vindicate the practises of the <hi>present</hi> Church, from the common prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that disturbe us, for by this account, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is not only a <hi>Divine institution,</hi> but the <hi>only</hi> order that derives <hi>immediately</hi> from Christ.</p>
                  <p>For the present only, I summe up this with that saying of <hi>Theodoret</hi> speaking of the 72 Disciples. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In Lucae cap.</hi> 10.</note>

For though Christ also ordain'd the 72, yet they were inferior to the Apostles, and afterwards were their followers and Disciples.</p>
                  <p>I know no objection to hinder a conclusion; only two or three words out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> are pretended against the maine question, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that he, although a Bishop, yet had no Apostolicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <gap reason="foreign">

Not to his own Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> for there he might command as an Apostle, but to the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> he might not, they were no part of his Diocesse, he was not <hi>their</hi> Apostle, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did not equall the Apostles in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission extraordinary, in their personall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and in their universall jurisdiction, therefore he might not command the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> being another Bishops charge, but admonish them with the freedome of a Christian Bishop, to whom the soules of all faithfull people were deare and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. So that still Episcopacy and Apostolate may be all one in <hi>ordinary office,</hi> this hinders not, and I know nothing else pretended, and that Antiquity is clearely on this side, is the next businesse.</p>
                  <p>For, hitherto the discourse hath been of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divine institution</hi> of Episcopacy, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments derived from <hi>Scripture;</hi> I shall only adde two more from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and so passe on to <hi>tradition</hi>

to Presbyters, and not onely of <hi>Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> but indeed the <hi>onely</hi> order which can clearely show an <hi>immediate Divine</hi> commission for it's power and authority (as I have proved of the function Apostolicall) then those which doe suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apostles in the ordinary office of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, have the same institution and authority the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had, as much as the successors of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have with the first Presbyters, and perhaps more.</p>
                  <p>For in the Apostolicall ordinations, they did not proceed as the Church since hath done. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had the whole Priesthood, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Ecclesiasticall power and all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now they in their ordayning assistant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, did not in every ordination give a distinct order, as the Church hath done since the Apostles. For they ordayned some to distinct offices, some to particular places, some to one part, some to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of Clericall imployment, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> who was an Apostle yet was ordain'd by imposition of hands to goe to the Churches of the Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so was <hi>Barnabas:</hi> S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> to the Circumcision, and there was scarce any publike designe or Grand imployment but the Apostolike men had a new ordination to it, a new imposition of hands as is evident in the Acts of the Apostles. So that the Apostolicall ordinations of the inferiour Clergy were onely a giving of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commissions to particular men to officiate such parts of the Apostolicall calling as they would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41208:220"/>
please to imploy them in. Nay sometimes their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations were onely a delivering of Iurisdiction when the persons ordayned had the order before, as it is evident in the case of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> Of <note place="margin">Acts, 13.</note> the same consideration is the institution of <hi>Deacons</hi> to spirituall offices, and it is very pertinent to this Question. For there is no Divine institution for these rising higher then Apostolicall ordinance; and so much there is for Presbyters as they are now authoriz'd; for such power the Apostles gave to Presbyters as they have now, and sometimes more, as to <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and diverse others, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were more then meere Presbyters as the word is now us'd.</p>
                  <p>* The result is this. The office and order of a Presbyter is but part of the office and order of an Apostle, so is a Deacon, a lesser part, so is an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, so is a Prophet, so is a Doctor, so is a helper, or a Surrogate in Government, but these will not be called orders, every one of them will not I am sure, atleast not made distinct orders by Christ, for it was in the Apostles power to give any one or all these powers to any one man, or to distinguish them into so many men, as there are offices, or to unite more or fewer of them. All these I say, clearely make not distinct orders, and why are not all of them of the same consideration? I would be answered from Grounds of Scripture. For there we fix as yet.</p>
                  <p>* Indeed the Apostles did ordaine such men, and scattered their power at first, for there was so much imployment in any one of them, as to require
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41208:221"/>
one man for one office; but a while after they united all the lesser parts of power into two sorts of men whom the Church hath since distinguished by the Names of Presbyters and Deacons, and called them two distinct orders. But yet if we speak properly &amp; according to the Exigence of Divine institution, there is <hi>Vnum Sacerdotium,</hi> one Priesthood appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christ, and that was, the commission given by Christ to his Apostles, and to their Successors precisely, and those other offices of Presbyter and Deacon are but members of the Great Priesthood, and although the power of it, is all of Divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as the power to baptize, to preach, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate, to absolve, to Minister, yet that so much of it should be given to one sort of men, so much lesse to another, that is onely of Apostolicall ordinance. For the Apostles might have given to some onely a power to absolve, to some onely to consecrate, to some onely to baptize. We see that to Deacons they did so. They had onely a power to baptize and preach, whether all Evangelists had so much or no, Scripture does not tell us.</p>
                  <p>* But if to some men they had onely given a power to use the Keyes, or made them officers spirituall to restore such as are overtaken in a fault, and not to consecrate the Eucharist, (for we see these powers are distinct, and not relative and of necessary conjunction, no more then baptizing and consecrating) whether or no had those men who have only a power of absolving or consecrating res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively, whether (I say) have they the order of a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41208:221"/>
Presbyter? If yea, then now every Preist hath two orders besides the order of Deacon, for by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Consecration he hath the power of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and what is he then by his other power? But if such a man ordayn'd with but one of these powers have not the order of a Presbyter, then let any man shew me where it is ordayned by Christ, or indeed by the Apostles, that an order of Clerks should be constituted with both these powers, and that these were called Presbyters. I only leave this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
                  <p>* But all the Apostolicall power we find insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Christ, and we also find a necessity, that all that power should be succeeded in, and that all that power should be united in one order, for he that hath the highest, <hi>viz.</hi> a power of ordination, must needs have all the other, else he cannot give them to any else, but a power of ordination I have proved to be necessary and perpetuall.</p>
                  <p>So that, we have cleare evidence of the Divine institution of the perpetuall order of <hi>Apostleship,</hi> mary for the <hi>Presbyterate</hi> I have not so much either reason or confidence for it, as now it is in the Church; but for the Apostolate, it is beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And to this Bishops doe succeed. For that it is so, I have proved from Scirpture, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>[no Scripture is of private interpretation</hi>] I have attested it with the Catholike testimony of the Primitive Fathers, calling Episcopacy, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolate, and Bishops successors of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and of all the Apostles in general in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41208:222"/>
offices in which they were Superior to the 72, the Antecessors of the Presbyterate.</p>
                  <p>One objection, I must cleare. For sometimes Presbyters are also called Apostles, and Successors of the Apostles, as in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in S. <hi>Hierome.</hi> I answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are not called <hi>Successores Apostolorum</hi> by any <hi>dogmaticall</hi> resolution or interpretation of Scripture, as the Bishops are in the examples above alleaged; but by <hi>allusion,</hi> and participation at the most. For true it is that they succeed the Apostles in the offices of baptizing, consecrating, and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>in privato foro,</hi> but this is but part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall power, and no part of their office as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were superiour to Presbyters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is observeable that Presbyters are never affirmed to succeed in the power and regiment of the Church, but in subordination, and derivation from the Bishop, and therefore they are never said to succeed <hi>in Cathedris Apostolorum,</hi> in the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sees.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The places which I have specifyed, and they are all I could ever meete with, are of peculiar answer. For as for <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Trallis,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jdem ferè habet in Epist. ad</hi> Magnes: <hi>&amp;</hi> Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens.</note> he calls the Presbytery or company of Priests, the Colledge, or combination <hi>of Apostles.</hi> But here S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> as he lifts up the Presbyters to a comparison with Apostles, so he also raises the Bishop to the similitude and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with God. <hi>Episcopus typum Dei Patris om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium gerit, Presbyteri verò sunt conjunctus Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41208:222"/>
                     <hi>caetus.</hi> So that although Presbyters grow high yet they doe not overtake the Bishops, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who also in the same proportion grow higher then their first station. This then, will doe no hurt.</p>
                  <p>As for S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> he indeed does say that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters succeed the Apostles, but what Presbyters he means, he tells us, even such Presbyters as were also Bishops, such as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was, who call themselves Presbyters, his words are these. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptereà</hi>

But <hi>[doe the work of an Evangelist</hi>] (saith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> therefore it is cleare S. <hi>Timothy</hi> was no Bishop. No, was not? That's hard. But let us try however.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, those are the next words, <hi>fulfill thy Deaconship.</hi> And therefore he was no Bishop? As well this as the other, for if <hi>Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> doe not exclude <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> why shall his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Evangelist</hi> exclude it? Or why may not his being a <hi>Deacon</hi> exclude his being an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41208:232"/>
well as his being an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> exclude his being a <hi>Bishop?</hi> Whether is higher, a Bishoprick, or the office of an Evangelist? If a Bishops office be higher, and therefore cannot consist with an Evangelist, then a Bishop cannot be a Priest, and a Priest cannot be a Deacon, and an Evangelist can be neither, for that also is thought to be higher then them both. But if the office of an Evangelist be higher, then as long as they are not disparate, much lesse destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of each other, they may have leave to consist in subordination. For as for the pretence that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist is an office of a <hi>moveable imployment,</hi> and a Bishoprick of <hi>fixt residence,</hi> that will be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by and by.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the former discourse is upon suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, implyes the <hi>office of a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and so it may as well as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> other phrase implyes S. <hi>Timothy</hi> to be an <hi>Evangelist.</hi> For if we marke it well it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, doe <hi>the worke,</hi> not <hi>the office</hi> of an Evangelist. And what's that? We may see it in the verses immediatly going before, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And if this be the work of an Evangelist which S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Timothy</hi> performe, <hi>viz.</hi> to preach, to be instant in season, and out of season, to reprove, to rebuke, to exhort, there is no harme done, a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop may, nay he must doe all this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider we what an <hi>Evangelist</hi> is, and thence take our estimate for the present. 1. He that writes the story of the Gospell is an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> so
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41208:233"/>
the Greek Scholiast calls him. And in this sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. S. <hi>Timothy</hi> was not an Evangelist, but yet if he had, he might have been a Bishop, because <hi>S. Mark</hi> was an Evangelist to be sure, and perhaps as sure that he was a Bishop; sure enough; for they are both delivered to us by the Catholick testimony of the Primitive Church, as we shall see hereafter, so farre as concernes our Question. But then again; an Apostle might be an Evangelist, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was, and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was, and the Apostolicall dignity is as much inconsistent with the office of an Evangelist, as Episcopall preheminence, for I have proved these two names <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> to signify all one thing. 2. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> gives another exposition of <note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. The office of an Evangelist was but <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and take it in either of the two senses of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> or <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> which are the only true and

genuine, was to expire when Christianity was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every where, and the office of Episcopacy, if it was at all was to be succeeded in, and therefore in no respect could these be inconsistent, at least, not alwaies. * And how S. <hi>Paul</hi> should intend that <hi>Timothy</hi> should keep those rules he gave him, <hi>[to the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>] if the office for the execution of which he gave him the rules, <note place="margin">1.

But if he instructed <hi>him</hi> in the perpetuall office of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then it is easy to understand that S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave that caution to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to intimate that those his directions were <hi>not personall,</hi> but for his successors in that charge, to which he had ordained him, <hi>viz.</hi> in the sacred order and office of Episcopacy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lastly, After all this stirre, there are some of the Fathers, that will by no means admit S. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to have been an Evangelist. So S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> so <hi>Theophylact,</hi> so the Greek Scholiast, now though we have no need to make any use of it, yet if it be <note place="margin">In Ephes. 4.</note> true, it makes all this discourse needlesse, we were safe enough without it, if it be false, then it selfe we see is needlesse, for the allegation of S. <hi>Timothy's</hi> being an Evangelist, is absolutely impertinent, though it had been true.</p>

The reason why

S. <hi>Paul</hi> appointed him to ordaine these Bishops in Citties is in order to coercitive jurisdiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>[many unruly and vaine talkers were crept in, vers.</hi> 10.] and they were to be silenced <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Their mouths must be stopped.</hi> Therefore they must be such Elders as had superiority of jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over these impertinent Preachers, which to a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> Presbyter, either by Divine or Apostolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution no man will grant, and to a <hi>Colledge</hi> of Presbyters S. <hi>Paul</hi> does not intend it, for himselfe had given it singly to <hi>S. Titus.</hi> For I consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus</hi> alone had coercitive jurisdiction before he ordayn'd these Elders, be they Bishops, be they Presbyters. The Presbyters which were at <hi>Crete</hi> before his comming had not Episcopall power, or coercitive jurisdiction, for why then was <hi>Titus</hi> sent? As for the Presbyters which <hi>Titus</hi> ordayn'd, before his ordayning them, to be sure they had no power at all, they were not Presbyters. If they had a coercitiv jurisdiction afterwards, to wit, by their ordination, then <hi>Titus</hi> had it before in his owne person, (for they that were there before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had not, as I shewed) and therefore he must also have it still, for he could not loose it by ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others, or if he had it not before, how could he give it unto them whom he ordain'd? For <hi>plus juris in alium transferre nemo potest, quàm ipse habet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howsoever it be then, to be sure, <hi>Titus</hi> had it in his owne person and then it followes Undeniably, that either this coercitive jurisdiction was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Church (which would be either to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41208:236"/>
suppose men impcccable, or the Church to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all the inconveniences of Schisme and tumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary factions without possibility of releife) or if it was necessary, then because it was in <hi>Titus</hi> not as a personall prerogative, but a power to be succeded to; he might ordaine others, he had authority to doe it, with the same power he had himselfe, and therefore since he alone had this coërcion in his owne person, so should his Successors, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a single Presbyter, could not have it over his brethren by the confession of all sides, nor the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Presbyters which were there before his comming had it not, for why then was <hi>Titus</hi> sent with a new commission, nor those which he was to ordaine if they were but meere Presbyters could not have it, no more then the Presbytes that were there before his comming, it followes that those Elders which S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent <hi>Titus</hi> to ordaine being such as were to be constituted in opposition and power over the false Doctors and prating Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and with authority to silence them, (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the first chapter of that Epistle) these Elders (I say) are verily, and indeed such as himselfe call's Bishops in the proper sense, and acceptation of the word.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Cretan</hi> Presbyters who were there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Titus</hi> comming, had not power to ordaine others, that is, had not that power which <hi>Titus</hi> had. For <hi>Titus</hi> was sent thither for that purpose, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to supply the want of that power. And now, because to ordaine others was necessary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41208:236"/>
and succession of the Church, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause new generations are necessary for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, and meere Presbyters could not doe it, and yet this must be done, not onely by <hi>Titus</hi> himselfe, but after him, it followes undeniably that S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent <hi>Titus</hi> to ordaine men with the same power that himselfe had, that is with more then his first <hi>Cretan</hi> Presbyters, that is Bishops, and he meanes them in the proper sense.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That by <hi>Elders in severall Cityes</hi> he meanes Bishops is also plaine from the place where they were to be ordaind, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The issue of this discourse is, that since <hi>Titus</hi> was sent to <hi>Crete</hi> to ordaine Bishops, himselfe was a Bishop to be sure, at least. If he had ordain'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Presbyters, it would have prov'd that. But this inferres him to be a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> forasmuch as he was Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi> and yet had many suffragans in subordination to him, of his owne constitution, and yet of proper diocesses. However, if this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concludes nothing peculiar, it frees the place from popular prejudice and mistakes, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres his being a Bishop, if not a great deale more.</p>

Yea; but did not S. <hi>Titus</hi> ordaine no <hi>meere Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters?</hi> yes most certainely. But, so he did <hi>Deacons</hi> too, and yet neither one nor the other are otherwise mentioned in this Epistle but by consequence and comprehension within the superior order.

For since Presbyters could not ordaine other Presbyters, as appeares by S. <hi>Paul's</hi> sending <hi>Titus</hi> to doe it there, where, most certainely, many Presbyters before were actually resident, if Presbyters had gone to Villages they

                  <p>And now I know not what objection can fairely be made here; for I hope S. <hi>Titus</hi> was no <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,</hi> he is not called so in Scripture, and all Antiquity calls him a Bishop, and the nature of his offices, the eminence of his dignity, the superiority of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the cognisance of causes criminall, and the whole exigence of the Epistle proclaime him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. But suppose a while <hi>Titus</hi> had been an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, I would faine know who succeeded him? Or did all his office expire with his person? If so, then who shall reject Hereticks when <hi>Titus</hi> is dead? Who
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41208:238"/>
shall silence factious Preachers? If not, then still who succeeded him? The Presbyters: How can that be? For if they had more power after his death then before, and govern'd the Churches which before they did not, then to be sure their government in common, is not an Apostolicall Ordinance, much lesse is it a Divine right, for it is postnate to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. But if they had no more power after <hi>Titus</hi> then they had under him, how then could they succeed him? There was indeed a dereliction of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but no succession.

this succession of Bishops from the Apostles ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, must of it selfe be a very certain thing, when the Church made it a maine probation of their faith; for the books of Scripture were not all gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and generally received as yet.

For, for that in the new Testament we have no precept, and nothing but the example of the Primitive Disciples meeting in their <hi>Synaxes</hi> upon that day, and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they did on the saturday in the Iewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, but yet (however that at <hi>Geneva,</hi> they were once in meditation to have chang'd it into a Thursday meeting to have showne their Christian liberty) we should think strangely of those men that called the <hi>Sunday-Festivall</hi> lesse then an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ordinance, and necessary now to be kept holy with such observances as the Church hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>* Baptisme of infants is most certainly a holy and charitable ordinance, and of ordinary necessity to all that ever cryed, and yet the Church hath founded this rite upon the tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; and wise men doe easily observe that the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> can by the same probability of Scripture inforce a necessity of communicating infants upon us, as we doe of baptizing infants upon them, if we
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41208:242"/>
speak of immediate Divine institution, or of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise Apostolicall recorded in Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great Master of <hi>Geneva</hi> in a book he writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> was forced to fly to Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licail traditive ordination, and therefore the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bishops, must be served first, as having fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer plea, and clearer evidence in Scripture, then the baptizing of infants, and yet they that deny this, are by the just <hi>anathema</hi> of the Catholick Church, confidently condemn'd for Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>* Of the same consideration are diverse other things in Christianity, as the Presbyters consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eucharist; for if the Apostles in the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution did represent the whole Church, Clergy and Laity, when Christ said <hi>[Hoc facite, Doe this</hi>] then why may not every Christian man there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, doe that which the Apostles in the name of all were commanded to doe? If the Apostles did not represent the whole Church, why then doe all communicate? Or what place, or intimation of Christ's saying is there in all the foure Gospells, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting <hi>[Hoc facite, id est, benedicite</hi>] to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and extending <hi>[Hoc facite, id est, accipite &amp; manducate</hi>] to the Laity? This also rests upon the practise Apostolicall and traditive interpretation of H. Church, and yet cannot be denied that so it ought to be, by any man that would not have his Christendome suspected.</p>
                  <p>* To these I adde the communion of Women, the distinction of bookes Apocryphall, from Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, that such books were written by such Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41208:243"/>
and Apostles, the whole tradition of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe, the Apostles Creed, the feast of <hi>Easter</hi> (which amongst all them that cry up the <hi>Sunday-Festivall</hi> for a <hi>Divine institution,</hi> must needs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile as <hi>Caput institutionis,</hi> it being that for which the Sunday is commemorated.) These and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of greater consequence (which I dare not specify for feare of being misunderstood) rely but upon equall faith with this of Episcopacy (though I should wave all the arguments for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Divine ordinance) and therefore it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable it should be ranked amongst the <hi>Credenda</hi> of Christianity, which the Church hath entertained upon the confidence of that which we call <hi>the faith of a Christian,</hi> whose Master is truth it selfe.</p>

the Church <hi>in common.</hi> * For their <hi>identity,</hi> It is cleare that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> does not meane it in respect of order, as if a Bishop and a Presbyter had both one office <hi>per omnia,</hi> one power; for else he contradicts himselfe most apertly, for in his Epistle <hi>ad Evagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Quid facit</hi> (saith he) <hi>Episcopus exceptâ ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione quòd Presbyter non faciat? A Presbyter may not ordayne, a Bishop does,</hi> which is a cleare difference of power, and by S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is not expressed in matter of <hi>fact,</hi> but of <hi>right [quod Presbyter non</hi> FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIAT] not <hi>[non facit;</hi>] that a Priest <hi>may not, must not</hi> doe, that a Bishop does, <hi>viz.</hi> he gives holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. * And for matter of fact S. <hi>Hierome</hi> knew that in his time a Presbyter did not governe in common, but because he conceived it was fit he should be joyn'd in the common regiment and care of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, therefore he asserted it as much as he could; And therefore if S. <hi>Hierome</hi> had thought that this difference of the power of ordination, had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly customary, &amp; by actuall indulgence, or incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or positive constitution, and no matter of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and originall right, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> was not so diffident but out it should, come what would have come. And suppose S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> in this distinct power of ordination had intended it onely to be a difference in <hi>fact,</hi> not in <hi>right</hi> (for so some of late have muttered) then S. <hi>Hierome</hi> had not said true according to his owne principles, for <hi>[Quid facit Episcopus exceptâ ordinatione quòd Presbyter non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat?</hi>] had beene quickly answered, if the Question had onely beene <hi>de facto;</hi> For the Bishop governed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41208:245"/>
the Church alone, and so in Iurisdiction was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Presbyters, and this was by custome, and in fact at least, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saies it, and the Bishop tooke so much power to himselfe, that <hi>de facto</hi> Presbyters were not suffered to doe any thing <hi>sine literis Episco<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> palibus, without leave of the Bishop,</hi> and this S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> complain'd of; so that <hi>de facto</hi> the power of <note place="margin">

                     </note> ordination was not the onely difference: That then (if S. <hi>Hierome</hi> sayes true) being the onely difference betweene Presbyter and Bishop, must be meant <hi>de jure,</hi> in matter of right, not <hi>humane positive,</hi> for that is coincident with the other power of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which <hi>de facto,</hi> and at least by a humane right the Bishop had over Presbyters, but <hi>Divine,</hi> and then this identity of Bishop and Presbyter by <hi>S. Hierom's</hi> owne confession cannot be meant in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of order, but that Episcopacy is by Divine right a superiour order to the Presbyterate.</p>
                  <p>* Adde to this that the arguments which <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> uses in this discourse are to prove that <hi>Bishops</hi> are sometimes called <hi>Presbyters.</hi> To this purpose he urges <hi>Act.</hi> 20. And <hi>Philippians</hi> 1. and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and some others, but all driving to the same issue. To what? Not to prove that Presbyters are sometimes called Presbyters; For who doubts that? But that Bishops are so may be of some consideration and needes a proofe, and this he Undertooke. Now that they are so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led must needes inferre an <hi>identity</hi> and a <hi>disparity</hi> in severall respects. An <hi>identity,</hi> at least of <hi>Names,</hi> for else it had beene wholly impertinent. A <hi>disparity,</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41208:245"/>
or else his arguments were to prove <hi>idem affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri de eodem,</hi> which were a businesse next to telling pins. Now then this disparity must be either in <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> or <hi>jurisdiction.</hi> By the former probation it is sure that he meanes the <hi>orders</hi> to be <hi>disparate;</hi> If <hi>jurisdiction too,</hi> I am content, but the former is most certaine, if he stand to his owne principles.</p>
                  <p>This identity then which <hi>S. Hierome</hi> expresses of Episcopus and Presbyter, must be either in Name or in jurisdiction. I know not certainely which he meanes, for his <hi>arguments conclude onely for the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity of Names,</hi> but his <hi>conclusion is for identity of jurisdiction, &amp; in communi debere Ecclesiam regere,</hi> is the intent of his discourse. If he meanes the first, viz: that of <hi>Names,</hi> it is well enough, there is no harme done, it is <hi>in confesso apud omnes,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nothing (as I shall shew hereafter) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he intends (so farre as may be guess'd by his words) a parity and concurrence of jurisdiction, this must be consider'd distinctly.</p>

they also might together with the twelve, <hi>exire in totum mundum.</hi> * So that in this <hi>Presbytery</hi> either they were more then meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> men of <hi>Apostolicall power,</hi> and they might well be in conjunction with the twelve, and with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> they were of equall power, not by vertue of their <hi>Presbyterate,</hi> but by their <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi> or if they were but meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is certaine, and proov'd, and confess'd that the Apostles had power to governe the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, this their taking meere <hi>Presbyters in partem regiminis,</hi> was a voluntary act, and from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was derived to other Churches, and then it is most true, that <hi>Presbyteros in communi Ecclesiam regere,</hi> was rather, <hi>consuetudine Ecclesiae,</hi> then <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicae dispositionis veritate,</hi> (to use S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> owne expression) for this is more evident then that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> doe <hi>eminere caeteris,</hi> by <hi>custome</hi> rather then <hi>Divine institution.</hi> For if the Apostles might rule the Church alone, then that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were taken into the Number was a voluntary act of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and although fitting to be retain'd where the same reasons doe remaine, and circumstances concurre, yet not necessary because not affixed to their Order; not, <hi>Dominicae dispositionis veritate,</hi> and not laudable when those reasons cease, and there is an emergency of contrary causes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next <hi>Presbytery</hi> we read of is at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but there we find no <hi>acts</hi> either of <hi>concurrent,</hi> or <hi>single jurisdiction,</hi> but of <hi>ordination</hi> indeed we doe, <note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> and that performed by such men as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was, and

                     <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for they were two of the <hi>Prophets</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> but I doe not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them to be called <hi>Presbyters</hi> in that place, to be sure they were not meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> as we now Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the word; as I proved formerly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But in the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> there was a Colledge of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and they were by the Spirit <note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> of God called <hi>Bishops,</hi> and were appointed by him to be Pastors of the Church of God. This must doe it or nothing. <hi>In quo spiritus</hi> S. <hi>posuit vos Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos,</hi> In whom the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> hath made you <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> There must lay the exigence of the argument, and if we can find who is meant by [Vos] we shall, I hope, gaine the truth. * S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent for the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> to come from <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Miletus,</hi> and to them he spoke. * * It's true, but that's not all the <hi>[vos</hi>], For there were present at that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Sopater,</hi> and <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> and <hi>Secundus,</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Tychicus,</hi> and <hi>Trophimus;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 20. 4.</note> And although he sent to <hi>Ephesus</hi> as to the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, and there many Elders were either accidentally, or by ordinary residence, yet those were not all Elders of that Church, but of all <hi>Asia,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sense, the lessar <hi>Asia.</hi> For so in the preface of his Sermon S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates <hi>[ye know that from the first day I came into Asia after what manner I have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:41208:248"/>

                  <p>Now upon this ground I will raise these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If there be a confusion of Names in Scripture, particularly of <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, on one side, and granted on all sides, then where both the words are used, what shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the signification? For whether (to instance in this place) shall <hi>Presbyter</hi> limit <hi>Episcopus,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus</hi> extend <hi>Presbyter?</hi> Why may not <hi>Presbyter</hi> signify one that is verily a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as <hi>Episcopus</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify a meere <hi>Presbyter?</hi> For it is but an ignorant conceit, where ever <hi>Presbyter</hi> is named, to fancy it in the proper and limited sense, and not to doe so with <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and when they are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather to believe it in the limited and present sense of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> then in the proper and present sense of <hi>Episcopus.</hi> So that as yet we are indifferent upon the termes. These men sent for from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the Church, but at <hi>Miletus, Spiritus S. posu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it vos Episcopos,</hi> there they are called <hi>Bishops</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers. So that I may as well say here were <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called Bishops,</hi> as another may say, here were <hi>meere Presbyters.</hi> * And least it be objected in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of my affirmative, that they could not be <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> because they were of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> there never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41208:248"/>
but one <hi>Bishop in one Church.</hi> I answer, that in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times this was not true. For at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> there were many at the same time that had <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall,</hi> and <hi>Apostolicall authority,</hi> and so at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och;</hi> as at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the same time <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> but yet but one of them was <hi>fixt,</hi> and <hi>properly the Bishop of that place.</hi> But 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> All these were not of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but the <hi>Elders</hi> of all <hi>Asia,</hi> but some from other countries as appears <hi>vers.</hi> 4. So that although they were all <hi>Bishops,</hi> wee might easily find <hi>distinct Diocesses</hi> for them, without incumbring the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed incumbency. Thus farre then we are upon even termes, the community of compellations used here, can no more force us to believe them all to be meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> then <hi>Bishops</hi> in the proper sense.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is very certain that they were not all meer <hi>Presbyters</hi> at his fare-well Sermon, for S. <hi>Timothy</hi> was there, and I proved him to be a <hi>Bishop</hi> by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant testimony, and many of those which are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>v.</hi> 4. were companions of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in his journey, and imployed in mission <hi>Apostolicall</hi> for the founding of Churches, and particularly, <hi>Sosipater</hi> was there, and he was <hi>Bishop of Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon in Bythinia,</hi> as <hi>Dorotheus</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> witnesse; and <hi>Trophimus</hi> of <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> for so is witnessed by the suffragans of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in their Epistle to S. <hi>Leo.</hi> But without all doubt here were <hi>Bishops</hi> present as well as <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41208:249"/>
for besides the premises we have a witnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond exception, the ancient S. <hi>Irenaeus, In Mileto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim convocatis Episcopis, &amp; Presbyteris qui erant eb</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Epheso, &amp; à reliquis proximis civitatibus, quoniam ipse festinavit Hierosolymis Pentecosten agere, &amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> making hast to keep his Pentecost at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> at <hi>Miletus,</hi> did call together the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the neighbouring Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. * Now to all these in conjunction S. <hi>Paul</hi> spoke, and to these indeed the Holy Ghost had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited his Church to be fed, and taught with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall supravision, but in the mean while here is no commission of power, or jurisdiction to Presbyters distinctly, nor supposition of any such praeexistent power,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All that S. <hi>Paul</hi> said in this narration, was spoken in the presence of them all, but not to them all. For that of <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>[ye know how I have been with you in Asia in all seasons,</hi>] that indeed was spoke to all the Presbyters that came from <hi>Ephesus</hi> and the voisinage, <hi>viz.</hi> in a collective sense, not in a distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive, for each of them was not in all the circuit of his <hi>Asian</hi> travailes; but this was not spoken to <hi>Sopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the <hi>Beraean,</hi> or to <hi>Aristarchus</hi> the <hi>Thessalonian,</hi> but to <hi>Tychicus,</hi> and <hi>Trophimus,</hi> who were <hi>Asians</hi> it might be addressed. And for that of <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>[yee all among whom I have gone preaching shall see my face no more,</hi>] this was directed only to the <hi>Asians,</hi> for he was never more to come thither; but <hi>Timothy</hi> to be sure, saw him afterwards, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent for him, a litle before his death, to <hi>Rome,</hi> and it will not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41208:249"/>
be supposed he neglected to attend him. So that if there were a conjunction of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> at this meeting, as most certainly there was, and of <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and <hi>Apostolicall men</hi> besides, how shall it be known, or indeed with any probability suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that, that clause of <hi>vers.</hi> 28. <hi>Spiritus S. posuit vos Episcopos pascere Ecclesiam Dei,</hi> does belong to the <hi>Ephesine Presbyters,</hi> and not particularly to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> who was now actually <hi>Bishop of Ephesus,</hi> and to <hi>Gajus,</hi> and to the other <hi>Apostolicall men</hi> who had at least <hi>Episcopall authority,</hi> that is, power of founding, and ordering Churches without a fixt and limited jurisdiction?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Either in this place is no jurisdiction at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated <hi>de antiquo,</hi> or concredited <hi>de novo,</hi> or if there be, it is in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Feeders;</hi> and then it belongs either to the <hi>Bishops</hi> alone, or to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with, and subordination to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> for to the meer <hi>Presbyters</hi> it cannot be proved to appertaine, by any intination of that place.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How and if these <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which came from <hi>Ephesus</hi> and the other parts of <hi>Asia</hi> were made <hi>Bishops</hi> at <hi>Miletus?</hi> Then also this way all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be removed. And that so it was is more then probable; for to be sure, <hi>Timothy</hi> was now entring, and fixing upon his See; and it was consonant to the practise of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the exigence of the thing it selfe, when they were to leave a Church to fixe a <hi>Bishop</hi> in it; for why else was a <hi>Bishop</hi> fixt in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> so long before in other Churches, but because
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41208:250"/>
the <hi>Apostles</hi> were to be scattered from thence, and there the first bloudy field of <hi>Martyrdome</hi> was to be fought. And the case was equall here, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> was never to see the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> any more, and he foresaw that ravening wolves would enter into the folds, and he had actually plac'd a <hi>Bishop</hi> in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and it is unimaginable, that he would not make equall provision for other Churches, there being the same necessity from the same danger, in them all, and either S. <hi>Paul</hi> did it now, or never; and that about this time the other sixe <hi>Asian</hi> Churches had <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> set in their candlesticks, is plain, for there had been a succession in the Church of <hi>Pergamus, Antipas</hi> was dead, and S. <hi>Timothy</hi> had sate in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and S. <hi>Polycarpe</hi> at <hi>Smyrna</hi> many years before S. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ his Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Lastly, that no jurisdiction was in the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine Presbyters,</hi> except a delegate, and subordinate, appeares beyond all exception, by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> establishing in the person of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> power of coercitive jurisdiction over <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and ordination in him alone, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of any in commission with him, for ought appeares either there, or else-where.</p>
                  <p>* 4. The same also in the case of the <hi>Cretan Presbyters</hi> is cleare. For what power had they of Iurisdiction? For that is it, we now speak of. If they had none before S. <hi>Titus</hi> came, we are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at <hi>Crete.</hi> If they had, why did S. <hi>Paul</hi> take it from them to invest <hi>Titus</hi> with it? Or if he did not, to what purpose did he send <hi>Titus</hi> with all those
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41208:250"/>
powers before mentioned? For either the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Crete</hi> had jurisdiction in causes criminall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to <hi>Titus</hi> after his coming, or they had not. If they had, then what did <hi>Titus</hi> doe there? If they had not, then either they had no jurisdiction at all, or whatsoever it was, it was in subordination to him, they were his inferiours, and he their ordinary Iudge and Governour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. One thing more before this be left, must be considered concerning the Church of Corinth, for there was power of excommunication in the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> when they had no Bishop, for they had none of diverse yeares after the founding of the Church, and yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> reprooves them for not ejecting the incestuous person out of the Church.</p>
                  <p>* This is it that I said before, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles kept the jurisdiction in their hands where they had founded a Church, and placed no Bishop. For in this case of the Corinthian incest the <hi>Apostle</hi> did make himselfe the sole Iudge. <hi>[For I verily as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>absent in body but present in spirit have judged alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>] and then secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the Church <note place="margin">V. 4.</note> of <hi>Corinth</hi> commission and substitution to proceed in this cause <hi>[In the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and</hi> MY SPIRIT, that is, <hi>My power, My authority,</hi> for so he explaines himselfe, MY SPIRIT, WITH THE POWER OF OUR LORD IESVS CHRIST, <hi>to deliver him over to Satan.</hi> And 3. As all this power is delegate, so it is but declarative in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi> had given sentence before, and they of Corinth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41208:251"/>
were to publish it. 4. This was a commission gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the whole assembly, and no more concernes the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> then the people, and so some have contended; but so it is, but will serve neither of their turnes, neither for an <hi>independant Presbytery,</hi> nor a <hi>conjunctive popularity.</hi> As for S. <hi>Paul's</hi> reprooving them for not inflicting censures on the peccant, I have often heard it confidently averred, but never could see ground for it. The suspicion of it is <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>[And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be</hi> TAKEN AWAY FROM AMONG YOU] <hi>Taken away.</hi> But by whom? That's the Question. Not by them, to be sure. For TAKEN AWAY FROM You, implies that it is by the power of another, not by their act, for no man can take away any thing from himselfe. He may <hi>put it away,</hi> not <hi>take it,</hi> the expression had been very imperfect if this had been his meaning. * Well then: In all these instances, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Antioch, Ephesus, Crete,</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> (and these are all I can find in Scripture of any consideration in the present Question) all the jurisdiction was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the <hi>Apostles</hi> while there was no <hi>Bishop,</hi> or in the <hi>Bishop</hi> when there was any; And yet that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were joyned in the ordering Church affaires I will not deny, to wit, by voluntary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming them, <hi>in partem sollicitudinis,</hi> and by dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of power <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> or <hi>Episcopall,</hi> and by way of assistance in acts deliberative, and consilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though I find this no where specified but in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where I prooved that the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41208:251"/>
were men of more power then meere <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> men of <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority. But here lies the issue, and straine of the Question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Presbyters</hi> had no jurisdiction in causes crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and pertaining to the publick regiment of the Church, by vertue of their order, or without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular substitution, and delegation. For there is not in all Scripture any commission given by <hi>Christ</hi> to meere Presbyters, no divine institution of any power of regiment in the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> no constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> that meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> should either alone, or in conjunction with the <hi>Bishop</hi> governe the Church; no example in all Scripture of any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure inflicted by any meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> either upon Clergy or Laity; no specification of any power that they had so to doe; but to Churches where Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of <hi>Presbyters</hi> were resident, Bishops were sent by <hi>Apostolicall ordination;</hi> not only with power of imposition of hands, but of excommunication, of taking cognisance even of causes, and actions of <hi>Presbyters</hi> themselves, as to <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> the Angell of the Church of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and there is also example of delegation of power of censures from the <hi>Apostle</hi> to a Church where many <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> were fix't, as in the case of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent before specified, which delegation was needlesse, if coercitive jurisdiction by censures had been by divine right in a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or a whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them.</p>
                  <p>Now then, returne we to the consideration of S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> saying: The Church was governed (saith
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41208:252"/>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Quo jure</hi> was this? That the <hi>Bishops</hi> were Superiour to those which were then called <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> by <hi>custome</hi> rather then <hi>Divine disposition</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> affirmes; but that <hi>Presbyters</hi> were joyned with the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> at first, by what right was that? Was not that also by <hi>custome</hi> and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion rather then by <hi>Divine</hi> disposition? S. <hi>Hierome</hi> does not say but it was. For he speakes onely of matter of fact, not of right, It might have beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, though <hi>de facto</hi> it was so in some places.</p>
                  <p n="2">* 2. <hi>[Communi Presbyterorum consilio</hi>] is true in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where the Elders were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall</hi> men, and had <hi>Episcopall authority</hi> and something superadded, as <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> for they had the authority and power of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> and an unlimited <hi>Diocesse</hi> besides, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Silas</hi> was fixt upon the See of <hi>Corinth.</hi> But yet even at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they actually had a <hi>Bishop,</hi> who was in that place superiour to them in Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore does clearely evince, that the common-counsell of <hi>Presbyters</hi> is no argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the superiority of a <hi>Bishop</hi> over them.</p>
                  <p>* 3. <hi>[Communi Presbyterorum consilio</hi>] is also true, because the Apostles call'd themselves <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in their Epistles. Now at the first, many <hi>Prophets,</hi> many <hi>Elders</hi> (for the words are sometimes us'd in common) were for a while resident in particular Churches, and did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne in common; As at <hi>Antioch</hi> were <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:41208:252"/>
and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Manaen,</hi> and <hi>Paul. Communi horum Presbyterorum consilio</hi> the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> for a time was governed; for all these were <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the sense that S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> were, and the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>

                  <p>* 4. Suppose this had beene true in the sense that any body please to imagine, yet this not being by any divine ordinance, that Presbyters should by their Counsell assist in externall regiment of the Church, neither by any intimation of Scripture, nor by affirmation of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> it is sufficient to stifle this by that saying of S. <hi>Ambrose, Postquàm omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>

                     </gap>, all, and yet all of them were not <hi>Bishops</hi> in the present sense, that is of a fixt and particular Diocesse, and Iurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>* 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> meaning is also true in this sense, <hi>[Bishops by the truth of the Lords disposition are not greater then Presbyters,</hi>] viz. <hi>quoad exercitium actûs,</hi> that is, they are not tyed to exercise jurisdiction solely in their owne persons, but may <hi>asciscere sibi Presbyteros in commune consilium,</hi> they may dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate jurisdiction to the Presbyters; and that they did not so, but kept the exercise of it only in their owne hands in S. <hi>Hieromes time,</hi> this is it, which he saith is rather by custome, then by Divine dispensation, for it was otherwise at first, viz. <hi>de facto,</hi> and might be so still, there being no law of God against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of power Episcopall. * As for the last words in the objection, <hi>[Et in communi debere Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam regere,</hi>] it is an <hi>assumentum of</hi> S. <hi>Hieromes owne;</hi> for all his former discourse was of the identity
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41208:253"/>
of Names, and common regiment <hi>de facto,</hi> not <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> and from <hi>a fact</hi> to conclude with a <hi>Debere,</hi> is a <hi>Non sequitur,</hi> unlesse this <hi>Debere</hi> be understood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exigence of the former arguments, that is, THEY OUGHT, not by <hi>Gods law,</hi> but in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the practise <hi>Apostolicall;</hi> to wit, when things are as they were then, when the Presbyters are such as then they were; THEY OUGHT, for many conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and in Great cases, not by the necessity of a Divine precept.</p>
                  <p>* And indeed to doe him right he so explaines himselfe, <hi>[Et in communi debere Ecclesiam regere, imitantes Moysen qui cùm haberet in potestate solus praeesse populo Israel, septuaginta elegit, cum quibus populum judicaret.</hi>] The Presbyters ought to Iudge in common with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> for the <hi>Bishops</hi> ought to imitate <hi>Moses,</hi> who might have rul'd alone, yet was content to take others to him, and himselfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rule in chiefe. Thus S. <hi>Hierome</hi> would have the <hi>Bishops</hi> doe, but then he acknowledges the right of sole jurisdiction to be in them, and therefore though his Councell perhaps might be good then, yet it is necessary at no time, and was not followed then, and to be sure is needlesse now. * For the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> uses to prove this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention what ever it is, I have and shall else where produce, for they yeeld many other considerations then this collection of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse then the equality of the offices of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Presbyterate.</hi> The same thing is <hi>per omnia</hi> respondent to the paralell place of <note n="a" place="margin">

It is needlesse to repeat either the objection, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                  <p>* But however this saying of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and the paralell of S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> is but like an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Evident truth, which comes forth upon a desperate service, and they are sure to be kill'd by the adverse party, or to runne upon their owne Swords; For either they are to be understood in the senses above explicated, and then they are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or else they contradict evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Catholike antiquity, and so are false, and dye within their owne trenches.</p>

Is it imaginable, that those gallant men who could not be brought off from the prescriptions of Gentilisme to the seeming impossibilities of Christianity, without evidence of Miracle, and clarity of Demonstration upon agreed principles, should all upon their first adhesion to Christianity, make an Universall dereliction of so considerable a part of their Masters will, and leave Gentilisme to destroy Christianity, for he that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects another Oeconomy then what the Master of the family hath ordayn'd, destroyes all those rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mutuall dependance which Christ hath made for the coadunation of all the parts of it, and so destroyes it in the formality of a Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or family?</p>

                  <p>* 3. Although <hi>Bishops</hi> be called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> yet even in Scripture names are so distinguished, that meer <hi>Presbyters</hi> are never called <hi>Bishops,</hi> unlesse it be in conjunction with <hi>Bishops,</hi> and then in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall addresse, which, in all faire deportments, is made to the more eminent, sometimes <hi>Presbyters</hi> are, or may be comprehended. This observation if it prove true, will clearely show, that the confusion of names of <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> such as it is in Scripture, is of no pretence by any intimation of Scripture, for the indistinction of offices, for even the names in Scripture it selfe are so distinguished, that a meere <hi>Presbyter</hi> alone is never called a <hi>Bishop,</hi> but a <hi>Bishop</hi> an <hi>Apostle</hi> is often called a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as in the instances above. But we will consider those places of Scripture, which use to be pretended in those impertinent arguings from the identity of Name, to confusion of things, and shew that they neither enterfere upon the maine Question, nor this observation. * <hi>Paul and Timotheus to all the saints which are in Christ Iesus which are at Philippi, with</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:41208:257"/>
                     <hi>the Bishops and Deacons.</hi> I am willinger to choose this instance, because the place is of much considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the whole Question, and I shall take this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to cleare it from prejudice and disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>* By <hi>Bishops</hi> are here meant <hi>Presbyters,</hi> because * many <hi>Bishops</hi> in a Church could not be, and yet * S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks plurally of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the * Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and therefore must meane * meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> * so it is pretended.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then; By <hi>[Bishops</hi>] are, or may be meant the whole superior order of the clergy, <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> and that he speaks plurally, he, may besides the <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Church, comprehend under their name the <hi>Presbyters</hi> too; for why may not the name becomprehended as well as the office, and order, the inferiour under the superiour, the lesser within the greater; for since the order of <hi>Presbyters</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the <hi>Bishops</hi> order, and is not only inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively in it, but derivative from it; the same name may comprehend both persons, because it does comprehend the distinct offices and orders of them both. And in this sense it is (if it be at all) that <hi>Presbyters</hi> are sometimes in Scripture called <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* 2. Why may not <hi>[Bishops</hi>] be understood properly; For there is no necessity of admiitting that there were any meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> at all at the first founding of this Church, It can neither be proved from Scripture, nor antiquity, if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: For indeed a <hi>Bishop</hi> or a company of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:41208:258"/>
                     <hi>men</hi> as there were at <hi>Antioch,</hi> might doe all that <hi>Presbyters</hi> could, and much more. And conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that there are some necessities of a Church which a <hi>Presbyter</hi> cannot supply, and a <hi>Bishop</hi> can, it is more imaginable that there was no <hi>Presbyter,</hi> then that there was no <hi>Bishop.</hi> And certainely it is most unlikely, that what is not expressed, to wit, Presbyters should be onely meant, and that which is expressed should not be at all intended.</p>
                  <p>* 3. <hi>[With the Bishops</hi>] may be understood in the proper sense, and yet no more <hi>Bishops</hi> in one <hi>Diocesse</hi> then one, of a fixt residence; for in that sense is S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and the fathers to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <note place="margin">

Nay in <hi>Philippi</hi> it selfe, If I mistake not, as instance may be given, full, and home to this purpose. <hi>Salutant te Episcopi One simus, Bitus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Polybius, &amp; omnes qui sunt Philippis in Christo, unde &amp; haec vobis Scripsi,</hi> saith <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Hero</hi> his Deacon. So that many <hi>Bishops</hi> (we see) might be at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and many were actually there long after S. <hi>Paul's</hi> dictate of the Epistle.</p>
                  <p>* 4. Why may not <hi>[Bishops</hi>] be meant in the proper sense? Because there could not be more <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> then one, in a <hi>Diocesse.</hi> No? By what law? If
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41208:258"/>
by a constitution of the Church after the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, that hinders not, but it might be otherwise in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. If by a Law in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, then we have obtained the main question by the shift, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> did ordain that there should be one, and but one <hi>Bishop</hi> in a Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is evident they appointed many <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And then let this objection be admitted how it will, and doe its worst, we are safe enough.</p>
                  <p>* 5. <hi>[With the Bishops</hi>] may be taken distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, for <hi>Philippi</hi> was a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse <hi>Bishopricks</hi> under it, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> wrote also to all the daughter Churches within its circuit, and therefore might well salute many <hi>Bishops,</hi> though writing to one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,</hi> and this is the more probable, if the reading of this place be accepted according to <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> for he reads it not <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>* Thus also it was in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to their <hi>Bishop,</hi> and giving order for the constitution and deportment of the Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>interim?</hi> Either they must be comprehended in <hi>Bishops</hi> or in <hi>Deacons.</hi> They may as well be in one as the other; for <hi>[Diaconus</hi>] is not in Scripture any more appropriated to the inferiour Clergy, then <hi>Episcopus</hi> to the Superiour, nor so much neither. For <hi>Episcopus</hi> was never us'd in the <hi>new Testament</hi> for any, but such, as had the care, regiment, and supra-vision of a Church, but <hi>Diaconus</hi> was used generally for all Ministeries.</p>
                  <p>But yet supposing that <hi>Presbyters</hi> were included under the word <hi>Episcopus,</hi> yet it is not because the offices and orders are one, but because that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> is comprehended within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of a <hi>Bishop.</hi> And then indeed the compellation is of the more principall, and the <hi>Presbyter</hi> is also comprehended, for his conjunction, and involution in the Superiour, which was the principall observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here intended. <hi>Nam in Episcopo omnes ordines sunt, quia primus Sacerdos est, hoc est, Princeps est Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotum, &amp; Propheta &amp; Evangelista, &amp; caetera ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>implenda officia Ecclesiae in Ministerio Fidelium.</hi> saith S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> * So that if in the description of <note place="margin">in Ephis. 4. * <hi>Idem ait</hi> S. <hi>Dionysius Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. hierarch. cap.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>orders,</hi> which very one thing makes <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to be a distinct <hi>order.</hi> For, <hi>Ordo,</hi> is defin'd by the Schooles to be, <hi>traditio potestatis spiritualis, &amp; collatio gratiae, ad obeunda Ministeria Ecclesiastica; a giving a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power, and a conferring grace for the performance of Ecclesiasticall Ministrations.</hi> Since then <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> hath a new <hi>ordination,</hi> and a distinct <hi>power</hi> (as I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41208:276"/>
shall shew in the descent) it must needs be a distinct <hi>order,</hi> both according to the Name given it by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and according to the nature of the thing in the definitions of the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing said against this but a fancy of some of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> obtruded indeed upon no grounds; for they would define order to be <hi>a speciall power in relation to the Holy Sacrament,</hi> which they call <hi>corpus Christi naturale;</hi> and <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> indeed to be a distinct power in relation <hi>ad cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Christi Mysticum,</hi> or the regiment of the Church, and ordayning labourers for the harvest, and therefore not to be a distinct order.</p>
                  <p>But this to them that consider things sadly, is true or false according as any man list. For if these men are resolved they will call nothing an <hi>order</hi> but what is a <hi>power</hi> in order to consecration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, who can help it? Then indeed, in that sense, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is not a distinct order, that is, a <hi>Bishop</hi> hath no new power in the consecration of the Venerable Eucharist, more then a <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath. But then why these men should only call this power <hi>[an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>] no man can give a reason. For, 1. in Antiquity the distinct power of a Bishop was ever called an Order, and I think, before <hi>Hugo de</hi> S. <hi>Victore,</hi> and the <hi>Master of the Sentences,</hi> no man ever deni'd it to be an <hi>order.</hi> 2. According to this rate, I would faine know how the office of a <hi>Sub-deacon,</hi> and of an <hi>Ostiary,</hi> and of an <hi>Acolouthite,</hi> and of a <hi>Reader,</hi> come to be distinct <hi>Orders;</hi> for surely the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath as much power in order to consecration <hi>de Novo,</hi> as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41208:277"/>
they have <hi>de integro.</hi> And if I mistake not; that the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath a new power to ordaine <hi>Presbyters</hi> who shall have a power of consecrating the Eucharist, is more a new power in order to consecration, then all those inferiour officers put together have in all, and yet they call them Orders, and therefore why not <hi>Episcopacy</hi> also, I cannot imagine, unlesse because they will not.</p>
                  <p>*** But however in the meane time, the denying the office and degree of Episcopacy to be a new and a distinct order is an Innovation of the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of some in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without all reason, and against all antiquity. This onely by the way.</p>
                  <p>The Enemies of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> call in aide from all places for support of their ruinous cause, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take their maine hopes from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by advantage of the former discourse. For since (say they) that consecration of the Sacrament is the Greatest worke, of the most secret mystery, <note place="margin">S. <hi>Hieron: ad Rusticum Narbonens: apud Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. dist:</hi> 95. <hi>can: ecce ego. casus, ibid.</hi>
                     </note> greatest power, and highest dignity that is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to man, and this a <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath as well as a <hi>Bishop,</hi> is it likely that a <hi>Bishop</hi> should by <hi>Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> be so much Superiour to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who by the confession of all sides communicates with a <hi>Bishop</hi> in that which is his highest power? And shall issues of a lesser dignity distinguish the <hi>Orders,</hi> and make a <hi>Bishop</hi> higher to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Greater raise up a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poise of a <hi>Bishop?</hi> Upon this surmise the <hi>men of the Church of Rome,</hi> would inferre an identity of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:41208:277"/>
though a disparity of <hi>degree,</hi> but the <hi>Men of the other world</hi> would inferre a parity both of order and degree too. The first are already answered in the premises. The second must now be serv'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, whether power be greater, of <hi>Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Priests, or <hi>Consecrating</hi> the Sacrament is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Question; possibly, it may be of some danger; because in comparing Gods ordinances, there must certainely be a depression of one, and whether that lights upon the right side or no, yet peradventure it will not stand with the consequence of our gratitude to God, to doe that, which in Gods estimate, may tant' amount to a direct Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing; but however it is vnprofitable, of no use in case of conscience either in order to faith, or manners, and besides, cannot fixe it selfe upon any basis, therebeing no way of proving either to be more excellent then the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Sacraments, and mysteries of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity if compared among themselves, are greater, and lesser in severall respects. For since they are all in order to severall ends, that is, productive of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effects, and they all are excellent, every rite, and sacrament in respect of its own effect, is more excellent then the other not ordain'd to that effect. For example. Matrimony is ordain'd for a means to preserve chastity, and to represent the mysticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ and his Church, and therefore in these respects is greater then baptisme, which does nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But <note n="*" place="margin">The Nicene Creed.</note> baptisme is for remission of sinnes and in that is more excellent then Matrimony; the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41208:278"/>
same may be said for ordination, and consecration, the one being in order to Christs naturall body (as the Schooles speak) the other in order to his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body, and so have their severall excellencies respectively; but for an absolute preheminence of one above the other, I said there was no <hi>basis</hi> to fixe that upon, and I believe all men will find it so that please to try. But in a relative, or respective excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, they goe both before, and after one another. Thus Wooll, and a Iewell, are better then each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for wooll is better for warmth, and a jewell for ornament. A frogge hath more sense in it, then the Sunne; and yet the Sunne shines brighter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suppose <hi>consecration</hi> of the Eucharist were greater then <hi>ordaining Priests,</hi> yet that cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that the <hi>power of ordaining</hi> may make <hi>a higher and distinct order,</hi> because the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, hath in it the power of consecrating and something more; it is all that which makes the <hi>Priest,</hi> and it is something more besides, which makes the <hi>Bishop.</hi> Indeed if the Bishop had it not, and the Priest had it, then supposing consecration to be greater then ordination, the Priest would not only equall, but excell the Bishop, but because the Bishop hath that, and ordination besides, therefore he is higher both in Order, and Dignity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Suppose that <hi>Consecration</hi> were the greatest Clericall power in the world, and that the Bishop, and the Priest, were equall in the greatest power, yet a lesser power then it, superadded to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's, may make a distinct <hi>order,</hi> and superiority.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41208:278"/>
Thus it was said of the sonne of Man. <hi>Constituit eum paulò minorem Angelis, he was made a little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the Angels.</hi> It was but a little lower, and yet so much as to distinguish their Natures, for he took not upon him the NATURE <hi>of Angells, but the seed of Abraham.</hi> So it is in proportion between Bishop, and Priest; for though a Priest communicating in the greatest power of the Church, <hi>viz. consecration</hi> of the venerable Eucharist, yet differing in a lesse is <hi>paulò minor Angelis, a little lower then the Bishop, the Angell of the Church,</hi> yet this little lower, makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct order, and enough for a subordination. * An Angell, and a man communicate in those great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of spirituall essence, they both discourse, they have both election, and freedome of choice, they have will, and understanding, and memory, impresses of the Divine image, and loco-motion, and immortality. And these excellencies are (being precisely considered) of more reall and eternall worth, then the Angelicall manner of moving so in an instant, and those other formes and modalities of their knowledge and volition, and yet for these superadded parts of excellency, the difference is no lesse then specificall. If we compare a Bishop and a Priest thus, what we call difference in nature there, will be a difference in order here, and of the same consideration.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lastly it is considerable, that these men that make this objection, doe not make it because they think it true, but because it will serve a present turne. For all the world sees, that to them that deny the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41208:279"/>
reall presence, this can be no objection; and most certainly the <hi>Anti-episcopall</hi> men doe so, in all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and then what excellency is there in the power of consecration, more then in ordination? Nay is there any such thing as consecration at all? This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so would be considered from their principles. But I proceed.</p>
                  <p>One thing only more is objected against the maine Question. If <hi>Episcopacy</hi> be a distinct order, why may not a man be a Bishop that never was a Priest, as (abstracting from the lawes of the Church) a man may be a Presbyter that never was a Deacon, for if it be the impresse of a distinct chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, it may be imprinted <hi>per saltum,</hi> and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, as it is in the order of a Presbyter.</p>
                  <p>To this I answere, It is true if the powers and characters themselves were independant; as it is in all those offices of humane constitution, which are called the inferior orders; For the office of an <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louthite,</hi> of an <hi>Exorcist,</hi> of an <hi>Ostiary,</hi> are no way dependant on the office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and therefore a man may be Deacon, that never was in any of those, and perhaps a <hi>Presbyter</hi> too, that never was a <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> as it was in the first example of the <hi>Presbyterate</hi> in the 72. <hi>Disciples.</hi> But a <hi>Bishop</hi> though he have a distinct character, yet it is not disparate from that of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but supposes it <hi>ex vi ordinis.</hi> For since the power of ordination (if any thing be) is the distinct capacity of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> this power suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses a power of <hi>consecrating</hi> the Eucharist to be in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> for how else can he ordaine a <hi>Presbyter</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:41208:279"/>
with a power, that himselfe hath not? can he give, what himselfe hath not received?</p>
                  <p>* I end this point with the saying of <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>

* However we see here, that they were prohibited, and we never find before this time, that any of them actually did give orders, neither by ordinary power, nor extraordinary dispensation; and the constant tradition of the Church, and practise <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall</hi> is, that they never could give orders; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this exposition of the Canon is liable to no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but is cleare for the illegality of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> giving holy orders, either to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and is concluding for the necessity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence both of <hi>Episcopall</hi> order, and jurisdiction for ordinations, for, <hi>reddendo singula singulis,</hi> and expounding this Canon according to the sense of the Church, and exigence of Catholike Custome, the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> are excluded from giving orders for want of jurisdiction, and the Priests of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for want of order; the first may be supplied by a delegate power <hi>in liter is Episcopalibus,</hi> the second cannot, but by a new ordination, that is, by making the <hi>Priest</hi> a <hi>Bishop.</hi> For if a <hi>Priest</hi> of the Citty have not so much power as a <hi>Chorepiscopus,</hi> as I have proved he hath not, by shewing that the <hi>Chorepis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus</hi> then had Episcopall ordination, and yet the <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> might not collate orders without a faculty from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> the City <hi>Priests</hi> might not doe it, unlesse more be added to them, for their want was more. They not only want jurisdiction, but something besides, and that must needs be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>* But although these <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> at the first had E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall Ordination, yet it was quickly taken from

them for their incroachment upon the <hi>Biships Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,</hi> and as they were but <hi>Vicarij,</hi> or <hi>visitatores E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscoporum in villis,</hi> so their ordination was but to a meere <hi>Presbyterate.</hi> And this we find, as soone as ever we heare that they had had Episcopall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

And ever after this all the ordinations they made were only to the inferiour Ministeries, with the Bishop's License too, but they never ordayn'd any to be <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> or <hi>Priests;</hi> for these were Orders of the <hi>Holy Ghost's</hi> appointing, and therefore were <hi>gratiae Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs Sancti,</hi> and issues of order; but the inferiour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries, as of a <hi>Reader,</hi> an <hi>Ostiary</hi> &amp;c. were humane constitutions, and requir'd not the capacity of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall</hi> Order to collate them; for they were not <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as all Orders properly so call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are, but might by humane dispensation be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd, as well as by humane Ordinance, they had their first constitution. *</p>
                  <p>* The <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> lasted in this consistence till they were quite taken away by the Councell of <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palis:</hi> save only, that such men also were called <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repiscopi</hi> who had beene <hi>Bishops</hi> of Cities, but had fallen from their honour by communicating in

Clergy men were reduc'd to lay communion, either being suspended, or deposed; that is, from their place of honour, and execution of their function, with, or without hope of restitution respectively; but then still they had their order, and the Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd by them were valid, though they indeed were prohibited to Minister; but in the cases of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent instance, the ordinations were pronounc'd as null, to have bestowed nothing, and to be meerely imaginary.</p>
                  <p>* But so also it was in case that Bishops ordain'd without a title, or in the diocesse of another Bishop, as in the Councell of <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. The expressions in the severall cases are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, &amp; of diverse issue, for in case of those nullities which are meerely Canonicall, they are expressed as then first made, but in the case of ordination by a <hi>Non-Bishop,</hi> they are onely declared voy'd <hi>ipso facto.</hi> And therefore in that decree of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> against <hi>Sinetitular</hi> ordinations, the Canon saith; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. In the cases of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the decree is <hi>pro futuro,</hi> which makes it evident that those nullities are such as are made by Canon, but in the cases of <hi>Colluthus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> there was declaration of a past nullity and that before any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was made; and though Synodall declarations pronoun'd such ordinations invalid, yet none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed so for the future, which is a cleare evidence, that this nullity, viz: in case of ordination by a <hi>Non-Presbyter,</hi> is not made by Canon, but by Canon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to be invalid in the nature of the thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If to this be added, that in antiquity it was dogmatically resolved that by the Nature, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Order of <hi>Bishops;</hi> ordination was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to them, then it will also from hence be evident, that the nullity of ordination without a <hi>Bishop</hi> is not dependant upon positive constitution, but on the exigence of the institution. * * Now that the power of ordination was onely in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> even they, who to advance the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> were willing enough to speake lesse for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> give testimony; making this the proper distinctive cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance of a <hi>Bishop</hi> from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath power of ordination, the <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath not.

the other Clergy can be imagined; I am sure none is either expressed or intimated. For it was a rul'd case, and attested by the Uniforme practise of the Church, which was set downe in the third Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Carthage, Episcopus vnus esse potest per quem</hi>

How if the Bishop have but one Priest, must his Bishop part with him to supply the necessity of the Neighbour widdow-Church?</hi> Yea, that he must. But how then shall he keepe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when he hath never a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to assist him? That indeed would have beene the objection now, but it was none then.

If thou speake (saith he) of <hi>Paulinianus,</hi> he comes now and then to visit us, not as any of your Clergy, but <hi>ejus à quo ordinatus est, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's who ordain'd him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* So that the issue of this argument is this. The <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>rules</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Councells</hi> appropriate the ordination of <hi>Bishops</hi> to <hi>Bishops,</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> to one <hi>Bishop,</hi> (for I never find a <hi>Presbyter</hi> ordain'd by two <hi>Bishops</hi> together, but onely <hi>Origen</hi> by the <hi>Bishops of Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Caesarea) Presbyters</hi> are never mention'd in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with <hi>Bishops</hi> at their ordinations, and if alone they did it, their ordination was pronounced inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and void <hi>ab initio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* To these particulars adde this, that <hi>Bishops</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were punished if ordinations were <hi>Vncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> which were most vnreasonable if <hi>Presbyters</hi> did joine in them, and were causes in conjunction. But unlesse they did it alone, we never read that they were punishable; indeed <hi>Bishops</hi> were <hi>pro toto, &amp; integro,</hi> as is reported by <hi>Sozomen</hi> in the case of <hi>Elpidius, Eustathius, Basilius of Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi> Thus also it was decreed in the second, and sixt Chapters of the <hi>Councell of Chalcedon,</hi> and in the <hi>Imperiall constitutions.</hi> Since therefore we neither find <hi>Presbyters</hi> join'd with <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>commission,</hi> or <note place="margin">

ordination is invalidated by this example, for <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> join'd with him in the ordination of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, that it matters not whether by his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues he means one, or the other, for <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Confessor who was the man ordain'd, was ordain'd but to be a Reader, and that was no <hi>Order of Divine institution,</hi> no gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and therefore might be dispensed by one, or more; by Bishops, or Presbyters, and no way enters into the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this question concerning the power of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating those orders which are gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and of <hi>divine ordinance;</hi> and therefore, this, although I have seen it once pretended, yet hath no validity to impugne the constant practise of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive antiquity.</p>
                  <p>But then are all ordinations invalid which are done by meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> without a <hi>Bishop?</hi> What think we of the reformed Churches?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For my part I know not what to think. The question hath been so often asked with so much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and prejudice; and we are so bound by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like interest to approve all that they doe, that wee have disabled our selves to justify our owne. For we were glad at first of abettors against the Errors of the Romane Church, we found these men zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in it, we thank'd God for it (as we had cause) and we were willing to make them recompence, by endeavouring to justify their ordinations; not thinking what would follow upon our selves. But now it is come to that issue, that our own <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41208:287"/>
thought not necessary, because wee did not condemne the ordinations of their <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why is not the question rather, what we think of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> then what we think of the <hi>reformed Churches?</hi> Did the Primitive Councells, and Fathers doe well in condemning the ordinations made by meere <hi>Presbyters?</hi> If they did well, what was a vertue in them, is no sinne in us. If they did ill, from what principle shall wee judge of the right of ordinations? since there is no example in Scripture of any ordination made but by <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Presbytery</hi> that impos'd hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> is by all antiquity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded either of the office, or of a Colledge of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation made by his owne hands, as appeares by comparing the two epistles to <hi>S. Timothy</hi> together; and may be so meant by the principles of all sides, for if the names be confounded, then <hi>Presbyter</hi> may signify a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and that they of this <hi>Presbytery</hi> were not <hi>Bishops,</hi> they can never prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where all men grant that the Names are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
                  <p>* So that whence will men take their estimate for the rites of ordinations? From <hi>Scripture?</hi> That gives it alwayes to <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> (as I have proved) and that a <hi>Priest</hi> did ever impose hands for ordination can never be showne from thence. From whence then? From <hi>Antiquity?</hi> That was so farre from licensing ordinations made by <hi>Presbyters</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the primitive Church did
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41208:288"/>
never joyne with <hi>Bishops</hi> in Collating holy Orders of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> till the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Councell of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> much lesse doe it alone, rightly, and with effect. So that, as in <hi>Scripture</hi> there is nothing for <hi>Presbyters</hi> ordaining, so in <hi>Antiquity</hi> there is much against it; And either in this particular we must have strange thoughts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or not so faire interpretation of the ordinations of reformed <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> But for my part I had rather speake a truth in sincerity, then erre with a glorious correspondence.</p>
                  <p>But will not necessity excuse them who could not have orders from Orthodoxe <hi>Bishops?</hi> shall we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinne against our consciences by suscribing to hereticall, and false resolutions <hi>in materiâ fidei,</hi> or else loose the being of a Church, for want of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ordinations?</hi> * Indeed if the case were just thus it was very hard with the good people of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Churches; but I have here two things to consider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I am very willing to beleive that they would not have done any thing either of error, or suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in cases of necessity. But then I consider that <hi>M. Du Plessis,</hi> a man of honour, and Great learning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>de Eccles. cap.</hi> 11.</note> does attest, that at the first reformation there were many <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> and <hi>Cardinalls</hi> in <hi>Germany, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> that joyn'd in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom they might, but did not imploy in their ordinations; And what necessity then can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this case, I would faine learne that I might make their defence. But, which is of more, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41208:288"/>
deeper consideration; for this might have been done by inconsideration, and irresolution, as often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the beginning of great changes, but, it is their constant and resolved practise at least in <hi>France,</hi> that if any returnes to them they will reordayne him by their <hi>Presbytery,</hi> though he had before <hi>Episcopall</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. I consider that necessity may excuse a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall delinquency; but I never heard that necessity did build a Church. Indeed no man is forc'd for his owne particular to committ a sinne, for if it be absolutely a case of necessity, the action ceases to be a sinne; but indeed if God meanes to build a Church in any place, he will doe it by meanes proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that end; that is, by putting them into a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doing, and acquiring those things which himselfe hath required of necessity to the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Church. * So that, supposing that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a <hi>Bishop</hi> is necessary for the vocation of <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> (as I have proved it is) and therefore for the founding, or perpetuating of a Church, either God hath given to all Churches op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and possibility of such Crdinations, and then, necessity of the contrary, is but pretence and mockery, or if he hath not given such possibility, then there is no Church there to be either built, or continued, but the Candlestick is presently remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The same happened in the case of the <hi>Iberians</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>* Thus the case is evident, that the want of a <hi>Bishop</hi> will not excuse us from our endeavours of acquiring one; and where God meanes to found a Church there he will supply them with those meanes, and Ministeries which himselfe hath made of ordinary and absolute necessity.

                  </p>
                  <p>If an ordinary necessity will not excuse this, will not an extraordinary calling justifie it? Yea, most certainely, could we but see an ordinary proofe for an extraordinary calling, viz: an evident prophecy, demonstration of Miracles, certainety of reason, clarity of sense, or any thing that might make faith of an extraordinary mission.</p>
                  <p>But shall we then condemne those few of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches whose ordinations alwaies have beene without <hi>Bishops?</hi> No indeed. That must not be. They stand, or fall to their owne Master. And
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41208:290"/>
though I cannot justifie their ordinations, yet what degree their Necessity is of, what their desire of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall</hi> ordinations may doe for their personall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and how farre a good life, and a <hi>Catholike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife</hi> may leade a man in the way to heaven, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the formes of externall communion be not observ'd) I cannot determine. * For ought I know, their condition is the same with that of the Church of <hi>Pergamus [I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Sathans seate is, and thou heldest fast my</hi> FAITH, <hi>and hast not denied my Name; Nihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lominus habeo adversus te pauca, some few things I have against thee;</hi>] and yet of them, the want of Canonicall ordinations is a defect which I trust themselves desire to be remedied; but if it cannot be done, their sinne indeed is the lesse, but their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery the Greater. * I am sure I have said sooth, but whether or no it will be thought so, I cannot tell; and yet why it may not I cannot guesse, unlesse they only be impeccable, which I suppose will not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be thought of them, who themselves thinke, that all the Church possibly may faile. But this I would not have declar'd so freely, had not the necessity of our owne Churches requir'd it, and that the first pretence of the legality, and validity of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations beene boyed up to the height of an absolute necessity; for else why shall it be called Tyranny in us to call on them to conforme to us, and to the practise of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> and yet in them be called a good and a holy zeale to exact our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to them; But I hope it will so happen to us,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41208:290"/>
that it will be verifyed here, what was once said of the Catholikes under the fury of <hi>Iustina, sed tanta fuit persever antia fidelium populorum, vt animas priùs amittere, quàm Episcopum mallent;</hi> If it were put to our choice, rather to dye (to wit the death of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> not rebells) then loose the sacred order, and offices of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> without which no Priest, no ordination, no consecration of the Sacrament, no absolution, no rite, or Sacrament legitimately can be performed in order to eternity.</p>

To this the answer is evident from his own words: That <hi>Bishops</hi> should give the Holy Ghost in confirmation, is written in the Acts of the <hi>Apostles;</hi> and now that this is reserved rather for the honour of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> then a simple necessity in the nature of the thing makes no matter. For the question here that is only of concernment, is not to what end this power is reserved to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but by whom it was reserved? Now S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saies it was done <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Acta,</hi> in the Scripture, therefore by Gods Holy Spirit, and the end he also specifies, <hi>viz.</hi> for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that sacred order, <hi>non propter legis necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, not that there is any necessity of law,</hi> that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation should be administred by the <hi>Bishop.</hi> Not that a Priest may doe it, but that, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe there argues, the Holy Ghost being already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in baptisme, if it happens that <hi>Bishops</hi> may not be had (for he puts the case concerning persons in bondage, and places remore, and destitute of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops)</hi> then in that case there is not the absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Law, that Confirmation should be had at all: A man does not perish if he have it not; for that this thing was reserved to a <hi>Bishops</hi> peculiar mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, was indeed an honour to the function, but it was not for the necessity of a Law tying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all cases actually to acquire it. So that this <hi>[non necessarium</hi>] is not to be referred to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> ministration, as if it were not necessary for him to doe it when it is to be done, not that a Priest may doe it if a <hi>Bishop</hi> may not be had; but this <hi>non neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> is to be referred to confirmation it selfe; so that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41208:293"/>
if a <hi>Bishop</hi> cannot be had, confirmation, though with much losse, yet with no danger, may be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This is the summe of S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> discourse, this reconciles him to himselfe, this makes him speak conformably to his first assertions, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to his arguments; and to be sure, no expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition can make these words to intend that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the power of confirmation to <hi>Bishops,</hi> is not done by the spirit of God, and then let the sense of the words be what they will, they can doe no hurt to the cause; and as easily may we escape from those words of his, to <hi>Rusticus Bishop of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona.

                  <p>* * But S. <hi>Gregory</hi> is also pretended in objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he gave dispensation to the Priests of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia, vt baptizatos Vguant,</hi> to aneale baptized <note place="margin">

                  <p>Because it is evident that he meanes it not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, but of the Chrisme in those times by the rites of the Church us'd in baptisme. For in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

And by the way this may answer S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his <hi>[Presbyteri consignant absente Episcopo</hi>] in case it be so to be read; for here wee see a consignation permitted to the presbyters in the Easterne Churches to be used in baptisme, in the absence of the Bishop, and this an act of indulgence and favour, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and of use to <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his purpose of advancing the Presbyters, but yet of no objection in case of confimation. * And indeed <hi>[Consignari</hi>] is us'd in Antiquity for any signing with the Crosse, and anealing. Thus it is us'd in the first <hi>Arausican Councell</hi> for <hi>extreame Vnction,</hi> which is there in case of extreame necessity permitted to <hi>Presbyters: Haereticos</hi>

For either there is no Government at all, or the <hi>Laity</hi> must governe the Church, or else the <hi>Clergy</hi> must. To say there is no Government, is to leave the Church in worse condition then a tyranny. To say that the Laity should governe the Church, when all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Ministeries are committed to the Clergy, is to say, Scripture means not what it saies; for it is

Now since by the frequent precept of so many Councells, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Deacons and Presbyters must submit in all things to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> much more must the Laity, and since the <hi>Bishop</hi> must rule in chiefe, and the Presbyters at the most can but rule in conjunction, and assistance, but ever in subordination to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> the Laity must obey <hi>de integro.</hi> For that is to keep them in that state, in which God hath placed them.</p>
                  <p>But for the maine, S. <hi>Clement</hi> in his Epistle to S. <hi>Iames</hi> translated by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> saith it was the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Peter,</hi> according to the institution of <hi>Christ, that Presbyters should be obedient to their Bishop in all things;</hi> and in his third Epistle; <hi>that Presbyters, and Deacons and others of the Clergy must take heed that they doe nothing without the license of the Bishop.</hi> * And to make this businesse up compleat, all these authorities of great antiquity, were not the prime constitutions in those severall Churches respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but meere derivations from tradition <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi>

                  <p>Thus farre we have matter of publike right, and authority declaring the <hi>Bishop</hi> to be the <hi>Ordinary Iudge</hi> of the causes, and persons of Clergy men; and have power of inflicting censures both upon the

Clergy, and the Laity. And if there be any weight in the concurrent testimony of the <hi>Apostolicall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> of the Generall Councells of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> of the Councells of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of <hi>Sardis,</hi> of <hi>Carthage;</hi> then it is evident, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> is the Ordinary Iudge in all matters of Spirituall cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, and hath power of censures, and therefore a Superiority of jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>This thing only by the way; in all these <hi>Canons</hi> there is no mention made of any <hi>Presbyters assistant</hi> with the <hi>Bishop</hi> in his Courts. For though I doubt not but the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were in some Churches, and in sometimes <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>* Now we may see these Canons attested by practice, and dogmaticall resolution. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is the man whom I would choose in all the world to depose in this cause; because he, if any man, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all dues to the Colledge of Presbyters: and yet if he reserves the Superiority of jurisdiction to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and that absolutely, and independently of conjunction with the Presbytery, we are all well enough, and without suspition. * <hi>Diù patientiam meam tenui (Fratres Charissimi)</hi> saith he, writing <note place="margin">

Well! Vpon this S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himselfe, by his owne authority alone, suspends them till his returne, and so shewes that his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was independant, theirs was not, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises they shall have a faire hearing before him, in the presence of the Confessors, and all the people. <hi>Vtar eâ admonitione quâ me vti Dominus jubet, ut interim prohibeantur offerre, acturi &amp; apud nos, &amp; apud Confessores ipsos, &amp; apud plebem Vniversam causam suam.</hi> * Here it is plaine that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended these Presbyters, by his owne authority, in absence from his Church, and reserved the further hearing of the cause till it should please God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to his See.</p>

But this fault of the Presbyters S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the two next Epistles does still more exaggerate; saying, they ought to have ask'd the <hi>Bishops</hi> leave, <hi>Sicut in praeteritum semper sub antecessoribus factum est,</hi> for so was the Catholike custome ever, that nothing should be done without the <hi>Bishops</hi> leave; but now by doing otherwise they did prevaricate the divine commandement, and dishonour the <hi>Bishop.</hi> Yea, <note place="margin">

And these are; all actions civill, all publike violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of justice, all breach of Municipall lawes. These the Church hath nothing to doe with, unlesse by the

                  <p n="3">3. There are somethings of a mixt nature; and something of the secular interest, and something of the Ecclesiasticall concurre to their constitution, and these are of double cognisance: the secular power, and the Ecclesiasticall doe both in their severall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities take knowledge of them. Such are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencyes of Clergy-men, who are both Clergy, and subjects too; <hi>Clerus Domini,</hi> and <hi>Regis subditi;</hi> and for their delinquencyes which are <hi>in materiâ justitiae</hi> the secular tribunall punishes as being a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of that right which the State must defend, but because done by a person who is a member of the sacred hierarchy, and hath also an obligation of speciall duty to his <hi>Bishop,</hi> therefore the <hi>Bishop</hi> also may punish him; And when the commonwealth hath inflected a penalty, the <hi>Bishop</hi> also may impose a censure, for every sinne of a Clergy-man is two. But of this nature also are the convening of Synods, the power whereof is in the <hi>King,</hi> and in the <hi>Bishop</hi> severally, insomuch as both the Church and the commonwealth in their severall respects have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar interest; The commonwealth for preservation of peace and charity, in which religion hath the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41208:311"/>
deepest interest; and the Church, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of faith. And therefore both Prince and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop have indicted Synods in severall ages, upon the exigence of severall occasions, and have severall powers for the engagement of Clericall obedience, and attendance upon such solemnities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because Christianity is after the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and is a capacity superadded to it, therefore those things which are of mixt cognisance are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>King;</hi> The <hi>Supremacy</hi> here is his, and so it is in all things of this nature, which are called <hi>[Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi>] because they are <hi>in materiâ Ecclesiae, ad finem religionis,</hi> but they are of a different nature, and use from things <hi>[Spirituall</hi>] because they are not issues of those things which Christianity hath introduc'd <hi>de integro,</hi> and are separate from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the commonwealth in it's particular capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, for such things only, are properly spirituall.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

But yet this internall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsory through the duty of good Princes to God, and their favour to the Church, is assisted by these<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular arme, either superadding a temporall penalty in case of contumacy, or some other way abetting the censures of the Church, and it ever was so since commonwealths were Christian. So that ever since then, Episcopall Iurisdiction hath a double part; an externall, and an internall; this is deriv'd from Christ, that from the King, which because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41208:312"/>
in all acts of Iurisdiction, therefore it is, that the King is supreme of the Iurisdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of it which is the externall compulsory.</p>
                  <p>* And for this cause we shall sometimes see the Emperour, or his Prefect, or any man of consular dignity sit Iudge when the Question is of Faith, not that the Prefect was to Iudge of that, or that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> were not; But in case of the pervicacy of a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish heretick who would not submitt to the power of the Church, but flew to the secular power for assistance, hoping by taking sanctuary there, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the favour of the Prince: In this case the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> also appealed thither, not for resolution, but assistance, and sustentation of the Church's power.</p>
                  <p>* It was so in the case of <hi>Aëtius</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> the Prefect, <hi>Constantius</hi> being Emperour. For, all that the Prefect did, or the Emperour in this case, <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>* Nay it was one of the causes why S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Palladius</hi> in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> because he refused to answer, except it were before some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable personages of the Laity.

                  <p>And now upon this occasion, I have faire oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41208:313"/>
to insert a consideration, The <hi>Bishops</hi> have power over all causes emergent in their diocesses; all, (I meane) in the sense above explicated; they have power to inflict censures, excommunication is the highest, the rest are parts of it, and in order to it. Whether or no must Church-censures be used in all such causes as they take cognisance of, or may not the secular power find out some externall compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory instead of it, and forbid the Church to use ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, in certaine cases?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To this, I answer, that if they be such cases in which by the law of Christ they may, or such in which they must use excommunication, then, in these cases no power can forbid them. For what power Christ hath given them, no man can take away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As no humane power can disrobe the Church of the power of excommunication; so no humane power can invest the Church with a lay Compulso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For if the Church be not capable of a <hi>jus gladij,</hi> as most certainly shee is not, the Church cannot receive power to put men to death, or to inflict lesser paines in order to it, or any thing above a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary penance; I meane in the formality of a Church-tribunall, then they give the Church what shee must not, cannot take. I deny not but Clergy men are as capable of the power of life and death, as any men; but not in the formality of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. A Court of life and death, cannot be an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall tribunall; and then if any man, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men should perswade the Church not to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41208:314"/>
inflict her censures upon delinquents, in some cases in which shee might lawfully inflict them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give her another compulsory; they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Church-consistory, and erect a very secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Court, dependant on themselves, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be appeal'd to from themselves, and so also to be prohibited as the Lay-Superiour shall see cause for. * Whoever therefore should be consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to any such permutation of power, is <hi>traditor potestatis quam S. Mater Ecclesia à sponso suo acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat, he betrayes the individuall, and inseparable right of holy Church.</hi> For her censures shee may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon her delinquent children without asking leave.

The other is beg'd, or borrow'd, none of her owne, nor of a fit edge to be us'd in her abscissions, and coërcions. * I end this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that memorable <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> of <note place="margin">

over to a forraine enemy, or the peoples rage; as then, to be buffeted, so now to be deposed, or disinterest in the allegeance of subjects; in these cases, excommunication being nothing like that which Christ authorized, and no way cooperating toward the end of its institution, but to an end of private designes, and rebellious interest, <hi>Bishops</hi> have no power of such censures, nor is it lawfull to inflict the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, things remaining in that consistence, and capacity.

This will not be suppos'd either of wise or holy men.

might doe it, I doe not say <hi>without leave,</hi> but I say they had leave given them, when the <hi>Bishop</hi> sent them to officiate in a Village with ordinary or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary residence; as it is to this day, when the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> institutes to a particular charge, he also gives power <hi>hoc ipso,</hi> of officiating in that place. So that at first when they did officiate in places by <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry missions,</hi> then they were to have leave, but this <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense</hi> was also <hi>temporary;</hi> but when they were fixt upon <hi>ordinary charges</hi> they might not officiate without leave, but then they had an <hi>ordinary leave</hi> given them <hi>in traditione sub ditorum,</hi> and that was done <hi>in subsidium Muneris Episcopalis,</hi> because it was that part of the <hi>Bishops</hi> charge, which he could not personally attend for execution of the <hi>Minor</hi> offices, and therefore concredited it to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but if he was present, a <hi>new leave</hi> was necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the <hi>power</hi> alwaies was in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> so now the <hi>execution</hi> also did returne to him when he was there in person, himselfe if he listed, might offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate.</p>
                  <p>All this is excellently attested in the example of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> of whom <hi>Possidonius</hi> in his life reports that being but a <hi>Presbyter, Valerius</hi> the Bishop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Greek borne, and not well spoken in the Latin tongue, and so unfit for publike orations, <hi>eidem Presbytero (viz.</hi> to <hi>Austin) potestatem dedit coram se in Ecclesiâ Evangelium praedicandi, ac frequentis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simè tractandi contra</hi> USUM <hi>quidem, &amp;</hi> CONSUE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUDINEM <hi>Africanarum Ecclesiarum. He gave leave to Austin then but Presbyter, to preach in the Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:41208:323"/>
                     <hi>even while himselfe was present, indeed against the</hi> VSE <hi>and</hi> CUSTOME <hi>of the African Churches.</hi> And for this act of his he suffered soundly in his report.</p>
                  <p>* For the case was thus. In all <hi>Africa</hi> ever since the first spring of the <hi>Arian</hi> heresy, the Church had then suffered so much by the preaching of <hi>Arius</hi> the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that they made a Law not to suffer any <hi>Presbyter</hi> to preach at all, at least in the <hi>Mother Church,</hi> and in the Bishops presence. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Thence came this Custome in the African Churches.</hi> But because <hi>Valerius</hi> saw S. <hi>Austin</hi> so able, and himselfe for want of Latin so unfit, he gave leave to <hi>Austin</hi> to preach before him, against the <hi>Custome</hi> of the <hi>African</hi> Churches. But he addes this reason for his excuse too; it was not indeed the custome of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> but it was of the Orientall Churches.

This, perhaps it was not well done, but this makes not against the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer discourse; for though it may be fit for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to give leave, the Church requiring it still more and more in descent of ages, and multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christians, and Parishes, yet it is cleare that this is not to be done without the Bishops leave, for it is for this very thing that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Rusticus,</hi> to show he did amisse, because he would not give his Presbyters license. * And this he also reprehends in his epistle <hi>ad Nepotianum, Pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simae consuetudinis est in quibusdam Ecclesiis tacere Presbyteros, &amp; praesentibus Episcopis non loqui.

                  <p>* 3. All Ordinations were made by <hi>Bishops</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, (as I have already prooved.) Now let this be confronted with the practice of Primitive Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that no Presbyter might be ordain'd <hi>sine titulo</hi> without a particular charge, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies custome, and at last grew to be a law in the

Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and we shall perceive that the ordainer was the onely chooser; for then to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a Presbyter was also to give him a charge; and the Patronage of a Church was not a lay inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, but part of the <hi>Bishops</hi> cure, for he had <gap reason="foreign">

For what is the <hi>divine authority</hi> that he mentions? It is only the example of <hi>Moses</hi> whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take the Sonne of <hi>Eleazer</hi> and cloath him with his Fathers robes <hi>coram omni Synagogâ, before all the congregation.</hi> The people chose not, God chose <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> consecrated him, and the people stood, and look'd on; that's all that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can supply. * Iust thus <hi>Bishops</hi> are, and ever were ordayn'd, <hi>non nisi sub populi assistentis conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ, in the sight of the people standing by;</hi> but to what end? <hi>Vt plebe praesente detegantur malorum crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, vel bonorum merita praedicentur.</hi> All this while the election is not in the people, nothing but the

                  </p>
                  <p>* * But S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath two more proof's whence we may learne either the sense, or the truth of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. The one is of the <hi>Apostles</hi> ordayning the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Deacons (but this we have already examin'd,) the other of S. <hi>Peter</hi> choosing S. <hi>Matthias</hi> into the <hi>Apostolate;</hi> it was indeed done in the presence of the people. * But here it is considerable that at this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of S. <hi>Matthias</hi> the Number of the persons present was but 120, of which eleven were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and 72 were Disciples and Presbyters, they make up 83, and then there remaines but 37 of the Laity, of which many were women, which I know not yet whether any man would admitt to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and whether they doe or doe not, the Laity is a very inconsiderable Number if the matter had beene to be carried by plurality of voices; so that let the worst come that is imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the whole businesse was in effect carried by the Clergy, whom in this case we have no reason to suspect to be divided, and of a distinct, or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interest. * 2. Let this discourse be of what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity it will, yet all this whole businesse was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and extraordinary; For though the <hi>Apostles</hi> nam'd two Candidates yet the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> chose them by particular revelation. And yet for all this, it was lawfull for S. <hi>Peter</hi> alone to have done it without casting lots. <hi>An non licebat ipsi [Petro</hi>] <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere? licebat, &amp; quidem maximè; verùm id non</hi>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:41208:329"/>
                     <hi>facit ne cui videretur gratificari. Quanquam alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui non erat particeps Spiritûs.</hi> For all, he had not as yet received the holy Ghost, yet he had power himselfe to have completed the election. So S. <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>So that now, if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> meanes more then the presence of the people for suffrage of publike testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, &amp; extends it to a suffrage of formall choice, his proofes of the divine authority are invalid, there is no such thing can be deduc'd from thence, and then this is his <hi>complying so much with the people</hi> (which hath beene the fault of many a good man) may be reckon'd together with his <hi>rebaptization.</hi> But truth is, he meanes no more then suffrage of testimony, viz: That he who is to be chosen <hi>Bishop</hi> be for his good life a man of good fame, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of before God and all the people, and this is all the share they have in their election. * And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed himselfe summes up the whole businesse and tells us of another <hi>jus Divinum</hi> too. <q>

                     <hi>Bishops</hi> only, that they should be carefull in their choyce. So that although the people were present, <hi>quibus pro fide, &amp; religione etiam honor deferendus est</hi> (as S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> phrase is) <hi>to whom respect is to be had, and faire complyings to be used so long as they are pious,</hi> catholick, and obedient, yet both the right of electing, and solemnity of ordaining was in the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the peoples interest did not arrive to one halfe of this.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                     </gap>, (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> expresses this case,) it was ordinary to doe so in many Churches.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The manner of election in many Churches was various, for although indeed the Church had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, and given power to the Bishops to make the election, yet in some times and in some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Presbyters, or the Chapter, chose one out of themselves. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saies they alwaies did so in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from S. <hi>Markes</hi> time to <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius.</hi> * S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saies that at the first, <note place="margin">

                  <p n="8">8. In the Church of <hi>England</hi> the people were never admitted to the choyce of a <hi>Bishop</hi> from its first becoming Christian to this very day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take it from the Clergy, in whom it alwaies was by permission of Princes, and to interest the people in it, is to recede <hi>à traditionibus Majorum,</hi> from the religion of our forefathers, and to INNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATE in a high proportion.</p>

(by way of testimony, I meane, and approbation) did concurre with the Synod of <hi>Bishops</hi> in the choyce of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> the people at last according to their usuall guise grew hot, angry, and tumultuous, and then were ingaged by divisions in religion to Name a <hi>Bishop</hi> of their own sect; and to disgrace one another by publike scandall, and contestation, and often grew up to Sedition, and Murder; and therefore although they were never admitted, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse where themselves usurped) farther then I have declared, yet even this was taken from them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, since in tumultuary assemblies, they were apt to carry all before them, they knew not how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between power, and right, they had not well learn'd to take deniall, but began to obtrude whom they listed, to swell higher like a torrent when they were check'd; and the soleship of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which by the Ancient Canons was in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> they would have asserted wholly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves both in right, and execution.</p>

                  <p>Truth is, the Nomination of <hi>Bishops</hi> in Scripture was in the <hi>Apostles</hi> alone, and though the Kindred of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> were admitted to the choyce of <hi>Simeon Cleophae,</hi> the Successor of S. <hi>Iames</hi> to the Bishoprick of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> witnesses; it was <note place="margin">

Yet this was <hi>praeter regulam Apostolicam.</hi> The rule of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and their precedents were for the sole right of the <hi>Bishops</hi> to choose their Colleagues in that Sacred order. * And then in descent, even before the <hi>Nicene Councell</hi> the people were forbidden to meddle in election, for they had no authority by Scripture to choose; by the necessity oftimes and for the reasons before asserted they were admitted to such a share of the choyce as is now folded up in a peice of paper, even to a testimoniall; and yet I deny not but they did often take more as in the case of <hi>Nilammon, quem cives elegerunt,</hi> saith the story out of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> they chose him alone, <note place="margin">

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41208:333"/>
partiality, faction, sedition, cruelty, and Pagan basenesse that they were quite interdicted it, above 1200 yeares agone. * So that they had their little in possession but a little while, and never had any due, and therefore now, their request for it is no petition of right, but a popular ambition and a snatching at a sword to hew the Church in peices. <note place="margin">

                  <p>But I thinke I need not have troubled my selfe halfe so farre, for they that strive to introduce a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular election, would as faine have <hi>Episcopacy</hi> out, as popularity of election let in. So that all this of popular election of <hi>Bishops,</hi> may seeme superfluous. For I consider, that if the peoples power of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Bishops</hi> be founded upon <hi>Gods law,</hi> as some men pretend from S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (not proving the thing from Gods law, but Gods law from S. <hi>Cyprian)</hi> then <hi>Bishops</hi> themselves must be by <hi>Gods law:</hi> For surely God never gave them power to choose any man into that office which himselfe hath no way instituted. And therefore I suppose these men will desist from their pretence of <hi>Divine right of popular election,</hi> if the Church will recede from her <hi>divine right of Episcopacy.</hi> But for all their plundering, and confounding, their bold pretences have made this discourse necessary.</p>
                  <p>IF we adde to all these foregoing particulars the <note place="margin">§ 41.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">Bishops onely did Vote in Councells and neither Presbyters, nor People.</note> power of making lawes to be in <hi>Bishops,</hi> nothing else can be required to the making up of a spirituall Principality. Now as I have shewne that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of every Diocesse did give lawes to his owne
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41208:333"/>
Church for particulars, so it is evident that the lawes of Provinces and of the Catholike Church, were made by conventions of Bishops without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, or concurrence of Presbyters, or any else for sentence and decision.</p>
                  <p>The instances of this are just so many as there are Councells. S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> reprehending <hi>Constantius</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> for interposing in the Conciliary deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of faith, <hi>si judicium Episcoporum est</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Epist. ad Solitar.</note> he) <hi>quid cum eo commune habet Imperator? It is a judgment to be pass'd</hi> BY BISHOPS, (meaning the determination of the article,) <hi>and not proper for the Emperour.</hi> And when <hi>Hosius</hi> of <hi>Corduba</hi> reprov'd him for sitting President in a Councell, <hi>Quis enim videns eum</hi> IN DECERNENDO PRINCIPEM SE, FACERE EPISCOPORUM, <hi>non meritò dicat illum eam ipsam abhominationem desolationis?</hi> He that sits Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, makes <hi>himselfe chiefe of the Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating <hi>Bishops</hi> only to preside in Councells, and to make decision.

where the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and ELDERS did meet together to DETERMINE of the question of circumcision. For although in the story of celebration of it, we find no man giving sentence but <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames;</hi> yet in 16. <hi>Acts,</hi> they are called <gap reason="foreign">

So that such Presbyters may well define in such conventuall assemblies. 3. If yet there were any difficulty latent in the story, yet the Catholick practice of Gods Church, is certainly the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor of such places where there either is any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, or where any is pretended.

                  <p>* I remember also that this place is pretended for the peoples power of voycing in Councells.

to them, in all the particular advantages of the former instances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the <hi>Bishops</hi> had the Parishes, what cure had the <hi>Priests?</hi> so that this will debase the <hi>Priests</hi> as much as the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and if it will confine a <hi>Bishop</hi> to a <hi>Parish,</hi> it will make that no <hi>Presbyter</hi> can be so much as a <hi>Parish-Priest.</hi> If it brings a <hi>Bishop</hi> lower then a Diocesse, it will bring the <hi>Priest</hi> lower then a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi> For set a <hi>Bishop</hi> where you will, either in a <hi>Diocesse,</hi> or a <hi>Parish,</hi> a <hi>Presbyter</hi> shall still keep the same duty and subordination, the same distance still. So that this objection upon supposition of the former discourse, will no way mend the matter for any side, but make it farre worse, it will not advance the Presbytery, but it will depresse the whole hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, and all the orders of H. Church.</p>
                  <p>* But because, this trifle is so much used amongst the enimies of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> I will consider it in little, and besides that it does no body any good advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I will represent it in it's <hi>fucus</hi> and show the falsehood of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then. It is evident that there were <hi>Bishops</hi> before there were any distinct Parishes. For the first division of Parishes in the West was by <hi>Evaristus,</hi> who lived almost 100 years after Christ, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Rome into seven parishes,</hi> assigning to every one a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> So <hi>Damasus</hi> reports of him in the Pontificall book. <hi>Hic titulos in urbe Româ divisit Presbyteris, &amp; septem Diaconos ordinavit qui custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirent Episcopum praedicantem propter stylum veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis. He divided the Parishes, or titles in the City of</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:41208:340"/>
                     <hi>Rome to Presbyters.</hi> The same also is by <hi>Damasus</hi> reported of <hi>Dionysius</hi> in his life, <hi>hic Presbyteris Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesias divisit, &amp; caemiteria, parochias<expan>

                        </expan> &amp; dioeceses constituit. Marcellus</hi> increased the number in the yeare 305. <hi>Hic fecit caemiterium viâ Salariâ, &amp;</hi> 25 <hi>Titulos in urbe Roma constituit quasi dioeceses propter baptismum, &amp; poenitentiam multorum qui converte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur ex Paganis, &amp; propter sepulturas Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. He made a Sepulture, or caemitery for the buriall of Martyrs, and appointed</hi> 25. <hi>Titles or Parishes:</hi> but he addes <hi>[quasi Dioeceses</hi>] as it had been diocesses, that is, distinct and limited to Presbyters, as dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were to <hi>Bishops;</hi> and the use of parishes which he subjoynes, cleares the businesse; for he appointed them onely <hi>propter baptismum, &amp; poenitentiam mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum &amp; sepulturas, for baptisme, and penance, and buriall;</hi> for as yet there was no preaching in Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, but in the Mother-Church. Thus it was in the West.</p>
                  <p>* But in <hi>Aegypt</hi> we find Parishes divided some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sooner then the earliest of these, for <hi>Eusebius</hi> reports out of <hi>Philo</hi> that the Christians in S. <hi>Markes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

Est au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in singulis locis consecrata orationi domus</hi> &amp;c: But even before this, there were <hi>Bishops.</hi> For in Rome there were <hi>fowre Bishops</hi> before any division of Parishes, though S. <hi>Peter</hi> be reckon'd for none. And before Parishes were divided in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> S. <hi>Marke</hi> himselfe who did it was the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time S. <hi>Iames</hi> was <hi>Bishop of Ierusalem,</hi> and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41208:341"/>
in diverse other places where <hi>Bishops</hi> were, there were no distinct Parishes of a while after <hi>Evaristus</hi> time, for when <hi>Dionysius</hi> had assign'd Presbyters to severall Parishes, he writes of it to <hi>Severus Bishop of Corduba,</hi> &amp; desires him to doe so too in his Diocesse, as appeares in his Epistle to him.</p>

                  <p>Well then! The case is thus. Parishes were not divided at first, therefore to be sure they were not of Divine institution. Therefore it is no divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a Presbyter should be fixt upon a Parish, therefore also a Parish is not by Christs ordinance an independant body, for by Christs ordinance there was no such thing at all, neither absolute, nor in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance neither; and then for the maine issue, since <hi>Bishops</hi> were before <hi>Parishes</hi> (in the present sense)
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41208:341"/>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> in that sense could not be Parochiall.</p>
                  <p>* But which was first, a private congregation, or a Diocesse? If a private congregation, then a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> was at first fix't in a private congregation, and so was a Parochiall <hi>Bishop.</hi> If a <hi>Diocesse</hi> was first, then the Question will be, how a Diocesse could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Parishes, for what is a Diocesse but a jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over many Parishes?</p>
                  <p>* I answer, it is true that DIOCESSE and PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RISH are words us'd now in contradistinction; And now, a Diocesse is nothing but the multiplication of of many Parishes: <hi>Sed non fuit sic ab initio.</hi> For at first, a <hi>Diocesse was the Citie and the Regio suburbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria,</hi> the neighbouring townes, in which there was no distinction of Parishes: That which was a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in the secular sense, that is, a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or division of secular prefecture, that was the assignation of a <hi>Bishops</hi> charge. * <hi>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Laodicea,</hi> were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> jurisdiction; and so they were in Ecclesiasticall regiment. And it was so upon great reason, for when the regiment of the Church was extended just so as the regiment of the Common-wealth, it was of lesse suspition to the secular power, while the Church regiment was just fixt together with the politicall, as if of purpose to shew their mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, and it's owne subordination. ** And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, there was in it a necessity; for the subjects of another Province, or Diocesse, could not either safely, or conveniently meete where the duty of the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41208:342"/>
Common-wealth did not ingage them; but being all of one prefecture, and Diocesse, the necessity of publike meetings in order to the Common-wealth would be faire opportunity for the advancement of their Christendome. And this, which at first was a necessity in this case, grew to be a law in all, by the sanction of the Councell of <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>* But in the moderne sense of this division a Bishops charge was neither a <hi>Parish,</hi> nor a <hi>Diocesse,</hi> as they are taken in relation; but a Bishop had the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme care of all the Christians which he by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or his Presbyters had converted, and he also had the charge of indeavouring the conversion of all the Country. So that although he had not all the Diocesse actually in communion and subjection, yet his charge, his Diocesse was so much. Iust as it was with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to whom Christ gave all the world for a Diocesse, yet at first they had but a smal congregation that did actually obey them.</p>
                  <p>And now to the Question. Which was first, a particular congregation or a Diocesse? I answere, that a <hi>Diocesse</hi> was first, that is, the <hi>Apostles</hi> had a charge before they had a congregation of converts; And S. <hi>Marke</hi> was sent <hi>Bishop</hi> to <hi>Alexandria</hi> by S. <hi>Peter</hi> before any were converted. * But ordinarily the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when they had converted a City or
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41208:342"/>
Nation, then fix't <hi>Bishops</hi> upon their charge, and there indeed the particular congregation was before the <hi>Bishop's</hi> taking of the <hi>Diocesse;</hi> But then, this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Nation although it was not the <hi>Bishops Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> before it was a particular congregation, yet it was part of the <hi>Apostles Diocesse,</hi> and this they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited to the <hi>Bishops</hi> respectively.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ordain'd by the Prophets at <hi>Antioch, Apostle</hi> of the Uncircumcision; All the Gentiles was his Diocesse, and even of those places he then received power which as yet he had not converted. So that, absolutely, a diocesse was before a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation. But if a <hi>diocesse</hi> be taken colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, as now it is, for a multitude of <hi>Parishes</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under one <hi>Bishop,</hi> then one must needes be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 20, and a particular congregation before a dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; but then that particular congregation was not a parish, in the present sense, for it was not a part of a Diocesse taking a Diocesse for a collection of Parishes; but that particular Congregation was the first fruits of his Diocesse, and like a Graine of Mustard-seed that in time might, and did grow up to a considerable height, even to a necessity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing titles, and parts of the Diocesse, assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning severall parts, to severall Priests.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that the Primitive <hi>Bishops,</hi> before the division of parishes, had the City, and Country; and after the division of parishes, had them all under his jurisdiction, and ever, even from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times had severall provinces (some of them I meane) within their limits and charges. * The 35 <hi>Canon</hi> of

                  <p>This generall account is sufficient to satisfie the allegations out of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> epistles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the whole Question. But for the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> epistle, there is something of peculiar answer. For first, It was a case of publike concernement, and therefore he would so comply with the publike interest as to doe it by publike counsell. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, It was a necessity of times that made this case peculiar. NECESSITAS TEMPORUM <hi>facit ut non temerè pacem demus,</hi> they are the first words of the next epistle, which is of the same matter; for if the <hi>lapsi</hi> had been easily, and without a publike and solemne triall reconcil'd, it would have made Gentile Sacrifices frequent, and Martyrdome but seldome. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, The common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell which <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> here said he would expect,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41208:350"/>
was the Councell of the Confessors, to whom for a peculiar honour it was indulged that they should be interested in the publike assoyling of such peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents who were overcome with those feares which the Confessors had overcome. So that this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently an act of positive, and temporary discipline; and as it is no disadvantage to the power of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> so to be sure, no advantage to the <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* But the clause of objection from the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>epistle</hi> is yet unanswer'd, and that runs something higher, .... <hi>tamen ad consultum vestrum eos dimisi ne videar aliquid temerè praesumere.</hi> It is called presumption to reconcile the penitents without the advice of those to whom he writ. But from this we are fairely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by the title. <hi>Cypriano, &amp; Compresbyteris Carthagini consistentibus; Caldonius, salutem.</hi> It was not the epistle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to his Presbyters, but of <hi>Caldonius</hi> one of the <hi>suffragan Bishops of Numidia</hi> to his <hi>Metropolitan;</hi> and now, what wonder if he call it presumption to doe an act of so publike conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence without the advise of his <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> He was bound to consult him by the <hi>Canons Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> and so he did, and no harme done to the present Question, of the <hi>Bishops sole</hi> and <hi>independant power,</hi> and unmixt with the conjunct interest of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> who had nothing to doe beyond <hi>ministery, counsell,</hi> and <hi>assistance.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. In all Churches where a <hi>Bishops</hi> seat was, there were not alwayes a Colledge of Presbyters, but only in the greatest Churches; for sometimes in the lesser Cities there were but two. <hi>Esse oportet,</hi>

                        <hi>In</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.</note> the third Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> put the case. <hi>Dein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de qui unum [Presbyterum] habuerit, numquid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet illi ipse unus Presbyter auferri?</hi> The Church of <hi>Hippo</hi> had but one. <hi>Valerius</hi> was the Bishop, and <hi>Austin</hi> was the Priest; and after him <hi>Austin</hi> was the Bishop, &amp; <hi>Eradius</hi> the Priest. Sometimes not one, as in the case <hi>Aurelius</hi> put in the same Councell I now cited, of a Church that had never a Presbyter to be consecrated <hi>Bishop</hi> in the place of him that dyed; &amp; once at <hi>Hippo</hi> they had none, even then when the people snatch'd <hi>S. Austin</hi> and carried him to <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to be ordain'd. In these cases I hope it will not be denied but the Bishop was <hi>Iudge alone,</hi> I am sure he had but little company, sometimes none at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But suppose it had been alwaies done that Presbyters were consulted in matters of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and possibility of Scandall, for so <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> intimates, <hi>Ecclesia seniores habuit sine quorum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio nihil gerebatur in Ecclesiâ</hi> (understand, in these <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> Churches where Presbyteries were fixt) yet this might be necessary, and was so indeed in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at first, which in succession as it prov'd trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the Presbyters; so unnecessary and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the <hi>Bishops.</hi> At first I say it might be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. For they were times of persecution, and temptation, and if both the Clergy and people too were not comply'd withall in such exigence of time, and agonies of spirit, it was the way to make
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41208:351"/>
them relapse to Gentilisme; for a discontented spirit will hide it selfe, and take sanctuary in the reedes and mud of <hi>Nilus,</hi> rather then not take complacence in an imaginary security and revenge. 2. As yet there had been scarse any <hi>Synods</hi> to determine cases of publike difficulty, and what they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from publike decision, it was fitting they should supply by the maturity of a Consiliary assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and deliberation. For although, by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> of the <hi>Apostles, Bishops</hi> were bound twise a yeare to celebrate <hi>Synods,</hi> yet persecution intervening, they were rather twice a yeare a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>a dispersion then a Synod.</hi> 3. Although <hi>Synods</hi> had been as frequently conven'd as was intended by the Apostles, yet it must be length of time, and a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive experience that must give opportunity and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to give generall rules for the emergency of all particulars, and therefore till the Church grew of some considerable age, a fixt standing Colledge of Presbyters was more requisite then since it hath been, when the frequency of Generall Councells, and Provinciall Synods, and the peace of the Church, and the innumerable volumes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Decretalls of Bishops, and a digest of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Constitutions, hath made the personall assistance of Presbyters unnecessary. 4. When ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity requir'd not their presence and Counsell, their own necessity requir'd that they should attend their severall cures. For let it be considered; they that would now have a Colledge of Presbyters as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Bishop whether they think of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41208:352"/>
For either they must have Presbyters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd without a title, which I am sure they have complain'd of these threescore years, or else they must be forc'd to <hi>Non-residence.</hi> For how else can they assist the Bishop in the ordinary, and daily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of the Church, unlesse either they have no cure of their own, or else neglect it? And as for the extraordinary, either the Bishop is to consult his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> or he may be assisted by a <hi>Synod,</hi> if the <hi>Canons</hi> already constitute doe not aide him, but in all these cases the <hi>Presbytery</hi> is impertinent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As this assistance of Presbyters was at first for necessity, and after by Custome it grew a Law; so now <hi>retrò,</hi> first the necessity fail'd, and then the desuetude abrogated the <hi>Law,</hi> which before, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome had established. <hi>[quod quâ negligentiâ ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solever</hi>

                     <hi>we have still</hi> (saith S. <hi>Hierome) in the Church our Senate, a Colledge, or Chapter of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> (he was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> but they were not consulted in Church affaires, &amp; matter of jurisdiction, that was it, that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> wondred how it came to passe. And thus it is to this day. In our Mother Churches we have a Chapter too, but the Bishop consults them not in matters of ordinary jurisdiction, just so it was in S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his time, and therefore our Bishops have altered no custome in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41208:352"/>
this particular, the alteration was pregnant even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the fowre generall Councells, and therefore is no violation of a <hi>divine right,</hi> for then most certainly a contrary provision would have been made in those conventions, wherein so much sanctity, and authority, and Catholicisme and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere discipline were conjunct; and then besides, it is no innovation in practice which pretends so faire antiquity, but however it was never otherwise then voluntary in the Bishops, and positive discipline in the Church, and conveniency in the thing for that present, and Councell in the Presbyters, and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Presbyters persons, and a disturbance of their duties when they came to be fixt upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular charge.</p>
                  <p>* One thing more before I leave. I find a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of the Councell of <hi>Hispalis</hi> objected. <hi>Episcopus Presbyteris solus honorem dare potest, solus autem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Can.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>non potest. A Bishop may alone ordaine a Priest, a Bishop may not alone depose a Priest.</hi> Therefore in censures there was in the Primitive Church a necessity of conjunction of Presbyters with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in imposition of <hi>censures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* To this I answer, first it is evident, that hee that can give an honour, can also take it away, if any body can; for there is in the nature of the thing no greater difficulty in pulling downe, then in raising up. It was wont alwaies to be accounted easier; therefore this Canon requiring a conjunct power in deposing Presbyters is a positive constitution of the Church, founded indeed upon good institution,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:41208:353"/>
but built upon no deeper foundation, neither of nature or higher institution, then its own present authority.</p>
                  <p>But that's enough, for we are not now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of <hi>divine right,</hi> but of <hi>Catholick and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive practice.</hi> To it therefore I answer, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct hand required to pull downe a Presbyter, was not the Chapter, or Colledge of Presbyters; but a company of Bishops, a <hi>Synodall sentence,</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> for so the <hi>Canon</hi> runnes, <hi>qui profecto nec ab uno damnari, nec uno judicante poterunt honoris sui privilegiis exui: sed praesentati</hi> SYNODALI IU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICIO, <hi>quod canon de illis praeceperit definiri.</hi> And the same thing was determin'd in the Greekes <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Carthage.</hi> If a Presbyter or a Deacon be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <note place="margin">

                     </gap>. But the causes of the other Clergy the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the place must ALONE <hi>heare and determine them.</hi> So that by this <hi>Canon,</hi> in some things the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop might not be <hi>alone,</hi> but then his <hi>assistants</hi> were <hi>Bishops,</hi> not <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in other things he <hi>alone was judge</hi> without either, and yet his sentences must not be <hi>clancular,</hi> but in <hi>open Court,</hi> in the full Chapter; for his Presbyters must be present; and so it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd for <hi>Africa</hi> in the <hi>fourth Councell of Carthage, Vt Episcopus nullius causam audiat abs<expan>

                  <p>*** I know nothing now to hinder our processe; for the Bishops jurisdiction is clearely left in his own hand, and the Presbyters had no share in it, but by delegation and voluntary assumption. Now I proceed in the maine question.</p>

S. <hi>Austin</hi> also reckons him in the accursed roll of hereticks, and adds at the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Catalogue, that he is NO CATHOLIKE CHRISTIAN that assents to any of the foregoing Doctrines, amongst which, this is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. <hi>Philastrius</hi> does as much for him.</p>
                  <p>But against this it will be objected. first, That heresies in the Primitive Catalogues are of a large extent, and every dissent from a publike opinion, was esteemed heresie. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, <hi>Aërius</hi> was called here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, for denying prayer for the dead. And why may he not be as blamelesse in equalling a Bishop, and a Presbyter, as in that other, for which he also is condemn'd by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and S. <hi>Austin.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, He was never condemn'd by any Councell, and how then can he be called heretick?</p>
                  <p>I answer; that dissent from a publike, or a received opinion was never called heresie, unlesse the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth was indeed a part of Catholike doctrine.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:41208:357"/>
For the Fathers many of them did so, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> from the <hi>Millenary</hi> opinion; yet none ever reckon'd them in the Catalogues of hereticks; but such things only set them downe there, which were either dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly opposite to Catholike beliefe, though <hi>in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus articulis,</hi> or to a holy life. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, It is true that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> reckon his denying pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the dead to be one of his owne opinions, and hereticall. But I cannot help it if they did, let him and them agree it, they are able to answer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But yet they accused him also of Arianisme; and shall we therefore say that Arianisme was no heresie, because the Fathers call'd him heretick in one particular upon a wrong principall? We may as well say this, as deny the other. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, He was not condemned by any Councell. No. For his heresie was ridiculous, and a scorne to all wise men; as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> observes, and it made no long continuance, neither had it any considerable party. * But yet this is certaine, that <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Philastrius,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> call'd this opinion of <hi>Aërius a heresie</hi> and against the Catholike beliefe. And themselves affirme that the Church did so; and then it would be considered, that it is but a sad imployment to revive old here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and make them a peice of the New religion.</p>
                  <p>And yet after all this, if I mistake not, although <hi>Aërius</hi> himselfe was so inconsiderable as not to be worthy noting in a Councell, yet certainly the one halfe of his error is condemn'd for heresie in one of the foure <hi>Generall Councells, viz.</hi> the first Councell of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

We call all them hereticks whom the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church hath condemn'd, and whom we shall anathematize. Will not <hi>Aërius</hi> come under one of these titles for a condemn'd heretick? Then see for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <gap reason="foreign">

And must we doe so too? God forbid. But how did they when all that was gone? For crummes would not last alwaies. The story specifies it not, but yet I suppose they then got a Bishop for their necessity to

were placed in a right and a true light, they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and saw them to be the Fathers of their soules, the <hi>Guardian of their life and manners</hi> (as King <hi>Edgar call'd S. Dunstan)</hi> the guide of their consciences, the instruments and conveyances of all the Blessings heaven uses to powre upon us, by the ministration of the holy Gospell; would they, that thought their lives a cheap exchange for a free, and open communion with a Catholick <hi>Bishop;</hi> would they have contested upon an aëry title, and the imaginary priviledge of an honour, which is farre lesse then their spirituall dignity, but infinitely lesse then the burden, and charge of the soules of all their Diocesse?

                  <p>However; let us see whether titles of honour be either unfit in themselves to be given to <hi>Bishops,</hi> or what the guise of Christendome hath been in her spirituall heraldry.</p>

Now since honour, and excellency are termes of mutuall relation, and all excellency that is in men, and things, is but a ray of divine excellency; so farre as they participate of God, so farre they are honourable.

                  <p>Lastly, <hi>[It shall not be so with you</hi>] so Christ said, <hi>non designando officium,</hi> but <hi>Sortem; not their duty, but their lot;</hi> intimating that their future condition should not be honorary, but full of trouble, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, but persecuted.

                  <p>VVELL! However things are now, It was <note place="margin">§. 49. And trusted with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of Secular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</note> otherwise in the Old Religion; for no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was thought too great for them whom God had honourd with so great degrees of approximati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himselfe in power, and authority. But then also they went further. For they thought whom God had intrusted with their soules, they might with an equall confidence trust with their personall actions, and imployments of greatest trust.</p>
                  <p>For it was Great Consideration that they who were <hi>Antistites religionis</hi> the <hi>Doctors,</hi> and great <hi>Dictators</hi> of Faith and conscience, should be the composers of those affayres in whose determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Divine wisdome, and interests of conscience and the authority of religion were the best ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
                  <p>But, it is worth observing how the Church and the Common-wealth did actions contrary to each other, in pursuance of their severall interests. The Common-wealth still enabled <hi>Bishops</hi> to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance of causes, and the confidence of their owne people would be sure to carry them thither where they hop'd for faire issue, upon such good grounds as they might fairely expect from the Bishops abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, authority, and religion; But on the other side, the Church did as much decline them as shee could, and made sanctions against it so farre as shee might without taking from themselves all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:41208:368"/>
both of doing good to their people, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the secular arme to their owne assistance. But this we shall see by consideration of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was not <hi>in Naturâ rei</hi> unlawfull for <hi>Bishops</hi> to receive an office of secular imployment. S. <hi>Paul's</hi> tent-making was as much against the calling of an <hi>Apostle,</hi> as sitting in a secular tribunall is against the office of a <hi>Bishop.</hi> And it is hard, if we will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that to the conveniences of a Republike which must be indulged to a private, personall necessity. But we have not S. <hi>Paul's</hi> example onely, but his rule too, according to Primitive exposition. <hi>[Dare any of you having a matter before another goe to law</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>before the Vnjust, and not before the Saints? If then ye have judgements of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church</hi>] who are they? The Clergy I am sure, now adayes. But S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also thought that to <note place="margin">In hunc locum.</note> be his meaning seriously. Let the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church be the <hi>Iudges.</hi> For by <hi>[least esteemed</hi>] he could not meane the most ignorant of the Laity, they would most certainly have done very strange justice, especially in such causes which they Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not. No, but set them to judge who by their office are Servants, and Ministers of all, and those are the <hi>Clergy</hi> who (as <hi>S. Paul's</hi> expression is) <hi>Preach not themselves, but Iesus to be the Lord, and themselves your servants for Iesus sake. Meliùs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit apud Dei Ministros agere causam.</hi> Yea but S. <hi>Paul's</hi> expression seemes to exclude the Governours
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41208:368"/>
of the Church from intermedling. <hi>[Is there not one wise man among you that is able to Iudge betweene his Brethren?</hi>] Why Brethren, if Bishops and Priests were to be the Iudges, they are Fathers? The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is not worth the noting, but onely for <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his answer to it. <hi>Ideò autem Fratrem Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem eligendum dicit, quià adhuc Rector Ecclesiae illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum non erat ordinatus. S. Paul</hi> us'd the word <hi>[Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>] <hi>for as yet a Bishop was not ordained amongst them of that Church,</hi> intimating that the <hi>Bishop</hi> was <note place="margin">

So that if his secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar imployment be an act of obedience, indeed it is trouble to him, but no sinne. But if he seekes it, for it selfe, it is ambition. In this sense also must the following Canon be understood. <gap reason="foreign">

3.

needs the Churches ayde. * From hence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that all secular imployment did not <hi>hoc ipso</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate a Clergy-man from his necessary office and duty; for some secular imployments are permitted him, <hi>all causes of piety, of charity, all occurrences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the revenues of the Church, and nothing for covetousnesse, but any thing in obedience,</hi> any thing <note place="margin">

All the Collects and Offerings of faithfull people are deposited with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and thence he dispenses for the reliefe of the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and Orphans, thence he provides for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and in one word, he takes care of all indigent, and necessitous people.</hi> So it was in <hi>Iustin Martyrs</hi> time
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:41208:370"/>
and all this, a man would think, requir'd a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion of his time, besides his studies and prayer and preaching.</p>
                  <p>This was also done even in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, for first they had the provision of all the Goods, and persons of the <hi>coenobium,</hi> of the Church at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> This they themselves administred till a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint arose, which might have prov'd a Scandall; then they chose seven men, men full of the holy Ghost; men that were Priests, for they were of the 70 <hi>Disciples</hi> saith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and such men as Preached, and Baptized, so S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and S. <hi>Philip,</hi> therefore to be sure they were Clergy-men, and yet they left their preaching for a time, at least aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the height of the imployment, for therefore the Apostles appointed them, that themselves might not leave the word of God and serve Tables; plainly implying that such men who were to serve these Tables, must leave the Ministery of the word, in some sense or degree, and yet they chose Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and no harme neither, and for a while them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had the imployment. I say there was no harme done, by this temporary office, to their Priestly function and imployment. For to me it is considerable. If the calling of a Presbyter does not take up the whole man, then what inconvenience though his imployment be mixt with secular allay. But if it does take up the whole man, then it is not safe for any Presbyter ever to become a <hi>Bishop,</hi> which is a dignity of a farre greater burden, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more then a Man's all, if all was requir'd to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:41208:371"/>
the function of a Presbyter. But I proceed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Church prohibiting secular imployment to Bishops and Clerks, doe prohibite it, onely <hi>in gradu impedimenti officii Clericalis;</hi> and therefore when the offices are supplyed by any of the Order, it is never prohibited but that the personall abilities of any man may be imployed for the fairest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages either of Church, or Common-wealth. And therefore it is observeable that the Canons provide that the Church be not destitute, not that such a particular Clerke should there officiate. Thus the Councell of <hi>Arles</hi> decreed, <hi>ut Presbyteri</hi> SICUT HACTENUS FACTUM EST, INDISCRETE <hi>per di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

That it had been usuall to send Priests on Embassyes <hi>[sicut hactenus factum est</hi>] 2. The Canon forbids the <hi>indiscreet</hi> or <hi>promiscuous</hi> doing of it; not that men of great ability &amp; choyce be not imployed, but that there be discretion, or discerning in the choyce of the men. <hi>viz.</hi> that such men be chosen whose particular worth did by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the legation, make compensation for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from their Churches; and then I am sure there was no indiscretion in the Embassy, <hi>quoad hoc</hi> at least; for the ordinary offices of the Church might be dispensed by men of even abilities, but the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary affaires of both states require men of an heightned apprehension. 3. The Canon only took care that the cùre of the soules of a Parish be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquished,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:41208:371"/>
for so is the title of the <hi>Canon, Ne Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri causâ legationis per diversa mittantur loca, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ animarum relictâ.</hi> But then if the cure be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by delegation, the feares of the Canon are prevented.</p>
                  <p>* In pursuance of this consideration the Church forbad Clergy-men to receive honour, or secular preferment; and so it is expressed where the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is made. It is in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon. Qui semel in clero deputati sunt, aut Monachorum</hi>

The case of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish, and cleare this businesse. <hi>Ecce reliquimus omnia,</hi> was the profession of their Clericall office.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:41208:372"/>
S. <hi>Matthew</hi> could not returne to his trade of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican at all, for that would have taken him from his Apostolate. But S. <hi>Peter</hi> might and did returne to his nets, for all his <hi>reliqui omnia.</hi> Plainly telling us that a SECULAR CALLING, a CONTINUED FIX'D ATTENDANCE on a businesse of the world is an impediment to the Clericall office, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, but not a temporary imployment or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Canons of the Church doe as much for bid the cares of houshold, as the cares of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like imployment to Bishops. So the fourth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Carthage</hi> decrees. <hi>Vt Episcopus nullam rei fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaris curam adserevocet, sed lectioni, &amp; orationi,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; verbi Dei praedicationi tantummodò vacet.</hi> Now if this Canon be confronted with that saying of S. <hi>Paul [He that provides not for them of his own hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold is worse then an infidell</hi>] it will easily informe us of the Churches intention. For they must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> But yet so provide as not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their imployment, or else they transgresse the Canon of the Councell; but this caveat may be as well entred, and observed in things Politicall, as Oeconomicall.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre we have seene what the Church hath done in pursuance of her owne interest, and that was that she might with sanctity, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, tend her Grand imployment; but yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cases did occurre in which she did canonically permitt an alienation of imployment, and revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some persons from an assiduity of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:41208:372"/>
attendance, as in the case of the seven set over the widdowes, and of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the <hi>Apostles</hi> and the <hi>Canon of Chalcedon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us see how the Common-wealth also pursued her interest, and because shee found <hi>Bishops</hi> men of Religion and great trust, and confident abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, there was no reason that the Common-wealth should be disserv'd in the promotion of able men to a <hi>Bishops throne.</hi> * Who would have made recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to the Emperour for depriving him of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> his prefect, if Episcopall promotion had made him incapable of serving his Prince in any great Negotiation? It was a remarkeable passage in <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>

                     </gap>. <hi>As our Lord is to be observ'd so also must we observe the</hi> BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOP, <hi>because he assists and serves the Lord. And wisemen, and of great vnderstanding must</hi> SERVE KINGS, <hi>for he must not be serv'd with men of small parts.</hi> Here either <hi>Ignatius</hi> commends Bishops to the service of Kings, or else propounds them as the fittest men in the world to doe them service. For if onely men of great abilities are fit to serve Kings, surely as great abilities are required to inable a man for the service of God in so peculiar manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximation. He then that is fit to be a <hi>Bishop,</hi> is most certainly fit for the service of his King. This is the sence of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his discourse.</p>
                  <p>For consider. Christianity might be suspected for a designe; and if the Church should choose the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:41208:373"/>
best, and most pregnant Understandings for her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and then these men become incapable of ayding the Republike, the promotion of these men, would be an injury to those Princes whose affayres would need support. * The interest of the Subjects also is considerable. For we find by experience, that no authority is so full of regiment, and will so finely force obedience, as that which is seated in the Conscience; And therefore <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> made his lawes, and imposed them with a face of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous solemnity. For the people are stronger then any one Governour, and were they not awed by Religion, would quickly <hi>miscere Sacra prophanis,</hi> jumble heaven and earth into a miscellany, and therefore not onely in the Sanction of lawes, but in the execution of them, the <hi>Antistites religionis</hi> are the most competent instruments; and this was not onely in all religions that ever were, and in ours ever till now, but even now we should quickly find it, were but our <hi>Bishops</hi> in that Veneration, and esteeme that by the law of God they ought, and that actually they were in the Calenture of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive devotion, and that the Doctors of Religion were ever even amongst the most barbarous and untaught Pagans.</p>
                  <p>Upon the confidence of these advantages, both the Emperours themselves when they first became Christian allowed appeales from secular tribunalls to the * <hi>Bishops</hi> Consistory, even in causes of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sozom. lib. cap.</hi> 9.</note> interest, and the people would choose to have their difficulties there ended whence they expected
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41208:373"/>
the issues of justice, and religion. * I say this was done as soone as ever the Emperours were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Before this time, <hi>Bishops,</hi> and Priests (to be sure) could not be imployed in state affayres, they were odious for their Christianity; and then no wonder if the Church forbad secular imployment in meaner offices, the attendance on which could by no meanes make recompense for the least avocation of them from their Church imployment. So that it was not onely the avocation but the sordidnesse of the imployment that was prohibited the Clergy in the Constitutions of holy Church. But as soone as ever their imployment might be such as to make compensation for a temporary secession, neither Church nor State did then prohibite it; And that was as soone as ever the Princes were Christian, for then immediately the <hi>Bishops</hi> were imployed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary negotiations. It was evident in the case of S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> For the Church of <hi>Millaine</hi> had him for their <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the Emperour had him one of his prefects, and the people their judge in causes of secular cognisance. For when he was chosen Bishop the Emperour who was present at the election cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Gratias tibi ago Domine ... quoniam huic viro ego quidem commisi corpora; tu autem animas,</hi>

The Church might not be ambitious, or indagative of such imployment. 3. The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e's interest abstractly considered was not promoted by such imployment, but where there was no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of compensation was interrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd. 4. The Church (though in some cases shee was allowed to make secession, yet) might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish her owne charge, to intervene in anothers ayd. 5. The Church did by no meanes suffer her Clerks, to undertake any low secular imployment, much more did shee forbid all sordid ends, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous designes. 6. The Bishop, or his Clerks might ever do any action of piety, though of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar burden. Clerks were never forbidden to reade Grammer, or Philosophy to youth, to be Masters of Schooles, of Hospitalls, they might reconcile their Neighbours that were falne out, about a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall trespasse, or reall action, and yet since now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes a Clergy-man's imployment and capacity is bounded within his Pulpit, or reading deske, or his study of Divinity at most, these that I have reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned are as verily secular as any thing, and yet no law of Christendome ever prohibited any of these
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41208:375"/>
or any of the like Nature to the Clergy, nor any thing that is ingenuous, that is fit for a Scholler, that requires either finenesse of parts, or great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or overruling authority, or exemplary piety. 7. Clergy-men might do any thing that was imposed on them by their Superiours. 8. The Bishops, and Priests were men of Great ability and surest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for determinations of Iustice, in which, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ever the strongest binder. And therefore the Princes and People sometimes forc'd the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops from their owne interest to serve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, &amp; in it they serv'd themselves directly, and by consequence too, the Church had not only a sustentation from the secular arme, but an addition of honour, and secular advantages, and all this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by precedent of Scripture, and the practice of the Primitive Church, and particularly of men whom all succeeding ages have put into the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Saints. * So that it would be considered, that all this while, it is the kings interest, and the Peoples that is pleaded, when we assert a capacity to the <hi>Bishops</hi> to undertake charges of publike trust.

which though perhaps they doe not alwaies fall out, yet these things may in expectation of reason be look'd for from the Clergy, their principles and calling promises all this, <hi>&amp; quia in Ecclesiâ magis lex est, ubi Dominus legis timetur, meliùs dicit apud Dei Ministros agere causam.

                  <p>And now we are easily driven into an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of that saying of S. <hi>Paul [No man that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2. 4.</note>

And such things must be par'd away from the frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Laity, as well as the long robe of the Clergy. But if we should consider how little we have now left for the imployment of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> I am afraid a <hi>Bishop</hi> would scarce seem to be a necessary function, so farre would it be from being hindered by the collaterall intervening of a Lay-judicature. I need not instance in any particulars; for if the judging matters and questions of religion be not left alone to them, they may well be put into atem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41208:377"/>
imployment, to preserve them from suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of doing nothing.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with this; only intreating this to be considered. Is not the King <hi>fons utrius<expan>

But if so, then why may not the King as well make <hi>Clergy-Iudges,</hi> as <hi>Lay-Delegates?</hi> For (to be sure) if there be an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in the Clergy of medling with secular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, there is the same at least in the Laity of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Church affaires. For if the Clergy be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the affaires of the World, then the Laity are under the affaires of the Church; or else, if the Clergy beincapable of Lay-businesse, because it is of a different and disparate nature from the Church, does not the same argument exclude the Laity from intervening in Church affaires? For the Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no more from the common-wealth, then the common-wealth differs from the Church. And now after all this, suppose a King should command a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> to goe on Embassy to a forraine Prince, <hi>to be a Commissioner in a treaty of pacification,</hi> if the <hi>Bishop</hi> refuse, did he doe the duty of a Subject?

But if no, then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was tyed to goe, and then the calling makes him no way incapable of such imployment, for no man can be bound to doe a sinne.</p>

BUt then did not this imployment, when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions <note place="margin">§. 50. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were inforced to delegate their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and put others in substituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> were great, and extraordinary, force the <hi>Bishops</hi> to a temporary absence? And what remedy was there for that? For the Church is not to be left destitute, that's agreed on by all the <hi>Canons.</hi> They must not be like the <hi>Sicilian Bishops</hi> whom <hi>Petrus Blesensis</hi> complains of, that attended the Court, and never visited their Churches, or took care either of the cure of soules, or of the Church possessions. What then must be done? The <hi>Bishops</hi> in such cases may give delegation of their power, and offices to others, though now adaies they are complain'd of for their care. I say, for their care; For if they may intervene in secular affaires, they may sometimes be absent, and then they must delegate their power, or leave the Church without a Curate. *** But for this matter the account need not be long. For since I have proved that the whole Diocesse is <hi>in curâ Episcopali,</hi> and for all of it, he is responsive to God Almighty, and yet, that instant necessity and the publike act of Christendome hath ratified it, that Bishops have delegated to Presbyters so many parts of the Bishops charge as there are parishes in his Diocesse, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is pretended for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of Episcopall charge, is no lesse then the act of all Christendome. For it is evident at first, Presbyters had no distinct cure at all, but were in common assistant to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and were his emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries for the gaining soules in Citty, or Suburbs; But when the <hi>Bishops</hi> divided parishes, and fixt the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41208:378"/>
Presbyters upon a cure, so many Parishes as they distinguished, so many delegations they made; And these we all believe to be good both in law, and conscience. For the <hi>Bishop per omnes divinos ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes propriae hierarchiae exercet mysteria</hi> (saith S. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>* But besides this grand act of the <hi>Bishops</hi> first, and then of all Christendome in consent, we have faire precedent in S. <hi>Paul;</hi> for he made delegation of a power to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the incestuous person. It was a plain delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he commanded them to doe it, and gave them his <hi>own spirit,</hi> that is, his <hi>own authority;</hi> and indeed without it, I scarce find how the delinquent should have been delivered over to Satan in the sense of the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Church, that is, <hi>to be buffeted,</hi> for that was a miraculous appendix of power Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                  <p>* When S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent for <hi>Timothy</hi> from <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> he sent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to be his <hi>Vicar. [Doethy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>

for he was most certainly non-resident.</p>
                  <p>* Thus also we find that <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> did dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his power to the Presbyters in his voyage to his <hi>Martyrdome. Presbyteri pascite gregem qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                  <p>* But this is; That in this Question of <hi>lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> the Moderne <hi>Aërians</hi> and <hi>Acephali</hi> doe wholly mistake their own advantages. For whatsoever they object out of antiquity for the white, and watry colours of lay-Elders is either a very misprision of their allegations, or else clearly abused in the use of them.

                  <p>I am only to cleare this pretence from a place of Scripture totally misunderstood, and then it cannot have any colour from any <gap reason="foreign">

Here are two sorts of Elders, Preaching Ministers, and Elders not Preachers. Therefore <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> and yet all are governours.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But why therefore <hi>Lay-Elders?</hi> Why may there not be diverse Church-officers, and yet but one, or two of them the Preacher? <hi>[Christ sent me not to Baptize but to Preach</hi>] saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet the commission of <hi>[baptizate</hi>] was as large as <hi>[praedicate</hi>] and why then might not another say,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:41208:382"/>
Christ sent me not to <hi>Preach,</hi> but to <hi>Baptize,</hi> that is, in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, not so much to doe one, as to doe the other, and if he left the ordinary ministration of Baptisme, and betook himselfe to the ordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Preaching, then to be sure, some Minister must be the ordinary Baptizer, and so, not the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, for if he might be both ordinarily, why was not S. <hi>Paul</hi> both? For though their power was common to all of the same order, yet the execution and dispensation of the Ministeries was according to severall gifts, and that of Prophecy, or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not dispensed to all in so considerable a measure, but that some of them might be destin'd to the ordinary execution of other offices, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the guift of Prophecy was the greatest, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was the office, and therefore the sense of the words is this, <hi>that all Presbyters must be honour'd, but especially they that Prophecy, doing that office with an ordinary execution and ministery.</hi> So no Lay-Elders yet. Adde to this, that it is also plain that all the Clergy did not Preach. <hi>Valerius Bishop of Hippo</hi> could not well skill in the Latine tongue being a Greek borne, and yet a Godly <hi>Bishop,</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> his Presbyter preach'd for him. The same case might occurre in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. For then was a concurse of all Nations to the Christian <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxes,</hi> especially in all great Imperiall Citties, and <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> as <hi>Rome, Antioch, Ierusalem, Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> and the like. Now all could not speak with tongues, neither could all Prophecy, they were particular guifts given severally, to severall men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:41208:382"/>
to minister in Church-offices. Some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed, some interpreted; and therefore is is an ignorant fancy to think that he must needs be a Laick, whosoever in the ages <hi>Apostolicall</hi> was not a Preacher.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None of the Fathers ever expounded this place of <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> so that we have a traditive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it in prejudice to the pretence of our new office.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is never used in the new Testament for a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> if a Church officer be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. If it be said, it is used so here, that's the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and must not be brought to prove it selfe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Presbyter</hi> that is here spoken of must be maintain'd by Ecclesiasticall revenue, for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds <hi>[honour</hi>] in the next verse. <hi>Presbyters that rule well must be honoured &amp;c. For it is written, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne.</hi> But now, the Patrons of this new devise are not so greedy of their <hi>Lay-Bishops</hi> as to be at charges with them, they will rather let them stand alone on their own rotten leggs, and so perish, then fixe him upon this place with their hands in their purses. But it had been most fitting for them to have kept him, being he is of their own begetting.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This place speaks not of divers persons, but divers parts of the Pastorall office, <gap reason="foreign">

honour, especially them that disregarding their own private, aime at the publike good. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not two sorts of Counsellors, but two parts of a Counsellors worth, and quality. Iudges that doe righteousnesse are worthy of double honour, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they right the cause of Orphans, and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and yet there are no righteous judges that refuse to doe both.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All Ministers of H. Church did not preach, at least not frequently. The seven that were <gap reason="foreign">

For labouring in the word does not signify, only making Homilies or exhortations to the people, but whether it be by word, or writing, or travelling from place to place, still, the greater the sedulity of the person is, and difficulty of the labour, the greater increment of honour is to be given him. So that here is no Lay-Elders; for all the Presbyters S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, are to be honoured, but especially those who take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary pains in propagating the Gospell. For though all preach, (suppose that) yet all doe not <gap reason="foreign">

And so it is likely S. <hi>Paul</hi> here means. Honour the good Presbyters, but especially them that travell for disseminating the Gospell. And the word is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so used in Scripture. S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

Not that S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached more then all the Apostles, for most certainly, they made it their businesse as well as he. But he travelled further and more then they all for the spreading it.

                     </gap> is the word for them too. So it is said of <hi>Persis,</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> of <hi>Tryphaena,</hi> of <hi>Triphosa.</hi> And <note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> since these women were <gap reason="foreign">

8. Since it is pretended by themselves in the Question of Episcopacy, that Presbyter, and Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus is all one, and this very thing confidently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded in defiance of Episcopacy, why may not <hi>Presbyteri</hi> in this place signify <hi>[Bishops?</hi>] And then either this must be <hi>Lay-Bishops</hi> as well as <hi>Lay-Presbyters</hi> or else this place is to none of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If both these offices of RULING and PREACHING may be conjunct in one person, then there is no necessity of distinguishing the Officers by the severall imployments, since one man may doe both. But if these offices cannot be conjunct, then no <hi>Bishops</hi> must preach, nor no preachers be of the Consistory (take which government you list) for if they be, then the offices being united in one person, the inference of the distinct officer, the <hi>Lay-Elder,</hi> is impertinent. For the meaning of S. <hi>Paul</hi> would be nothing but this. All Church-Rulers must be honour'd, Especially for their preaching. For if the offices may be united in one person (as it is evident they may) then this may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the other, and only be a vitall part and of peculiar excellency. And indeed so it is, according to the exposition of S. <hi>Chrysostome, and Primasius,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>They rule well, that spare nothing for the care of the flock.</hi> So that this is the generall charge, and preaching is the particular. For the work in generall they are to receive double honour, but this of preaching, as then preaching was, had a
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:41208:384"/>
particular excellency, and a plastick power to forme men into Christianity, especially it being then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested with miracles.</p>
                  <p>But the new office of a <hi>Lay-Elder,</hi> I confesse I cannot comprehend in any reasonable proportion, his person, his quality, his office, his authority, his subordination, his commission hath made so many divisions and new emergent Questions: and they, none of them all asserted either by Scripture or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that if I had a mind to leave the way of God and of the Catholick Church, and runne in pursuit of this meteor, I might quickly be amused, but should find nothing certain but a certainty of being misguided. Therefore if not for conscience sake, yet for prudence, <hi>bonum est esse hic,</hi> it is good to remaine in the fold of Christ, under the guard, and supravision of those sheapheards Christ hath appointed, and which his sheep have alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                  <p>For I consider this one thing to be enough to determine the Question. <hi>[My sheep</hi> (saith our blessed Saviour) <hi>heare my voice, if a stranger, or a thiefe come, him they will not heare</hi>] Clea ly thus. That Christ's sheep heare not the voice of a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor will they follow him, and therefore those sheapheards whom the Church hath followed in all ages, are no strangers, but Sheapheards or Pastors of Christs appointing, or else Christ hath had no sheep; for if he hath, then Bishops are the sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, for them they have ever followed.

                  <opener>May it please your GRACE,</opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was obedience to my <hi>Superiour</hi> that ingaged me upon this last Anniversary commemoration of the great Goodnesse of God Almighty to our King and Country in the discouery of the most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb facs="tcp:41208:388"/>
                     <hi>Powder-Treason.</hi> It was a blessing which no tongue could expresse, much lesse mine, which had scarce learn'd to speake, at least, was most unfit to speake in the Schooles of the Prophets. <hi>Delicata autem est illao bedientia quae causas quaerit.</hi> It had beene no good argument of my obedience to have disputed the inconvenience of my person, and the unaptnesse of my parts for such an imployment. I knew God, out of the mouth of Infants, could acquire his praise, and if my heart were actually as <hi>Uotive</hi> as my tongue should have beene, it might bee one of Gods <hi>Magnalia</hi> to perfect his owne praise out of the weaknesse and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Organ. So as I was able, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to performe it, having my obedience ever ready for my excuse to men, and my willingnesse to performe my duty, for the assoylment of my selfe before God; part of which I hope was accepted, and I have no reason to thinke, that the other was not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
                  <p>When I first thought of the Barbarisme
<pb facs="tcp:41208:388"/>
of this Treason, I wondred not so much at the thing it selfe as by what meanes it was possible for the Divell to gaine so strong a party in mens resolutions, as to move them to undertake a businesse so abhorring from Christianity, so evidently full of extreame danger to their lives, and so certainly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the highest wrath of God Almighty. My thoughts were thus rude at first; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a strict inquisition I fond it was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as a businesse (perhaps full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their bodies, but) advantagious to their soules, consonant to the obligation of all Christians, and meritorious of an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weight of Glory, for now it was come to passe which our dear Master foretold, <hi>men should kill us, and thinke they did God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in it.</hi> I could not thinke this to be a part of any mans religion, nor doe I yet believe it. For it is so apparently destructive of our deare Master his Royall lawes of <hi>Charity</hi> &amp; <hi>Obedience,</hi> that I must not be so uncharitable as to thinke they speake their owne minde truly, when they professe their beliefe of
<pb facs="tcp:41208:389"/>
the lawfullnesse and necessity in some cases of rebelling against their lawfull Prince, and using all meanes to throw him from his kingdome, though it be by taking of his life. But it is but iust that they who breake the bonds of duty to their Prince, should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise forfeit the lawes of charity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and if they say not true, yet to bee more uncharitable to their owne persons, then I durst be, though I had their own war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Briefly (Most R. Father) I found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them of the Roman party such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing opinions, as could not consist with loyalty to their Prince, in case hee were not the Popes subiect, and these so generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and somewhere obtruded under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of their soules, that I could not but point at these dangerous rocks, at which I doubt not, but the loyalty of many hath suffered shipwrack, and of thousands more might, if a higher <hi>Starre</hi> had not guided them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then their owne Pilots.</p>
                  <p>I could not therefore but thinke it very likely that this Treason might spring from
<pb facs="tcp:41208:389"/>
the same Fountaine, and I had concluded so in my first meditations, but that I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to consider, whether or no it might not bee that these men were rather exasperated then perswaded, and whether it were not that the severity of our lawes against them might rather provoke their intemperate zeal, then religion thus move their setled consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It was a materiall consideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they ever did and still doe fill the world with outcries against our lawes for making a rape upon their consciences, have printed Catalogues of their English Martyrs, drawn Schemes of most strange tortures imposed on their Priests, such as were unimaginable, by <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> or any of the worst and cruellest enemies of Christianity, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring thus to make us partly guilty of our owne ruine, and so washing their hands in token of their owne innocency, even then when they were dipping them in the blood Royall, and would have emptyed the best veynes in the whole Kingdome to fill their <hi>Lavatory.</hi> But I found all these to be
<pb facs="tcp:41208:390"/>
but Calumnies, strong accusations upon weake presumptions, and that the cause did rest where I had begun, I meane, upon the pretence of the <hi>Catholique cause,</hi> and that the imagin'd iniquity of the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> could not be made a vaile to cover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of their intentions, for our Lawes were just, Honourable, and Religious.</p>
                  <p>Concerning these and some other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices to the businesse of the day; I expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some part of my thoughts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause happily they were but a just truth, and this truth not unseasonable for these last times, in which (as S. Paul prophecyed) <hi>men would be fierce, Traytors, heady, and high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, creeping into houses, leading silly women captive,</hi> it pleased some who had power to command me, to wish me to a publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these my short and sudden meditations, that (if it were possible) even this way I might expresse my duty to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus farre encouraged, I resolved to goe something further, even to the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a dedication to your <hi>Grace,</hi> that since
<pb facs="tcp:41208:390"/>
I had no merit of my own to move me to the confidence of a publike view, yet I might dare to venture under the protection of your <hi>Graces</hi> favour. But since my boldnesse doth as much neede a defence, as my Sermon a Patronage, I humbly crave leave to say, that though it be boldnesse, even to presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet my addresse to your <hi>Grace</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>For since all know that your <hi>Grace</hi> thinks not your life your owne, but when it spends it selfe in the service of your <hi>King,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your great endeavours against the ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots of both sides who labour the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church and State, I could not think it <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Grace</hi> to whom under God and the King we owe the Blessing and Prosperity of all our Studies. Nor yet can I choose but hope, that my Great Obligations to your <hi>Grace's</hi> Favour may plead my pardon, (since it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that my Gratitude should be bold, then my diffidence ingratefull) but that this is so farre from expressing the least part of them, that it layes a greater bond upon me, either for a debt of delinquency in presenting it, or of thankfulnesse, if your <hi>Grace</hi> may please to pardon it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not need to strain much to bring my Text and the day together, Here is fire in the text, consuming fire, like that whose <hi>Antevorta</hi> we doe this day commemorate.

I would say the paralell holds thus farre, but that the persons of my Text, however <hi>Boanerges,</hi> sonnes of thunder and of a reproveable spirit, yet are no way considerable in the proportion of malice with the persons of the day. For if I consider the cause that mov'd <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to so inconsiderate a wrath, it beares a fair excuse: The men of <hi>Samaria</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verse 53.</note> turn'd their Lord and Master out of doores, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give a nights lodging to the Lord of Heaven and Earth. It would have disturbed an excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to see him, whom but just before they beheld trans figured, and in a glorious Epiphany upon the Mount, to be so neglected by a company of hated <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as to be fore'd to keep his vigils where nothing but the welkin should have been his roofe, not any thing to shelter his precious head from the descending dew of heaven.<hi>—Quis talia fando Temperet?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It had been the greater wonder if they had not been angry. But now if we should levell our progresse by the same line and guesse that in the present affaire there was an equall cause, because a greater fire was intended, wee shall too much betray the ingenuity of apparent truth, and the blessing of this <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</hi> They had not halfe such a case for an excuse to a farre greater malice; it will prove they had none at all, and therefore their malice was somuch the more malicious because causelesse and totally inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.</p>
                  <p>However, I shall endeavour to joyne their consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41208:392"/>
in as neere a paralell as I can; which if it be not exact (as certainly it cannot, where we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discovered so much difference in degrees of malice,) yet by laying them together we may better take their estimate, though it be only by seeing their disproportion.</p>
                  <p>The words as they lay in their own order, point out, 1. The persons that ask't the question. 2. The cause that mov'd them. 3. The person to whom they propounded it; 4. The Question it selfe. 5. And the precedent they urg'd to move a grant, drawn from a very fallible Topick, a singular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in a speciall and different case. The persons here were Christs Disciples; and so they are in our case, design'd to us by that glorious Sir-name of <hi>Christianity:</hi> they will be called Catholiques, but if our discovery perhaps rise higher, and that the See Apostolique prove sometimes guilty of so reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a spirit, then we are very neer to a paralell of the persons, for they were Disciples of Christ, &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. 2. The cause was the denying of toleration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode upon the grudge of an old schisme, Religion was made the instrument. That which should have taught the Apostles to be charitable, and the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> hospitable, was made a pretence to justify the unhospitablenesse of the one and the uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other. Thus farre we are right, for the malice of this present Treason, stood upon the same base. 3. Although neither Side much doubted of the lawfulnesse of their proceedings; yet S. <hi>Iames</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41208:393"/>
and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> were so discreet as not to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves infallible, therefore they ask'd their Lord: so did the persons of the day, aske the question too, but not of Christ, for he was not in all their thoughts; but yet they ask'd of Christs Delegates, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should have given their answer <hi>ex eodem tripode,</hi> from the same spirit. They were the Fathers <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi> who were ask'd. 4. The question is of both sides concerning a consumptive sacrifice, the destruction of a Towne there, of a whole Kingdome here, but differing in the circumstance of place whence they would fetch their fire. The Apostles would have had it from Heaven, but these men's conversation was not there. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, things from beneath, from an artificiall hell, but breath'd from the naturall and proper, were in all their thoughts. 5. The example, which is the last particular, I feare I must leave quite out, and when you have considered all, perhaps you will look for no example.</p>
                  <p>First of the persons; they were Disciples of Christ and Apostles. <hi>[But when</hi> Iames <hi>and</hi> Iohn <hi>saw this,</hi>] When first I considered they were Apostles, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered they should be so intemperatly angry; but when I perceived they were so angry, I wondred not that they sinned. Not the priviledge of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall spirit, not the nature of Angels, not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of immortality can guard from the danger of sinne, but if we be overrul'd by passion, we almost subject our selves to its necessity. It was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without reason altogether, that the Stoicks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41208:393"/>
wisemen to be void of passions, for sure I am, the inordination of any passion is the first step to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And although of them, as of waters of a muddy residence wee may make good use, and quench our thirst, if wee doe not trouble them, yet upon any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle disturbance we drinke down mud in stead of a cleere streame, and the issues of sinne and sorrow, certaine consequents of temerarious or inordinate anger. And therefore when the Apostle had given us leave to <hi>be angry,</hi> as knowing the condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, hee quickly enters a <hi>Caveat</hi> that <hi>we sinne not;</hi> hee knew sinne was very likely to be hand-maid where <hi>Anger</hi> did domineer, and this was the reason why <hi>S. Iames</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> are the men here pointed at, for the Scripture notes them for <hi>Boanerges,</hi> sonnes of thunder, men of an angry temper, <hi>&amp; quid mirum est filios tonitrui fulgurâsse voluisse?</hi> said S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> But there was more in it then thus. Their spirits of themselves hot enough, yet met with their education under the Law, (whose first tradition was in fire and thunder, whose precepts were just but not so mercifull;) and this inflam'd their distemper to the height of a revenge. It is the Doctrine of S. <note n="a" place="margin">Epist. ad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas.</note> 
                     <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">in Lucam.</note> 
                     <hi>Titus Bostrensis;</hi> The Law had beene their Schoole-master, and taught them the rules of justice both Punitive and <hi>Vindictive:</hi> But Christ was the first that taught it to be a sinne to retaliate evill with evill, it was a Doctrine they could not read in the killing letter of the Law. There they might meete with precedents of revenge and anger of a high se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41208:394"/>
                     <hi>an eye for an eye,</hi> and <hi>a tooth for atooth,</hi> and <hi>let him be cut off from his people:</hi> But forgiving injuries, praying for our persecutors, loving our enemies, and relieving them, were Doctrines of such high and absolute integrity, as were to be reserved for the best and most perfect <hi>Law-giver,</hi> the bringer of the best promises, to which the most perfect actions have the best proportion; and this was to be when <hi>Shiloh</hi> came. Now then the spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> is out of date,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>—I am ferrea primum</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>And therefore our blessed Master reproveth them of ignorance, not of the Law, but of his spirit, which had they but known or could but have guessed at the end of his comming, they had not been such <hi>Abecedarij</hi> in the Schoole of <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now we shall not need to look farre for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Disciples professing at least in Christs schoole, yet as great strangers to the mercifull spirit of our Saviour, as if they had been sonnes of the Law, or foster-brothers to <hi>Romulus</hi> and suck't a wolse, and they are <hi>Romanists</hi> too; this daies solemnity presents them to us, <gap reason="foreign">

This Doctrine, although<hi>—Titulo res digna sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri—</hi>yet is nothing if compared with <hi>Mariana.</hi> For 1. he affirms the same Doctrine in substance. 2.

Lastly, this may be done, not only if the Pope judge the King a Tyrant (which was the utmost <hi>Emanuel Sà</hi> affitm'd) but it is sufficient proofe of his being a Tyrant if lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, though but few, and those seditious too doe but murmure it, or beginne to call him so. I <note place="margin">Postquam ae paucis seditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, sed doctis caeperit Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari.</note> hope this Doctrine was long since disclaim'd by the whole Society, and condemned <hi>ad umbras A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherunticas.</hi> Perhaps so, but yet these men who use to object to us an infinity of divisions among our selves, who boast so much of their owne Vnion and consonancy in judgment, with whom nothing is more ordinary then to maintaine some opinions quite throughout their Order (as if they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by some common <hi>Intellectus agens)</hi> should not be divided in a matter of so great moment, so much concerning the Monarchy of the <hi>See Apostolike,</hi> to which they are vowed leigemen.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41208:396"/>
is the greatnesse of this probability. For 1. There was an <hi>Apology</hi> printed in <hi>Italy, permissu superiorum,</hi> in the yeare 1610. that sayes, <hi>They were all enemies of that holy Name of Iesus that condemned Mariana for any such Doctrine.</hi> I understand not why, but sure I am that the <hi>Iesuits</hi> doe or did thinke his Doctrine innocent: for in their <hi>Apology</hi> put forth in the name of the whole Society against the accusations of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoton,</hi> they deny that the Assasine of <hi>Henry</hi> 4.

                  <p>What negligence is sufficient that such a Doctrine as this should passe so great supravisors, if in their hearts they disavow it? The children of this world are not such fooles in their generations. The Fathers of the Society cannot but know how apt these things of themselves are to publike mischiefe, how invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the Christian world, how scandalous to their Order; and yet they rather excuse then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Mariana:</hi> speaking of him at the hardest but very gently, as if his only fault had beene his spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a truth <hi>in tempore non opportuno,</hi> something out of season, or as if they were forc'd to yeelde to the current of the times, and durst not professe openly of what in their hearts they were perswaded: I speak of some of them, for others you see are of the same opinion. But I would faine learne why they are so sedulous and carefull to procure the decrees of the <hi>Rector &amp; Deputies</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> Rescripts of the Bishop, Revocation of Arrest of the Parliament which had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41208:397"/>
been against them, and all to acquit the Fathers of the Society from these scandalous opinions; as if these laborious devices could make what they have said and done, to be unspoken and undone, or could change their opinions from what indeed they are, whereas they never went <hi>ex animo</hi> to refute these Theorems, never spake against them in the reall and serious dialect of an adversary, never condemned them as hereticall, but what they have done they have been sham'd to, or forc'd upon, as <hi>Pere Coton</hi> by the King of France, and <hi>Servin</hi> to a confutation of <hi>Mariana,</hi> (from which he desir'd to be excused, and after the Kings death, writ his declaratory letter to no purpose;) the <hi>Apologists</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes of Christendome against them; and when it is done, done so coldly in their reprehensions with a greater readinesse to excuse all, then condemne any, I say these things to a considering man doe increase the suspicion if at least that may be called suspicion for which we have had so plain testimonies of their own.</p>

If the Disciples of Christ, if Apostles, if the <hi>See Apostolique,</hi> if the fathers <hi>Confessors</hi> prove <hi>Boutefeu's</hi> and Incendiaries, I'le no more wonder if the people call for fire to consume us, but rather wonder if they doe not.

                  <p>This hath beene the constant attestation of our Princes and State since the first Lawes made against <hi>Recusants</hi> &amp; the thing it selfe will bear them record.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>primo</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>undecimo,</hi> the Papists made no scruple of comming to our Churches, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusancy was not then so much as a Chrysome, not an <hi>Embrio.</hi> But when <hi>Pius quintus</hi> sent forth his <hi>Breves</hi> of Excommunication and Deposition of the Queen, then first they forbore to pray with us, or to have any religious communion. This although eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where knowne, yet being a matter of fact and so as likely to be denied by others as affirmed by us
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41208:402"/>
without good evidence, see it therefore affirmed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly by an Act of Parliament in <hi>Decimo tertio</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which specifies this as one inconvenience and ill consequence of the <hi>Bull. [Whereby hath grown great disobedience and boldnesse in many, not only to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and absent themselves from divine service, now most Godly set forth and used within this Realme, but also have thought themselves discharged of all obedience &amp;c.</hi>] Not only Recusancy, but like wise disobedience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both Recusancy and disobedience.</p>
                  <p>Two yeares therefore after this <hi>Bull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> this Statute was made if it was possible to nullify the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, to hinder its execution, and if it might be, by this meanes to keep them, as they had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and obedience to her Majesty. This was the first Statute that concerned them in speciall, but yet their Religion was not medled with; For this Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst execution of the Popes <hi>Bulls</hi> was no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what had been established by Act of Parliament, in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, by which it was made <hi>praemunire</hi> to purchase <hi>Bulls</hi> from Rome, and the delinquents in this kinde with all their <hi>[abettors, fautors, procurators, and maintainers to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Kings Councell for farther punishment.</hi>] There was indeed this severity expressed in the Act of 130 of the Queene, that the putting them in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be Capitall; and yet this severity was no more then what was inflicted upon the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, for publishing of a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41208:403"/>
                     <hi>Bull</hi> against the Earle of <hi>Chester</hi> without the Kings leave, and on the Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, for the like offence. Thus farre our Lawes are innocent.</p>
                  <p>But when this Statute did not take the good effect for which it was intended, neither keeping them in their ancient Communion not obedience, but for all this, <hi>Mayne, Campian,</hi> and many others, came as the Popes Emissaries for execution of the Bull, the State proceeded to a farther severity, making Lawes against Recusancy, against Seditious and Trayterous Bookes, and against the residence of Romish Priests in <hi>England,</hi> making the first fineable with a pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mulct, the two later, Capitall, as being made of a Treasonable nature. Of these in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The mulct which was imposed for Recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was not soul mony, or paid for Religion; and that for these reasons. 1. Because it is plaine Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not make them absent themselves from our Churches, unlesse they had changed their Religion since the Bull came over. For if Religion could consist with their Communion with us before the Bull (as it's plain it did) then why not after the Bull, unlesse it be part of their Religion to obey the Pope, rather then to obey God commanding us to obey our Prince? 2. Their Recusancy was an apparent mischiefe to our Kingdome, and it was the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diversion of this that was the only or speciall and of these Lawes.</p>
                  <p>The mischiefe is apparent these two waies. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41208:403"/>
by their Recusancy they gave attestation that they held the Bull to be valid; for else why should they after the Bull deny their Communion, which before they did not? Either they must think the Queen for a just cause, and by a just power excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or why did they separate from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Now if the Queen by vertue of the Bull was excommunicate, why should they stop here? She was by the same deposed, they absolved from all Allegeance to her, and commanded to take arms against her. I confesse it is no good argument of it selfe, to say, The Pope might excommunicate the Queen, therefore depose her from her Kingdome; But this concludes with them sufficiently, with whom excommunication not only drives from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls, but deprives of Temporalls, and is not to mend our lives but to take them away; I speak how it is in the case of Princes, (and I shall anon prove it) for they being publike persons from whose Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more may be gotten, are like to suffer more, <hi>ui ex tunc ipse (Pontifex) vasallos ab ejus fidelitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiet absolutos, &amp; terram exponat Catholic is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandam,</hi> as they are taught by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in the eight <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell: such is their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication for matter of Heresy, as was this pretended in the Queenes case, so that in respect of them the danger was apparent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is plaine that Recusancy and disobedience came actually hand in hand, I say not that one was the issue of the other, but that they were coetaneous,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41208:404"/>
for the same persons that moved them to Recusancy by vertue of the Bull, moved them to the execution of it <hi>per omnia.</hi> Now see whither this would tend! They by Recusancy were better able to judge of their forces in <hi>England,</hi> and what party they were able to make for execution of the Bull, whilest by that as by a discriminative cognisance they were pointed at, as Abettors of the Catholike cause.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre they suffered not for their Religion or conscience, unlesse it were against their conscience to be good subjects, and then it was not Religion, at least not Christian, that was inconsistent with their Loyalty, &amp; so hitherto inrespect of us, their machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was altogether causelesse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the second (I mean the writing &amp; publishing of Seditious &amp; Trayterous Books, I shall not need to say any thing in defence of its being made Capitall, though sometimes they accuse our laws for it) for <note place="margin">Apud Linwood de senten. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat.

This I noted, because the same censure involves more, by vertue of the same Canon: I mean, not only the seditious Libellers but impugners of the Kings Regalties, as also the Bringers, Publishers, and Executioners of the Bull; as is to be seene in the constitution of Arch-bishop <hi>Stephen,</hi> in a Councell held at <hi>Oxford.</hi> But secondly, whether they were or were not, it matters nothing; this I suppose was no part of their Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this might be made Treason, and yet their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41208:404"/>
and peace of conscience undistarbed. 3. But the next is the main outcry of all, the very <hi>Concla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum est</hi> of the <hi>Catholique</hi> cause, if suffered; it was made Treason to be a Priest, or at least if any of their Priests should be found in England he should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a Traytor, and these Lawes were not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, but then in execution.</p>
                  <p>When certaine Sycophants told <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that some of his discontented Subjects called him Tyrant, his answer was, <hi>Rudes sunt Macedones, &amp; scapham vocant scapham.</hi> I wish these men who object this, had the same ingenuity, and would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the rudenesse of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth is no apparent calumny. And truly, as the case then stood, it was no worse. For consider that the statute against Priests was not made till sixteen years after the Bull of <hi>Pius quintus,</hi> and after much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence both by the confession of some Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and divers Lay-persons, that at least, many of them came into England with this errand, that they might instigate the Queenes liege people to the Execution of it. This is very plaine in the case of <hi>Mayne</hi> the Iesuit, and <hi>M. Tregion</hi> who were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">1577.</note> at <hi>Launston</hi> for the same businesse.</p>
                  <p>The state could not certainly know what would be the issue, but yet could not but think it likely to produce more and worse consequences for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Leges aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> justae in facta constituuntur quia fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41208:405"/>
This was all, and this done with so much lenity and moderation as if of purpose to render good for their evill; such was her innocence, and yet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for her safety, such was her prudence. She gave them forty daies time of preparation for their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, impos'd no penalty for their longer stay in case that any of them were lesse healthfull, or that the winds were crosse, or that the wether serv'd not: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that during their stay, they gave security for their due obedience to her laws, and that they should attempt nothing against her person or government, for this was all she aim'd at; but if they obeyed not the Proscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, having no just cause to the contrary, such as were expressed in the Act, then it should be adjudged their errand was not right, &amp; therefore (not their Religion, but) their disobedience Treasonable.</p>
                  <p>This was the highest <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the severity of this state against them, now first I shall briefly shew that this proscription which was the highest penalty, was for just cause as the case then stood, and deserved on their part. 2. It was but reasonable, in case they obeyed not the proscription, their stay should be made Treason. 1. Because the Priests did general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach the Popes power either directly over tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls, or else in order to spiritualls, of which the Pope being judge it would come to the same issue, and this was dangerous to the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and intrenched too much upon the Regalty. In particular, the case of bringing from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and publishing of Bulls, was by the Lords of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41208:405"/>
the Parliament in the sixteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, judg'd to be <hi>[cleerely in derogation of the Kings Crown and of his Regalty, as it is well known and hath been of a long time known,</hi>] and therefore they protested <hi>[together and every one severally by himselfe, that they would be with the same Crown and Regalty in these cases specially, and in all other cases which shall be attempted against the same Crown and Regalty in all points with all their power,</hi>] I hope then if the State in the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> hàving farre greater reason then ever, shall judge that these Bulles, the publishing of them, the Preaching of their validity, and reconciling by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of them her Subjects to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> be dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to her Crown and Regalty, I see no reason She should be frighted from her just defence with the bugbear of pretended Religion, for if it was not against Religion then, why is it now? I confesse there is a reason for it, to wit, because now the Popes power is an Article of Faith (as I shall shew anon) but then it was not with them, any more then now it is with us: but whether this will convince any man of reason I leave it to himselfe to consider.</p>
                  <p>But one thing is observeable in that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, I meane this clause <hi>[as it is well knowne, and hath been of a long time knowne.</hi>] The Popes incroachments upon the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had been an old sore, and by its eld almost ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate; but yet it grieved them neverthelesse, nor was the lesse a fever for being hecticall: but so it is that I am confident upon very good grounds, it may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41208:406"/>
be made as apparent as the noon Sunne, for these 600 years and upwards, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have exercised so extream and continuall Tyranny and exactions in this Kingdome, that our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was under him worse then the State of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> under their thirty Tyrants, or then our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors are now under their <hi>Belgick</hi> Tributes. So many greivances of the people, expilations of the Church, abuses to the State, intrenchments upon the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Crown were continued, that it was a great blessing of Almighty God, our Kingdome was delivered from them upon so easy termes, which <hi>Grosthead</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> thought would never be done, but in <hi>Oregladii cruentandi:</hi> and now to have all these mischiefes returne <hi>with more strength</hi> upon us by the attempts of these Priests, had been the highest point of indiscretion and sleepinesse. I said <hi>[with more strength</hi>] because what anciently at the highest was thought but a priviledge of the Church began now to be an Article of Faith, and therefore if admitted would have bound stronger and without all possibility of redresse.</p>
                  <p>And now if after all this any man should doubt of the justice of these Lawes against the Priests obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the State the Popes power, I only referre him to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> where let him hold his Plèa against those great Sages of the Law, for their just censures upon <hi>Florentinus Iacobus, Thomas Blanzius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Tanquerell,</hi> who were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <note place="margin">1561.</note> to a solemne honorary penance and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41208:406"/>
to the State, and not without extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty escaped death, for the same cause. But this is not all. I adde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Pope had his Agent in <hi>England</hi> to stirre up the Subjects to rebell against the Queene, as I proved before by the testimonies of <hi>Catena</hi> and <hi>Gabutius.</hi> It is not then imaginable that he should so poorely intend his own designes, to imploy one on purpose, and he but a Merchant, and that the Priests who were the men, if any, most likely to doe the businesse, should be un-imployed. I speak not of the argument from matter of fact, (for it is apparent that they were imployed, as I shewed but now,) but it is plain also that they must have been imployed, if we had had no other argument but a presumption of the Popes ordinary discretion.</p>
                  <p>Things then remaining in this condition what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity could the Queen or State have without the absence of those men who must be the instruments of their mischiefe? Thirdly, there was great reason those men might be banished who might from their own principles plead immunity from all Lawes, and subordination to the Prince. But that so these Priests might, I only bring two witnesses, leading men of their own Side. Thus <hi>Bellarmine: The Pope hath exempted all Clerks from subiection to Princes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     </note> The same is taught by <hi>Emanuel S à</hi> in his <hi>Aphorismes, Verbo Clericus.</hi> I must not dissemble that this Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme however it passed the Presse at first, yet in the Edition of <hi>Paris</hi> it was left out. The cause is known to every man: For that it was meerely to serve their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41208:407"/>
ends is apparent; for their French freedome was there taken from them, they durst not <hi>parler tout</hi> so neere the Parliament; but the Aphorisme is to this day retain'd in the Editions of <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Colein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be their Doctrine, as it is plain it is taught by these leading Authors, I mean <hi>Sà</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I know no reason but it may be very just and most convenient to deny those men the Country from whose Lawes they plead exemption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was but reasonable, in case they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not the proscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their disobedience should be made Capitall. For if they did not obey, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they sinned against their conscience in disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lawfull Prince, and so are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and inexcusable from the Lawes penalty, which may be extended at the pleasure of the Lawgiver, where there is no positive injustice in the disproportion; or if they did not sinne against their conscience, then of necessity must they think her to be no lawfull Prince or not their lawfull Prince, nor they her Subjects, &amp; so <hi>ipso facto</hi> are guilty of high Treason, &amp; their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution <note place="margin">De simplie. Pralat.</note> was for <hi>Treason not Religion,</hi> and so the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall is evicted which I shall beg leave to expresse in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> language, <hi>Non erat illa fidei Corona, sed poena per fidiae; nec religiosae virtutis exitus gloriosus, sed desperationis interitus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if <hi>Valentius</hi> banish <hi>Eusebius</hi> from <hi>Samosata,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> obey not the edict, if <hi>Valentius</hi> puts him to death, it is not for his being a Christian that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Theodoret. l.</hi> 4. c. 14.</note> he suffers death, but for staying at <hi>Samosata</hi> against the command of <hi>Valentius.</hi> Such was the case of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41208:407"/>
Priests, whom for just cause (as I have proved) and too apparent proofe of seditious practices the Queen banished. Now if the Queen was their lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, then were they bound to obey her Decree of exile, though it had been unjust as was the case of <hi>Eusebius;</hi> or if they did not obey, not to think the Lawes unjust for punishing their disobedience. I say again, their Disobedience, not their Religion: for that it was not their Religion that was struck at by the justice of these Lawes, but the security of the Queen and State only aim'd at, (besides what I have already said,) is apparent to the evidence of sence. For when <hi>Hart,</hi> and <hi>Bosgrave, Iesuits</hi> both, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England against the Law, they were apprehended and imprison'd: (for the Lawes without just Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were of no force for the Queenes safety;) but when these men had acknowledg'd the Queenes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate power, and put in their security for their due obedience, they obtain'd their pardon and their liberty. The same proceedings were in the case of <hi>Horton</hi> and <hi>Rishton,</hi> all which I hope were not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states from their Order or Religion, but so they must have been or not have escap'd death, in case that their Religion had been made Capitall. Lastly, this Statute extended only to such Priests who were made Priests since <hi>Primo</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; were born in <hi>England.</hi> It was not Treason for a French Priest to be in England, but yet so it must have been if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had been the thing they aim'd at. But 'tis so foule a Calumny, I am asham'd to stand longer to efute it. The proceedings of the Church and State
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41208:408"/>
of <hi>England</hi> were just, honourable and religious, full of mercy and discretion, and unlesse it were that as <hi>C. Fimbria</hi> complain'd of <hi>Q. Scaevola,</hi> we did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our breasts wide enough to receive the danger, there is no cause imaginable, I mean on our parts, to move them to so damned a conspiracy, or indeed to any just complaint.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if these were not the causes (as they would faine abuse the world into a perswasion that they were,) what was? I shall tell you, if you will give me leave <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to derive it from its very head, and then I will leave it to you to judge whether or no my Augury failes me.</p>
                  <p>First, I guesse that the Traitors were encouraged and primarily mov'd to this Treason from the preuailing opinion which is most generally receiv'd on that side of the lawfulnesse of deposing Princes that are Hereticall. I say generally receiv'd, and I shall make my words good, or else the blame shall lay on themselves for deceiving me when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their own mindes.

                  <p n="3">3 He that saith Subjects may and are bound to depose their Princes, and to drive them from all rule over Christians, if they be able, meanes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more: For what if the Prince resist? still he is bound to depose him if he be able. How if the Prince make a warre? The Catholike subject must doe his duty neverthelesse, and warre too, if he be able. He that saies he may wage a warre with his Prince, I doubt not but thinks he may kill him; and if the fortune of the warre lights so upon him, the subject cannot be blamed, for doing of his duty.</p>
                  <p>It is plain that killing a Prince is a certain conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of deposing him, unlesse the Prince be bound
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41208:411"/>
in conscience to think himselfe a Heretick, when the Pope declares him so, and be likewise bound not to resist, and besides all this will performe these his obligations, and as certainly think himselfe hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and as really give over his Kingdome quietly, as he is bound. For in case any of these should faile, there can be but very slender assurance of his life. I would be loth to obtrude upon men the odious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of their opinions, or to make any thing worse which is capable of a fairer construction; but I crave pard on in this particular, the life of Princes is sacred, and is not to be violated so much as in thought, or by the most remote consequence of a publike doctrine: But here indeed it is so immediate and naturall a consequent of the former that it must not be dissembled. But what shall we think if even this blasphemy be taught <hi>in terminis?</hi> See this too.</p>
                  <p>In the yeare 1407. when the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had been slaine by <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the fact noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beyond a possibility of concealement, he thought it his best way to imploy his Chaplaine to justify the act, pretending that <hi>Orleans</hi> was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. This stood him in small stead; for by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of <hi>Gerson,</hi> it was decreed in the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> that Tyranny was no sufficient cause for a man to kill a Prince. But yet I finde that even this decree will not stand Princes in much stead. First, because the decree runnes <hi>[ut nemo privatâ Authoritate &amp;c.</hi>] but if the Pope commands it, then it is <hi>Iudicium publicum,</hi> and so they are never the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41208:412"/>
more secure for all this. Secondly, because <hi>Marianae</hi> tels us, that this Decree is nothing. <hi>Nam<expan>

Now whether the Pope, or learned men, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be to passe this sentence upon the Prince, it is plaine that it is an Vniversall Doctrine amongst them that after this sentence (whosesoever it be) it is then without Question lawfull to kill him, and the most that ever they say is, that it is indeed not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to kill a King, not lawfull for a private man, of his owne head, without the publike sentence of his Iudge, but when this Iudge (whom they affirme to be the Pope) hath passed his sentence, then they doubt not of its being lawfull.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41208:413"/>
and then to beautify the matter professe that they deny the lawfulnesse of <hi>Regicidium,</hi> by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate authority. For if the Pope sentence him then he is no longer a King, and so the killing of him is not <hi>Regicidium,</hi> and if any man doth kill him after such sentence, then he kills him not <hi>privatâ Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> or <hi>sinè judicio publico,</hi> which is all they affirm to be unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>And thus they hope to stop the clamour of the world against them, yet to have their opinions stand intire, the way to their owne ends fair, but the Prince no jot the more secure of his life. I doe them no wrong, I appeale to the Authors themselves, there. I will be tryed. For that either the People, or that a Company of learned men, or to be sure the Pope may license a man to kill the King, they speake it with one voyce, and tongue. And now after all this we may better guesse what manner of counsell or threatning (for I know not which to call it) that <note place="margin">

Now if we put all these things together, and then we should prove to be Heretiques in their account, we are in a faire case both Prince and people, if wee can but guesse rightly at this wee shall need I thinke to looke no further why fire was called for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume both our King and Country, nor why we may feare it another time.</p>

                  <p>By this time wee see too plainly that the state of Protestant Princes is full of danger where these men have to doe. They may be deposed and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the Government of their Kingdomes, they must be deposed by the Catholiques under perill of their soules, it may be done any way that is most convenient, they may be rebelled against, fought with, slaine.

                  </p>
                  <p>But what matter is it if the Pope be judge, for if they may be deposed, as good he as any else. What greivance then, can this be to the state of Princes more then the former? Yes, very much. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41208:414"/>
the Pope by his order to spiritualls may take away Kingdomes upon more pretences then actuall heresy. It is a large title, and may doe any thing. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> expresses it handsomely, and it is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> of their great <hi>Aquinas. The Pope</hi> (saith he) <hi>by</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De regim, Princip.</note> 
                     <hi>his Spirituall power may dispose of the Temporalties of all the Christians in the World, when it is requisite to the end of the Spirituall power.</hi> The words are plain that he may doe it for his own ends (for his is the <hi>Spirituall power)</hi> that is, for the advancement of the <hi>See Apostolike,</hi> and thus (to be sure) he did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wish <hi>Frederick Barbarossa, Iohn of Navarre,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> and our own King <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. The Pope pretends to a power that to avoid the probable danger of the increase of heresy he may take away a Territory from the right owner, as is reported by the Cardinall <hi>D'Ossat,</hi> and this is soon pretended, for who is there that cannot make probabilities, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when a Kingdome is at stake? 3. We finde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that the Pope hath excommunicate Princes, and declar'd them hereticks when all the heresy hath been a not laying their crownes at the feet of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> The case of <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth is every where known, whom <hi>Iohn</hi> the twenty third Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. <hi>Platina</hi> tels the reason. He called himselfe <note place="margin">In Clement. quinto.</note> Emperour without the Popes leave, and aided the <hi>Italian</hi> deputies to recover <hi>Millaine.</hi> Doubtlesse a most damnable and fundamentall heresy. 4. How if it proves in the Popes account to be a heresy to defend the immediat right of Princes to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41208:415"/>
dependant only on God, not on the <hi>See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike.</hi> If this be no heresy, nor like heresy to say it, I would faine learn the meaning of <hi>Baronius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the book of <hi>Iohannes de Roa,</hi> who sometimes had been a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> but then chang'd his order, and became <hi>Augustinian,</hi> saying, <hi>it was sentenc'd to the</hi>

And if it be not heresy to doe so, it is in their account as bad, for so the <hi>Iesuits</hi> in their <hi>Veritas defensa</hi> against the Action of <hi>Arnald</hi> the Advocate affirme <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> that the actions of some Kings of <hi>France</hi> against the Pope in defence of their Regalties, were but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of rebellion, and spots to disgrace the purity of the French Lillies.</hi> 5. Put case the Pope should chance to mistake in his sentence against a Prince, for the cause of heresy, yet for all this mistake, he can secure any man to take away the Princes life or Kingdome. His Lawyers will be his security for this point. For although in this case, the deposition of the Prince should be, and be acknowledged to be against Gods law, the Prince being neither Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant nor heretick, yet his Holinesse commanding it,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41208:415"/>
takes away the unlawfulnesse of it, by his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. So <hi>D. Marta,</hi> and for this doctrine he quotes <hi>Hostiensis, Felinus, Gratus,</hi> the <hi>Abbat,</hi> the <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>For these reasons I think it is true enough that the constituting the Pope the judge of Princes in the matter of deposition, is of more danger then the thing it selfe. The summe is this. However schisme or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy may be pretended, yet it is but during the Popes pleasure that Kings or subjects shall remain firme in their mutuall necessitude. For if our Prince bee but excommunicate or declar'd heretick, then to be a good subject will be accounted no better then irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and <hi>Anti-Catholicisme.</hi> If the conclusion be too hard and intolerable then so are the Premises, and yet they passe for good Catholike doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves.</p>
                  <p>But if truly and <hi>ex animo</hi> they are otherwise affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they should doe well to unsay what hath been said, and declare themselves by publique authority against such doctrines. And say whether or no their determinations shall be <hi>de fide?</hi> If they be, then all those famous Catholique Doctors, <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Bellarmine, Creswell, Mariana, Emanuel Sá, &amp;c.</hi> are heretiques, and their Canons teach heresy, and Many of their Popes to be condemn'd as hereticall, for practising and teaching deposition of Princes by an authority usurp't against, and in prejudice of the Christian faith. But if their answers be not <hi>de fide,</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41208:416"/>
then they had as good say nothing, for the danger is not at all decreased, because if there be Doctors on both sides by their own <note n="*" place="margin">Charity maintaind by Cath. cap. 7.</note> assertion they may without sinne follow either, but yet more safely if they follow the most received and the most autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, and whether this rule will lead them, I will be judg'd by any man that hath considered the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Briefly either this thing must remain in the same state it is, and our Princes still expos'd to so extream hazards, or else let his <hi>Holinesse</hi> seat himselfe in his chaire, condemne these doctrines, vow against their future practise, limit his <hi>or do ad spiritualia,</hi> containe himselfe within the limits of causes directly and meerely Ecclesiasticall, disclaime all power, so much as indirect over Princes temporalls, and all this with an intent to oblige all Christendome. Which when I see done, I shall be most ready to believe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Popery, doth either directly or by a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence destroy Loyalty to our lawfull Prince, but not till then, having so much evidence to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Thus much was occasion'd by consideration of the cause of the Disciples <hi>Quaere</hi> which was when they saw this, that their L. and M. for his difference in Religion was turned forth of doores, which when they saw,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They said Lord</hi>]. It was well they ask'd at all, and would not too hastily act what they too sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly had intended, but it was better that they ask'd Christ, it had been the best warrant they could have had, could
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41208:417"/>
they have obtain'd but a <hi>Magister dixit.</hi> But this was not likely, it was too strange a Question to aske of such a M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>A Magistro mansuetudinis licentiam crudelitat is?</hi> Nothing could have come more crosse to his disposition. His spirit never was addicted to blood, unlesse it were to shed his owne.

Hee knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what it cost to redeem aman, and to save his life from destruction then to bee so hasty for his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. And if the Fathers <hi>Confessors</hi> who were to answere the Question of the day had but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon this Gospell, they might have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their penitents better then to have engaged them upon such Antichristian, and Treasonable practises, as to destroy an assembly of Christians, as to depose or kill a King.</p>
                  <p>It is the proper cognisance of Mahumetanisme, by fire and sword to maintain their cause, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their Religion, by ruine of Princes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering their Kingdomes. But it is the excellency of Christianity, that by humility and obedience it made Princes tributary to our Deare Master, and homagers to his Kingdome.

For true it is God commanded us, saying, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> that is, if thou art not able to lift up thy hand, or strike a stroake; thou shalt not blaspheme, that is, if thou beest speechlesse, thou must be obedient to thy Prince, that is, if thou canst not tell how to helpe it. Good Doctrine this! And indeed it might possibly be something if God had commanded our subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Princes only <hi>for wrath,</hi> for then <hi>sivires ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sint,</hi> if wee can defend our selves we are secure, wee need not feare his wrath, but when he addes, <hi>also for conscience sake,</hi> I cannot sufficiently wonder that any man should obtrude so senselesse, so illiterate, and so impious an interpretation upon the Christian world, under the Title of Catholique Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Christ when he was betrayed and seized upon by his Murderers could have commanded twelve Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Angels for his Guard, <hi>Non defuerunt vires;</hi> and in all humane likelyhood such a <hi>Satellitium</hi> as that would have mov'd them to a beliefe in him, or else I am sure, might have destroyed the unbelievers. Shall I say more against this rude <hi>glossema?</hi> Then thus. It is false that the Primitive Christians had not power to defend themselves against their Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.

as a thing not subjicible to their penitentiall, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, because it was a fact not repented of, but then in agitation, and resolved upon for the future. How then could this be a confession, whose institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must certainly be in order to absolution, and how could this be in any such order; when it was a businesse of which they could not expect to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved unlesse they hop'd to sinne with a pardon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks; and on condition God would be mercifull to them in its remission, would come and professe that they were resolved to anger him? In reason this could be no act of repentance, neither could it, by confession of their own side. It is the doctrine of <hi>Hostiensis:</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3 It was not only not repented of, but by them reputed to be a good action, and so could not be a matter of confession. I appeal to any of their own <hi>Manuals</hi> and penitentiary bookes. It is culpable say they. I am sure it is ridiculous in any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and shrive himselfe of a good action, and that this was such in their opinion, it's plaine, by that impious answer of <hi>Garnet,</hi> affirming it a businesse <note place="margin">See proceed. against late Traitors.</note> greatly meritorious, if any good might thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Catholique cause.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 By this their pretended confession they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to acquire new complices, as is evident <hi>in the proceedings against the Traitors.</hi> They were therefore bound to reveale it, for it neither was nor
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41208:420"/>
could be a proper and formall confession. That this is the common opinion of their own Schooles, see it affirmed by <hi>Aegidius Coninck.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vbisuprà.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first particular then is plain. Here neither was the forme of confession, nor yet could this thing be a matter of confession, therefore supposing the seale of confession to be sacredly inviolable in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet they were highly blameable for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement in the present.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But the truth of the second particular is more to be inquired of. That is, that though these things had been only revealed in confession, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession had been formall and direct, yet they were bound in the present case to reveale it, because the seale of confession is not so inviolable, as that in no case it is to be broken up, and if in any, especially it may be opened in the case of treason.</p>
                  <p>I never knew any thing cryed up with so generall a voyce upon so little ground, as is the <hi>Over-hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> seale of confession.</p>
                  <p>True it is that an ordinary secret committed to a friend in civill commerce is not to be revealed upon every cause, nor upon many, (but upon some it may as they all confesse.) If thus, then much rather is this to be observed in the revelation of the secrets of our consciences, not only from the ordinary tye to secrecy, but likewise least sinnes should grow more frequent, if so great a remedy of them be made so odious, as to expose us to a publike infamy or danger of the law. The Councell therefore that first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41208:421"/>
this obligation was very prudent and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, pleads a thousand yeares prescription, and relies upon good conveniences. This is all that ever could be prov'd of it (as may appeare anon) but these are too weak a base, to build so great a structure on it, as to make it sacriledge, or any sinne at all, to reveale confessions in some cases.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For first, if because it is delivered as a secret, and such a secret, it is the more closely and religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be kept; it is true, but concludes no more, but that it must be a greater cause that must authorize a publication of this, then of the secrets of ordinary commerce between friend and friend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If the licensing of publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of confession be a way to make confession odious, and therefore that it may not be publish'd, I say if this concludes, then on the contrary it concludes farre more strongly, that therefore in some cases it may be published, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing can make a thing more odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, then if it be made a cover for grand impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so as to engage a true subject, quietly &amp; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to see his Prince murdred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If it be discouragement to the practise of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that some sinnes revealed in it must be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished though with perill to the delinquents fame &amp; life, then it will be a farre greater discouragement to the sinne, when that it shall by an universall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be so detested, that its concealement may not be permitted, though it be with the hazard of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Holy duty of confession: and when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41208:421"/>
the being guilty of such a sinne, shall reduce men into such streights, that either they shall want the benefit of absolution, or submit themselves to a publike sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and so even in this particular the benefit is farre greater then the imaginary inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>The conveniences of the Seale force no more then that it is convenient to be observed, not simply and absolutely in all cases necessary. And perhaps <hi>Suarez</hi> the great patron of it perceived it, however he laies the burden, <hi>super communi consensu Ecclesiae,</hi>

                  <p>Of the first. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the seale of confession as sacredly as reason or religion it selfe can possibly permit, yet forbids not disclosure in case of Murder or Treason, but in these particulars leaves us intire in our obedience to <note place="margin">

                  <p>That the Church of England gives leave in some cases to reveale confessions, is argument enough to prove that the Seale is not founded upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41208:422"/>
of the present <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> For it is no more a begging of the Question (nor apparently so much) to say, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a part of the Catholike Church, and therefore her consent is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a thing universall, then to say, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the whole <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> therefore her consent is sufficient to make a thing Catholike. But I shall not need to proceed this way. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is apparent that of their own side <hi>Altisidio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rensis</hi> largely and professedly proves the iawfulnesse of publication in some cases as is to be seen. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Summae tract.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 7. and <hi>Garnet</hi> himselfe, the man who if any had most need to stand in defence of the <hi>Seale</hi> that the pretence of it might have defended him, yet confessed of his own accord, <hi>Leges quae ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare haec prohibent apprimè esse justas &amp; salutares.</hi> He <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Actio in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dit. lat. p.</hi> 99.</note> addes his reason, and that is more then his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for (saith he) it is not fitting that the life and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Prince should depend upon the private nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of any mans conscience.

                  <p>There are many cases, generally confessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, in which the seale of formall and (as they love to speak) <hi>Sacramentall</hi> confession may be broken open. I instance but in two or three.</p>
                  <p>First, confession may be reveal'd to clear a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case of marriage. It is the opinion of many great <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Canonists,</hi> as you may see them quoted by <hi>Suarez de</hi>

                     </note> who married a Virgin that was both his sister and daughter: and that at <hi>Rome</hi> under Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third almost to like purpose, were long disputed on both sides, whether they were to be revealed or not, so that at most, it is but a doubtfull matter in such cases, whether the tye of secrecy doth oblige. Now if for the proofe of marriage the seale may be broken up, that man and wife might live contentedly and as they ought, strange it should be unlawfull to reveale confessions in case of Treason, for the safety of a Prince or State!</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In case of heresy the seale binds not, by their own generall confession. It is a rule amongst them,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haeresis est crimen quod non confessio celat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I would fain learn why Treason is not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeable as Heresy? Is heresy dangerous to soules? Then surely, so is Treason, unlesse it be none, or a very small crime. May heresy infect others? So may Treason, as it did in the present. It may then as well be revealed as heresy. Now that it may something rather, I have these reasons. 1. Because it is not so certaine that such an opinion is heresy as that such a fact is Treason. 2. Because although both Treason and reall heresy be damnable and dangerous to soules, yet heresy killes no Kings as treason doth. I confesse that heresy may, and doth teach it, but then it degenerates into Treason. Now if some he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy may be Treason, then that Treason is heresy, &amp; so a case of Treason may occurre, in which from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41208:423"/>
their own confession, treason is revealeable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 By the most generall voice of their own side any man may licence his confessor to reveale his confession. It is the doctrine of <hi>Scotus, Durandus, Almain, Navarre, Medina,</hi> and generally of all the <hi>Thomists.</hi> I inferre, if a private man may licence his <hi>Confessor</hi> to reveale his confession, then the seale of confession is not founded upon any divine comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, for if it were, the penitent could not give the Priest license to break it. But if the penitent may give his <hi>Confessor</hi> leave, because the tye of secrecy is a bond in which the Priest stands bound to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp; he giving him leave, remits of his own right, then much rather may a whole State authorise this publication, for what ever personall right a private man hath, that the whole State hath much rather, <note place="margin">L. quod Maior ff. ad Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalem.</note> for he is included in it as a part of the whole, and in such cases as concerne the whole commonwealth (as this of treason doth most especially) the rule of the Law holds without exception, <hi>Refertur ad uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versos quod publicè fit per maiorem partem,</hi> the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <note place="margin">

                     </note> gives leave to the publication of confession, therefore because the whole state doth, whereof he is one member. I adde, that in the case of Treason this is much rather true, for here the delinquent looseth all his right whatsoever, praediall, personall, and of priviledge, &amp; therefore the Commonwealth can the better license the publication, and the breach of the bond of secrecy, in which the <hi>Confessor</hi> stood tyed to the penitent by vertue of implicit stipulation.</p>

I instance not in the case of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere,</hi> it is every where knowne as it is reported part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Thuanus,</hi> but more fully by the Authour of <hi>Histoire de la paix.</hi> Nor yet is <hi>France</hi> singular in the practise of publication of confessed Treason. For at <hi>Rome</hi> there have been examples of the like, I meane of those who confessed their purpose of killing the <note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus then the first pretence proves a nullity, &amp; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Laws are just in commanding publication of confession in case of Treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or themselves very culpa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble in teaching &amp; practising it in the same, &amp; in cases of lesse moment.

then a whole assembly. Thus it was in the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> both Law and Custome. But now if we look into the <hi>Latine Church</hi> wee shall find that it was taken up from example of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and some while practis'd, that some particular sinnes should be published in the Church before the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is confessed in the Councell of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <note place="margin">

                  <p>But when the <hi>Lay</hi> piety began to coole, and the zeale of some Clergy men waxe too hot, they would needs heighten this <hi>custome</hi> of publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>some</hi> sinnes to a <hi>Law</hi> of the publishing of <hi>all</hi> sinnes.

The reason which he gives makes the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse somewhat clearer, for hee derives it not

from any simple necessity of the thing or a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> but least men out of inordinate love to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>should rather refuse to be wash't then buy their purity with so much shame. The whole Epistle hath many things in it excellently to the same purpose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say no more, the Doctrine and practise of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is sufficiently evident, and that there is nothing lesse then an <hi>Vniversall tradition</hi> for the seale of confession to be observed in all cases, even of sins of the highest malignity.</p>
                  <p>Thus these Fathers <hi>Confessors</hi> are made totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable by concealing a Treason which was not revealed to them in a formall confession, and had been likewise culpable though it had, there being as I have showne, no such sacrednesse of the <hi>Seale</hi> as to be inviolable in all cases whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with the severall considerations of the persons to whom the Question was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they were the Fathers <hi>Confessors</hi> in the day, but it was Christ the Lord in my text. The Question it selfe followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall we command fire to come from heaven and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Question was concerning the fate of a whole Towne of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in our case it was more; of the Fate of a whole Kingdome. It had been well if such a Question had been silenc'd by a direct negative or (as the Iudges of the Areopage used to doe) put off <hi>ad diem longissimum,</hi> that they might have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the answer three ages after.</p>

De morte hominis nulla est cunctatio longa,</q>
                  <p>No demurre had been too long in a case of so much and so royall blood, the blood of a King, of a Kings Children, of a Kings Kingdome. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, King and Kingdome should have &amp; been made a solemne sacrifice to appease theirsolemndeliberate malice. I said deliberate, for they were loth to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious without good advice, and therefore they askt their question, worthy of an Oracle, even no lesse then <hi>Delphick,</hi> where an evill spirit was the <hi>Numen,</hi> and a Witch the Prophet. For the Question was such of which a Christian could not doubt though he had been fearefully scrupulous in his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For whoever question'd the unlawfulnesse of murder, of murdering innocents, of murdering them who were confessed righteous? for such was their proposall, being rather willing that <hi>Catholiks</hi> should perish with those whom they thought, hereticks, then that their should be no blood spilt. But to the question: it was fire they called for. The most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of all the Elements. No possibility of relenting when once kindled and had its object. It was the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test instrument for mercilesse men, men of no bowels whose malice like their instrument did <hi>agere ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremum suarnm virium,</hi> worke to the highest of its possibility. Secondly, It was fire indeed they called for, but not like that in my text, not fire from heaven, They might have called as long and as loud as those Priests did, who contested with <hi>Elisha,</hi> no fire would have come from heaven to have consum'd what they had intended for a sacrifice. Gods <hi>Anathema's</hi> post
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41208:426"/>
not so fast as ours doe. <hi>Deus non est sicut homo.</hi> Man curseth often when God blesseth, men condemne whom God acquits, and therefore they were loath to trust God with their cause, they therefore take it into their own hands. And certainly if to their <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas</hi> they adde some fagots of their own and gunpowder, 'tis oddes but then we may be consum'd indeed, and so did they, their fire was not from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it was a fire so strange, that it had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The Apostles indeed pleaded a mistaken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for the reasonablenesse of their demand, they desir'd leave to doe but <hi>even as Elias did.</hi> [The <hi>Greekes</hi> only retaine this clause, it is not in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>] and really these <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no-barbari</hi> could never pretend to any precedent for an act so barbarous as theirs. <hi>Adrimelech</hi> indeed kil'd a King, but he spar'd the people, <hi>Haman</hi> would have killed the people, but spared the King, but that both King and people, Princes and Iudges, branch, and rush and root should dye at once (as if <hi>Caligula's</hi> were actuated and all England upon one head) was never known till now, that all the malice in the world met in this as in a center. The <hi>Sicilian</hi> evensong, the mattins of <hi>S. Bartholomew,</hi> known for the pittilesse and damn'd massacres, were but <gap reason="foreign">

Adde then to these, <hi>Herods</hi> Master-piece at <hi>Ramah</hi> as it was deciphred by the teares and sad threnes of the Matrons in an Vniversall mourning for the losse of their pretty infants, yet this of <hi>Herod</hi> will prove but an <hi>infant</hi> wickednesse, and that of <hi>Nero,</hi> the evill but of one citty.

                  <p>Should I take for true story the highest cruelty as it was fancied by the most hieroglyphicall <hi>Egyptian,</hi> this alone would weigh them down, as if the <hi>Alpes</hi> were put in scale against the dust of a ballance. For had this accursed Treason prosper'd, we should have had the whole Kingdome mourne for the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble losse of its chiefest glory, its life, its present joy, and all its very hopes for the future.
