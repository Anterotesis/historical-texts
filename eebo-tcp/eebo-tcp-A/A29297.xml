            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHen dejected Spirits lye groaning under the heavy preſſure of Affliction, they addreſs their Vows unto a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being; likewiſe in every ſmall Reverſe of Fortune, Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation has inſtructed man to flye unto thoſe Powers on Earth, as are endowed by the Celeſtial Influences with requiſite Qualities for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the afflicted.</p>
            <p>Your Grace having been ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fitted by Heaven for that Employ on Earth, in ſo vaſt a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as has ſpread your Fame over the whole Univerſe; it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Madam, If <hi>Camille</hi> ha been diligent in attaining to ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Idiom, as
<pb facs="tcp:47241:4"/>
would fit him to appear in your Princely Preſence, with more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and to ſhroud himſelf with greater Reſpect, under the Wings of Your Graces generous Protection.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, though concealed under the formal Weeds of a Modern Knight-Errants ſeeming Sanctity, is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine by Profeſſion, and of the very firſt rank in Licentiouſneſs, who approaches full of confidence, that the bare reflection of Your Graces Perfections is more than ſufficient to work a thorough refor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mation in him.</p>
            <p>The whole World is of Opinion that it is with the greateſt force of reaſon imaginable, that this gallant Pilgrim builds on this bottom. For what greater motives to Virtue can there be derived from Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Madam, than that exampla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life which Your Grace does ſteer with ſuch exactneſs through the
<pb facs="tcp:47241:4"/>
tempeſtuous Seas of this World, without touching on the two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rocks of Superſtition, or of Religious Contempt.</p>
            <p>Here, Madam, I ſhould attempt to numerate Your Graces Virtues, If I would have this Dedication <hi>a-la-mode,</hi> but beſides that I know they are not to be comprehended within the inconſiderate limits of an Epiſtle; I cannot be guilty of ſuch an Errour, Madam, ſo long as I know with what diſguſt Your Grace receives vulgar Applauſe while with Juſtice you expect your Reward from above, where Angels only celebrate your Praiſes, and write your Fame on the vaſt Tables of Eternity. I ſhall reſt contented in giving Your Grace an hours Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement in the lively portrait of a <hi>Spaniſh-Jacobin Fryar,</hi> and Father Confeſſor, of a conſiderable ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; perſons whoſe Principal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes are ſo worldly, that their Religious Habit and Profeſſion, are

but the ſpecious pretences, under which thoſe Ghoſtly Fathers, with ſingular induſtry, and admirable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience do exerciſe a moſt gainful Traffick in Humane Fleſh.</p>
            <p>If I am ever ſo happy, Madam, as to have given Your Grace ſome moments of Recreation, I have my ends. In thoſe hopes I take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

            <head>A Word of Advice to the READER.</head>
            <p>THis Word of Advice would not be neceſſary, if I had to do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with rational and indulgent Readers, but when once a man has delivered himſelf up to the Publick in this manner, he is apt to fall into the hands of ſuch perſons as will give no quarter. For my part I have feared, leſt ſome perſons ſhould ſcandalize themſelves with the Reverend Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. I could ſend thoſe Cenſors to <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace,</hi> to <hi>Arioſto,</hi> and to divers other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Authors, who in their Railleries have treated thoſe good Fathers ſomewhat worſe than I have, if ſpeaking truth of them is treating of them ill. But peradventure thoſe examples will not be ſufficient to juſtifie me; and <hi>Baronius,</hi> who ſpares them not, no more than <hi>Plautus,</hi> in ſome certain Affairs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a more ſcandalous nature than thoſe of being ſerviceable to ones Neighbour on the account of Amorous Intrigues, would appear
<pb facs="tcp:47241:6"/>
more excuſable to them than I; only becauſe that theſe rebuke them for their Crimes, while that I do but laugh at them. But with the good leave of thoſe Gentlemen, that are ſo apt to be ſcandalized, I will ſay, that there is ſometime made a greater impreſſion of the horror of Vice in dexterouſly ſcoffing at it, than in down right railing after it. However I am very certain that by what I ſay of Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> no <hi>Monk</hi> will have a mind to imitate him. But theſe are not yet the beſt Reaſons that I prepare for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, It is upon the Cuſtom of the Country which I mention, that I retrench my ſelf, where the right of ſerving Amorous Intrigues is ſo common to thoſe pious Confraters, that who ſays a <hi>Monk,</hi> ſpeaks a confident; and there is no perſon that has been in <hi>Spain</hi> but is convinced of this truth. I could ſay the ſame of <hi>Italy,</hi> and, it may be, of <hi>France</hi> alſo, but it is dangerous to draw ſo many perſons all at once upon ones back; I am ſatisfied with ſpeaking of thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> who count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a particular honour to be skilful in that point, I am perſwaded, will not take it ill at my hands; at the worſt the buſineſs is not ſo great; and let me tell you; that if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity had nothing in this age but that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to pardon, it would not paſs for one of
<pb facs="tcp:47241:6"/>
the moſt corrupt. Humane Nature, with growing old, becomes ſo weak, that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity many of her ſmall Crimes, which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> call Peccadillo's, muſt be winked at. It would be too great a task to reform all; and ſuch a Cenſurer may here find fault with me, who will have more need of indulgency for himſelf, than I now crave from him. Thus I beg their favour for my Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and in my turn, I ſhall afford them the ſame Courteſie; when all comes to all, let them be ſcandalized that will, for my part I will not undertake to redreſs thoſe perſons, whoſe Brains are like their Necks. It ſuffices me to believe that there will be found ſome modeſt perſons that will laugh with me at what I have done meerly to cauſe laughter; I fear not that Venom which is only ſhed upon Books, and I am certain that there will be none ſtrong enough to ſpoil that jovial humour, that my mirth may infuſe into thoſe that know what 'tis to rally.</p>
            <p>It is not given to all the world to know how to reliſh Salt and Pepper, no more than how to uſe them aright. What would a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Brain ſay, if he ſhould read this place of <hi>Arioſto,</hi> where a certain Hermit,

Of truth their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page is ſomewhat different from that which their predeceſſors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had; for in lieu of a Lance and a Helmet, which they did
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47241:8"/>
wear in thoſe days, now they have a Palmers-Staff, a Hat trim'd with Cockel-ſhells, and I know not what kind of Rocket, inſtead of a back and breaſt, which indeed are not Iron and Lead proof; but then they do not fatigate ſo much their bearer, as thoſe Enchanted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours formerly did. That which they have retained of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cuſtome, which devotion it ſelf could not perſwade them to alter, is a little Miſs, which ſtill ſticks cloſe to them, and for whoſe ſake ſomtime the <hi>Palmer</hi>'s ſtaff does Wagg, as the Lance did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. In ſhort, what difference ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is betwixt that kind of life, which they lead now a-days in their Foot-Travels, and that formerly when they were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beſtriding their Palfreys, all things well conſider'd, it may be ſaid that each condition hath its agreements and its Troubles, its ſweets as well as its labours.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47241:8"/>
For when all is ſaid, it was no ſmall Toil to have ſo many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to break, and ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments to put to an end. You doubtleſs may have read, how that when they were to paſs over a Bridge, or to get into a Caſtle, there ſtill was ſome <hi>Giant</hi> or other to Combat, or ſome Monſter to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome; but in theſe times, as things are now ordered, all this is done with a Song.
<q>
                  <l>No Maid though, near ſo ſtout, theſe latter years,</l>
                  <l>But becomes tame, when <hi>Palmer</hi>-ſtaff appears:</l>

                  <l>When once ſhe hears a Jolly <hi>Pilgrim's</hi> Song.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Adventure for adventure, it is certain that theſe new Knights condition is well worth that of the Knights in former times. At leaſt-wiſe it was made Choice of, by a perſon of a very good guſto,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47241:9"/>
whom the leaneſs of the Purſe, or the exceſs of Devotion did not oblige to ramble up and down the World under that Figure. This poor <hi>Pilgrim</hi> had but Fifty or Sixty Thouſand Livers yearly Revenue; but here is the real cauſe of his vocation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> formerly ſo renowned, has not degenerated of late ſo much in perſons of Wit, as in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects.

            <p>There has always been found in it divers Accademies of great Wits, but in our time none has made ſo much noiſe as that which was call'd, of the Libertines; not only by reaſon of thoſe bold diſcourſes which were held in it; but for thoſe

terrible <hi>Satyrs</hi> which it ſent forth againſt all perſons without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Holy Father, to whoſe feet the firſt complaints againſt it were humbly laid down, by thoſe perſons that were concern'd in thoſe Truths which thoſe Accademicks did publiſh, was obliged to ſend forth divers Thundering Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications againſt this Society. But they being but little daunted at the <hi>Vaticans</hi> Armes, did but laugh and ſcoff at the Pope's juſt indignation; bringing him and the Cardinals alſo into play, which is the only Crime, that is not to be forgiven in <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore it was no longer Saint <hi>Peter</hi> that Armed himſelf with Thunderbolts for their deſtruction, but Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who with the Sword in hand, made a purſuit after thoſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons. There never was ſeen ſo many ſorts of perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together, as there was then, to deſtroy thoſe Libertines: Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47241:10"/>
Watch-men, Guards, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Monks,</hi> Prelates, both on foot and on Horſe-back, all were under Armes, and one would real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have taken it for a Cruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</p>
            <p>There were but few perſons in <hi>Rome</hi> that had not ſome ſhare in their <hi>Satyrs,</hi> and half the City was already providing Faggots for them, ſo that it was High time to ſound the retreat: Every one got away as well as he could, ſome diſguis'd after one manner, and ſome after another. Our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> who was one of the moſt eminent amongſt them, hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the Habit of a <hi>Pilgrim</hi>; with which having got, without any Retinue, to <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> he took a <hi>Felouqua,</hi> that carried him to <hi>Genova.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His deſign was for <hi>France</hi>; but the opportunity of a Gally, which was going to put off for <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where it was carrying a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47241:10"/>
Lord, General Maſter <hi>de</hi> Camp, of the <hi>Cavalry</hi> of the ſtate of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> having made him Change his reſolution, he enbarqued to make the ſame voyage upon it.</p>
            <p>There was a great number of Paſſengers on that Gally; and our <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> who beſides the trouble of the Crowd, was not willing to be known, being yet ſo near <hi>Italy,</hi> did accoſt the Captain, and with a Complement of few words he ſlid into his hand a Role of Piſtols, to make him underſtand by his liberality, and his good meen, that he was no common <hi>Pilgrim.</hi> The Captain therefore treated him according as his Complement, and his good meen did deſerve: for he gave him his own Cabin, which was joyning to that of the Spaniſh <hi>Don,</hi> and caus'd him to be ſerv'd by two Slaves during the whole voyage</p>
            <p>The Wind was as favourable as could be, and they had not ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47241:11"/>
ſoon Hoiſed Sails, but they loſt the ſight of <hi>Genoua.</hi> Prudence would not yet allow our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> to be much ſeen, though they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well off at Sea. He therefore reſolv'd, not to ſtir forth out of his Chamber, till he were arriv'd at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and to divert himſelf in the mean time in reading of books. This was an agreeable employment to him, but it laſted not long; for the very next day, his reading was interrupted by the Charming voice of a Woman that was in the General's Chamber. He lent an Ear, and underſtood that ſhe ſung ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Aires. His Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity did each moment increaſe, and being Charm'd with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the voice, he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have ſeen that perſon. He viſited and ſearch'd the partition of the Cabin from one end to the other, to find out ſome Chink, but the boards were ſo well Joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was labour in vain.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47241:11"/>
In fine, at night when the Captain, who us'd to eat with him, was come to ſee him, and to ſup; he ſet him on a diſcourſe concerning the Spaniſh <hi>Don,</hi> and having par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly made inquiry concerning his Retinue and Family, he learn'd that it was the Marqueſs of <hi>L.</hi> lately married at <hi>Milan,</hi> where he had eſpouſed the Daughter of the Count <hi>N.</hi> one of the moſt Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons in all <hi>Italy,</hi> of whom he was ſo jealous, that there was but two old women that ſerv'd her, that had the liberty of entring her Chamber; neither would he have her to be ſeen by any of his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>Camille,</hi> ſo was the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> nam'd, did on a ſuddain fall into a profound ſilence, ſeriouſly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what the Captain did tell him, not doubting but that the voice that had Charm'd him did belong to the beautiful Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This made him more earneſt than ever to ſee her, and he was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47241:12"/>
already almoſt fallen in Love; he did eat little or nothing, during that meal, and dyed with impatiency to have the Captain gone, that he might, when alone, make a new ſearch after ſome means to pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Chamber. The very Idea which he did frame to himſelf of that beautiful Lady, upon the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's words, did inflame him with love, and the Jealouſie of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, which did detain her in that Captivity, did already inſpire him with ſuch deſigns, as did flatter him with ſome hopes of a good fortune. The Captain being at laſt gone, he ſhuts the Cabin door, and with the Candle in his hand, ſearches and examines every board one after another, above, beneath, on the right, on the left, all over, but no hopes. He Torments himſelf, ſweats, ſighs, and almoſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, he would endeavour to make ſome hole, with an Iron he had found, when fortune guided his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47241:12"/>
eyes upon a knot in a board, which did anſwer juſt upon the Ladies bed, and that could be got out without much difficulty. Never was joy comparable to his, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently peeps through the hole, and ſees the moſt beautiful woman that ever was in the World, in a moſt Magnificent undreſs, who was at her Toylet undreſſing her ſelf for bed. He could not ſee her but of one ſide, and the hole being but ſmall, he could but imperfectly diſcern ſuch Features, as were of power to have inchanted a man much leſs prepoſſeſt than he was: but he did ſee enough to accompliſh his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and yet think himſelf the happieſt man in all the World. Nothing on earth could have drawn him from thence; and he us'd no other Caution than the putting out of his Candle, for fear of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and was preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for a moſt Charming pleaſure at her going in bed, when fickle
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47241:13"/>
fortune, who had been ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, did preſently fill his heart with darkneſs; for the Marqueſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred the Chamber, to go to bed, went and hung his Cloak (an Ornament which the Spaniſh Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity will not allow to be quitted but rarely) upon that very place, where was the little peep-hole; a moſt ſorrowful vail unto the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Camille</hi> which caus'd a ſad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe betwixt his heart, and that moſt Charming object. His ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is eaſy to be imagin'd, yet he left not his poſt, but making uſe of his Ears, where his eyes could not reach, he heard certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which did not pleaſe him leſs, than what he had ſeen; They were little Jarrs between the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the wife, which did ſpeak the ill underſtanding, that there was between them; The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies complaints againſt the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings of her Lord; and his reproaches on her Humour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47241:13"/>
of Courtſhip. Our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this bottome greater and fairer hopes than ever, he did paſs the beſt part of the night, in fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf ſuch Ideas, as affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him as much content as would to others, every Charming reality: at laſt he muſt go to bed, for there had not been any noiſe heard in the Chamber of two hours: but how can a perſon ſleep, that has his mind fill'd with what he had beheld that day? and what he did hope to ſee the next morning, if fortune would have it, that the Jealous Husband ſhould riſe before the Lady, and take the envious Cloak along with him? That which troubled him moſt was the wind, which ſtill continuing favourable, would not let him long enjoy this Happineſs: For it was probable that with ſuch a wind they would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the next day at <hi>Barcelona</hi>; which would put an end to his adventure, except love, who is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47241:14"/>
pleas'd with extraordinary things, ſhould favour him with ſome turn of fortune, of which he durſt not much flatter himſelf. The beſt part of the night he ſpent in thoughts, and yet in his opinion paſſed it well, though he had had no ſleep. So ſoon as he did ſee day appear, he aroſe, but it was ſomewhat too early yet for perſons that had no ſuch diſquiet as he had in his mind. He fitted the knot to its hole, and had the patience to waite a great while, inceſſantly hearkning with a ſtrange anguiſh of mind, whether the Marqueſs was not ſtirring, which unfortunately to him did not riſe ſo ſoon that day, as he us'd to do; and when up, he walked in his Chamber till he was advertis'd, that they were in ſight of <hi>Palamos.</hi> Then out he went in his Spaniſh <hi>decorum</hi> to behold that City. His Lady who was yet in bed, and who had the ſame Curioſity, got out of it in a pretty kind of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47241:14"/>
to run to the window. Then it was that our good <hi>Pilgrim</hi> had that happy ſight which he had ſo much deſired, for in that haſte in which the Lady had riſen, ſhe ſhew'd him ſuch things as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inchant the Gods. He was not contented with this, but Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with ardor and love, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo went to his Chamber window, which was very near unto that in which the Marchioneſs was; and but half ſhewing himſelf, leſt any one elſe ſhould ſee him, he made her a Reverence much more amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than profound, looking on her with Eyes that did ſpeak ſome part of thoſe things which he felt in his Soul. The beautiful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs (who according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Italian Ladies, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expert in that Language) was at firſt ſurpriz'd to ſee ſo near her a man with ſo good a meen; but after ſhe had look'd about, to ſee if any body did obſerve her, ſhe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47241:15"/>
did very obligingly anſwer his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. Our amorous <hi>Pilgrim</hi> would gladly have had this Language of the eyes changed, into an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the mouth, but it was too much to be fear'd, that they would have been heard. And the Lady who did fear to be ſurpriz'd by her Guardians, or Husband, durſt not make any longer ſtay at the window. <hi>Camille</hi> who did follow her every where with his eyes and heart, did retire preſently alſo to his former port, where he did behold the Marchioneſs, who was got to bed again, who not imagining, to be obſerv'd, lay in ſuch a poſture, by reaſon of the great heat of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as was capable to kill a man with love. Neck, Breaſt, Arms, Feet Legs; in fine, all the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Charming things in the World, were expos'd at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our <hi>Pilgrim's</hi> eyes, who at this ſight did quickly loſe the reſt of his liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47241:15"/>Preſently after, her women came in to dreſs her, and <hi>Camille,</hi> who had received as much as he wanted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, for fear that amongſt ſo many eyes there might be ſome, that might light accidentally upon his peep-hole, which would ſpoil all. Imagining alſo, that in ſo great a buſtle of Women he ſhould have but an imperfect view of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>Never any man ſo pleas'd as he, if his good fortune had laſted but ſome time longer; but they ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached nearer <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of that moment, which was to part them, and that would peradventure, make him loſe for ever the ſight of what he ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loved: Good Gods! would he frequently cry out ſighing, ſome blaſts of a contrary Wind! His pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were not heard; time preſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and finally there muſt be a reſolution taken to ſpeak out ſome way, whereby he might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47241:16"/>
he found ſome paper, pen and ink, and without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, he wrote ſome Italian Verſes to this purpoſe.
<q>
                  <l>When by a too Rigorous Fate,</l>
                  <l>Moſt beauteous Lady, your curſt mate</l>
                  <l>Shall force you, through his jealous Rage,</l>
                  <l>To free your ſelf; I dare engage,</l>
                  <l>By a certain am'rous Art,</l>
                  <l>When juſt y'are ready to depart,</l>
                  <l>To have a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> wait at hand,</l>
                  <l>In Obedience t' your command.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Having finiſh'd his Verſes, he waited till he ſaw no body in the Ladies Chamber, and having rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the paper, he put it through the hole, which being juſt in the Ladies ſight, could not fail of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eyes upon it. She was at firſt ſurpriz'd at the Novelty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which caus'd her to bluſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, not doubting but it was expoſed there by that Cavalier which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47241:16"/>
ſhe had ſeen at the window, &amp; whoſe good meen had raiſed in her a great Curioſity to know what he was: but when ſhe reflected on thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which he might have made uſe of by the means of that hole, during the freedome which ſhe had taken all the time that ſhe had been in that Cabin, it wanted but little, that an Anger mixed with baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did not produce ſome kind of hatred againſt a man, of whom ſhe had ſo little knowledge. She was ſtrangly buſied in her thoughts, and knew not what to reſolve; mean time the paper which ſhe ſaw to wag continually, giving her an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream deſire to ſee what it might be, and fearing on the other hand that ſome body would come into the Cabin, her anger and ſcruples were forc'd to give place to her Curioſity; ſhe approached, took the Note, looked through the hole, and did ſee a <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> whoſe good meen did ſomewhat appeaſe her; ſhe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47241:17"/>
preſently withdrew, and having ſeated her ſelf again upon her bed, ſhe unfolded the paper with a mind ſtrangely taken up with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. In ſuch a condition as ſhe was at that time, evil-treated by an Husband, which ſhe had never lov'd, and who prepar'd himſelf to make her ſuffer new afflictions in a Country, where women are yet greater ſlaves than in that, from whence ſhe came, nothing could be offered, that could bring her more content, than that which the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> did write. Till then ſhe had not been a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without wiſhing, that the Veſſel might ſplit upon the Coaſt, or that it might fall into the hands of the <hi>Turk,</hi> rather than arrive in <hi>Spain</hi>; and never ceaſed her Tears, ſince ſhe had ſeen Land. And yet when the heavens grant her her deſires in a more favourable manner than ſhe had required, and when ſhe diſpar'd of making
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47241:17"/>
ſhipwrack, or falling into the <hi>Pirates</hi> hands, being almoſt at the Gates of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> ſhe tremblingly looks upon the ſuccour which is offer'd her, ſhe ſtaggers in her reſolution, ſhe loſes her Courage, and fears to imploy a man, that has nothing in his perſon, but what aſſures, and gives her to underſtand, that he is a gallant perſon. Of truth ſhe was not long in thoſe irreſolutions, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt her ſight upon <hi>Spain,</hi> and made ſome reflections upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy life, which ſhe was going to lead there, ſhe preſently reſolv'd to give her ſelf up to the Conduct of a perſon, that ſeemed to be ſent to her by the heavens to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. She would willingly have ſignify'd ſo much to him; but it was long ſince all that belong'd to writing was forbid her, &amp; one of her women being come into her Cabin, neither could ſhe come near unto the little hole, in which ſeeing the generous <hi>Pilgrim's</hi> eye to glitter;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47241:18"/>
ſhe contented her ſelf in giving him to underſtand, with ſuch ſigns as the <hi>Italians</hi> are very expert in, that ſhe did very much like and approve of the tender of his ſervices, and that he ſhould not be unhappy, if he could take her out of that deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition to which ſhe was reduced. At laſt <hi>Camille,</hi> who ſtood moſt attentively examining even the very leaſt twinckling of an eye, did interpret it after this manner; and it may be imagined, that the <hi>Pilgrim's</hi> apprehenſion might very well reach as far, as the Ladies dumb diſcourſe. Never was lover ſo pleas'd with himſelf as he. He would not have Chang'd his fortune for a Monarch's Diadem, no, not for the Pope's Triple Crown. The leaſt look, a kind geſture, or ſome favourable ſign, did afford him more content, than the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World would give unto the moſt Ambitious of Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47241:18"/>This pretty ſport laſted till they were ready to enter into the Port of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> when the Lady, being left a moment alone, drew near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and told him in a low voice, that ſhe had apprehended what he had writ, that ſhe believ'd him a man of Honourable Principles, and even ſomething more than what he appear'd to be under that <hi>Pilgrim's</hi> Habit; and that if he could deliver her from the Tyranny of a Jealous Husband, and were a perſon that would receive ſome recompence for ſo great a ſervice, ſhe did aſſure him, that he ſhould have cauſe to be ſatisfied, for having perform'd ſo generous an Action. And not giving him time to reply, fearing inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to be ſurpriz'd, ſhe deſired him to find out ſome means, by which ſhe might write or ſpeak to him, when arrived at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and ending with theſe words, ſhe put through the hole one of her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, on which ſhe had a very fair
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47241:19"/>
Diamond, with which ſhe would have preſented him; but <hi>Camille</hi> having kiſſed a thouſand times that delicate finger, did not think of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Ring: ſo that ſhe let it fall expreſly. But the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> was ſo tranſported with love and pleaſure, that he took no notice of it: And the Marqueſs being juſt come in to tell his wife, that it was time to prepare her ſelf to Land, ſhe withdrew, to <hi>Camille</hi>'s great ſorrow, who ſome moments after went out of his Chamber, to behold the beautiful Marchioneſs, and to be ſeen by her.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> who had not appear'd during all the Voyage, and had embarked himſelf in the night time, did ſurprize every body at his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon the deck; every one gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by his aire, his gate, and thoſe Acoutrements which he had under his <hi>Pilgrim's</hi> weeds, that he was nothing leſs than what he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be. The Marqueſs and his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47241:19"/>
Lady, who came forth of their Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin a moment after, found him upon the Deck leaning on his ſtaff, holding his Hat with ſhells, under his Arme, in a certain Poſture as did preſently draw their eyes upon him, though with different thoughts. The Marchioneſs had a Man to upon her head after the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> faſhion; which did cover her whole face: ſo that <hi>Camille</hi> had but the pleaſure of admiring her fine ſhape, and the Charming Aire of her whole compoſure; and that too by ſtealth, for fear of creating new Jealouſies in the Husband, who had his eyes inceſſantly fixed upon him, beholding him, as a bird of evil preſage; for he was of opinion, that the whole world had a mind to his Wife. At laſt he came near unto him, and made him ſome queſtions, to find if he were not deceived in his diſtruſt. As they were diſcourſing together, and that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Don's fears did ſtill increaſe more and more, to hear a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47241:20"/>
reaſon with ſo much wit, as this did appear to have; the Captain of the Veſſel came up to <hi>Camille,</hi> and with a Reverence that did out-paſs what was due to an ordinary <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,</hi> he asked him if he had not loſt a Ring, ſhewing him at the ſame time, that which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs had let fall from her finger, and told him that he had juſt then found it in his Chamber; <hi>Camille,</hi> who had not the leaſt thought of the favour, which the Marchioneſs had intended him, anſwer'd him, no, and that it did not belong unto him: but the Marqueſs having preſently known it, did moſt terribly bluſh; and God knows with what fury his Soul was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly poſſeſs'd! yet he diſſembled all, and choſe rather to loſe the Ring, than to divulge his ſhame, in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be his Wives. He left the unfortunate <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> for preſently his firſt ſuſpitions had fallen on him again, and retiring into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cauſed the Marchioneſs to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47241:20"/>
call'd, with ſuch a cold Air, as did diſguiſe the rage and violence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſſions, which then poſſeſſed him: he enquired of her, what ſhe had done with her Diamond. The poor diſtreſſed Lady, more pale than death, fearing that ſhe had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> anſwer'd him in a ſtammering voice, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ſhe had loſt it. Then did the Jealous Husband, giving a full vent unto his fury, let himſelf be carried away to ſuch violent actions as were very unworthy a perſon of his quality. <hi>Camille</hi> who knew not the reaſon, why the Marqueſs and his Lady were retired, ſtrange ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the noiſe he heard, run to his Cabbin to learn what might be the occaſion: there he beheld the lovely Marchioneſs leaning upon her bed, and her unworthy Husband, in a great fury, walking in the room, and giving her all manner of ill Language. Nothing could more grieve his Soul, than that ſad Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47241:21"/>
he was a thouſand times in a reſolution to go in to them, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſuch Tears as did rend his heart in pieces, the which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent he would have given his life. Nothing but the conſideration of the loſs of the Marchioneſs, which he foreſaw would be infallible, if he ſhould proceed ſo far in his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did prevent him. He would gladly have known the cauſe of this quarrel, not believing that he had given any ſuch occaſion to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, who being ſomewhat more cool, was going to inform him of all things, by thoſe reproaches that he had begun to make to his wife: when he had notice given him, that the Governour of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> who was his near Kinſman, was coming in perſon to receive him, and that his Skiff was already got near to the veſſel; upon which, laying aſide the reſt of his anger againſt ſome other time, he left his wife in the Cabbin, that ſhe might have ſome time to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47241:21"/>
recollect her ſelf, and went forth to meet the Governour. The deſolate Marchioneſs in this affliction greater than can be expreſs'd, for having been thus villainouſly betray'd by a perſon, for whom ſhe had at firſt ſight conceived a great eſteem, was framing within her ſelf moſt ſtrong reſolutions, never more to conſide ſo lightly in perſons that ſhe did not know, and as ſhe was going forth ſhe eſpy'd the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> locking through the hole. Ah! Traytor, ſaid ſhe to him, did I preſent you with that Diamond, but to ruine me by it? go, I ſhall be revenged if I can; and without ſtaying for an anſwer, ſhe followed her Husband. <hi>Camille,</hi> who was afflicted even to death, to be call'd Traytor, by that perſon that he would have leaſt betray'd of all the world, was a while like a man poſſeſt with ſorrow, deſpair, and amazement. Traytor! Traytor! did he repeat twice or thrice over, what Treaſon can I have committed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47241:22"/>
againſt her? I that have not known her but one day, and that would ſacrifice a thouſand lives to do her ſervice. With this he let himſelf drop upon a Bench, and reflecting on that which the Matchioneſs had reproached him concerning a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and then on the Ring which the Captain would have given him before the Marqueſs, believing that it was his; it came in his mind, that he had ſeen ſuch a one on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs finger, and thus little by little unravelling this cruel Miſtery, he eaſily did perceive that he was the only cauſe of all that evil. In what deſpair did he fall on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den? but not to loſe time in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous exclamations, he went to the Captain, and did engage him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him that Ring; then preſently running to the other end of the ſhip, he found that the Governour was newly arriv'd, and that he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing with the Marqueſs. He takes the opportunity of thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47241:22"/>
to reſtore to the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs her Ring, but as he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es her ſhe flyes, and thus they both went round the deck. <hi>Camille,</hi> who perceiv'd this her diſdain, was forc'd at laſt to ſhew her the Diamond, to let her know it was to reſtore it that he would approach her. But the Marchioneſs did underſtand it otherwiſe, and believing that this <hi>Pilgrim</hi> was of intelligence with her Husband, who doubtleſs had given him that Ring as a reward of his Treachery, ſhe imagin'd that he ſought how to bring her into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble: She was alſo cruelly vexed, that he had the confidence to ſhew it her, as glorying in it; and raiſing her Manto a little, ſhe look'd upon him with the eyes of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was infinitely angry at his inſolency. At which our unhappy lover, apprehending that ſhe would not receive it, ſtood ſtill looking upon her, with a ſad and afflicted countenance, which was the only
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47241:23"/>
thing capable of juſtifying him, at that preſent. But when the heart is prepoſſeſſed with any thing, the impreſſion of it is not ſo ſoon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off. The Marchioneſs could not ſee any thing in this buſineſs: but what did accuſe the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> of a moſt palpable Treaſon, or at leaſt of an indiſcretion, of which a perſon as he ſeemed to be in her eyes, was not capable of: yet ſhe could not but feel ſomthing within her ſelf, which ſeemed to ſpeak him leſs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than he appear'd; and yet knew not why, and ſhe was troubled, that ſo accompliſh'd a perſon, and who did appear to her ſo worthy, could ſubmit to do ſo baſe an action.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Civilities at laſt being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which on ſuch occaſions are commonly ſomewhat long amongſt <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Marqueſs and his Lady enter'd into the Governours Boat, to go to ſhoar. And <hi>Camille</hi> in that of the Captains, which he gave him, and which he made to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47241:23"/>
follow cloſe that of the Governours. They arrived almoſt at the ſame time upon the Mole, where they met with the Governours Lady, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with divers Ladies and Gentlemen of the Country, who waited for the Marchioneſs to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement her; <hi>Camille</hi> would gladly have found out ſome means to ſpeak a word to her in the crowd, before he ſhould be wholly depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſight of her; but there was no likelihood of approaching her in the dreſs he was in, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch a Concourſe. He did ſee her take Coach, with the other Ladies, and having follow'd them to the Palace, where the Marqueſs was to reſide with the Governour, he went to ſeek out ſome Lodgings for himſelf.</p>
            <p>He paſſed the whole night in ſighs and regrets, the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary comfort of deſolate Lovers, ſeeking within his mind after ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might make his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47241:24"/>
appear to the Object of his love, and juſtifie himſelf of a Crime which he would not have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the laſt of Women. He durſt not hope for ſo much Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to ſpeak to her, imagining that in the opinion ſhe had of him, ſhe would not make one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it? but he did not believe it wholly impoſſible, that by contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intreagues upon intreagues, he might get a Letter ſafely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to her. He knew that in thoſe kind of things, the ſureſt way was to act Perſonally; and not truſt to others. Therefore he try'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a little good management of his own, and without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance, he could compaſs this buſineſs. In <hi>Spain,</hi> as in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Churches are the chiefeſt places where lovers repair to ſeek their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes: and thus abuſing of thoſe things, which are moſt holy, they go to commit great Crimes, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are appointed where to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47241:24"/>
ask pardon for committing them. <hi>Camille,</hi> who was not ignorant of the Spaniſh Bigotry, did imagine that the Marqueſs would not fail to go with his Wife that morning to hear Maſs, to give God thanks for their happy Voyage, and that it would be a fit place to deliver her a Note, if fortune or love would never ſo little favour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. This reſolution being taken, he intreated his Hoſt, who was an <hi>Italian,</hi> to get him conducted by ſome Perſon to the Chappel of the Palace, if there was any, or to that Church, which the Governour was us'd to frequent, he was ſerv'd as he deſired, and brought to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where he did ſee a moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Chappel, and in it the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Wife, who was hearing Maſs, and who ſeeing him enter, was much ſurpriz'd with his good meen, ſuch as was not very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily found in <hi>Pilgrims:</hi> But the Marqueſs and his Lady had paſſed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47241:25"/>
the night too ill to riſe ſo early: There had been nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, complaints, menaces, and quarrels between them, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laſted almoſt till day, were followed on both ſides with hatred, and heart-burnings, which had kept them long from ſleep. The Marqueſs, and reaſon good, would be ſatisfy'd how his Wife had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd that Diamond into that Chamber where the Captain had found it, and what ſhe intended by it: Whether it was not for that <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,</hi> who ſhe doubtleſs did know, and who did follow her under that diſguiſe. The Lady finding that he was no better inform'd of the buſineſs, took Courage, ſtood upon her defence, cry'd out, ſpoke, and threatned, as loud as her Husband. The only regret ſhe had was for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treated ſo ſeverely that <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,</hi> whom ſhe believ'd was not ſo guilty as ſhe had thought him, and who had expreſt a deſign to ſerve
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47241:25"/>
her in a handſome manner; not that ſhe did wholly excuſe his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in letting that Ring be ſeen by her Husband, but ſhe did believe that there might be ſome ill fortune in it, but no ill deſign; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon did chide her ſelf for having ſo ſoon condemned a perſon who had ſo generouſly offer'd himſelf to free her from that miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe liv'd in, not thinking ever to find again ſo fair an occaſion, for ſhe hardly had any hopes of ever ſeeing him more, after ſuch a piece of Injuſtice as ſhe had done him.</p>
            <p>The Night being paſs'd in this manner, they did not riſe, but juſt to ſit at Table; where the Governour &amp; his Lady did wait for them to dine: The Company had ſcarce begun to eat, when <hi>Donna Barbara d' Ayamon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> ſo was named the Governour's Wife, did begin a Diſcourſe of a young Pilgrim which ſhe had ſeen at Maſs, there being no quality in his Perſon that ſhe had not taken
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47241:26"/>
ſpecial notice of, and did not praiſe extremely; further ſaying, being of a more free humour than the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Country did commonly allow, that ſhe had very much wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had approached nearer her, that ſhe might have asked him of what Country he was, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that there were ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Adventure in that kind of life, that a man ſo well made as he was did lead about the World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a Pilgrim. The Vice-Roy, who was very gallant, and who having not the Diſeaſe incident to <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Husbands, had always given a modeſt liberty unto his Wife, who began not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo young, and had never been over handſome, did play upon her very much about the Pilgrim, and ſet all the Company in a good humour, except the Marqueſs, who at the very name of Pilgrim had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him a Melancholly Meen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not doubting but it was the very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47241:26"/>
Blade who had been to ſeek after his Wife in that Chappel. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtark mad to ſee his Wife well-pleas'd with what the Governour did ſay, and he look'd upon her as if he would devour her with his Eyes: The Marchioneſs, who did obſerve all thoſe Grimaces, did not much concern her ſelf with them, on the contrary ſhe did laugh at them more and more, being certain that what <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ſaid, to that Pilgrim's advantage, did give the Marqueſs as much of trouble as it afforded her of pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camille</hi> was at the Chappel the next morning again, but as unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful as the firſt time, not finding there what he ſought after. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who had extremely deſired to ſee him once more, did no ſooner caſt her Eyes upon him, but ſhe ſhew'd him unto the Governour, who had ſo much complaiſance for his VVife, as to have him call'd ſo ſoon as Maſs was ended. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47241:27"/>
made him divers Queſtions, to which he anſwer'd with ſo good a grace, and ſo much wit, that he was much taken with him as well as his VVife. He bid him come and ſee him, and that in the condition he was, if he wanted any thing he might have recourſe unto him. After the Pilgrim had given him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he was above want, he thank'd him for the favour he did him in giving him leave to wait upon him, of which he would make uſe; after this he retir'd, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſufficiently to underſtand by all that he had ſaid, as well as by his carriage, and the fine air of his Perſon, that he underſtood Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, even after the beſt manner. The Governour was much pleas'd at it, and did no ſooner ſee the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs and his Lady, but he mention'd his Wives Pilgrim unto them, for ſo he call'd him, and promiſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that they ſhould ſee him. The Marqueſs, who had not yet taken
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47241:27"/>
any notice that he knew him, did i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that it would be needleſs to conceal his knowledge of him any longer, and almoſt dead for fear this Traytor ſhould come to the Palace, if he uſed not ſome Stratagems to put it off; he drew aſide the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and told him, that he knew not of what Pilgrim he did ſpeak, but that if it was a certain Raſcal who was come in the ſame Veſſel with him from <hi>Genoua,</hi> and conceal'd himſelf all the time that he had been at Sea, he did declare to him, that he was the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and moſt wicked perſon in all <hi>Italy</hi>; that he had known him upon the Veſſel, and had ſpoken to him; that he was a <hi>Bandite</hi> of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who had been above a year Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> whence at laſt he had made his eſcape, after he had been convinc'd of having been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Spye by the Enemies of that State: That doubtleſs he came into <hi>Spain</hi> upon ſome ſuch like deſigns,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47241:28"/>
and that for his part, if he were in a place where he had any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he would certainly ſecure him, and detain him in a Dungeon, till he had confeſſed what he came for into <hi>Spain</hi> under that diſguiſe, or that at the leaſt he would ſend him back to <hi>Italy.</hi> All this he ſpoke to him as an Adviſe of great conſequence which he ought not to deſpiſe. The Governour did hearken to him with a great amazement, not being able to quit very eaſily the good Opinion which he had conceived for the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, who appear'd to him nothing leſs than what the Marqueſs would make him to be. <hi>Might you not, my Lord,</hi> ſaid he twice unto him, <hi>miſtake your ſelf? and do you know him well? for he qualifies himſelf a</hi> Roman, <hi>and I can aſſure you that he has not the accent of</hi> Genoua, <hi>and that a man who had ſo much wit as this ſeems to have, had not need to take upon him the Employ of a Spye. If he is ſo as you repreſent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47241:28"/>
him,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs, <hi>it cannot be the ſame perſon; and I adviſe you once more,</hi> continued he, raiſing of his Voice, <hi>that you take good notice of him; for I know what he hath done in more than one place</hi>; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, to make good what he had ſaid before, he invented tvvo or three ſtories, ſuch as his jealous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour did ſuggeſt unto him; unto vvhich the Governour had much to do to give credit. Mean time, as he could not give a gueſs at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which did make the Marqueſs ſpeak this; he did believe it part of the duty of his Office, not wholly to neglect his advice; and after he had expreſs'd hovv much he vvas obliged to him for it, he told him, that he believed that this Pilgrim vvould come to ſee him that day, that he vvould examine him, and then he ſhould knovv vvhat he had to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camille</hi> who knew nothing of thoſe good Services vvhich vvere rendred
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47241:29"/>
him at the Palace, vvas tranſported vvith joy to have advanced his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo far vvith the Governour, as to be invited by him to give him a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, which would give him the moſt favourable acceſs in the World at his Palace, vvhereby he might have the opportunity to ſee, perhaps to ſpeak, or at leaſt to vvrite unto the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Marchioneſs. He already dyes with Impatiency that the fit hour to render that Viſit in is not come yet. At laſt he goes to the Palace, vvhere the Governour made him a no leſs gracious reception than he had done in the morning at the Chappel. He examines, he queſtions, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him on divers things, and finds not the leaſt ſign in him of vvhat he vvas accuſed; on the contrary a great Fond of Honour, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a perſon of Quality, and his Converſation ſo charming, that he vvas amazed hovv the Marqueſs could entertain ſuch a thought of him, if this vvas that perſon vvhich
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47241:29"/>
he had ſeen, and had entertain'd in diſcourſe on the Ship. Mean time, the duty of his Charge, requiring that he ſhould proceed further; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſpoken during ſometime of things in general, he came to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and ask'd him by vvay of raillery, if it vvere a ſpirit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, or ſome ſecret Deſign vvhich he might have in <hi>Spain,</hi> that had made him undertake to travel thither under that Pilgrims Habit: <hi>Camille</hi> anſwer'd him ſmile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, That there was more of a Caprichio than of a deſign in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; but that knowing the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had for all thoſe that did vow themſelves to S. <hi>Jaques,</hi> he had taken in hand a Palmers ſtaff to ſerve him as a Paſs. The Governour replyed, That he knew well he had no occaſion of any ſuch aide, and then, putting on a more ſerious countenance, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there had been very ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports made of him, which he could
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47241:30"/>
not attribute but to his diſguiſe; that therefore he did adviſe him to take an Apparel more ſuitable to a perſon of Quality, as he did believe he was, and that if he had no buſineſs in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> that he ſhould quit that City ſo ſoon as he could: That he would allow him three days to end his buſineſs in, during which time he would do well not to let himſelf be ſeen, and leſs about the Palace than in any other place: That he would have him believe it was with an extreme regret that he acted thus; and that if he could have given cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit but to part of thoſe things which had been ſpoken againſt him, he had been obliged to treat him with much more ſeverity than he did: That if he wanted mony or any thing elſe to retire himſelf from thence, he ſhould but name it and he ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all things neceſſary, but that abſolutely he could not diſpenſe from giving him that order. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille,</hi> amaz'd and confounded at
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47241:30"/>
once with the Governour's Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and with ſo cruel and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a blow, after he had told the Governour that he was the moſt unhappy of all men to have given an occaſion for ſuch evil impreſſions, which he could attribute but to his ill fortune; he did return him thanks for all thoſe favours which he had received from him, aſſuring him that ſince he was pleas'd to give him three days time longer before his departure from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> he would employ them to ſuch a uſe as ſhould not give to any perſon the leaſt cauſe of complaint, or of any ſuſpition as to his conduct; and in this manner he took leave of the Governour.</p>
            <p>No man more diſconſolate than <hi>Camille,</hi> to find himſelf on ſuch a ſudden fallen from all thoſe amorous hopes which he had too ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and what was worſt of all to be obliged to quit the City within three days, a ſhort time for a Lover;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47241:31"/>
at leaſt if he could but once have ſpoken or writ to the Marchioneſs, and taken her off of thoſe ſo diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious reſentments which ſhe had for him, and that he might but hope to take his leave of her; but he is baniſhed from the Palace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to approach it: That was too ſevere: a Lover may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſuch things, but it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he will not obſerve them. It is rare to betray ones ſelf; and it was not to be expected that <hi>Camille,</hi> who lov'd more than all the men in the World, ſhould be in this point more exact than others; ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had a long time afflicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on this unhappy condition of the affairs of his heart, a deſpair ſeized him; he reſolves to dye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than depart after that manner. An Adventure ſo happily begun, was not to be concluded after ſuch a manner, and it came in his head that peradventure he ſhould not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as he did imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:47241:31"/>He did not know what reaſon the Governour might have to uſe him thus, at the very time that he did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him with ſuch honour and bounty as out-paſſed what ſuch a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure as he repreſented might expect: There was great likelyhood that all this came from the Marqueſs, who upon the jealouſie which he had conceived of him on the account of the Ring, would not be wanting in employing all his Intereſt with the Governour to make him quit the City. But he did not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Governour himſelf was not tainted with that diſeaſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that his Wife had ſhew'd him ſo much kindneſs before him that morning in the Chappel; ſo that he had been concern'd at it himſelf, and the Governour had look'd upon her twice or thrice earneſtly, ſo as to let her underſtand that ſo much eagerneſs did not very well pleaſe him. That which did the more confirm him in that Opinion, was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47241:32"/>
the forbidding of him to approach near the Pallace; ſo that he held it already for certain, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of State and Policy which that Lord had made uſe of to be rid of him, were but the meer Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a jealous temper: He was fully reſolv'd to give him ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that point without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to himſelf; for beſides that he was already prepoſſeſt with a too beautiful Object, to have the leaſt thought on any other Woman, <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi> was not the moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World in his Eyes, and the Governour had not hazarded much in truſting her with him.</p>
            <p>Part of the night having been employed in making all thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, without being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide poſitively, if his unhappineſs did proceed from the Governour's or the Marqueſſes jealouſie; he did paſs the remnant of it on the means to write to the Marchioneſs, becauſe that the time preſſed if he were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47241:32"/>
to obey the Governour's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. He knew that in <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Fryers</hi> are the ordinary Confidents of the gallant Intrigues, by reaſon of their free acceſs into all houſes, as a priviledge annexed unto all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Character. He thought that if he could make an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him that officiated in the Governour's Chappel, he could not doubt of a good ſucceſs in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for, as to the gaining of him, that was a thing that did not much trouble him. He had learn'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Fryers</hi> who reſiſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would be tempted with Mony; he mention'd this in the Morning to his Hoſt, who told him, That he did very well know that worthy Chaplain, and that he would bring him to dine with him, if he deſired it. To begin that way with a <hi>Monk</hi> is to hold the right courſe; the Match is concluded, the Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's ready, and the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes with a freſh-coloured
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47241:33"/>
face, like a good <hi>Jacobin</hi> as he was. In <hi>Spain</hi> thoſe perſons do not ſet forth the poverty of the Country, abundance of Beads, but little Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence ſerves their turn: They ſit at Table, they eat and drink a little better than in the Refectory: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, the Pilgrim, plays his part, and the Reverend Father much better his. Friendſhip from the one to the other, Healths and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, aſſurances of Services, and the fineſt tenderneſs in the World flew about; drink but once with thoſe Reverend Fathers, and and it is an eſtabliſhed Acquaintance even to the next World; and if you have no need of their Service, at leaſt you ſhall have a ſhare in their Prayers whether you will or not. <hi>Camille</hi> did not yet much trouble himſelf to have Prayers ſaid for his Soul; he having occaſion to make uſe of Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> thus was he named, more as to this World then for the next; at the end of the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47241:33"/>
they fell into a diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Governour's Court. He found that the Father was perfectly well-inſtructed in all things; that he lodged in the Palace; that he had as great a Power there as any Chaplain could have, and that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he could better than any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, render him that piece of Service which he deſired; he gave a true byaſs to the buſineſs, takes the good Father aſide, and tells him, that having taken that Habit which he did ſee him wear through a Vow which he had made to S. <hi>Jago</hi>; he knew that he was obliged to make ſome charitable deeds, to cauſe Prayers to be ſaid in his behalf, and that he did not believe that he could put his charity into better hands than his; whereupon he drew out of his pocket a purſe of Piſtols, of which he gave fifty unto the Reverend Father, who return'd him Curteſie upon Curteſie, mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47241:34"/>
a quantity of words one upon another by way of Thankſgiving and Prayers, of which he ſcarce did underſtand the ſenſe, ſo much did the Rapture that he was in by this magnificent charity tranſport him beyond himſelf.</p>
            <p>This ſtep being made, which was the moſt eſſential in the whole buſineſs. <hi>Now, Father,</hi> ſaid <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, might I obtain a favour of you? Alas, Sir,</hi> replyed Father <hi>Andrew</hi> with much earneſtneſs, <hi>what would not any one do for you. I do believe you,</hi> continued the Pilgrim, <hi>to be an honeſt and a good man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope, that in declaring this to you in way of Confeſſion, I run no hazard, and that you will ſerve me therein if it lyes in your power. You know,</hi> continued he, <hi>that with in theſe two or three days there is come into the Pallace a certain Lady from</hi> Italy, <hi>who is called the Marchioneſs of</hi> C. <hi>I have ſome buſineſs with her, and cannot get to ſpeak to her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47241:34"/>
of her Husband who is very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Jealous</hi>! replyed Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, yea more than any man in the World. So that I would willingly have a Letter delivered unto her,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Camille, and I believe that there is no hurt in that. Alas, not in the leaſt,</hi> replyed the ſcrupulous Father, <hi>and you need do no more than to give it me. I do promiſe you, upon the faith of a good-Religious, as I am, that you ſhall have an Anſwer before you go to Bed. If it prove ſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Camille, there are fifty Piſtols more for Charities. I tell you,</hi> replyed the zealous Father <hi>Andrew, that you ſhall have it, for you are too chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and too honeſt a man not to have your Prayers and Vows granted in Heaven.</hi> This Agreement being made, and there being no further occaſion of Requeſts or Promiſes between them, they alter'd their diſcourſe; and Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was as earneſt to go earn the other fifty Piſtols as <hi>Camille</hi> was to ſee
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47241:35"/>
the Anſwer which the Marchioneſs would make him, ended here his Viſit, and having the Letter he went to labour to bring about ſo pious a deſign.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs was not ſo eaſie as he imagin'd, for the Marqueſs, who underſtood ſuch things better than any <hi>Fryer</hi> of them all, and who had no great Faith in their Girdle, was continually preſent during the Viſit that this came to give to his Wife; ſo that the good Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> did begin to deſpair of getting the other fifty Piſtols that Night, when by good fortune the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour came in, towards whom the Marqueſs advancing to receive him, he gave an occaſion to this new Mercury to accompliſh his Meſſage, in ſliding very dextrouſly the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Marchioneſs's hand, who looking upon him did underſtand by ſome ſigns he made that it was ſomething of great moment to her, and which it was not requiſite that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47241:35"/>
her Husband ſhould ſee. She with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew her ſelf into another Chamber, as if ſhe would give a free liberty to theſe Gentlemens Entertainments, and having opened the Letter ſhe found it thus.

                     <p>IN that deſpair, Madam, in which thoſe unjuſt diſtruſts which you have had of me, has plunged me, I deferre not to ſeek all the means in the World to write to you, to offer you once again my Services. You tax of Treachery a man which would rather periſh a thouſand times than have ſo much as the leaſt thought of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you. When you will know me better, you will learn that I am not of ſo mean a Rank as to commit any unworthyneſs. I know what is due to Ladies; but more than that I know what I feel for you within my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and there is no fear of falling in that Duty which is ſupported by Love. If your Ring has cauſed ſome diſorders, at the worſt you may attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47241:36"/>
it to ſome misfortune, but not to any fault of mine. It fell from your fair hand without my knowledge, and the Captain of the Galley who did find it, thinking that it was mine, did bring it to me before the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs. This is the truth, Madam, of that Adventure: If you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this juſtifying of my ſelf, as it appears to me you ſhould, and that you continue ſtill in the ſame Reſolutions you once had, make uſe of a perſon who offers you not his Life and Fortunes only, but who dyes with Love for you. It is time to think on it, for I have but three days to ſtay in this City, the Governour hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given me orders, I know not for what reaſons, to be gone after that time. I could however find out ſome means to continue longer here, if you did deſire it. What will not a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do for the object of his Love, I wait your orders on this. The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, who ſhall deliver you this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is a perſon that I have wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47241:36"/>
in my Concerns, and in whom you may confide: Be confident, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that nothing ſhall be forgotten to render me worthy of your Eſteem, and that there is no perſon that is with more Reſpect and Paſſion, than I am wholly yours.</p>

            <p>The Marchioneſs, who when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Letter had had ſome thoughts that it might come from her Pilgrim, was raviſhed with joy at the reading of it, and finding that ſhe had not deceived her ſelf, and in learning the whole ſtory of the Ring. But that which charm'd her moſt, were thoſe tender and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Sentiments which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for her, judging well by the manner of his writing, as alſo by the air of his perſon that he muſt be ſome perſon of Quality. All that eſteem which ſhe had had for him at firſt ſight, did now redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he had offered himſelf unto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47241:37"/>
her with ſo good a Grace; he had given her to underſtand in ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious a manner the deſign which he had to ſerve her, that that alone was capable to ſeize the heart of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful young Woman, that ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which was offered to her in ſo gallant a manner. It is true, that her firſt diſtruſts had ſomewhat coold her deſires; but beſides that ſhe could never condemn him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her thoughts; ſhe had at laſt in ſome meaſure better inform'd her ſelf, by what ſhe had heard from her Husband, and the wrong which ſhe conceived ſhe had done the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim on that account, had ſerv'd but to render him the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her eſteem: In fine all things elſe, beſides the Governour and his Lady, having contributed in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a thouſand times regret the not having made better uſe of the good intentions of ſo worthy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This Letter in bringing her the joy that ſhe received by hearing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47241:37"/>
from him, did wholly diſpoſe her to entertain ſuch thoughts of him as he was worthy of. She would gladly have made him an Anſwer, but as it has been ſaid before, the uſe of writing was not only forbid her as a Capital Crime, but wholly out of her Power. Mean time as Love is extreme ingenious, and that it appears more in ſuch occaſions than in any others, ſhe bethought her ſelf to write with a Bodkin, upon an Orange which ſhe had, theſe words, <hi>Be this night at ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Clock under my Window, and you ſhall have my Anſwer</hi>; after which ſhe return'd into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where was the Governour with the Marqueſs, and Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who would not be gone from thence without ſome Anſwer to his Letter, after he had perform'd the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult part, which was the delivery of it. The Marchioneſs did look upon him, and ſhewing him the Orange which ſhe ſet upon the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47241:38"/>
Window, ſhe made him ſigns to take it, and that it was all that ſhe had to give him. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was a moſt intelligent <hi>Fryer,</hi> gently takes it up, and lifting up his Cowl he made a moſt humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto thoſe Gentlemen, and ſo retired, to the Marqueſs his great ſatisfaction, who was not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mind till he did ſee him out of his Apartment.</p>
            <p>Our devout Poſtilion, but half pleas'd with his Meſſage, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an Orange for his Anſwer, was returning muſing to the Pilgrim who ſtaid for him at his Lodgings in great perplexity; he did believe that the good Father had fail'd of his deſign, ſeeing him coming with a ſomewhat mortifyed Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>Well, Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Marchioneſs is no more viſible to you, than ſhe is to others, and doubtleſs that you have not ſpoken to her. I not ſpeak to her!</hi> replyed Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> as if angry at the wrong was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47241:38"/>
him, and who dares refuſe that to a Director of twenty years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Confeſſor to the Lady Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Chaplain to my Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and a worthy Son of St. <hi>Dominick. Good God!</hi> added he, raiſing his voice, <hi>and where would you have us to be, in</hi> Barbary? <hi>No, no, Sir Pilgrim,</hi> continued he, while <hi>Camille</hi> was endeavouring to make his Excuſes with Poſtures and Grimaces, <hi>I have ſeen, I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I have delivered your Letter, it has been read, but for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I have but this Orange to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to you,</hi> which he drew out of his Slieve, <hi>and truly you muſt needs be very unhappy to have no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this buſineſs, for I always go through withal that I undertake, to the great ſatisfaction of thoſe that employ me.</hi> After that <hi>Camille</hi> had let him know that he was extremely ſatisfied with what he had done, he took the Orange, examin'd it a little better than Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47241:39"/>
done, whoſe concern was not ſo great, and preſently he diſcovered the whole Myſtery, after which tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no further notice, he put it in his Pocket in the room of fifty Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols which he took from thence, which the good Father was ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to take, ſaying, that in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he could not, and that at the moſt he would have but half, becauſe he had done but half what he had promiſed. Yet at laſt, to oblige ſo generous a Pilgrim he was perſwaded to take the whole, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him not to ſpare him in any thing that he ſhould have occaſion for him, and upon that he went his way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camille,</hi> more full of joy than would be a Lover that had received an effectual rendezvous, did wait with ſtrange impatiency the hour of that Aſſignation which was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: Prudence would not let him approach the Palace in his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims Habit after what the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47241:39"/>
had ſaid to him, but the fear that he had leaſt the Marchioneſs ſhould not know him from her Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in another dreſs, or that ſhe durſt not truſt to another, he being by that better diſtinguiſh'd from all other perſons, he reſolv'd not to change his Apparel; ſo that being gone out at a fit hour, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt at eleven before the Palace. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had pretty well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him on which ſide was the Marchioneſſes Apartment, and that her Windows did anſwer upon the Sea; ſo that he could not miſtake. He gets under them, and perceiving ſome light in them, he goes behind a Pillar till the Marchioneſs ſhould appear and make him ſome ſign. In ſuch buſineſſes time ſeems long, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment lengthens; and it ſeem'd to <hi>Camille,</hi> who had his Eyes faſtned to thoſe Windows, that he had already waited a long time, when at laſt he did ſee a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy appear, and as he imagin'd it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47241:40"/>
could be none but the Marchioneſs: He immediately ſteps out of his lurking-place and ſhew'd himſelf. He was preſently known by the Shells and other gaudy things which Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims uſually wear on their Hats which glittered in thoſe bright nights that are common in thoſe Countries in the Summer Seaſon; and ſoon after the Window was ſhut again. He thought that it was not yet time, but a quarter of an hour after he ſaw a little door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whence there came forth an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Duenna,</hi> who call'd him, and made him go in, ſaying, in a low Voice, that all that day they had been concerned for him, that he had been ſought for all over the Town, and that they had but juſt ſpy'd him from the Window; he was advis'd to be diſcreet and wiſe, and that he ſhould be the happyeſt of all men. And hereupon, taking him by the hand, ſhe led him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light through an obſcure way
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47241:40"/>
till they were come into a low room very like that of ſome old waiting Woman, in a corner of which there was a Lamp burning, there being nothing elſe in it but a Bed, and that none of the beſt, two Flag-Chairs, and a Trunk, which it is probable did ſerve for a Wardrobe. She buſily told him that he ſhould ſtay a little, and that when all things ſhould be ready to receive him, ſhe would fetch him. Happy <hi>Camille,</hi> not daring to make the leaſt noiſe, all tranſported with joy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, did only kiſs twice or thrice her hand, making her ſigns that ſhe might be gone, and that he would ſtay there till ſhe came again: upon this the <hi>Duenna</hi> who knew with what impatiency ſhe was expected back, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of her Commiſſion might be known, did get up a Ladder which was in the room, and went into the Chamber over it through a Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door to give an account of what ſhe had done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47241:41"/>To conceive well the condition that the amorous <hi>Camille</hi> was in at that time, one ſhould love as much as he did. He was ſenſible that the Marchioneſs did ſhew him more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than ever he could have hoped for, and that when he thought his buſineſs deſperate, on the ſudden he did find himſelf upon the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of being the happyeſt of all men. Theſe Reflections rais'd his Thoughts and Idea's, repreſenting to himſelf the beauteous Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome time after one manner, ſometime after another, who told him this, to which he anſwer'd; that thus reliſhing beforehand ſuch charming pleaſures, that nothing but the reallity of what he did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine could afford him greater; ſo long as the heat of his amorous ravings could afford him any matter of entertainment, time did not ſeem long to him; and ſetting aſide ſome little Impatiences which from time to time did ſeize on him, he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47241:41"/>
did ſpend paſſably well ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that dull Chamber; but when it began to be long before the old Woman did return, and that he had begun to fear ſome back-ſtroak of Fortune or of Love, his fancy repreſenting to him every moment ſome misfortune or other, he felt no longer any thing of the former ſweets. He had almoſt been two hours dancing Attendance, and had already gone above a thouſand times about the Chamber, which he had viſited to divert himſelf from one end to the other, there not being a Rag, or Clowt, Shell of red, Pot of <hi>Pomatum,</hi> with which that Trunck was filled, which had not paſs'd through his hands, and wherein he had not thruſt his Noſe. He already did no longer hope for any thing of what he had promiſed to himſelf, and was very fearful of paſſing the Night upon that Trunck; for as to the Bed, he fear'd too much the ſmell and Society of it, when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47241:42"/>
at laſt he did ſee the Trap-door lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and the <hi>Duenna</hi> to appear, who made him ſigns to come up; Preſently he re-aſſumes his joy, and in two or three ſteps flies up to the Trap-door; he beholds a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Chamber, enlightened but with one ſingle Flambeau, which was placed upon the Table. The <hi>Duenna</hi> made him ſign that he ſhould go to the Wall-ſide of the Bed, he advances with redoubling joys of Love which he could hardly contain in his heart, and drawing near to the Bed where lay the Lady with the Curtins drawn, he caſt himſelf upon his Knees before her, who received him with no leſs paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At the firſt on-ſet there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Tranſports and Tenderneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on both parts, ſighs on this part, ſighs on the other. <hi>Ah, Madam,</hi> cry'd out <hi>Camille</hi> twice or thrice in a languiſhing accent, <hi>what Graces, what Favours do I receive at preſent from you</hi>? he was not able to ſay
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47241:42"/>
any more in the joy he had. Mean time the old <hi>Duenna,</hi> who had no more buſineſs there, went out of the Chamber to keep Centry for fear of a ſurpriſal. The Lady, who had ſeen ſufficiently this languiſhing Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kneeling, being impatient that he ſhould riſe to an higher degree of Fortune, having no time to looſe, deſired him with a ſigh to ariſe and ſit down by her; that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was playing with the Marqueſs, and that it would not belong before he would be coming. <hi>Camille</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd with this diſcourſe, and to hear ſo good <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſpoken by a Lady of his Country who was not likely to underſtand it ſo well, opens his Eyes, diſcerns through the Curtins ſome other Features than thoſe of the Marchioneſs, and in lieu of her he finds the Governours Wife, whoſe Cornets, Ribbons, Curls, and all the other Adjuſtments with which ſhe had bedeck'd her ſelf as a new Bride, had at firſt ſight deceived
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47241:43"/>
him through the aid of the ſmall light that came into the Bed; what a change did this miſtake produce in him? his Joy and Tranſports are preſently chang'd into a dull ſilence, he looks up towards Heaven as if it had been the Author of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, and at the ſame time turning his Head another way, in lieu of riſing, as the Lady did bid him, he lets himſelf drop upon the Bed, with his Head leaning on his Arms, as if he would hide the Confuſion that he was in through that piece of Treachery which Love had lately play'd him. The Lady much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſee him in this poſture, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a tender and paſſionate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, enquires what he aileth, and whether he finds himſelf ill. He makes no Anſwer, ſhe takes him by the Arm, draws him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and finds him to be grown cold and indifferent, which ſurpriſes and frets her. Never were perſons more puſled; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47241:43"/>
her Careſſes, and intreats him to tell her what he has found in her that ſhould on the ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt him. She ſees that he ſighs, but it is for ſorrow, and not out of love. At laſt he riſes and intreats of her that he may retire. <hi>Retire</hi>! replyed ſhe, with a trembling Voice, <hi>and can you leave me in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Ah! how unhappy am I</hi>? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, holding an Handkerchief before her eyes to hide the confuſion that ſhe was in, and to receive ſome Tears which ſhe could not retain. <hi>What,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>muſt I ſee my ſelf thus ſlighted by a perſon to whom I have abandoned my Life and Honour.</hi> And finding that neither her Tears nor any thing elſe that ſhe could ſay to him of moſt tender, did move him, and that he ſtill did perſiſt in the deſign of retiring, <hi>ungrateful man,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him with a ſorrow mixed with fury, <hi>carry not thy cruelty ſo far, for thou wouldeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon me to all that rage can make a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47241:44"/>
perſon of my Quality and Courage do, when ſhe finds her ſelf treated as thou uſeſt me. Speak, draw near, and at leaſt tell me ſomething that may allay the effects of thy contempt. The Governour is not far from hence, and if thou obligeſt me to make ſome noiſe thou art loſt.</hi> Whoever elſe had been in <hi>Camille</hi>'s room, had had peradventure more Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance for a Lady, who, though none of the handſomeſt, might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomewhat leſs of rigour to be ſhewn to her, that doth never become a young man; but yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when one is prepoſſeſſed with ſuch a ſtrong paſſion as he was, and that in lieu of a charming beauty which has been long expected and thought to be in poſſeſſion, an Object is met with which was not ſought after, it becomes the more hateful, and the Heart being grieved at ſuch a deceit, it takes up quite contrary thoughts to the former, and it is very difficult to reclaim it.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47241:44"/>
Howbeit <hi>Camille,</hi> who look'd upon himſelf as a Priſoner in the Power of a tranſported Woman who could really ruine him, did at laſt make uſe of his prudence; he did not drive her to the extremity, and thinking on ſome more handſome put off than that of a diſguſt, he was preparing himſelf to make her ſome Excuſes upon a faintneſs of Heart, which had ſeiz'd on him, when the <hi>Duenna</hi> came in great haſt to tell them, that the Game was at an end, and the Governour coming; ſo that all that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> could do, was to embrace once more that inſenſible Lover, which in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment did force ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of kindneſs to comfort her a little, ſeeing himſelf upon the point of being rid of her. <hi>If you will not,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>put into deſpair a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that has ſo much paſſion as I have for you, render your ſelf to morrow at the ſame hour where I did ſee you this night.</hi> She had no time to ſay
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47241:45"/>
more to him, becauſe that ſhe heard the Governour coming; ſo that the <hi>Duenna</hi> had but juſt time ſufficient to open the Trap door, and go out with <hi>Camille,</hi> and that with ſuch precipitation, that her Coats being between as ſhe let it down again, and the Ladder, which was not very faſt, having ſlid from under them by their haſty motion in getting off, the Pilgrim fell with his Breech to the ground, and the old Woman remain'd hung in the Air by her Coats, which was the pleaſanteſt ſight that could be. She durſt not make any noiſe for fear of being heard by the Governour; and ſhe was making ſign to the Pilgrim to help her to get looſe; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the croſs Adventure which he had ſo lately had, and that in which he had ſhear'd with the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> he did break out into ſuch a laughter at the dangling of her Legs, that he was a long time not being able to riſe. He would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47241:45"/>
have left her in that poſture to be reveng'd of the cruel meſſage which ſhe had lately deliver'd to him, by which he had loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Rendezvous which he had from the Marchioneſs, and perhaps the opportunity of ever having another; but having occaſion for this old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to convey him from thence, he was obliged much againſt his will to aſſiſt her; yet it was not without conſidering of her very exactly, before and behind, and laughing heartily at her, which made the <hi>Duenna</hi> ſtorm at him, and promiſe him to revenge her ſelf if ever he came again. <hi>Camille</hi> did not trouble himſelf at her Threats; being very ſorry to have been catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once there. Being led out he paſſed once again before the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Marchioneſſes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but he could ſee no more light there, and ſmall hopes of having any till day; yet he walked under them for ſome time, ſighing, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47241:46"/>
and complaining of Love, and of that hard fate which had ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly thrown him into the Arms of an homely Woman; yet in the midſt of all theſe regrets, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Reflections which he did make upon his miſtake on the tranſports of the Governeſs, and on the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>'s Adventure did ſomewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him. But it was time to go to Bed, not to ſleep; for that's not for Lovers; but to think what he ſhould do to repair that nights miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as it was day he ſent to ſeek after the moſt dear Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> from whom he kept ſecret what had befallen him with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Wife; it not becoming a well-bred man to divulge ſuch things; he only told him, That he was the moſt unfortunate of all men, and that if he did not take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of him, his deſpair would not let him live 24 hours. The oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> impatient to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47241:46"/>
learn in what he could ſerve him, imagining that it would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded, did conjure him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but to be perſwaded, that if his happineſs did depend on him only, he would make him the moſt happy perſon in the World. After this ſincere and true proteſtation, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi> told him, that if he would have him obliged to him of his life, which was much more than of his good fortune, he muſt that day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a Letter to the Marchioneſs, and endeavour by all means poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring him an Anſwer: That he would acknowledge his kindneſs ſo as that he ſhould have cauſe to be contented, and not repine at the little pains he ſhould take for him. <hi>Alas, fie, Sir, pray have no ſuch thought,</hi> ſaid the Father, ſmilingly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him. <hi>You know that we are in this World but to ſerve one another, and I do not believe there is any one that taketh more delight in obliging perſons than I do. Give me that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

added he, <hi>and only pray to God that I may find the Marchioneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and I promiſe to return you ſuch an Anſwer as you would deſire; but be the Marqueſs there or not, I will not return without bringing you news from the Marchioneſs, and deliver your Letter unto her</hi>; and without more words, he takes leave of him, and goes to ſet the Irons in the Fire.</p>
            <p>The Marchioneſs had been all night in no leſs trouble than <hi>Camille</hi>; ſhe had in the Evening feign'd her ſelf ſomewhat ill, that ſhe might ſtay in her Chamber, and not loſe the opportunity of the appointment which ſhe had made to the Pilgrim, but that pretended indiſpoſition had not had the effect which ſhe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; for the Governour and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being come to keep her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, did paſs the greateſt part of the night with her, the Governour at play with the Marqueſs and <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> in diſcourſe with her; ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47241:47"/>
that ſhe never durſt draw near to the Window, for fear of giving them any diſtruſt in caſe the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim ſhould appear and be ſeen; as indeed it had happened unto the Governour's Wife, which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently known him and made uſe of the occaſion as has been related. And the Marchioneſs was no ſooner quit of the Lady, but ſhe went alſo to the Window, but there was no more Pilgrim there, ſhe look'd every way, and waited for him with the greateſt impatiency and trouble i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, fearing that he might have been weary with waiting ſo long. The Game being ended at laſt, and the jealous Marqueſs, who had twice or thrice obſerved with what aſſiduity his ſick VVife did ſtay at the VVindow, had played with a very diſtracted mind, every moment turning his Head towards her, as if he fear'd ſome Gallant ſhould get up that way; ſo that the Governour was no ſooner got out
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47241:48"/>
of the Chamber, but that he went himſelf to ſee what was the matter, he look'd out, and after he had been ſome time there, not ſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, he ſhut the VVindow with a great deal of caution.</p>
            <p>The beautiful Marchioneſs was in ſuch a melancholy for having fail'd the Pilgrim, that ſhe could have no reſt all that night. Her Husband who did not always ſleep, when he ſeem'd ſo to do, and who had fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd that certainly his VVife had had ſome evil deſign that Evening, was more than ever confirm'd in that Opinion, when he heard her from time to time to vent moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſighs. There needed no great matter to puzzle his brains; and this wicked Pilgrim did ſo run in his mind ſince the Adventure of the Diamond, that he had no other dreams every night but of Palmer ſtaves, Cockle-ſhell-Hats, and the like, which made him be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fear; he would come every
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47241:48"/>
day at Maſs in the Palace-Chappel where he had no buſineſs; he did inſinuate himſelf into the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Favour, to render him a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit; wherefore all this, thought he, if it were not on my VVifes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? who as indiſpos'd as ſhe was, did watch two or three hours at the VVindow to ſee him paſs by. Thus did he reaſon within himſelf; if by laying his hand on her left ſide he could have made her declare in her ſleep all that ſhe had in her Heart; Oh, what a triumph that had been for him! but he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a thouſand times made tryal of that ſecret without advantage. After this he lay reproaching of himſelf for having continued ſo long at play while he ſhould have been minding his buſineſs; for, ſaid he to himſelf, with a Sex ſo perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious as that is, let a poor man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf but one moment, and he is lyable to receive during that time the greateſt Affront that can
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47241:49"/>
ever happen to him. Having paſs'd the beſt part of the Night in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting himſelf after this manner, he got up in the Morning, his Head ſo fill'd with the thoughts of this Pilgrim, that he fancyed to ſee him in every perſon that came into the Chamber. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was one of the firſt that came to viſit him, though he diſſembled ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, approaching him in a Saint-like poſture, with a wry Neck, his Hands in his great Sleeves, and a down look, he was received by the Marqueſs rather worſe than the day before. For after he had ſhew'd him a meen cold enough to freeze the fiery heat of the moſt Zelot of all Intreaguers, he heard him ſpeak during more than an hour that they walked together in the Hall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affording him any other Anſwer than <hi>yea</hi> or <hi>nay,</hi> with which Father <hi>Andrew</hi> grew at laſt weary, and finding that he could not get him by any means to enter into a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47241:49"/>
Converſation, he took the liberty to ask him how the Lady Marchioneſs did, and whether he ſhould not have the honour to give her the good morrow. <hi>No, Father,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs, very coldly, <hi>ſhe is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and you will excuſe her for this time. Heaven! how ſorry am I at it</hi>? replyed the good Father, <hi>it is at ſuch times, as when we are viſited, that we ſtand in moſt need of a wiſe Directors Conſolations; and with your liking, my Lord,</hi> added he, <hi>ſeeing that Heaven hath ſent me as it were on purpoſe, I will have her ask'd, if without diſturbing I could not ſpeak ſome words of Conſolation unto her. You will certainly diſquiet her, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> did he reply. <hi>But if ſhe had occaſion to confeſs her ſelf</hi>? conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the ghoſtly Director. <hi>She is not yet ſo ill,</hi> anſwer'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, <hi>and it is not eight days ſince ſhe was at Confeſſion. It is no matter,</hi> went on the Father, going towards

the Marquioneſſes Chamber, <hi>one knows not what may happen.</hi> She ſleeps, ſaid the other, detaining him, and this is no fit time. <hi>How? does ſhe ſo</hi>? ſa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d the zealous Father, <hi>then I will wait till ſhe awakens,</hi> and you — Father, without any more ado, ſaid the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Lord, interrupting of him ſomewhat roughly, his patience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at an end, I tell you, that here is no need of you, and that you will oblige me, not to come here again till you are ſent for. <hi>Sir, it is not uſual to treat a man of my Orders in ſuch a manner,</hi> replyed Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> without being daunted, <hi>In ſpeaking to me ſo roughly, you offend a whole Order,</hi> that might — I ſhould offend the Pope, &amp; the whol Church, ſaid the angry Marqueſs interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, with a longing deſire to break the Fryars bald Pate, if the Pope and the Church would ſee my Wife againſt my Will: and ſaying this he left his Reverence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf into his Wifes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47241:50"/>
and ſhut the Door after him.</p>
            <p>The poor Father <hi>Andrew</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly confus'd and vexed at the Marqueſs his brutiſhneſs, retir'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry penſive, but fully reſolv'd to find out ſome way of revenge, thinking himſelf unworthy of his Monkiſh Character, if he did not make him wear a pair of fair ones. He returned to the Pilgrime with a moſt ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance, and in giving him an account of the manner that that Brute had us'd him (for ſo he qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd the Marquis) he did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſs his reſentments prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that were it not for the Habit he wore, he would have made him that which he feared ſo much to be. That exceſs of cholar made <hi>Camille</hi> to laugh, maugre all the diſcontent he was in at his Embaſſies ill ſucceſs. He intreated the Father to rely on him as to the point revenge, only deſiring his aſſiſtance to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. That I fully reſolve, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and though it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47241:51"/>
ſhould coſt me the hundred Piſtols that I have received from you, I muſt and will ſpeak to the Marquioneſs this very day, and give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Letter. <hi>Camille</hi> who was not ignorant of thoſe Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſubtilties, very much rejoycing to ſee him take ſuch a reſolution, told him, to animate him the more, that in caſe thoſe hundred Piſtols were employ'd in his ſervice, he ſhould meet with another hundred at his return, and more too, if he had occaſion for them. Liberality is one the moſt advantageous, and ſureſt qualities of a Lover. Moſt commonly it ſtands in the place of Merit, and perſwades much better. That which Love cannot do in a long time, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney will perform ſome time in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> in whom a covetous humour did predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate above all other things, did find himſelf ingaged by ſo powerful an intereſt to ſerve ſo brave a Pilgrim, as not to omit ſetting on work all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47241:51"/>
that he knew of ſubtilty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treague. Vengeance and hope of a new preſent were too ſtrongly joyned together to fail; upon ſuch good ſecurity he would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the moſt difficult things in the World. He goes to <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> whoſe Confeſſor he was, as we have already ſaid, ſo that he knew the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul of her; he counterfeits a troubled mind, that he might be ask'd what it was that diſquieted him. The Lady falls in his Trap, ſhe intreats and preſſes him diverſe times to tell her what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and at laſt he informs her that the Marqueſs is jealous of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; and that having been in his appartment to viſit the Marquio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who he had heard was fallen ill, he had us'd him not as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, or his Excellencies Chaplain; but as a Meſſenger concern'd in the Governours Amours, not giving him the liberty to ſee her. <hi>Signora Donna Barbara,</hi> according to the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47241:52"/>
uſual cuſtom of women who will be themſelves jealous of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, but will not ſuffer others to be ſo; did take in great diſdain, the Marquis his diſtruſts, not thinking her ſelf leſs worthy than his Wife. Thus being carryed away with thoſe firſt tranſports, ſhe did ſpeak with ſo much ſcorn of the Husbands extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy, and the Wifes want of Merit, that ſhe gave occaſion to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrew</hi> to deſcant upon that Theme alſo, and ſay to her, all that could incenſe her and make her of his party, <hi>Nay, ſince it ſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Donna Barbara, and that this Lord is ſo apt to ſee Viſions, only becauſe my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is more civil, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what is due to Ladies than he. He ſhall be made jealous in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and we will make our ſelves ſome ſport with him. If you will ſerve me in it, Father</hi> Andrew, added ſhe, ſmiling, <hi>we ſhall both revenge our ſelves moſt pleaſantly.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing more, made anſwer,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47241:52"/>
that he was ready to obey her, in all that ſhe would be pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him; and upon that ſhe told him that ſhe would think on it, and did bid him come again to her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the evening a little before Supper, of which he fail'd not, and <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> found him in her Chamber waiting for her; ſhe laugh'd ſo ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, and asked him, if he could act very well a Gallants part; for he ſhould ſee that night the Marquioneſs in ſuch a Garb: at this, Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him to aſſume a good Meen, was willing to let the Lady ſee, that he had not quite forgot what he had formerly been, and what he yet could be upon occaſion: at which poſtures <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> laughing out-right, ſhe ſent him to one of her husbands <hi>Valets de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> to whom ſhe had before given order to fit him <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> like a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and ſhe told Father <hi>Andrew</hi> that when he ſhould be ready, he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47241:53"/>
ſhould go into the Garden, and keep himſelf hid in the <hi>Grotto</hi> of the <hi>Nayades,</hi> where ſhe would meet him with the Marquioneſs. Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> o're joy'd with a deſign ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his deſires, did ſhout with joy at ſo pretty a deſign, and did much applaud the Ladies inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity. Go and prepare your ſelf to act your part well, ſaid the Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs; for now that the Governour is not here, doubtleſs the Marqueſs will accompany us into the Garden, which will furniſh us no doubt with ſome further divertiſment, and you with a fit occaſion of revenge. But Madam, reply'd Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had no mind that the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Play ſhould light on him, I would not have this Lord to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake himſelf; for I know how furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous he is, and you can teſtifie, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that I have no hand in this, further than to obey your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; go, reply'd ſhe, and fear not any thing where I ſhall be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47241:53"/>Upon this Father <hi>Andrew</hi> goes to the <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> who did take care to accomodate him; and <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi> having ſupped, ſhe went, as ſhe us'd to do every evening, to walk in the Garden with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quioneſs, where the Marqueſs did not fail to accompany them. But becauſe the Governour was not there, the Spaniſh Cuſtom not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to entertain the Ladies, for fear of giving Jealouſie, he went to walk in an other place of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, however ſtill having his Eyes on them, for fear of ſome ſurprize. Madam, ſaid <hi>Donna Barbarae</hi> to the Marquioneſs, ſo ſoon as they were by themſelves, to ſhew you that I am a Woman of the moſt franck nature in the World, I muſt tell you that it is twenty years ſince I firſt knew a man, for whom I have a very great eſteem, and whom I cannot forbear ſeeing once a day, and in a word, from whom I reſerve no ſecrets, ſo that I intruſt him with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47241:54"/>
my greateſt as well as ſmalleſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; yet this man does not ſo ſoon deſire to ſee you, but that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighing my own intereſts, I offer to be his aſſiſtant. <hi>I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,</hi> replyed the Marquioneſs, <hi>that the example is not common, and that ſuch an action from any one but you, Madam, would very much ſurpriſe me, but one indowed with ſuch charming qualities as you have, may hazard ſomething more than ordinary, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being near ſuch a mean beauty as mine is.</hi> Madam, I do not tell you this, replyed the Governours Lady, to invite you to flatter me, or to contend of beauty with you; on the contrary you ſee the ſacrifice which I make you, of a Man whoſe heart you deſerve to poſſeſs much more than I do, and unto whoſe vows I humbly intreat you to hearken: <hi>And I, Madam,</hi> replyed the Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, <hi>who ſhall ever yield unto you in all things, except in complaiſance and generoſity of heart, I conjure you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47241:54"/>
not to ſpeak to me in the least of that Perſon, and to diſpenſe with me from ſeeing him:</hi> That cannot be, replyed <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> for I have engag'd it ſhould be otherwiſe, and we are too near him to get off again: As ſhe ended theſe words, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two or three ſteps from the <hi>Grotto</hi> of the <hi>Nayades,</hi> they ſaw come forth a Cavalier in a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent dreſs, which did as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the Marquioneſs, as all that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had newly ſaid unto her. She would preſently have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, fearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was ſome trick put upon her; but the Governours La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtopt her. <hi>Good Madam,</hi> ſaid the Marquioneſs, <hi>permit me to retire I beſeech you, or I ſhall have cauſe to complain of you.</hi> But <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had no ſooner ſeen Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Figure, but ſhe burſt out into ſuch a laughter as would not give her leave to anſwer her. At which the Marquio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtrangely confounded, believing that ſhe was certainly played upon,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47241:55"/>
would by all means be gone, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be an object to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of the Governours Lady. On the other hand, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did make moſt ridiculous poſtures in imitation of a Gallant Air; and did ſpeak ſuch pleaſant things to the Marquioneſs to undeceive her, and oblige her to ſtay, that <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi> was e'en ſpent with laughing, and the Marquioneſs began to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry in good earneſt, not deigning to anſwer, or ſo much as turn her Eyes towards the Cavalier; who ſeeing that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> could detain her no longer, was at laſt conſtrained to ask her if ſhe knew no longer, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrew.</hi> Never was a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion equal to that of the Marquio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who at the name of Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> having caſt her Eyes upon him, did preſently know him, and was for ſometime ſo diſordered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her ſelf, that ſhe knew not what to ſay, not knowing to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had brought
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47241:55"/>
her that Fryar, without he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted her with what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Pilgrim: but ſhe was preſently undeceived as to that; for the Governours Lady, who thought that ſhe had ſufficiently laught at the Marchioneſſe's coſt, not willing to let her remain any longer in the diſorder that ſhe ſeem'd to be in, did relate unto her how that all this Comedy had been invented meerly to revenge her ſelf of her husbands jealouſie, who would not allow that any one ſhould ſee her: and as ſhe was thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the watch, and who not without cauſe was more in fear than any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, did afar off eſpy the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, who was advancing towards them with a round pace: upon which he was alarmed; and would fain a been going; but <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi> did imbolden him again, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd them both to go into the <hi>Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> while ſhe would go meet the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47241:56"/>
Marqueſs, to undeceive him; but that the opportunity was too fair not to throughly revenge her ſelf by it. The Marchioneſs, who would willingly have given half her life to ſpeak with Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> was ſo ſurpris'd with joy, at the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> gave her of it, that ſhe thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to make good uſe of that happy moment.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs had all along kept the Avenue, having walked before the Garden-gate to obſerve thoſe that ſhould go in or out; when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caſt his eyes on that ſide that the Ladies were, he had ſeen certain feathers appear, which had moſt terribly affrighted him; and quite out of breath at the ſight of that Viſion, he was running as faſt as he could that way, to ſee what it was, and know whether his eyes deceived him or not: But <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> meeting him, did detain him, and enquired whether he went
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47241:56"/>
ſo faſt: <hi>Leave me, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, with ſo great a perplexity that he could ſcarce ſpeak, <hi>for Heavens ſake let me go, for I have ſeen all, and your company is too dangerous for my Wife. Why</hi>? reply'd ſhe, <hi>what is't you fear? She is with my Husband, who we have found hid in the</hi> Grotto <hi>of the</hi> Nayades. <hi>How? She is with your Husband,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs more aſtoniſh'd than ever, <hi>and you can have the patience, Madam, to leave them alone thus? What,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>you'd have me be there as a Property? That is not my humour; and if</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>the Governour, who as you know has ever been wanton enough, will play me foul play, I ſhall ſooner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him for making choice of ſo pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a Lady as is the Marchioneſs, than if he ſhould make uſe of ſome other leſs deſerving: And I find,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs in a fury, <hi>that what you now ſay, is the moſt terrible thing in the world, and that an honeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to give Poyſon to a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47241:57"/>
that ſhould have the leaſt thought of ſuch a thing.</hi> In ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, he was ſo diſtracted, that he knew not what to do: He would go two or three ſteps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and then as many back, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> after him, who ſtill had hold of him, and had much to do to follow him: <hi>Will you not then,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>go and ſee what they do, ſeeing you are ſo reſtleſs? No, Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he roughly, retiring back, <hi>for I have ſeen but too much already; and ſince that the Rights of Hoſpitality are violated here, and that under the pretence of Parentage a Man of my Quality is diſhonour'd, I muſt have a recourſe to thoſe that can do me Juſtice in this caſe, and I will periſh rather than not be righted.</hi> He did ſpeak thoſe words with ſuch a tranſport, and ſo loud, that Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was not far from thence, having heard him, thought that he was juſt upon him, which made him gallop away
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47241:57"/>
as faſt as he could to the back-door, of which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had given him the Key.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs was going back to the Palace wholly tranſported with fury, revolving a thouſand deſigns of vengeance in his mind againſt this treacherous Kinſman the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour: When he was ſcarce got to the firſt Gallery which anſwer'd into the Garden, where he met him with ſome Officers. How great his ſurpriſe was, is eaſie to be imagined; and ſeeing him come up to him with a chearful ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he ſtood looking on him without ſaying one word. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour more ſurpris'd, than he himſelf, at his behaviour, and to ſee him ſo pale and wan, did ask him what he ailed: <hi>What, my Lord,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs, <hi>did I not ſee you but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now in the Garden ſpeaking to my Wife, near the</hi> Grotto <hi>of the</hi> Nayades? <hi>No aſſuredly,</hi> reply'd the Governour, <hi>for I have been ever
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47241:58"/>
ſince morning in the</hi> Arcenal, <hi>to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the fitting out of ſome Veſſels for</hi> Sicily, <hi>and I am but juſt come in.</hi> The jealous Marqueſs had no ſooner heard this, but that the fumes of this paſſion confounding his ſenſes more than ever, he return'd into the Garden almoſt diſtracted, where the Governour, who did ſee him ſo tranſported, did follow him, preſſing him ſeveral times to declare what he ailed, and where he was going, without being able to get one word from him, till they had found the Ladies that were walking and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill at the Adventure, againſt whom he vented part of his rage, running down his Wife with ſuch ill language, in which <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi>'s Honour was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. The Governour did hear all that without one word ſpeaking, being in an extreme impatiency to learn the cauſe of all thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: But the Ladies, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued laughing at the Marqueſſes fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47241:58"/>
did increaſe it much at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours amazement, unto whom, when the jealous man was retired, they gave an account of all that had paſſed.</p>
            <p>Mean time the furious Marqueſs was extremely perplexed, to gueſs who that Cavalier ſhould be that he had ſeen with his Wife in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, there being no likelihood that it ſhould be the Governour: ſo that after he had ſufficiently tormented himſelf on that Theme, he having always his imagination fill'd with the Pilgrim, and that he could think of no other perſon on whom <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

ſo low: But of what ſtrange Idea's is not a jealous mans fancy capable? He did confirm himſelf ſo well in that Opinion, through a thouſand falſe reaſonings which he made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that he no longer doubted it; ſo that he took the reſolution to rid himſelf of a man ſo fatal to his qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et as was that perſon: Yet ſome checks of Conſcience, (for <hi>Spaniards</hi> have it very tender,) making him to reflect with ſome ſcruples on an act in which a Chriſtian ſoul was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, he did conclude to examine the buſineſs a little better firſt: And thereupon he was framing a deſign moſt infallible, to inform himſelf of the whole truth; which was, to diſguiſe himſelf like a Pilgrim, as he might eaſily do in a Country where there are Shops full of ſuch Garments to ſell, and then to walk under his own Chamber-window, where his Wife would not fail to appear, as ſhe had done the night before, and ſo be trepan'd: This
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47241:60"/>
being reſolv'd upon, as has been ſaid, and perceiving the night to draw near, ſo that he had no time to loſe, if he would get all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before the Marchioneſs ſhould be return'd from her walk, he ſent one of his Servants to fetch him a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims habit; and having plac'd two other of his Servants over againſt his Chamber to keep Centry, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion were, and to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all things, he withdrew himſelf, expecting the return of his Servant.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who through the impatiency he was in to carry thoſe good news to the Pilgrim, which he had to tell him, together with the fear that the Marqueſs had put him in, had not had time to go and ſhift himſelf, but was running as faſt as he could towards his moſt Dear's Lodgings with that Hat loaden with Feathers, which ſometimes flapt of one ſide of his head, and ſometimes hung on the other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47241:61"/>
the Peruque which did infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely annoy him, and made him ſweat more than ever had done two Cowls made of Serge; but above all the Belt, which was ſo long, that the Sword dragg'd on the ground, being forc'd to carry it in one hand, and to hold his Hat with the other. He did croſs in this dreſs the beſt part of the City, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequently looking behind him, to ſee if ſome-body did follow him, ſtill fearing the Marqueſs his anger, though he was far enough: At laſt he came to the Pilgrims Lodgings, who unfortunately was not at home. This makes him mad, he muſt find him out; that which he has to ſay to him is of too great a conſequence to be omitted; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deferr'd, and there is not a moment to be loſt: He runs to and fro, here and there, knowing that his ſteps would be very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and that thereby his zeal would the more appear, but no Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47241:61"/>
to be found. He had been ſeeking of him two hours, and was ready to return the ſecond time to his Lodgings, but firſt he would go round the Palace, not being far from thence, to ſee if he might not be ſtaid there; when paſſing under the Windows of the Marqueſs his Apartment, he ſaw a Pilgrim walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that ſeem'd to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. It was ſomewhat dark, and he believ'd that he ſhould hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know him; therefore running towards him to imbrace him, <hi>You have given me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a great deal of trouble this day; you ſee in what an Equipage I am ſtill, but you ſhall never know in what dangers I have hazarded my life for your ſake. In a word,</hi> continued he in a low voice, <hi>the beauteous Marchioneſs is yours, and this very night, if you can get a Ladder of Ropes, ſhe will follow you whereſoever you ſhall pleaſe to lead her: I have a Letter of hers to give you, in which you will ſee more; but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47241:62"/>
let us from hence.</hi> As Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> was talking after this manner, he perceiv'd a certain piece of Iron to glitter, with which the Pilgrim was going to reward him after an ill manner for his good ſervices, if he had not happily eſcaped the blow, by ſuddenly recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeeing his errour, and running away; yet not ſo quickly, but that he left the Hat, Feathers, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruque in the others hands, who thought to hold him faſt by them: <hi>Ah! thou Villain,</hi> cryed he, <hi>is it thus that thou performeſt thy Religious Vows? Thou infamous Hypocrite, haſt thou taken upon thee a Religious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, but for the more ſecure debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another mans Wife</hi>? Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had not been ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd at the ſhining of the Dagger, as he was at the hearing of the Marqueſs his voice, did ſet all his ſtrength in his heels, and little mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sermon which was preach'd to him, he left not running till he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47241:62"/>
was come to the Pilgrims houſe. The Marqueſs, who was not ſo good a Foot-man, Ieft running after him, being well ſatisfied with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found out the bottom of the Plot, eſpecially the Marchioneſſes good intentions. He was only vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had been too haſty, elſe he might have had the Letter alſo, which had been the way to have convinced her ſo home, that ſhe ſhould have had nothing to ſay for her ſelf: Yet he did not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of performing it, in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act the Pilgrims part, and walking under the Windows of her Apartment: He was ſcarce return'd thither, but the <hi>Duenna</hi> of <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who had ever ſince morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared as ſevere a revenge for <hi>Camille</hi> as could be imagin'd, fail'd not to let fall upon the Marqueſs his head, from a third ſtory, a whole deluge of filth, with which he was cover'd all over. <hi>Oh Heavens! muſt I receive this affront too,</hi> ſaid he,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47241:63"/>
lifting up his head, to ſee from whence that Preſent came, <hi>to fill up my meaſure of misfortunes</hi>? And without ſtaying to make needleſs complaints, and not being able to endure the horrible ſtink with which he was perfum'd, he went back to the Palace to ſhift himſelf, and in the ſame time give ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo that the Conſpiracy ſhould not take effect; but as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that Chamber in which he was to leave all his Equipage, the Governour, who with his Wife was accompanying the Marchioneſs, did eſpy him; and having judg'd by his countenance that it was ſome-body that would hide himſelf, he did ask of him who carried the <hi>Flambeau,</hi> who it was; who made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he thought it was the Marqueſs: At which they all fell to laugh; and <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who ſought by all means to make him ſtark mad, did oblige his Lady, who was very indifferent, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47241:63"/>
who out of complaiſance did follow them, to go with her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Chamber where they found him, having ſtill the Hat and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruque of that moſt wicked Father <hi>Andrew</hi> in one hand, and the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Staff in the other; but their preſence was to him the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of all afflictions, not thinking that they had ſeen him. They all gaz'd upon him with ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, as at firſt hindered them from ſpeaking, not only by reaſon of his diſguiſe, which was ſufficient to ſurpriſe them, but to ſee in what a pickle he had been laid, from head to foot, which did oblige them all to hold their Noſes, no body daring to ask him the reaſon of all that, ſeeing him to be in no humour of ſatisfying their curioſity. But at laſt great ſhouts of laughter having ſucceeded all on a ſudden, to their ſurpriſal and ſilence, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who was a very civil Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, did deſire his Wife and the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47241:64"/>
Marchioneſs to retire, that they might not augment the confuſion, or rather the rage that the Marqueſs was in, and give their people occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to laugh at him. So he only remain'd with him; and looking on him with compaſſion, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what would you have the World to think of you? Let it think what it will; but ſtill 'tis my opinion, that it is permitted every body to mind their own buſineſs; and, if poſſible, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being betraid: Betraid,</hi> reply'd the Governour, <hi>and where then are theſe Traytors? Where they are</hi>! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Marqueſs in his turn, <hi>over all the Earth, and with you, more than in any place of the World. In a word, your Wife, and your Apoſtate Chaplain, who is the moſt wicked of all Traytors: But do you not ſee,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Governour, <hi>that all is but in jeſt, to make mirth; and that my Wife, and that good Father — How? a ſport to laugh at,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs in a fury, interrupting
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47241:64"/>
him, <hi>when my Honour and Life are concern'd in it? Yes, my Life, I ſay, for one cannot take the one from me without the other; when Letters are carried, and that my Wife is to be ſtoln away: But who,</hi> reply'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, <hi>who is to take her away? Who?</hi> reply'd the other, <hi>your honeſt Pilgrim, with that precious Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>through the aſſiſtance, I will not ſay of whom, for I my ſelf am aſhamed of it. Heavens! is it poſſible,</hi> ſaid the Governour, <hi>that you ſhould abuſe your ſelf in this manner? Yea, yea, I do abuſe my ſelf,</hi> reply'd he in a ſcornful tone, <hi>and this Hat and Peruque were not part of Father</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew<hi>'s Equipage, who has been this night to ſpeak with my Wife through the aſſiſtance of yours: That which you now ſay, is true,</hi> reply'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, <hi>Father</hi> Andrew <hi>has been ſo idle as to pleaſe my Wife, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing himſelf like a Cavalier, and ſhe made him go into the Garden to laugh at him, with the Marchioneſs;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47241:65"/>
you ſhould have laugh'd alſo, and not fum'd at it as you have done: Yea, I muſt confeſs I am mightily in the wrong,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs in the ſame tone ſtill, <hi>and I was to have laugh'd at it; or rather, if you pleaſe, I ſhould have been my Wifes Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to have carried the Letters which ſhe writ to the Pilgrim, and have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the good Father</hi> Andrew <hi>that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Theſe are your counſels,</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>the Governour, and I thank you moſt kindly for them.</hi> But— the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would have anſwer'd him; <hi>But,</hi> ſaid he preſently again, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of him, <hi>I beſeech you to leave me in quiet, and let every one govern himſelf according to his own Maxims; it ſuffices that I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to you, and to my Lady Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for all that could happen to me in this world of moſt cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While they were thus entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, the Marqueſs had rid himſelf of the Pilgrims Weeds, he immediately did run to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47241:65"/>
confiding no more in <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> than in Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> and preſently he ſet his head to the Window, to ſee if the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was not yet ready. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour who would not leave him till he had inform'd him better, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring with the beſt reaſons that he could find, to reclaim him: <hi>Believe me,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>my dear Couſin, that Pilgrim, of whom you ſpeak, has no ſhare in this Evenings Rallery; and I am very certain, that F.</hi> Andr. <hi>does not ſo much as know him. Good God</hi>! reply'd the Marqueſs, crying out as if poſſeſs'd, <hi>Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>that Villain, from whom I have juſt now learned all, who is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of a Letter from my Wife to that Pilgrim, and who is to give him notice that he need but bring a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this night to get her out at the Window, and that ſhe will follow him whereſoever he pleaſes, does not know that Traytor</hi>? All this did ſeem ſo ridiculous unto the Governour, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47241:66"/>
to <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> that in lieu of adding faith unto it, they did believe that he was crack-brain'd; and they were conſulting between them, what they ſhould do to prevent this diſtemper from growing worſe. As for the Marchioneſs, ſhe was retired into a Cloſet, ſo ſoon as ſhe had ſeen the Marqueſs come, under pretence of not expoſing her ſelf unto the rage of a jealous Mad-man; but the truth was, becauſe ſhe was ſo ſtrangely perplexed, not knowing what had happened unto Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> whoſe Hat and Peruque ſhe had ſeen in her Husbands hands; above all things, fearing that ſome miſhap was come to her Letter. The Governour did think, that if he ſhould cauſe the Pilgrim to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, ſo that the Marqueſs ſhould have nothing further to fear from him, that that might compoſe his Brains. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did highly approve of this Propoſition; and her advice was, as every body
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47241:66"/>
thinks moſt on their own intereſt, that it would not be amiſs to detain him Priſoner in one of the Towers of the Palace, that the Marqueſs might reſt the more ſecure; and that on the other hand, this poor Pilgrim, whom they thought not guilty, ſhould be the better treated. This being ſo concluded, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Marqueſs, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gathering his people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be on the defence, in caſe of an Eſcallade, and who proteſted that there ſhould be night and day a Guard in his Chamber, and that his Wife ſhould not ſtir forth of it till this curſed Pilgrim were ſeis'd, and that he had ſeen him have Irons at his feet. They promiſed him, that things ſhould be performed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his deſires: And the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſent immediately to fetch a Lieutenant of the Guard, to whom he gave Orders before the Marqueſs, to inſtantly go with twelve Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, and ſeek all about the City
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47241:67"/>
after an <hi>Italian</hi> Pilgrim, which he deſcrib'd unto him; that he ſhould not return without him, but ſhould confine him in the Red Tower of the Palace. Mean time Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> was come to <hi>Camille</hi> ſo out of breath, that he was a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time before he could ſay any thing to him, more than by Signs and Grimaces, which did as much amaze the Pilgrim, as the Equipage that he was in did make him laugh; <hi>Good God! Sir,</hi> ſaid Father <hi>Andrew</hi> to him, with his eyes ſtaring, <hi>what hazards have I run through this day for your ſake? I have ſeen my ſelf at the laſt moment of living, and it was well for me that I had a quick eye, and a nimble foot, I had been a dead man elſe, and kill'd, paſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, by the inraged Marqueſs his hand. Camille</hi> having enquired how, after he had taken a little breath, he related all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him that Evening, in ſuch paſſionate terms, and ſuch pleaſant
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47241:67"/>
geſtures, eſpecially at the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ure of the Dagger, which was doubtleſs the moſt pleaſant paſſage of all the Relation, that <hi>Camille,</hi> as vexed as he was at his giddy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, whoſe evil conſequences he did very well foreſee, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing, ſeeing him imitate at once both the Marqueſſes and his own part, how he had lifted the Dagger up againſt him, and how he had ſhunn'd the blow, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that his buſineſs had been done, if he had not made quick uſe both of his eyes and legs. <hi>Camille</hi> who was much more impatient to ſee the Marchioneſſes Letter, than to hear every particular of that ſtory, having ask'd for it, he open'd it, and read theſe words.
<floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>APpearances have deceived me, Sir, and you muſt blame them for my over-haſty condemning of you. I can further ſay, that in deſpite of them, I have rendred you more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47241:68"/>
than I could reaſonably have done; and that at the very inſtant that I call'd you Traytor, there was ſomething which whiſper'd unto me, it could not be poſſible, that a perſon who appeared ſo worthy, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, could be capable of committing ſo baſe an action. I was beginning to renounce that injuſtice which I thought I did you, when I received your Letter; and I am not more obliged to you for thoſe generous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, which you continue to make me, than in having wholly confirm'd me in the opinion that I had of you: for proof whereof, I declare to you, that beſides the manner that you ſeem to be concern'd at my ill fortune, which would ever oblige me to have a great eſteem for you, I have found ſuch qualities in you, as uſually make the tenders of ſome perſons ſervices more acceptably received, than thoſe of ſome others; and that it will not be difficult for me to wholly confide in you. Let us make good uſe of time

and opportunity, for I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall ever have it ſo fair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and if you can provide this very night a Ladder to get me down with from the Window, I ſhall be ready to follow you.

            <p>While <hi>Camille</hi> was reading this Letter with tranſports of joy and love, he did tremble on the other ſide, when he did think on the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards that it had run of falling into the Marqueſs his hands, which would have been the abſolute ruine of the Marchioneſs: He did ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gueſs, though Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had not told him, that his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had made him diſcover any thing of the ſecret, that after ſuch a fatal Encounter there was nothing to be hoped for in their late deſign;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47241:69"/>
and that the jealous Lord would certainly be upon his guard: He was diſtracted at it, which yet he durſt not wholly expreſs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for fear of putting him out of humour, perceiving very well, that which way ſoever the buſineſs ſhould go, he ſhould ſtill have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him. As they were reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together on the ways they ſhould take, to know if there were any hopes of executing their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, without danger of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd or known, they ſaw an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer come into the Chamber, who followed by ſix Muſqueteers, gave the Pilgrim to underſtand, that he had an Order from the Governour to ſecure him, and did in a civil way deſire him to ſurrender himſelf, becauſe that beſides his having of ſix Muſqueteers more at hand, it had been expreſly commanded him, to uſe him civilly; and that he ſhould be very ſorry to be obliged to uſe violent hands. All thoſe kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47241:69"/>
did not hinder our Heroe, who believ'd himſelf loſt, and who was not a perſon to be tamely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to ſet himſelf in a poſture of defence, with a Dagger in his hand, the only Weapon that he had then near him; ſo that maugre their great number, he ſold them his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty at a dear rate, having wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three or four of the Souldiers; who having ſpared him at firſt, were at laſt ſo netled at the ſight of their blood, that they were making at him, without any further regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Governours Orders of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring him. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had never been in ſuch a Fray, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being animated thereunto by the example of the Pilgrims gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſiſtance, or that the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers dreſs he was in, of which he had loſt nothing but the Hat and Peruque, did infuſe courage in him; he plaid the Devil amongſt them; and did ſo well ſecond the Valiant <hi>Camille,</hi> that the Lieutenant had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47241:70"/>
for the other ſix Souldiers, which he call'd to his aſſiſtance. They were forc'd at laſt to yield to the greater number: Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> was the firſt taken, and the moſt ill treated, having not been ſpared, as had been the Pilgrim, there had rain'd upon his back and head, which was naked, a whole deluge of blows of Garabines, and flats of Swords; he crying out as one that was ſufficiently beaten; <hi>Ah! you Villains, is it thus that you treat poor Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Chaplain, and Religious Prieſt of the Order of S.</hi> Dominick? <hi>Ye are all Excommunicated, and I Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate you for ever if you do not hold.</hi> At the name of Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> rather than at the noiſe of the Excommunication, there was a Truce of blows; and at the ſame time the Pilgrim having been ſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were both had to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, though there was Order but for <hi>Camille,</hi> becauſe of the reſiſtance that Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had made, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47241:70"/>
whom the Souldiers had been more ſevere, as it did very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they having diſcharged the greateſt part of their anger upon him, ſo that he could but difficultly move. He was thus very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for all his Meſſages: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune does not always favor us in all places; and her ordinary viciſſitudes are in making croſs Events to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the faireſt beginnings.</p>
            <p>The Pilgrim was lodged in the Red Tower, and his Companion was had before the Governour, to know what ſhould be done with him. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> would have willingly redeemed himſelf from ſo ſhameful a Scene, with the hundred Piſtols which he had received: And for certain, how great ſoever the Governours ſurpriſe was to ſee him in ſo ſtrange a dreſs, and to learn that he was found with the Pilgrim, he could not forbear laughing, in ſpight of the ſerious countenance which he had took upon him, to ſee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47241:71"/>
him in ſo ſad a pickle with that new garment, which had been extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſordered in the Battel. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who was gone to bed, and could not perſwade her ſelf that it was her Ghoſtly Father, did riſe to ſee him, and was yet more ſurpris'd than had been the Governor, but did not laugh, having a greater intereſt in it than her Husband, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this, but that all which the Marqueſs had ſaid concerning the Intrigues between the Marchioneſs and the Pilgrim were real truths. All her anger was preſently turn'd againſt Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> not only for his ſerving her Rival, but becauſe he had made her a party, having caus'd her to act a part very unworthy of her, and moſt cruel to her heart. She took no notice of it before her Husband, but was reſolv'd to treat him the next morning as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. The Governour, who thought the Fryar had been ſufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for all his follies, caus'd him
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47241:71"/>
to be releas'd, and preſently ſent word to the Marqueſs, that the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim was ſecur'd: This was a great ſatisfaction to him; yet he did not ſleep the better for it, but had all night long Viſions of Palmer Staves, Hats with Shells, and ſuch like things, againſt which his mind could not yet be well ſetled, though the cauſe of all thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of his was in Priſon.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate <hi>Camille,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with vexations and deſpair in that Priſon, was much troubled about the cauſe that ſhould move the Governour to have him thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the night-time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch kindneſſes which he had ſhew'd him: the time which he had allow'd him to remain in <hi>Barcelona</hi> was not yet expired, and on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs his account he did not believe that there was any reaſon to uſe that extremity towards him; and it was much more probable, as he could not doubt it, that the Governour
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47241:72"/>
had dived into his Wifes folly; and that the ſame reaſons which had oblig'd him to forbid him the Court, and not to remain above three days in the City, had incited him alſo to caſt him into Priſon. Theſe conſiderations made him exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his too rigorous fate, that thus did load him with troubles, through the love of a Woman, whom he could not fancy, when he was juſt upon the point of being the moſt happy of all men with her that he adored. This thought, with the little inclination that he had for the Governours Wife, did not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contribute to make him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely hate her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had not that night her mind leſs fill'd with ſorrow and care for her Lover: She had ſcarce ſeen him, but ſhe had lov'd him with ſo violent a paſſion, which did every moment encreaſe, and the ſole Idea of that Pilgrim did ſo tranſport her, that there was not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47241:72"/>
any thing which ſhe would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to gain his affections. Mean time ſhe learns that he loves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and concludes that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, or at leaſt the indifferency that he had ſhewn to her the night before, did all proceed from thence, and that when he came to her, it was with an intention to have met with the Marchioneſs, as it had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appear'd by his ſurpriſe. Theſe were cruel reflections for a Woman that loves with ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as ſhe did the Pilgrim, and yet they were not powerful enough to cure her; and in the midſt of all the ſorrow ſhe had, to find her affections run ſo far in favour of an ungrateful perſon, which would triumph over them before her Rival, ſhe did ſigh and earneſtly wiſh that day were come, that ſhe might find out ſome way of ſeeing him. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was now the only Object of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as if he had been the cauſe of all her misfortunes: ſhe wiſh'd that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47241:73"/>
he would gueſs the concerns which ſhe had for the Pilgrim; and that in lieu of ſerving him towards the Marchioneſs, he would diſcover to her all that which had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Lovers, that ſhe might break all their meaſures; that is, ſhe deſired that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. This is commonly the odd compoſure of mind of ſuch perſons as are poſſeſs'd with ſo violent a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: mean time ſhe was preparing very ſevere Mortifications for the good Father, the leaſt of which was to ſend him back to his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
            <p>The morning, which affords counſel on the things which have been concluded in the night, and frequently with advantage, did cauſe the Governeſs to go quite another way to work than what ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: She ſent to ſeek after Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrew</hi> ſo ſoon as ſhe was up; but the good Father, who had not reſted well that night, though not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47241:73"/>
tormented with Love as ſhe had been, was yet in Bed, and caus'd his excuſes to be made to Madam the Governeſs, that through ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions which had that night trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, and from which he was not yet quite free, he could not come ſo ſoon to wait upon her. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> to whom Love would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford no reſt, being impatient to ſee and ſpeak with the Father, went her ſelf unto his Chamber, under the Veil of an act of Charity, and to learn what was her Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors diſtemper: Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who expected not this Honour, was much ſurpris'd at the ſight of her; and after ſome queſtions which ſhe made him on the condition of his diſtemper, the true cauſe of which he would never tell her, the Lady taking upon her a more ſerious Air, began to make him a Fraternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrancy, that with ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Religious <hi>Decorum,</hi> he was become the Confident of a mean
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47241:74"/>
Pilgrim, and had made her alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the Intrigue, and the Fop of a Woman, that would take no ſmall advantage of it; adding, that the Governour had reſented it very much, and would have ſent him back to his Convent, had ſhe not oppos'd it, and endeavour'd to excuſe him. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> moſt humble and contrite, at thoſe Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> made him, did return her thanks for all the good Offices which ſhe had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him towards the Governour, proteſting that he had not acted any thing in all that, but what was in pure zeal of ſerving his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, not imagining that there was any evil in it, that otherwiſe for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he had not done it; and that for his part, he had rather die, than enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt thought of diſpleaſing her. The paſſionate Lady, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to make her advantage from the Fathers faults, would not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his excuſes, ſeeming ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47241:74"/>
unwilling to pardon him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he endeavour'd to gain her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by ſome other means: She would firſt learn from him all that had paſſed between thoſe two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; the Father, who had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd very far into <hi>Camille</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, did endeavour to ſatisfie her as well as he could, in giving her a ſincere and faithful account of that little which he knew of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. But ſhe was not ſatisfied with that neither; and ſhe made him divers other queſtions, to which he anſwer'd according to his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi> which did not extend very far. <hi>You do not believe then,</hi> ſaid the Governeſs to him, after ſhe had been ſome time ſilent, <hi>that it is long ſince this Pilgrim has been acquainted with the Marchioneſs, nor that he is much in love with her? As to Love, Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he, not knowing what intereſt the Lady had in all theſe enquiries, <hi>I cannot ſay but that he does very much love her, but I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47241:75"/>
know that their acquaintance is but new; that they have ſcarce had one opportunity to diſcourſe one another; and finally, that all their intelligence has yet gone no further, than to a deſign of delivering the Marchioneſs out of her Husbands tyrannical jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. Donna Barbara</hi> took a little courage at Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as an unreſolved perſon, who had a thouſand deſigns in her head that perplexed her, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beginning divers diſcourſes, and ſuddenly breaking them off, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finiſhing of any, ſhe at laſt told him, that ſhe was concern'd for that young man, whom the Marqueſs was reſolv'd to ruine; and that the Governour would hardly have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſave him. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had a real affection for the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, was much concern'd at the news, and began to intercede for him to <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> telling her, that he was the moſt honeſt, civil, and generous Pilgrim in the whole
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47241:75"/>
World; that it were a thouſand pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to take away his life, and that his death would draw ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon her Family, becauſe it had never been heard that any man that had once vow'd himſelf to S. <hi>Jago,</hi> had ever been hang'd. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> being ſomewhat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded with the good Fathers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, did promiſe to concern her ſelf further for him, but yet that ſhe would have the Pilgrim to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her to it himſelf, that he might know to whom he were obliged; ſo that ſhe would have him go to the Pilgrim, and give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his affairs. That he ſhould be ſure to repreſent the danger he was in yet greater than it was; and that he ſhould inſenſibly give him to underſtand, that there was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſhe, that could ſave him.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtructed in all things, and yet not able to dive into the buſineſs, was very well pleas'd however to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47241:76"/>
ſee her ſo well diſpoſed to ſerve his dear Pilgrim, knowing well what power ſhe had over the Governours ſpirit, he return'd her thanks before-hand for the kindneſs that ſhe ſhew'd in the behalf of a Stranger, who ſhe would find when, ſhe ſhould know him, worthy of her care. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who valued not his Complement, did preſs him to make haſte, telling him, that ſhe would ſtay for his Anſwer in her Chamber; and he promiſed her to be within a moment at the Priſon: There he found the Pilgrim much dejected and caſt down, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him with a great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Courage, Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I hope that you ſhall not die: That I ſhall not die,</hi> ſaid <hi>Camille, am I then ſo near being condemn'd? No, but I fear,</hi> reply'd Father <hi>Andrew, that you may be ſo, if you have not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body to ſollicite for you; for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs does not only accuſe you of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving endeavour'd forcibly to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47241:76"/>
his Wife from him, but that you would have murdered him alſo: And what proof is there of all this</hi>? reply'd <hi>Camille. I know not,</hi> ſaid the Father, <hi>but I believe that you will be condemned, whatever the proofs may be, if you do not apply your ſelf to the protection of ſome perſon of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power to ſave you. Camille,</hi> who pitied him to hear him reaſon ſo ſimply, did only tell him, that if he had no body but the Marqueſs to fear, he did not believe that he ſtood in want of any perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having once again endeavour'd to repreſent the danger greater to him than he did imagine it, the Pilgrim ask'd him, <hi>Where he had learn'd all that</hi>: To which he anſwer'd, <hi>from a Lady that had a great power at Court, and good intentions towards him: In a word, that he had it from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Lady. From the Governours Lady</hi>! reply'd <hi>Camille, well Father, I have ſo little inclination to be her
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47241:77"/>
Debtor, that I had rather die than be obliged to her for my life: And car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her back that anſwer,</hi> continued he, <hi>if it is ſhe that has ſent you here on that Errand; tell her beſide, that death will never come ſo ſoon as I deſire it.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> aſtoniſhed at this high ſpirit, did endeavour to reclaim him a little, and enquir'd of him, what reaſon he had to refuſe, in the ſad condition he was, ſuch marks of affection, as would have fill'd with honour and joy any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon than he? <hi>I have nothing further to ſay to you on that account,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and peradventure I have more cauſe of complaint of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Wife, than of returning her thanks; But that is not the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, Go back to her, Father, and tell her, that if I muſt die, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, but no lowneſs on my part.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended any thing of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes deſign, could yet leſs unravel what reaſons the Pilgrim had to ſlight ſo much her obliging offers, as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47241:77"/>
to chuſe to die, rather than ſo much as entreat her. He could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there was any particular acquaintance between them; and yet he did believe, that the odd way, after which they both acted, was not without ſome kind of myſtery, which did ſpeak ſomething more, than from ſuch perſons as did not know one another. His Brains not diving further into this myſtery, he left to time to unravel all that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, and return'd unto <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> to whom he gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Commiſſion which ſhe had given him; and if he did not relate to her wholly with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, or rather with what ſcorn the Pilgrim had receiv'd the offers of her protection, he however told her enough to make her underſtand the ſmall eſteem he had of her: <hi>What! he will die then,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>with an Emotion which ſhe had much to do to conceal: Yes, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Father, <hi>rather than be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47241:78"/>
obliged to any one for his life: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Madam, becauſe he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he deſerves death: Ah! cruel</hi>! ſhe then cry'd out, not being able to ſuppreſs her ſighs any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>it is not that which makes him anſwer after this manner, but the extreme paſſion which he has for the Marchioneſs, and the averſion which he feels for all other Women: It is not with you, Father, that I muſt conſtrain my ſelf any longer,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe bluſhing; <hi>and ſeeing that you already know all the weakneſſes of my Soul, therefore it would be uſeleſs to conceal this from you: This Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim has ſome ſecret Art to Charm Women with: Since the firſt day that I ſaw him, and that he cast his eyes on me, I have felt for him ſuch things as are not naturally felt for ordinary perſons; and whatſoever I have oppos'd againſt it, to remove him from my mind, I have been daily more and more poſſeſſed with it; I know that I do ill, but I have no
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47241:78"/>
power to reſiſt him, and find that the more my paſſion ſhould be oppoſed, the more it would break forth: I will try what time can do; mean time, Father, if you have any conſideration for me, you will have pity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am in, and will endeavour to qualifie in ſome meaſure the torment that I endure, for none can do it better than you.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd at this her confiding in him, which gave him ſo fair a return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> did make her alſo a gentle and ſhort Remonſtrancy, as in duty bound, and did repreſent to her the conſequences of thoſe kind of Ingagements, the ſorrow that they are commonly accompanied with, and the publick ſhame when once they broke forth: All this was deliver'd very mildly, and ſtill with ſtore of howevers, which did ſweeten the bitterneſs of the Remonſtrancy, which was none of the ſevereſt. And at laſt finding that there was no hopes of diſſwading her that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47241:79"/>
way, (neither had he much mind to do it) he ſhifted into another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as an Indulgent Director ſhould do, and told her in a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devout tone, That ſeeing the Spiritual Remedies had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over her, ſhe was to make uſe of thoſe that were Natural, and of two evils ſhun the worſt, which was the ſcandal, in which ſhe muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have fallen, if the Heavens had not inſpired her to addreſs her ſelf to a perſon ſo diſcreet as he was, ſhe knowing what zeal he had for her ſervice. <hi>Do but repoſe your ſelf on my cares, Madam,</hi> continued he, <hi>and ſince that the chiefeſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to make you to be beloved, know that I have ſome ſecrets as powerful in that point as are the Pilgrims; and that before he ſleeps, he ſhall ſigh for you.</hi> That laſt word made <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ſigh, who languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly looking upon the Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolator; <hi>How much you promiſe me in a ſhort time, Father,</hi> ſaid ſhe to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47241:79"/>
him, <hi>to do this, he muſt firſt forget an Object with which he is too much poſſeſt, and for which he hath doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs left his Country, and be mov'd with the like thoughts for me: So great a change,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>is not done in one day: No, no! do but make him loſe all hopes of ever ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marchioneſs, and in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing danger of his life, as you may repreſent it to him, make him ſee how much better it would be for him to turn his affections towards me; for he already knows that I love him, and that it is his own fault if he is not happy.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having been ſufficiently inſtructed in all things, to acquit himſelf of that Imploy, as a zealous and expert Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee, he promiſed <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> not to forget any thing: And ſo parting each with his particular I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's, they both went to labour to bring about their deſign.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs and the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had paſs'd the night as a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47241:80"/>
and Wife could do, when they are of ſo bad intelligence as thoſe two were. The Governour had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the jealous Marqueſs, before they had parted, to ſacrifice to his requeſt all the reſentments that he might have againſt his Wife; and had had a promiſe from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, never to have any deſign againſt her Husbands Honour and Intereſts. Thus a certain kind of Reconciliation having been made upon this, he had left them both in a paſſable good reſolution of living friendly together. All this was good in the outward appearance, but the inward parts are not ſo ſoon cured; and as the Marqueſs could but very hardly forgive his Wife the treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able trick that ſhe would have plaid him, his Wife did not diſpair of finding out ſome other Pilgrims, if this ſhould fail her. Here were two perſons very ſtrangely intention'd, and that might lye long enough to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet have no true peace
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47241:80"/>
between them. Neither was there any thing elſe all night, but maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings on the Husband's ſide, and ſighs on that of the Wife, which laſted till morning. A pitiful Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! a ſad alliance, which is but too often met withal in this wicked age! it is not without cauſe therefore, that the mode of unmarrying has been found out of late.</p>
            <p>The Governour's Wife, who was impatient to ſpeak with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, had order'd a Page to wait all the Morning at his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door to tell him, when he were up, that ſhe had ſomething to impart to him. It was very late before he came to her, with a ſad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Countenance, partly through the ill Night which he had paſſed, and the little reaſon that he had to be ſatisfied with <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s proceedings; as for her part, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no better, ſhe was not ſurpris'd at it, and without further minding of it, ſhe told him, that ſhe knew
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47241:81"/>
the cauſe, which he thought he had to be angry with her, but th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſhe proteſted to him, that ſhe did not know any thing of Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s late deſign, in which her Honour had not been as much concern'd as his, ſhe not being of Quality nor Humour to ſerve any one in ſuch amorous Intrigues; that ſhe did not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have that inſolent <hi>Monk</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for it, but that ſhe expected that the Marchioneſs ſhould alſo make her ſome acknowledgment thereupon; and driving her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments further yet, ſhe added, that it was a thing very unworthy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, that had marryed a Marqueſs, who had been honour'd with ſo many brave Employes, and deſcended of one of the prime Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of that Kingdom, to abandon her ſelf in that manner to the love of a Pilgrim, of a Begger, which ſhe had rather follow than her own Husband. Finally, ſhe ſet her ſelf up in ſo fine a mode of Invectives,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47241:81"/>
that the Marqueſs, who did believe her to be angry in earneſt, had much to do to appeaſe her. He did ask her a 1000 times pardon for his Wife, acknowledging that ſhe did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be allyed to a perſon of ſuch Honour and Quality as ſhe was; that it was his misfortune, and he the more to be pityed: The Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all this was, that <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi> did adviſe the Marqueſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey his Wife to ſome ſolitary place, and learn her to be wiſe. But the Marqueſs, who was tainted with that weakneſs incident to all jealous Husbands, that cannot part with their Wives, though never ſo many Reaſons to incite them to it, was not at firſt of her Opinion, and thought it more reaſonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the principal Cauſe of all thoſe Diſorders, that Pilgrim, which the Governour could do no leſs than ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out of the Kingdom, if he would not condemn him to dye; as ſuch Attempts, as that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47241:82"/>
were, did deſerve. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who was concern'd in all this, did as little approve of the Marqueſs his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ſhewing him that beſides thoſe forms that were to be obſerved in doing Juſtice, which would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Governour to baniſh a man without being firſt examined, it were more proper to leave him for ſome time in Priſon, to puniſh him for his inſolency, and that there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides certain reaſons as to the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and policy of the buſineſs, which required ſome other kind of uſage, becauſe that this Baniſhment would ſeem leſs puniſhment, than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whereby to be rid of a perſon which he feared, and of whom he were jealous; and that however it would be an eaſie matter for this Pilgrim to go into the Kindom of <hi>Valencia,</hi> or in that of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and there cauſe him the ſame troubles, as he had done in <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs, who was not one of the beſt head-pieces in the World,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47241:82"/>
was yielding to <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; who added this beſides, that when the Marchioneſs ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Pilgrim's Liberty, ſhe would not deſpair to ſee him again, and that the ſureſt way, to cure her of that fancy, was to take from her all poſſible hopes of ever-ſeeing him more, by removing her from him ſo ſoon as poſſible he could, ſo that ſhe might never-more hear him mentioned. The Marqueſs being now wholly convinced, did reſolve to be gone the very next day, and in order to it, he went to ſeek the Governour, to inform him of his reſolution, who did endeavour to diſſwade him from it, but all in vain, for he did not confide much in him neither, by reaſon of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgency toward the Pilgrim.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> was of Opinion, that ſhe had very much advanced her buſineſs, in having perſwaded this jealous man to leave <hi>Barcelona,</hi> flattering her ſelf with the thoughts
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47241:83"/>
that the Marchioneſs, whom ſhe did look upon as the ſole Obſtacle to her deſires, being once diſtanced from her Lover, ſhe would find it no longer ſo difficult to be belov'd by him. To wholly deceive her in that Opinion, there needed no more but Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who after he had but very fruitleſly diſcourſed the Pilgrim on theſe Inſtructions that the Lady had given him, would not quite put her into deſpair, in informing her of the little eſteem that this Lover had for her; for then he would himſelf have loſt thoſe advantages which he did hope to gain by his cares, as alſo the honour of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing longer in the Office of the Governeſſes Confident. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave her hopes that the Pilgrim would not always prove inſenſible towards her, that he had found him much altered ſince thoſe fine things which he had told him concerning her, and that if ſhe would be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent but a little, ſhe ſhould find him,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47241:83"/>
if not quite ſo paſſionate as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, yet at the leaſt very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for having ſlighted her favours, and ſufficiently ſoftned to give her ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>As there is nothing that more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily makes impreſſions in our minds than thoſe things which pleaſe us, and which we deſire, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did not ſay one word to that paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Lady which did not give her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite content, though under doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearances; the good Father, who did diſcern it in her Eyes, did continually add ſome new thing unto the amorous Narrative. So that <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> being impatient to ſee the effects of Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s rare ſecrets, did reſolve to go in a Diſguiſe to the Priſon, to be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto their Diſcourſes, and to reliſh the whole pleaſure of them.</p>
            <p>This propoſition did ſtartle the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father, well knowing that ſhe ſhould hear nothing there, but what would be contrary to thoſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47241:84"/>
hopes which he had given her. He oppos'd himſelf as much as he could to that Deſign, ſetting before her the evident danger unto which ſhe ſhould expoſe her ſelf; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides would not have a good effect on the Pilgrim's mind, of which ſhe was to manage well the value, if ſhe would be belov'd of him in good earneſt; but all thoſe Reaſons, and many more which he told her to draw himſelf out of the Bryars, were not of force to remove her from that deſign. They were of no value with a Woman, whoſe Soul was fill'd with fiery tranſports. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I know,</hi> ſaid ſhe, not giving ear to half what he ſaid, <hi>all that you can ſay to me, and I ſhould know what I had to do in this Caſe, if, in the condition I am, I were capable of ſome Reflections or Reaſons. But when one loves, as I do, nothing but the deſires of the heart are hearkened unto; and it would be fruitleſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the diſſwading me from it;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47241:84"/>
for I can follow no other Counſel; and without any further reaſoning on the caſe, ſince it is my buſineſs, and that you are willing to ſerve me in it, I deſire you to get me in readineſs againſt Night, one of your Novices Garments, and not to trouble your ſelf any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the buſineſs, for though I ſhould but ſee this Pilgrim, I ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely recompenſed for the pains I ſhall have taken, and the hazard I ſhall have run.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was no hopes of making her change her reſolution, did promiſe to perform whatſoever ſhe ſhould deſire, though he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the danger that there was for them both in it. But <hi>Fryars</hi> in all buſineſſes have always a back door open to get out at. He went to his Convent, where he ſoon fitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Novices Habit, about the Ladies ſtature, which he had conveyed into the Palace. When the hour was come, <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> fail'd not to go to his Chamber, to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47241:85"/>
prepare her ſelf for the Maſquerade, with as much earneſtneſs as Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was backwards; but he was forc'd to reſolve upon it, and for that time to officiate to the Lady, who was not very well acquainted with that <hi>Jacobin</hi>-Equipage in the place of a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi>; during his Employ he had here and there ſome little pleaſures, and his new Office giving him ſomewhat more of Liberty than that of a ſpiritual Director would afford him, he made good uſe of it; for it is cuſtomary with <hi>Monks</hi> to make an advantage of all things, and this, who was a moſt perfect one, did make pretty good uſe of his Rights, in putting that Gown and Frock on the <hi>Senno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Barbara,</hi> of whom he made the prittyeſt little <hi>Fryar</hi> that ever was in the <hi>Novitiat</hi>; if all this was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Temptation I ſhall not tell. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, all being ready, they went out of the Chamber, and marched on without noiſe or light towards
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47241:85"/>
the red Tower, and with ſo good fortune as to meet with no perſon in the Palace that did ſpeak to them. <hi>Camille</hi>'s reſtraint being not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtrict, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had leave, through <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Order, to ſee him at what hour he pleas'd; ſo that it was not difficult for them to get in; they found the Pilgrim lying on his Bed, reading in a Book, a kind of Conſolation in his Afflictions. <hi>Well, Father,</hi> ſaid he to the Confeſſor, ſo ſoon as he ſaw him appear, <hi>have you no better News for me, than thoſe which you have brought me hitherto? and ſhall I have Juſtice done me, or muſt I dye in this Priſon? I have already told you, Sir,</hi> reply'd he, making him ſign that there was a Novice after him, of whom they ſhould be wary, <hi>it lies in you to go out of it, and to be the happyeſt of all men. Happy! after what manner</hi>? (replyed <hi>Camille,</hi> who thought there was no great danger in ſpeaking before a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47241:86"/>
young Brother) <hi>in imploring the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a Perſon that is peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the ſole cauſe of all my Evil? Of a Woman — Yea! but of ſuch a Woman,</hi> interrupted the Father, ſtill making ſign, <hi>that has a great eſteem and affection for you, that knows your worth, and that doubtleſs deſerves that you ſhould conſider her not as your Enemy, or the cauſe of your misfortune, towards which ſhe has never contributed, but as a Lady that concerns her ſelf in your Affairs, and that would inform you what an intereſt ſhe has in them. I know more on that ſubject, Father,</hi> reply'd the Pilgrim, who did not comprehend to what purpoſe thoſe ſigns were made, <hi>than you can tell me; and in a word, if you would oblige me, never ſpeak more of her to me.</hi> To which Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſweat to hear him ſpeak in that manner, reply'd, <hi>but this morning, Sir, you were not in this mind, and I found you in my Opinion, more full
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47241:86"/>
of acknowledgments towards a perſon, that you cannot hate without ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. You deceive your ſelf, Father,</hi> reply'd <hi>Camille,</hi> who was wondring at the Father's Diſcourſe, as much as at his ſigns, <hi>I am no Changling, and what I tell you now, I did both think and ſay in the Morning; you know that I love, and though my heart ſhould be capable of perfidiouſneſs, it</hi>—there he made a ſtop, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the little Novice, that was drawn nearer them, did look ſtedfaſtly in his face, with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that did amaze him. <hi>Go on, thou cruel one,</hi> ſaid the little Brother to him, <hi>and declare that I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing, though I ſhould act all that can be imagined for thee. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille,</hi> who would never have known <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> under ſuch a Dreſs, did fall into the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement in the World, when he heard her voice. He could ſcarce believe his own Eyes, examining her from head to foot. <hi>Yes, look,</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:47241:87"/>
ſaid ſhe, <hi>and ſee what Love makes me do for thee, maugre all thy ſcorns? What I have done hitherto is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, but I come now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my ruin for the moſt ungrateful of all men. Alas, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Camille, it is me that you ruin, and that you render miſerable. How mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable? ſpeak,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>canſt thou complain but of being too much beloved? is there any perſon of worth in the World that would ſay ſo much of the meaneſt of Women? thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt thy ſelf about my cares, thou thinkeſt that it would be a ſhame to thee to be obliged to me for thy life, and preferreſt thy Priſon to Liberty, only becauſe that it is offer'd thee by me.</hi> The paſſionate and winning manner that the amorous <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did uſe in her reproaches to her Pilgrim, certainly there was no heart but what would be ſomewhat mov'd at it, and <hi>Camille,</hi> whoſe heart was not wholly inſenſible, was touch'd with compaſſion, and did
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47241:87"/>
endeavour to excuſe himſelf, on the reſpect which he owed to the Governour, to whom he would not for the world, have given ſo great a cauſe of complaint, after the great a Civilities which he had received from him. <q>The Governour? (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi>) pitiful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and ſeeing that I paſs them by, thou ſhouldſt not ſcruple to do the ſame: But rather ſay, and never ſeek after ſpecious pretences, that to my grief thou cam'ſt into theſe parts, with a heart fill'd with an other Object: That it is the Marchioneſs that renders uſeleſs, and even odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thee, all my Cares, my Kindneſſes, and all things elſe, that I would do for thee. When thou doſt own it to me, I ſhall do thy Heart juſtice; but then add to it, that I might have been agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee, if thou hadſt ſeen me firſt; and that when ever thou ſhalt loſe all hopes of poſſeſſing her,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47241:88"/>
thou wilt remember with what a Paſſion I love thee, and give thy ſelf wholly to me. Other Women would not be contented with this ſmall requeſt; there are but few that would love thee at that rate: But I will make thee ſenſible, how far the exceſs of a real Paſſion will extend.</q> 
               <hi>Camille,</hi> had never found himſelf in ſo great a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He could not refuſe ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſances, at leaſt, to a Lady ſo tranſported with Love, as ſhe was for him; and he had need to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie his diſdain, to give her ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſutable to her paſſionate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; yet, nothing did more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to thoſe kindneſſes which he expreſſed to her, as the deſire which he had to be rid of her, inceſſantly fearing that ſhe ſhould be ſurpriz'd with him, in that diſguiſe and that this viſit ſhould come to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's knowledge, which would make an end of ruining him, he could not forbear expreſſing his ſenſe of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47241:88"/>
it to the Lady, intreating her to have patience, till he had recover'd his liberty, and that then there would be leſs danger for either of them, and they might have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſeeing one another the longer. But ſhe being incapable of any reaſon, did reproach him all his fears; which ſhe, being wholly taken up wich her paſſion, could not entertain. Yet at laſt to let him ſee that ſhe did love him to that exceſs, as to deprive her ſelf of what was moſt pleaſing to her; which was to ſee him: She left him, and at her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe did force from him ſome kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which either real, or fictitious, did however extreamly conſolate her.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had ſeen this viſit concluded for better than he expected; did receive by it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much of ſatisfaction as <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi> had, and did much glory in it, and did congratulate her of her happy ſucceſs; to which he thought he had not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47241:89"/>
They both went out of the <hi>Tower</hi> entertaining themſelves with the merits and fine qualities of this Pilgrime, which were thought to be ſuch extraordinary ones, that ſhe would needs have him to be ſome Prince in a diſguiſe; ſeeing nothing but what was great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in all his actions. The good Father, who knew how much it would pleaſe her to extend himſelf upon the Pilgrime's praiſes; did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out do her at that ſport, and the earneſtneſs they both were in, did ſo tranſport them, that without conſidering they were in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Territories, they did ſpeak ſo loud, that any body might hear them. So that being come near to ſome ſteps, which were to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended: <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who knew not ſo well the way in the dark, as Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did, did bid him lend her his hand to help her up the ſteps. The Father, who went firſt, turn'd back; but when he would
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47241:89"/>
have taken her by the hand, he found it already ſeiz'd on, and that ſome body elſe did do her that Office. Upon this, ſuch a fear did ſeize on him, as it would have done on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; that without ſpeaking one word, he ſtole away into his Chamber, as faſt, and with as little noiſe, as he could: Where I believe he Barricadoed himſelf up, and, I believe, had but an ill night of it. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> hearing ſomebody walk ſo near them, did ſoftly ask of the Father, who ſhe thought ſhe had by the hand, what that was. But this Father would make no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it being the Marqueſs, who returning from giving the laſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for his depart, was waiting there for his Flambeau, that was blown out, and which was gone to be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> preſag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no good from that ſilence, did inquire of the pretended Father the reaſon of it; and was thinking to retire, fearing ſome ſurpriſal, juſt as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47241:90"/>
the Flambeau appeared; by whoſe light having perceiv'd, that it was not Father <hi>Andrew</hi> that did hold her by the hand, ſhe made a great out-cry, and preſently got away, leaving one of her Gloves behind her, not having had time to diſcern who it was. But ſhe was perfectly known by the Marqueſs, who had had leaſure to hear her diſcourſe with Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> which gave no ſmall cauſe of reflection to our jealous, who ſince the Morning had thought her the moſt virtuous Wife in all <hi>Spain:</hi> And the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the happieſt of all men, becauſe he could take his reſt in quiet. The dreſs ſhe was in did ſurprize him more than all the reſt, he who was a profeſſed Biggot, and who did perceive to what uſe were put ſuch holy things. He concluded, that Father <hi>Andrew</hi> muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be made one in all thoſe ſports, on whom he did already look as on one of <hi>Lucifer's</hi> black Inſtruments,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47241:90"/>
ſent into the World to corrupt all Woman-kind. He could eaſily gueſs, by what he had heard them ſay that they were newly come from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the Pilgrime; and that thought did ſomewhat comfort him; for in this world there's nothing like having Companions in our afflictions, which makes them not ſeem ſo weighty unto us. He had a great itching immediately to give the Governour an account of this adventure; but becauſe he knew him to be extreamly prepoſſeſt with a good opinion of his VVife, and that he ſhould have to do with a bold and high ſpirited Lady; he feared that a Glove might not be ſufficient proof, wherewith to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the husband, that he was in his predicament, or to convince the Lady of being concern'd in a gallant Intrigue. And that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he ſhould but cauſe ſome diſorder, and draw upon himſelf all the evil of that intrigue. So that he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47241:91"/>
took the reſolution of being ſilent and return'd to his own Apartment, reflecting often within himſelf, how little Women were to be truſted, and that ſome did make Horns to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who had his own Houſe full of them. Upon this he careſſed his Wife with a better heart, than he had done in a long time; and as he knew that nothing could work a greater effect on the minds of Female kind, than Jealouſie would, he could not forbear giving her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the pleaſant Rencounter which he had had. The Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would have had much to do to have believed it, thinking it ſome effect of his jealous mind, to make her hate the Pilgrim, if he had not aſſur'd her, that he had ſeen them both come out of the <hi>Tower</hi>; if he had not repeated to her the ſame Diſcourſes, which had paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father <hi>Andrew</hi> and the Lady, and finally if he had not ſhown her the Ladies own Glove, which had
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47241:91"/>
been left in his hands. Of truth, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fter that laſt proof ſhe had no more to ſay, and the ſincerity with which ſhe ſee him ſpeak to her, knowing him perfectly well, did make as great an impreſſion in her mind as all the reſt did, ſo that ſhe began to feel within her ſelf more Hatred for that perfidious man, and more jealouſie againſt her Rival, than ſhe could have thought to have had upon ſo ſlender a ſubject. The Marqueſs, who, though his Wife was ſilent, did eaſily ſee in her eyes, and perceive by her very ſilence, that he had compaſſed his ends, and animated her with almoſt as much Hatred againſt <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> as he had been againſt his Wife, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did inform her, how excellently that fair Lady had acted the Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Womans part with him that morning, having flown very high againſt her Conduct, even to the giving him ſuch Counſels as he would not follow; which confirm'd
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47241:92"/>
the Marchioneſſes rage againſt them both, though he would not let her know what thoſe adviſes were. So that what with Jealouſie, and what with Reſentments, ſhe was all night in little kind of rages, which would let her take but very little reſt, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great impatiency for day, that ſhe might be gone, having no other deſires left, than to remove from a place, where ſhe could be of no other uſe than a property to her Rival, to whom that Traytor the Pilgrim had doubtleſs diſcovered all their ſecret Intrigue.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs, who had not changed his deſign, though he had found out, that another had as well as his Wife a months mind to the Pilgrim, knowing well, that in all thoſe kind of things, others Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do rather authorize than deter, was the firſt riſing in the Palace, to have all his Retinue in a readineſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to march, and continue his Voyage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he was going.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47241:92"/>
The Governour and his Lady did riſe alſo to wait upon them out of Town; but the firſt thing that <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi> did ſo ſoon as her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band went out of the Chamber, was to ſend after Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> to enquire of him who that man was that affrighted the Father, who was poſſeſs'd with the ſame curioſity, having ſpent all the Night in a ſtrange reſtleſneſs, leſt it ſhould be the Governour, was very glad to hear the contrary by <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Meſſage. He had no more to ſay to this point than ſhe had, only that he was certain he had not been ſeen. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who was not a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be frighted with ſo ſmall a matter, did trouble her ſelf no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to what might happen from this buſineſs, knowing well how to get out of it, and that ſhe would make that perſon paſs for ridicule, that would accuſe her of any ſuch thing; ſhe ſent back Father <hi>Andrew</hi> to his Chamber, and took the way
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47241:93"/>
that led her to the Marchioneſs, to acquit her ſelf of thoſe Ceremonies uſed in ſuch caſes, not knowing how to diſpence her ſelf from them, though ſhe had no great inclination to go. She entered her Chamber with a cold and indifferent Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and found the Marchioneſs making an end of preparing her ſelf for the Journey, and who afforded her as indifferent a reception; they were both for ſome time in that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, not ſpeaking a word to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till that <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who thought that ſhe had the only cauſe of Complaint, did break that ſilence, and told her, that ſhe was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd at the reception which ſhe did afford her that morning. The Marchioneſs did anſwer her coldly, that there were certain days of Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, when a perſon was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for any thing, and that ſhe would have her to be Judge of it, who appeared not to be in a better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour her ſelf. <hi>I might have hoped
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47241:93"/>
however, Madam,</hi> replyed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, who was not ſatisfied with that excuſe, <hi>that after ſo much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance as I had for you in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den this Evening, which was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to your Deſigns, you might have afforded me a better reception: But I perceive the buſineſs; you would have them that concern themſelves for you to be reſponſable of the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that your deſires have had. You being the Perſon, Madam,</hi> replyed the Marchioneſs, <hi>who did give the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that Maſquerade, which you had not invented but for your own diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I wonder, that after you had made me the Property in it, you ſhould yet demand of me ſome acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yes, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> with a forced ſmile, <hi>if there had been no more in the caſe, but you know that if you have been my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, I have been your Gull. The worſe for you, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs. <hi>Yes, the worſe indeed,</hi> reply'd the other, <hi>but do you know,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:47241:94"/>
added ſhe, with a little tranſport, not being able to contain her paſſion any longer, <hi>that I am very unfit to be employed in ſuch kind of Commerce. I am willing to believe it, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Marchioneſs, ſtill with the ſame coldneſs, <hi>but it is my Opinion, that no perſon ſhould be vexed for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſuch Services to others, of which they themſelves ſtand in need. I need ſuch Services</hi>! replyed ſhe. <hi>Who knows, Madam,</hi> replyed the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, <hi>you are a Woman as I am, and one cannot—Ah! one can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſtill fretting more and more, <hi>that if I am a Wife, it is without ſuch weakneſſes as diſhonour an Husband. It is true,</hi> replyed the Marchioneſs, who could forbear no longer from revenging her ſelf of that Reproach, <hi>that it is very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for a Woman to go at midnight to viſit Priſoners, ſuch a one too, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe account you would have me diſgrac'd, though I had never ſpoken to him. Priſoners!</hi> replyed <hi>Donna
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47241:94"/>
Barbara,</hi> in an accent very different from the former. <hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Rival, <hi>Priſoners, but I muſt confeſs that is an act of Charity, which perform'd at ſuch an hour and under a Religious Habit, is of ſo great a merit before God and Man, that it gives a perſon a due right of ſlandring all others. Donna Barbara,</hi> whoſe quick and nimble wit had never wanted a repartee to all that was ſaid to her, did remain now ſtrangely confounded, ſo that ſhe only ſaid that ſhe underſtood her not. <hi>How! do you not underſtand me,</hi> replyed the Marchioneſs, who was reſolv'd to give it her home, <hi>ſtay a moment, and I will fetch you a certain thing that ſhall expound to you more clearly what I ſay to you, and ſhall let you ſee, that it is from good hands that I have it.</hi> She meant the Glove, which ſhe went to ſeek for in a Cloſet that was in her Chamber. The Marqueſs, who had heard all that fine Dialogue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out-meddling with the Diſpute, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47241:95"/>
himſelf about ſomething elſe, was very much pleaſed that his Wife had given her ſuch a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and ſhe had never done any thing in the world that had pleaſed him ſo much as to have humbled that Lady, who was the proudeſt Woman in the World. He could have wiſh'd, to compleat his joy, that the Governour had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who came juſt in the time that the Marchioneſs was returning with <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Glove. <hi>Here, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, giving it her, <hi>judge by that Token whether I am well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Adventure.</hi> The poor Lady was ſo caſt down with different thoughts, both at the ſight of that Glove, and at her Husband's unlucky arrival to make an end of ruining her, that ſhe retir'd, not being able to ſpeak one word more. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who did ſee her go ſo out of Countenance, and with a great fluſhing all over her Face, which did ſufficiently expreſs the diſturbance
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47241:95"/>
that was in her Soul, did inquire of the Marqueſs, what was the matter with her; he told him that he muſt enquire of the Marchioneſs, and the Marchioneſs ſaid that he muſt ask the Marqueſs, thus ſhifting him from the one to the other, without any other ſatisfaction. The Governour was not very well contented with this, and he would have gone to ſeek after his Wife, to know of her what occaſion ſhe had to ſeparate her ſelf after that manner from the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had they not been on the point of going, he therefore deferred his Information till his return, believing that at the moſt it could be but ſome Womans Quarrel, and knowing the humour of his, he did ſuppoſe that ſhe might have undertaken to make ſome Remonſtrances to the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about the Pilgrim, which the other had not taken kindly; and therefore he did not trouble himſelf any further about it. They all got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coaches, and drove on towards
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47241:96"/>
               <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> through which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs would paſs going for <hi>Madrid.</hi> The Governour had had a deſign to accompany them a Journeys way from <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> but that certain words which the Marchioneſs had let fall by the way concerning <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi> and the Pilgrim, which did bear double ſenſe, did give him more cauſe to think than was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and were the occaſion that he return'd home that night. No great ſtore of Diſcretion can be expected from Women in ſuch caſes, and there never was one yet that did ſpare her Rival, when ſhe could ruine her. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> was paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome very ſcurvy particles of time, as may be imagin'd after the late Encounter that ſhe had had with the Marchioneſs, who doubtleſs would not forbear, as ſhe imagined, informing the Governour throughly of it: So that ſhe was in ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, till ſhe did ſee him go along with them, gueſſing by that that

he was not over angry with her; ſeeing he did not deſiſt accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as he had deſign'd it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſhe began to breath and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice that ſhe had driven away the Marchioneſs from <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> and remained in ſole poſſeſſion of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhe preſently ſent to ſeek after her moſt dear Confident, to whom ſhe did relate what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Marchioneſs. Not conceiving from whom ſhe could have had all that Information, except it were the Marqueſs that had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd them at the going out of the <hi>Tower.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did fear very much for himſelf, in caſe this buſineſs ſhould be known, not doubting but the ſhare he had in it, would make him fall heavily under the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Anger, and made to bear the whole Burden. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did endeavour to encourage him, telling him that ſhe knew a way how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all the harms which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them; that they had two days
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47241:97"/>
to think of it, ſeeing that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was not to return till the next day, but that the Pilgrim was to be diſpoſed to aſſent to it, in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him the danger that their lives would be in, if they ſhould ſtay till the Governour returned; and that of neceſſity they muſt make their eſcape that night, and get into <hi>France,</hi> where they ſhould not fear to want for any thing, becauſe ſhe would carry along with her a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of Jewels, to ſhelter them all from it. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who would willingly be always the fartheſt from blows, did highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this Advice, and he did not believe that the Pilgrim would make any difficulty of following them, ſeeing that beſides his liberty which by that means he did recover, he could not but imagine, that there was much more for him to fear than for them. They therefore did conclude, that without a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay they would go to him, and inform
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47241:97"/>
him in what a condition things were, and ſee whether the propoſition would pleaſe him. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had put up her <hi>Fryars</hi> Habit in one of her Cloſets, whence they took it out, and the Father was again employed in the ſame Office as the night before. After which they went to the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, who was not a little ſurpriz'd to ſee <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> return in the ſame Diſguiſe at that time o'th' day. He could not forbear from expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his trouble at it, and ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearkening unto him, ſaid that ſhe came to inform him of two things, the firſt of them ſhe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but would very much afflict him, which was that the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was gone to remain in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited place, where ſhe was led by her Husband, that ſhe might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more be ſeen by any body but him. The other was, that before the Ladies departure, ſhe had told the Governour of her going to ſee him the laſt night, in a <hi>Fryars</hi> Habit,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47241:98"/>
as ſhe had learned it of the Marqueſs, which had met her and Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> as they were going out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> from whoſe hands ſhe had much to do to eſcape, with leaving one of her Gloves with him, which the Marchioneſs had ſhown to the Governour for Confirmation of what ſhe had ſaid; ſo that he might eaſily ſee what was to be done: That, as for her part, ſhe was fully reſolv'd to do whatſoever he pleaſed, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he would take care of his own life, which was that which ſhe held moſt dear. Though <hi>Camille</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf in order to his ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Marchioneſs, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they would be gone before he was got out of Priſon; yet the news of it gave him a mortal wound: as to what the Governeſs ſaid beſides, he did not add much Faith to it, and if he could have believ'd it, it had only aflicted him a little for the fear he would have had that the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Marchioneſs had believed he had
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47241:98"/>
contributed ſomething towards that Viſit, but apprehended nothing at all on the Marqueſs's account, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his life, of which he was very careleſs at that time. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara,</hi> who perceived that he continued ſilent, which made her think that he was thinking of what he ſhould reſolve concerning what ſhe had propos'd to him, did preſs him to give his anſwer; it was time to fix upon ſomething, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a flight, if he thought fit to ſave himſelf from the evil effects of the Governour's Fury, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſon very ſenſible of things of that nature, he would be highly exaſperated. <hi>Camille,</hi> who did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perceive which way the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies deſigns did tend, and who had choſen to dye rather than to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with her, did anſwer her very coldly, that he had acted nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Governour, which might draw his Anger ſo ſeverely upon him, and that if he had been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47241:99"/>
as ſo to do, however he would not involve her in his Miſery, and ſo render her more guilty than ſhe really was. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ſtruck to the heart with ſo cold an anſwer, as much as a paſſionate Woman as ſhe was could be, concealing her cruel rage, did tell him all that the wit of a Woman could invent of moſt perſwading, to engage him to yield to the propoſition which ſhe did make him, even in meer pity to her ſelf whom ſhe had loſt through the violent paſſion which ſhe had for him; adding to thoſe tender expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſuch Tears and Sighs as did tear ſome alſo from Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, who did declare of her ſide, with his eyes full of Tears, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade this inſenſible man to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own liberty, which they did offer him, and to ſhun that Death which would be inevitable, if he ſhould ſtay the Governour's return; but the hard-hearted, or rather pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Camille,</hi> who was not of ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47241:99"/>
a nature as was the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that perceived better than he did, on which ſide lay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger, did eaſily defend himſelf againſt all thoſe Attempts; of which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> being ſenſible, did then endeavour to make him appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all that a paſſionate and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Woman could imagine of moſt cruel and wicked, to ruine him with, and finding that all thoſe threatnings did not move him neither, in that height of paſſion ſhe drew from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her <hi>Fryars</hi> Gown a Stilleto, with a deſign to plunge it into her own Boſom, if the Pilgrim had not been nimble in ſtaying of her Arm, and after that he had much to do to force that Weapon out of her hands. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had been ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted at the Attempt, was on his Knees, intreating the tranſported Lady not to kill her ſelf, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim to have Compaſſion of her, who at laſt was mov'd, not at his Requeſt, nor at her furious Rage,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47241:100"/>
which had rather exaſperated him, ſeeing that all this did tend to make him miſerable, but unto thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which he had, that to ſhun one evil he ſhould create to himſelf divers others, if he ſhould drive that Woman into a diſpair: Therefore to reclaim her a little, he intreated her to deliver up that Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him, and that he would do all that ſhe ſhould deſire. She did not part with it but on that condition, and breathing a little, <hi>Ungrateful,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that ſtays till I cauſe my own death, before thou would'ſt grant me my life. I know not, Madam, whether the way that we are going to take, will not bring you ſooner to your end, than the abiding here. No certainly,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd ſhe, <hi>for the Governour being not in Town, I have the means to draw you from hence without the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; at the Port there are ſome Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louca's in readineſs to carry us to</hi> France, <hi>and I take with me that which ſhall ſecure you from want and miſery,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47241:100"/>
except you reckon it a miſery to have in your Company a Woman that loves you with ſuch a paſſion as I do. Camille</hi> did make her no Anſwer, to give her leave to think all that ſhe pleaſed, his deſign being to get out of Priſon, ſince it was to be ſo, whether he would or no, to ſhun greater evils, and not to humour the Amorous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricios of a Woman, for whom he had never had the leaſt inclination. However, things were ordered as if he had reſolv'd to content her; and the Lady was ſo tranſported with joy at it, that ſhe already thought her ſelf out of <hi>Barcelonna</hi> with her dear Gallant. The Governeſs and the good Father <hi>Andrew</hi> took leave of the Pilgrim to go order their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and prepare for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was to be at eleven at Night. The Father had all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Commiſſions in his charge, which were to hire the <hi>Felouca,</hi> to buy in Proviſions, and all other things neceſſary for a Voyage. And
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47241:101"/>
the Lady took upon her the care of the inward buſineſs, and to prevent all obſtruction of their flight: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, all things having been well regulated on her part, and Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having taken ſuch care as nothing ſhould be wanting on his ſide, when the hour was come they went to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy entered, being wholly tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy, and running immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into her dear Pilgrim's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Come, you muſt riſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſeeing him lye upon the Bed with the Curtains drawn, <hi>for it is time to be going, and we are Maſters as well of the Priſon as of the Palace</hi>; and finding that he neither anſwer'd nor mov'd, ſhe believ'd that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, therefore ſhe drew open the Curtains to pull and awaken him, but when ſhe perceiv'd the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who aroſe, it did ſet her on a ſudden into ſuch an amazement as may be imagined; which did ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe her, that after ſhe had made
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47241:101"/>
an extream out-cry, which affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who thought as little as ſhe did, to find the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour there, ſhe fell down backwards in a Swoun. This Lord, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Honour than of his Wife, whoſe humour he had known long, and fearing more the divulging of the buſineſs, than the effects thereof, having well conceived by all that the Marchioneſs had told him, that ſome things were acted within his doors, which did not go well, he had thought that it would not be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him to lye from home: He had been witneſs of the good-will which his Wife had expreſs'd for the Pilgrim, and making good uſe of the Marchioneſſes advice, had in a handſom manner taken leave of the Marqueſs, not ſhewing them the leaſt ſign of diſturbance, and was return'd to <hi>Barcelonna</hi> on a full gallop, where he came in the dark, judging that if there was any buſineſs in hand, his Wife would take the opportunity of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47241:102"/>
his abſence. Wiſe-men have always ſome fore-ſights of the miſchief that may befall them, and there are many in the World that would not have ſuch weights upon their Fore-heads, if they were as well inſpired as he was. Our Governour therefore being come into the City, had quitted his Horſe at the <hi>Arcenal,</hi> where having left his people alſo, he took one of his Servant's Cloaks, went into the Palace, and from thence into the <hi>Tower,</hi> without being known by any body. There he ſpoke with him that had the Pilgrim in charge, who being none of <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, did confeſs that he had let Father <hi>Andrew</hi> come to the Priſoner by the Lady Governeſſes Orders, who the firſt time had come to ſee him ſingly, but afterwards accompanied with a little <hi>Fryar</hi> of the ſame Order, and that the laſt night they had been long together. There needed no more for a man of underſtanding, as was the Governour, to unravel this
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47241:102"/>
Myſtery, and to gueſs who had been Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Companion in that Viſit, who was not not us'd to go accompanied in the Palace, and who had leſs occaſion to do ſo in going to viſit that Priſoner. He needed no further inſight in the buſineſs. He ſent the Goaler to the Port to hire a <hi>Felouca,</hi> who a moment after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to tell him, that there was but one, who had been retain'd by a <hi>Fryar</hi> of S. <hi>Dominick</hi>'s Order, who was to be gone that Night at eleven. This news did almoſt diſtract him, not doubting any longer but that his Wife was reſolv'd to be gone with this Pilgrim, or at leaſt to help him to eſcape. The <hi>Spaniſh Flemne,</hi> who did abound in him, did at laſt gain the upper hand over divers deſperate reſolutions which he had taken, and which he had been upon the very point of executing upon his own Lady, rather than againſt an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſtranger, who was not to be reſponſable of his Wifes follies, he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47241:103"/>
took the reſolutions therefore to break their meaſures without noiſe, and to oblige <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe by reaſon. He ſent the Goaler to the Pilgrim to get him out of Priſon, and conduct him to that <hi>Felouca,</hi> which Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had hired, with expreſs Orders from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the Watermen to be gone immediately, on pain of Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and a Charge to the Pilgrim, of never returning to <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> on pain of Death. This was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, with the greater ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Camille,</hi> who had no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that City, and who was happily going out of Priſon, and quitted of that cruel torment, in which he ſhould have been with the Governeſs.</p>
            <p>The Goaler having acquitted himſelf of all his Commiſſions, the Governour had laid himſelf in the Pilgrim's place, charging the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, not to tell of his being out of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47241:103"/>
Priſon, and to let any one in, that came to ſee him; thus had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour carryed on the buſineſs; his Wifes accident did ſomewhat miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his wrath, and made him loſe the opportunity of ſeizing Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who he had reſolv'd ſhould have been kept in Priſon for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, in recompence of all the good and pious Offices which he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to his Wife, none deſerving it better than he had done. But in a Retreat, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was always one of the firſt, ſetting all his ſafety in his heels; ſo that he was already gone far, when the Governour was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to detain him. There was no more to do, but to take care of the Lady, who he was forced to lead himſelf into her Appartment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe was a little recovered of her Swoun. How that breach was made up, I know not; for my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires fail me there, but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Governour's Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47241:104"/>
laſted no longer than did his Ladies Paſſion, who was not long before ſhe was ingaged in a new Gallantry with a Cavalier, leſs cruel than our Pilgrim.</p>
