            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

ſort of our people in diuers parts of our kingdome, either by ſecret
combination, wrought by ſome wicked inſtruments, or by ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the firſt beginners, haue preſumed lately to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
riotouſly in multitudes, and being armed with ſundry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
haue layd open in forcible maner a great quantitie of ſeuerall
mens poſſeſſions, ſome newly encloſed, and others of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
making their pretence that ſome townes haue been depopulated, and diuers families
vndone by meanes of ſuch Encloſures. In which ſeditious courſes they haue perſiſted not
onely after many prohibitions by our Miniſters in the ſeuerall Counties, but after particular
Proclamations publiſhed by our Royal Authoritie, &amp; which is more, when ſo many meanes of
lenitie and gentleneſſe were offered to reclaime them, as no Prince would haue vſed, but ſuch
a one as was both confident in the loyall affections of his Subiects in generall, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
towards the ſimplicitie of ſuch Offenders: many of them ſtood out moſt obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in open fielde rebelliouſly reſiſted ſuch forces as in Our name, and by Our authoritie
came to repreſſe them, whereupon inſued by neceſſitie in the end
that ſome blood was drawen
as well by martiall Execution, as by ciuil Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Vpon this accident it ſeemeth good vnto Vs to declare to the world, and ſpecially to Our
louing Subiects, as well that which concerneth Our affections (which vpon ſeueral reſpects
are diuided betweene comfort and griefe) as that which concerneth alſo Our Princely inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which likewiſe are bent vpon the contrary obiects and courſes of Grace and Iuſtice.
For firſt of all We finde cauſe of comfort in our ſelues in regard of the cleareneſſe of Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(to whome God hath committed the care and ſupreme Gouernment of Our people)
from giuing cauſe or colour of ſuch complaint; the matter whereof is ſuch, as Wee take Our
ſelues more intereſſed therein then any our Subiects can bee: For as Wee cannot but
know, that the glorie and ſtrength of all Kings conſiſteth in the multitude of Subiects, ſo
may Wee not forget that it is a ſpeciall and peculiar preheminence of thoſe Countreyes,
ouer which God hath placed Vs, that they do excell in breeding and nouriſhing of able and
ſeruiceable people, both for Warre and Peace, which Wee doe iuſtly eſteeme aboue all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Commodities, which our ſaid dominions do otherwiſe ſo plentifully yeeld vnto Vs.
Neither in this particular caſe of depopulation, can any man make doubt but it muſt bee farre
from our inclination to ſuffer any tolleration of that which may bee any occaſion to decay or
diminiſh our people, if wee did conſider nothing elſe, but that vſe and application which wee

<pb facs="tcp:28721:2"/>
may make (as other Princes do) both of the bodies of our people to carrie armes for defence of
our Crown, and of their goods and ſubſtance to ſupply our wants vpon all iuſt &amp; reſonable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
ſo as we may by many reaſons ſufficiently iuſtifie our care herein towards God &amp; the
world (foraſmuch as apperteineth to our Kingly Office) ſeeing the ſaid Incloſures (lawfull
or vnlawfull) were all or the moſt part made before we had taken the Scepter of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
into our Poſſeſſion. Whereunto we may adde (as wholy cleanſing and waſhing
our hands from the tolleration of theſe grieuances) the continuall and ſtrict charges and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
giuen by vs to our Iudges and Iuſtices, for, the care and reformation of thoſe
things which may bee in any wiſe grieuous to our people in their ſeuerall Countreyes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in this point there is ſome defence alledged by our ſubordinate Miniſters, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe, that our people haue beene wanting to themſelues in the due and
ordinary meanes which they ought to take, by preſentment of ſuch as are or haue beene guilty
of theſe oppreſſions. But as wee take comfort that the cauſes of theſe complaints haue not
proceeded from our Gouernment, hauing contrariwiſe (before theſe ſeditious courſes firſt
brake forth) taken into our Princely conſideration this matter of depopulating and decaying
of Townes and Families (whereof we are more ſenſible, then any other) with reſolution
to cure whatſoeuer is amiſſe, by iuſt and orderly remedies: So are wee grieued to behold
what the diſloyalty and obſtinacy of this rebellious people hath forced vs vnto, who being
naturally inclined to ſpare ſhedding of blood, could haue wiſhed that the humble and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
ſubmiſſion and repentance of all thoſe Offenders, might both haue preuented the loſſe of
the life of any one of them, and the example of Iuſtice vpon ſome might haue preuented the
loſſe of more. And ſeeing it was of ſuch neceſſity, that ſome in regard of their intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obſtinacy in ſo pernicious Treaſon ſhould periſh, rather then the ſparkes of ſuch a fire in
our Kingdome ſhould be left vnquenched, that it may yet ſerue to put others in mind of their
duetie, and ſaue them from the like ruine and deſtruction, for ſuch and ſo Traiterous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps
hereafter: In all which conſiderations, for that which may concerne our own Royall
intention, as wee would haue all men know and conceiue, that neither the pretence of any
wrongs receiued, nor our great miſlike of depopulation in generall, can in any wiſe ſtay vs
any longer, from a ſeuere and iuſt proſecution of ſuch as ſhall take vpon them to be their owne
iudges and reformers, either in this or any other pretended grieuance: So on the other ſide,
we are not minded that the offences of a few (though iuſtly prouoking our Royall indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
ſhall alter our Gracious diſpoſition to giue reliefe in this caſe, where it apperteineth, were
it for none other cauſe, then in reſpect of ſo many others our good and louing Subiects,
which might haue alledged like cauſe of griefe, and neuertheleſſe haue contained themſelues
in their due obedience.</p>
            <p>And therefore Wee doe firſt declare and publiſh our Princely reſolution, That if any of our
Subiects ſhall heereafter vpon pretences of the ſame or like grieuances, either perſiſt in the
vnlawfull and rebellious Act already begun, or renewe and breake forth into the like, in any
parts of our Kingdome; We will prefer the ſafetie, quiet, and protection of our Subiects in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and of the body of our State, before the compaſſion of any ſuch Offenders, bee they
more or leſſe, and howſoeuer miſled: and muſt forget our naturall clemency by purſuing them
with all ſeuerity for their ſo hainous Treaſons, as well by our Armes as Lawes, knowing
well, that We are bound (as the head of the politike body of our Realme) to follow the courſe
which the beſt Phiſitians vſe in dangerous diſeaſes, which is, by a ſharpe remedy applyed to
a ſmall and infected part, to ſaue the whole from diſſolution and deſtruction. To which ende
We doe accordingly charge and command all our Lieutenants, Deputie Lieutenants, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes,

<pb facs="tcp:28721:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Iuſtices of Peace, and all other Magiſtrates of Iuſtice vnder Vs, and all other our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Subiects to whom it ſhall any wayes appertaine, to doe and imploy their vttermoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours
and forces for the keeping of our Subiects in peace and obedience, for preuention of
all ſuch riotous and rebellious Aſſemblies, and deſtroying them, (if any doe remaine, or
ſhall happen to ariſe) by force of Armes, and by execution (euen to preſent death) of ſuch as ſhall
make reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide We doe notifie and declare to all our louing Subiects, That We are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
not out of any apprehenſion or regard of theſe tumults and diſorders (which Wee know
well to be only dangerous to thoſe that attempt them, and which experience may teach them,
that they are in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be diſperſed) nor to ſatiſfie diſobedient people, be they rich or poore:
But meerely out of loue of Iuſtice, Chriſtian compaſſion of other of our Subiects, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewiſe touched with this griefe, auoyded the like offences, As alſo out of our Princely
care and prouidence to preſerue our people from decay or diminution, To cauſe the abuſes of
Depopulations and vnlawfull Incloſures to be further looked into, and by peaceable and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
meanes to eſtabliſh ſuch a reformation thereof, as ſhall bee needfull for the iuſt reliefe of
thoſe that haue iuſt cauſe to complaine, and therin neglect no remedy, which either the lawes
of our Realme doe preſcribe, or our owne Royall Authority, with the aduice of our Councell
can ſupply.</p>
            <p>For which purpoſe wee haue already aſſembled our Iudges, and giuen them in charge
ſtraightly, to make it one of their principall cares aſwell to diſcouer the ſaid offences, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how farre they may be touched in law, and in what courſe, and accordingly to proceede
againſt them with all ſeueritie. And yet becauſe the execution thereof requireth ſome time,
though no more then muſt of neceſſitie bee employed therein, if any turbulent or ſeditious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
by their impatience, or through their deſire to ſatiſfie their owne wicked humors, by moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
common troubles ſhall ſeeke to preuent the courſe of Iuſtice by any ſuch vnlawfull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
as haue beene lately vſed, and abuſing our gracious diſpoſition ſhall take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
to be Reformers of the ſaid inconuenience by any force, becauſe they perceiue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
how much we miſlike of it: Wee doe once againe denounce vnto them the ſame ſeuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
which belongeth to Rebels in the higheſt degree, And doe require all and euery
our Magiſtrates, Officers and Miniſters of Iuſtice (according to their place of authoritie)
and all our loyall Subiects according to their duety of aſſiſtance (laying aſide all ſlackenes or
fond pittie) to ſee it duely put in execution: As on the other ſide we doe promiſe, and are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
graciouſly to lend our eares to humble and iuſt complaints, and to affoord our people
Iuſtice and fauour both in this and all occaſions fit for a King to doe for his good Subiects
in generall and in particular.</p>
