            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Did not at all wonder at
your earneſtneſs (the other
day) in reading the firſt
Pages of a little Book, entituled,
<hi>A Diſcovery of the admirable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Remedy,</hi> &amp;c. upon which
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou deſired I ſhould communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35103:4"/>
my Sentiments to you; as
alſo concerntng <hi>Febrifuges,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which there is now ſo much
diſcourſe. And this I thought I
might better do by Letter, than
by a verbal Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>This Book of <hi>Monſieur de Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gny</hi>'s
(to which we are indebted
for the new Diſcoveries in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick)
was no ſooner brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but I had the curioſity to
run it over, to ſee whether the
Remedy and the Method of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring
it were the ſame I had
practiſed with good ſucceſs in
Tertians, double Tertians, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
and alſo in continual and
Malignant Fevers, for five or
ſix Months laſt paſt. In the laſt
of which Fevers, it is not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
as in the Intermittents,
which it cures in few days. I
read, or rather devoured, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35103:4"/>
Book in a ſhort time, in hopes to
find what I ſought after: but I
found nothing of it but onely
the manner of his Diſcovery,
with an engagement to diſpenſe
it to ſuch as ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>I was at firſt a little offended
at his manner of proceeding, and
I doubt not but other Readers
of that Book have been ſo too.
But after ſome Reflections made
upon it, I found that the Author
had done as became a wiſe and
prudent man. For the making
this Remedy common, were in
effect to render it contemptible,
and to expoſe it to the abuſes of
Apothecaries, to whoſe intereſt
the longeſt Fevers are moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable;
or to the calumny of
thoſe old Phyſicians who have
long ſince taken the <hi>Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35103:5"/>
to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi>
theſe Gentlemen are unwilling
to uſe any Medicines but thoſe
left them by their Anceſtors,
leſt their preſent Practice ſhould
prove a convincing Argument
of their paſt Ignorance. Nay,
every little Barber would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know as much of it as
the moſt learned of Phyſicians,
who have for ſeveral years made
it their ſtudy: and would have
abuſed a Remedy which ought
no more to be truſted in the
hands of the unskilful, than
Fire-Arms in the hands of a
Child.</p>
            <p>Methinks it were not juſt
that the pains and ſtudy of a
Curious and Ingenious man
ſhould be expoſed as a prey to
every ignorant fellow: And that
the Honey of an induſtrious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35103:5"/>
Bee ſhould be a prize for a lazy
and idle Drone. The deſire
and emulation of diſcovering
what is by others kept as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
is an admirable way to find
out many other ſecrets, though
perhaps we find not that we
ſearch for. Many Phyſicians (I
ſuppoſe) in <hi>France</hi> have, as well
as my ſelf, applied themſelves to
the ſtudy of Experiments about
<hi>Febrifuges,</hi> ever ſince they have
been ſo much ſpoken of. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there are Medicines which
ſeem too loathſome to be taken,
their Compoſition being known,
but go down without difficulty
when they are kept as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſaying of St.</hi> Auguſtine
<hi>may poſſibly be objected to me,</hi>
That being Chriſtians, we ought not
to conceal that, which made known,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35103:6"/>
would conduce to the utility and
good of Mankind. <hi>To which may
be added what Dr.</hi> Sidenham, <hi>a
learned Engliſh Phyſician, ſaith,</hi>
That whoever hath any Specifick
Remedy, or any certain Method of
curing intermitting Fevers, merits
not the name of a good Citizen, or
of a prudent man, if he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
not a thing ſo neceſſary for the
good of Mankind: For it is not
the part of a good Citizen to turn
to his own particular profit that
which may bring ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to Humane Society; nor
of a prudent man, to deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the Divine Benediction,
which we may expect, when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our ſelves to procure the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good, and when we prefer
Virtue and Wiſdom before Riches
and vain Reputation.</p>
            <p>To this may be anſwered,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35103:6"/>
That if one were aſſured of the
benefit the Publick would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by communicating the
Compoſition of this Remedy, an
honeſt man could not conceal it
without a crime.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, if it be
more advantageous not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
it, then 'tis the part of a
good Citizen and a prudent man
to keep the myſtery of it ſecret,
procuring means whereby all
ſuch as deſire to have it prepared
may be furniſhed with it. I have
already given my reaſons in a
few words; and Dr. <hi>Sidenham</hi>
himſelf may ſerve for an inſtance,
that the publiſhing of a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
does not gain it a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.
He printed (about
four or five years ſince) his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
upon Acute Diſeaſes,</hi>
wherein there are excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35103:7"/>
for the cure of many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes;
and of Fevers alſo, which
he cures ſo perfectly, that at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
he is called the <hi>Fever-Doctor;</hi>
and yet for all this, we do not
ſee that his method is much u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>There have come out Books
very learned about the cure of
Fevers, and other Subjects, which
have been conſidered rather as
ſubtile Idea's, than as Diſcourſes
grounded upon Experience; and
yet theſe Books have been very
well received.</p>
            <p>But the Engliſh Doctor had no
ſooner ſignalized himſelf by the
great Cures he did, but every
one ſtrove to imitate his method.
And ſome particular perſons,
who thought they had his Secret,
have ſold it by the name of the
<hi>Engliſh Doctors Remedy</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35103:7"/>
and all over <hi>France.</hi> So much
did the very name of Secret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
its reputation. And now,
ſeeing that nothing will take but
what has the name of a Secret, it
is fit that we ſpeak no more of
our Remedy but as of a <hi>Secret,</hi>
to juſtifie the ſaying, <hi>Populus vult
decipi, decipiatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'm ſo far from being of their
opinion who treat the Engliſh
Doctor as a Mountebank, that I
do ingenuouſly acknowledge
that Phyſick is much indebted
unto him; and though he were
but an Apothecary in his own
Country, yet his Merit ſhould
make him be conſidered as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Phyſician of Fevers (or
Ague-Doctor). And thoſe who
ſlight and ſcorn his Method,
without knowing it, deſerve
much leſs than he to be called
true Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35103:8"/>
Not that I approve either of
the great myſtery which he
made of his Remedy, or of his
exorbitant Price: for this ſhew'd
too much of Covetouſneſs, and
too little Charity. And if this
be not the hiding ones Talent, it
is at leaſt a too reſerved em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
it.</p>
            <p>I ſhould think, that to keep
the Scales even, and to preſerve
as well the quality of a good
Chriſtian as of a good Citizen,
theſe Rules might be preſcribed,
as well for the ſatisfaction of
thoſe who would have it made
publick, as of thoſe who would
have it ſtill kept ſecret.</p>
            <p>1. Endeavour, with <hi>Monſieur
de Blegny,</hi> to give the Remedy,
or one very like it, to the Poor,
<hi>gratis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Not to impoſe upon ones
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35103:8"/>
ſelf a neceſſity of adminiſtring
every Doſe to the Patient; nor
to endeavour to hinder ſuch Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
as are curious in the ſearch
of it from finding it, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken the pains to examine
it: for after that, being ſatisfied
with the trouble they have been
at, they'l hardly go and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it to thoſe who have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
taken pains for the diſcovery
of the ſame.</p>
            <p>3. Not to fear to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it to thoſe of our Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and our Friends, eſpecially if
they live far remote from us,
whither it would be difficult to
ſend the Remedy; yet with this
Proviſo, that they do not make
it common.</p>
            <p>4. To aſſure our ſelves for two
or three years of its operation
and effects, by reiterated experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35103:9"/>
before we communicate it
to any: And if after this we
give ſome light of it in Writing,
in ſuch manner that the Learned
may (near the truth) conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
what it is, and form to
themſelves Idea's of it, which
may come very near the truth,
without letting the common ſort
penetrate into it.</p>
            <p>5. Not to maintain too eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that it is not ſuch or ſuch a
Drug; but let thoſe that will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it is a ſimple Infuſion of
<hi>Kinkina,</hi> or of <hi>Centaury,</hi> or if they
pleaſe, of <hi>Nut-ſhells,</hi> provided
the Patient be <hi>quickly, ſafely,</hi> and
<hi>agreeably</hi> cured, as far as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for a Phyſician who has
ne're a Loop-hole to ſee through
into the body of his Patient.</p>
            <p>Thus I believe that <hi>Monſieur
de Blegny,</hi> whoſe aim is the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35103:9"/>
good, and the good of the
Poor, would not be ſorry that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
ſhould find out his Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
after examination of the
taſte, colour, ſediment, and its
effects; ſince he himſelf had the
ingenuity to find out that of the
<hi>Engliſh Doctor,</hi> who made it ſo
great a myſtery.</p>
            <p>In the Chapter of the utility
of this Diſcovery, we find a very
good deſcription of certain Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
who in the cure of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
uſe nothing but Bleeding,
Caſſia, Sena, Clyſters, and a great
number of hard words; which
are to little purpoſe, unleſs to
deceive the curioſity of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
of the Nurſe, or of thoſe
people who will needs know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing. 'Tis not good ſo to
tie ones ſelf up to the authority
of the Ancients, as not to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35103:10"/>
what additions to the Art of
Phyſick have been made by the
Moderns, as well in the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of the Body, as in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Diſeaſes and their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
For there are a ſort of
Phyſicians who derive every
thing from <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> Nay,
one of theſe days, you ſhall ſee,
now that <hi>Febrifuges</hi> have gotten
a general eſteem, they'l be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſay, the Moderns borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them out of that Author.</p>
            <p>The Chapter about Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks
is very well done; for he
plainly ſets forth who they are
that deſerve that name, whether
thoſe who with great ſwelling
words of Greek and Latine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
the cure of the Sick, but
rarely perform it; or thoſe who
not being very well skill'd in
thoſe Tongues, yet cure their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35103:10"/>
Patients in few days. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
he puts too great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
upon ſome people who
have indeed made a great noiſe
in <hi>France,</hi> as one that was called
the <hi>Medecin de Boeufs,</hi> or <hi>Ox-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>
and one <hi>Father Ange,</hi> who
did no Miracles but ſuch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
either hazard, or an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
prepoſſeſſed by their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,
were the greateſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And then on the other
ſide, for a man that is an Enemy
to Satyr, he treats the ordinary
Phyſicians with too little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>The preference which ought
to be given to the <hi>Engliſh Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
is ſufficiently authorized by
its ſucceſs, and from that it does
not tire out the Patient. If this
of <hi>Monſieur de Blegny</hi> produce the
ſame effect, one would be glad
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35103:11"/>
to ſave forty Piſtols by taking
his Remedy; for the Engliſh
Doctor ſeldom took under Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And people will be very
cautious how they truſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with him that was his
Foot-man, who pretends he has
the ſecret of the Remedy; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he not having the leaſt

            <p>The deſign of advancing our
progreſs in the matter of <hi>Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges</hi>
beyond that of the <hi>Engliſh
Doctor,</hi> which we believe we
have found, obliged <hi>Monſieur de
Ville</hi> and my ſelf to ſtay a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Chymical Phyſician</hi> here, in
his return from <hi>America,</hi> where
he had practiſed Phyſick for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Ten years: But the poor
man, after he had told us very
ſtrange things of the practice of
Phyſick among the <hi>Americans,</hi>
fell unfortunately down a pair
of Stairs, and remained dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place. He had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Month with us, during
which time he had begun to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
unto us of the manner
of curing ſeveral very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35103:12"/>
Diſeaſes, as of Intermitting
Fevers, and particularly of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans;
of the ulcerated Cancer;
of the Gout; of the Ulcer of
the Lungs; of the Epilepſie,
and ſome others which puzzle
the moſt expert Phyſicians. He
had alſo prepared (for us) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Medicines in our preſence,
which we have found anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the relation he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of them; of the goodneſs
of which every days experience
convinces us.</p>
            <p>The Digreſſion I am going to
make, touching the practice of
Phyſick among the <hi>Americans</hi> of
<hi>Virginia,</hi> where he had ſojourned,
will not, I hope, be unpleaſant
to the Reader, nor quite from
our purpoſe, to ſhew the little
care had here of ſearching into
the nature and virtues of Plants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:35103:12"/>
He told us that they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Remedies (for all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes)
drawn from Simples;
and that he had ſeen very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Cures done there: That
they pierce the Skin with points
of Cane, which ſerved them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Lancets; and ſuck out
the Bloud without ſwallowing it,
which is inſtead of Phlebotomy
and Cupping-glaſſes. That they
cure the Dropſie after an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner, of which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of curing he has been an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs:
They take Flint-ſtones
and make them red-hot, and put
them into a hole made for that
purpoſe in the Earth, and make
the Patient lay his Belly over
them, whilſt they ſprinkle a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Decoction of three ſorts of
Herbs; one whereof is a kind
of <hi>Eſſula</hi> or <hi>Spurge:</hi> that after
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35103:13"/>
the Patient has received the
Smoak very hot againſt his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his Navel opens, and the
Phyſician lets out a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Water, according to the
ſtrength of the Sick; after
which, to cloſe up the aperture,
he applies a certain Moſs to it;
and this he repeats as often as
he thinks neceſſary, to draw out
all the Water. He related to us
the manner how they cured the
hardneſs of the Spleen, with a
Pultis made of a Root, which
produces the effect of a Veſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
in drawing to it abundance
of Water. This has ſome affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to the practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
who were wont to apply
actual Cauteries to the region of
the Spleen. He was alſo to have
diſcourſed to us of their ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
method of curing Venerial
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35103:13"/>
Diſtempers, and the Lethargie,

which at my requeſt he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
An <hi>American</hi> named <hi>Rao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comoco,</hi>
one of their Phyſicians,
(for a little money) ſhew'd him
a certain Root, which if chewed
in the Mouth, and the hands
rubbed therewith, one might
handle all ſorts of Serpents
without danger. He ſaid that
none beſides himſelf underſtood
the vertues of that Plant, which
he called <hi>Kibaſchkonko,</hi> that is, in
their Language, the <hi>Death of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;</hi>
or <hi>Serpents-bane:</hi> Its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are much like thoſe of the
Plant called <hi>Dictamnus Virginius,</hi>
which is found in <hi>Virginia.</hi> The
<hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions</hi> of the
<hi>Royal Society</hi> of <hi>London, Anno
1665,</hi> relate, that with this Plant

of a Staff, they kill that kind of
Serpent by them called <hi>Rattle-Snakes</hi>
if they but ſmell it, its
very ſmell making them dye
within the ſpace of half an hour.
That in all places where this
Plant grows, none of thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
are found.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Tranſactions we
find, that the <hi>Virginians</hi> have a
Root called <hi>Vichacan,</hi> wherewith
they cure Wounds. <hi>Raocomoco</hi>
paſſed for ſo able a <hi>Magician,</hi>
that he could (by the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one of their Gods called
<hi>Heiamſough)</hi> cauſe Slaves that
were run away to return to their
Maſters; and could handle bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Coals without receiving
any harm. He foretold that he
ſhould die a violent death; for
which cauſe he preſerved a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and converſed much with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35103:14"/>
the Engliſh, from whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
leſs danger than
from thoſe of his own Nation:
as indeed he had good reaſon; for
he was aſſaſſinated by order of
one of their petty Kings, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rendred himſelf ſuſpected
for having ſojourned too long
among the Engliſh of <hi>Carolina.</hi>
The knowledge of the qualities
of ſo many Plants is admirable
in thoſe ignorant people. There
may be ſome reaſon to believe,
that thoſe <hi>Daemons</hi> which inſtruct
their Prieſts, or Sacrifiſers, in the
art of Phyſick, cure Diſeaſes
only by the knowledge of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Plants and Minerals whoſe
vertues they underſtand, and
not without ſuch external means
as may naturally produce the
effect.</p>
            <p>A Fragment of the Oracles
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35103:15"/>
of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> may be ſeen in
<hi>Gruter,</hi> where the Remedies
which this God, or rather this
Daemon, preſcribes to the Sick
which come to conſult him, are
natural and proper for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.
Here follow three which
I have tranſlated.</p>
            <p>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S BEING SICK of a
pain in his ſide, and being given over
by all, the God <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this Oracle: That he
ſhould come and take off from the
Altar Aſhes which he ſhould mix
with Wine, and apply the mixture
to his ſide: Which he did, and was
preſently cured, and came publickly
to give thanks unto the God; and
the people congratulated his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>Here's the Remedy which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35103:15"/>
Women uſe for the pain in their
Sides; for they are wont upon
this occaſion to apply to their
ſide a little bag fill'd with hot
Aſhes. The Wine augments
the vertue of the Aſhes, in diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
the Wind, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the cauſe of this pain. But
as it muſt be a Phyſician who can
diſcern whether this pain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Wind or from ſome
other cauſe; it happens often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that people do more harm
than good with their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and inſtead of diſcuſſing
a Wind, augment an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was but beginning.</p>

Bloud, being given over by every
body, the God being asked, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to come and take off
the Altar Kernels of Pine-apples,

and eat them with Honey for three
days; wherewith he was cured;
and came to give thanks to the
God in the preſence of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Kernels of <hi>Pine-apples</hi> are

his Oracle, that he ſhould come and
take of the bloud of a white Cock,
and mix it with Honey, and make
thereof a Collyrium to be put upon
his Eyes for three days; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his Sight, and came to give
thanks publickly to this God.</p>
            <p>The bloud of a Cock is very
proper by its heat to diſſipate the
ſpots that are beginning in the
Eyes, and Honey clears the ſight;
ſo that there is nothing ſtrange
in it, if Medicines compoſed of
theſe two ingredients recover
the ſight of a man that began to
be blind. 'Tis true indeed, that
upon the ſame Marble may be
read the Cure of another blind
man, whom the God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to put his five fingers upon
the Altar, and then put them
upon his Eyes; which has in it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35103:17"/>
no natural cauſe which might
produce ſuch an effect.</p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>Febrifu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi>
we may hope that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerches
which ſhall be made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
may diſcover unto us many
things which now lie hid. And
to this purpoſe I think it would
be neceſſary for us to diſengage
our ſelves from the Sentiments
of the <hi>Antients</hi> wherewith we
are prepoſſeſſed; for theſe tell
us of nothing but <hi>Choler, Flegm,
Melancholy,</hi> Remedies cooling
and evacuating, and ſuch-like:
For upon their <hi>Principles,</hi> there
is no way for any new diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but we are confin'd, and
hindered from penetrating fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the nature of things.
I ſhall now give you ſome <hi>Idea's,</hi>
the cleareſt I can, of the nature
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35103:17"/>
and cauſes of a Fever, which are
not much different from the
Sentiments of the moſt learned
of the Moderns; upon which it
will be eaſie to explain its Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
and cure.</p>
            <p>A Fever is an extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
of the maſs of Bloud, which
diſturbs the Oeconomy of the body
of man.</p>
            <p>This Agitation is produced by
many external cauſes; as immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Exerciſes, heat of the Sun,
Falls, all thoſe Objects which
may ſtir up our Anger, Fear, or
Sadneſs, and by other cauſes,
which move the Bloud with too
much violence. But the moſt
ordinary cauſe of Fevers, and
which doth not onely produce
<hi>Ephemera's,</hi> and thoſe of a few
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ays, but alſo intermitting and
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ontinual Fevers with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35103:18"/>
at certain periods, and alſo
malignant Fevers, is a Ferment
or Chyle become too ſharp;
which being introduced into the
Bloud, does there produce an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Emotion, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
different Symptoms.</p>
            <p>And this may be proved from
this, that all ſharp Liquors, or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,</hi>
mixed with other Liquors
of an oppoſite nature, which we
call <hi>Alkalies,</hi> do cauſe an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence.
So if you mix Oyl of
Vitriol with Oyl of Tartar, they
make a conſiderable ebullition,
and become ſenſibly hot. The
ſame may be ſaid of many other
Liquors, of which I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this place, ſince it may
be ſeen at large in a book of Dr.
<hi>Grews,</hi> of the mixture of Liquors,
tranſlated into French by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Meſmin,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:35103:18"/>
Another proof, which to me
ſeems convincing, is, that the
Chyle mixing it ſelf with the
Bloud, cauſes every day natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
even in the moſt healthy, a
certain ſhadow as it were of a
Fever; which differs not from a
real Fever, but as <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs.</hi>
For half an hour or an hour after
Meals, as ſoon as the moſt ſubtile
part of the Chyle, or but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
which by its fermentation
it drives before it, doth inſinuate
it ſelf into the Bloud, it cauſes a
coldneſs in the hands and feet,
which is taken for a ſigne of
Health. In ſome it produces
Yawnings, and a deſire of Sleep;
with a Pulſe leſs, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
than ordinary. Here you
have the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Fever.
This cold being paſt, there ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
a heat all over the Body,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35103:19"/>
which is very great in the palms
of the hands, and ſoals of the feet
of ſuch as are of a Cholerick
temperament; and at the ſame
time the Pulſe riſes and beats
ſtronger. Here you have the
<hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> of the Fever.</p>
            <p>Four or five hours after Meals,
when all the Chyle is mixed with
the Bloud, and has receiv'd a
part of its perfection from the
circulation, the Heat diminiſhes,
the Pulſe comes to his natural
ſtate, and Appetite returns. Here
you have the <hi>declination</hi> of the
Fever.</p>
            <p>If after this one ſtay twelve
hours, or more, without eating
any thing, the Pulſe becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſlow, and the vigour one
had diminiſhes. Here you have
the ſtate of a man when the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is almoſt paſt. But as the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35103:19"/>
Aliments wherewith we are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
are not all alike, and our
Temperaments different; which
is the reaſon why ſome have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no Cold, that others feel
a great heat after Meat, and are
lighter or heavier; all which has
relation to the different accidents
or ſymptoms which accompany
the Fever.</p>
            <p>If the Chyle find the Bloud too
much ſubtilized or exalted, it
produces a lingring Fever; which
may be particularly perceived
after Meals. This cauſes lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and a conſiderable falling
away in the Patient.</p>
            <p>By this may be underſtood
the reaſon why <hi>Coffee</hi> and <hi>Thea,</hi>
taken after Meals, hinders thoſe
from ſleeping who are ſubject to
ſleep, unleſs a common cuſtome
of drinking one or other of them
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35103:20"/>
render them ineffectual, becauſe
by their bitterneſs and moderate
heat, they diſſipate the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick
fumes of the Chyle. This
alſo conduces to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what the Naturaliſts ſay of
Lions and Goats, that they have
every day a Fever: for as they
are of a Temperament hot and
dry, their Chyle has the greater
diſproportion to their Bloud, and
in mixing it ſelf with it, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
a greater Combat than in
other Animals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of one
<hi>Caius Maeſenas,</hi> who had all his
life long a Fever, and never ſlept
a moment during the three laſt
years of his life. On the other
ſide, Deer that are of a cold and
dry Temperament, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
their Bloud leſs apt to
ferment, never have any Fever,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35103:20"/>
as the ſame Author ſays. He
adds, that certain Ladies having
accuſtomed themſelves to eat
Deers fleſh every morning, lived
very long free from Fevers.</p>
            <p>This Ferment, in intermitting
Fevers, has its ſeat in the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
of the Velvet-coat of the
Stomach and Inteſtines, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by Monſieur <hi>Payer.</hi> Theſe
Glandules have each their little
Channels of Excretion, through
which they diſcharge a very lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
Seroſity, which is of the
ſame nature of the <hi>Lympha</hi> which
circulates through the whole
Body; and this ſubtile Liquor
joyned to that which is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furniſhed by the <hi>ductus Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vales,</hi>
and to the <hi>Pancreatick</hi>
juice, ſerves for a ferment and
diſſolvent for the Chyle.</p>
            <p>This Diſſolvent being too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35103:21"/>
communicates to the Chyle
its Aciditie, even as Acids cauſe
a Coagulation in Milk; ſo that
the Chyle entering into the Veins
and Arteries, and not being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being perfectioned by the
ordinary circulation, when a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
thereof great enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Fermentation, remains in
the Bloud more violent than that
which happens after Meals; the
fit of the Fever begins and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
until this ſharp Chyle be
diſſipated and driven out by
Sweat or inſenſible Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now according as this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in greater or leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
or the Bloud more or leſs
ſuſceptible of an Efferveſcence,
Fevers become Tertians, double
Tertians, or Quotidians, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
or double Quartains. So
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35103:21"/>
the Cholerick having their Bloud
more boyling and ſubtile, fall
commonly into Tertian, or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tertian Fevers.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Antients
have ſaid, and 'tis in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
true, That Choler is the
cauſe of Tertian Fevers, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
and continual: for
there is reaſon to believe, that
that which cauſes an Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
cauſes alſo a continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the ſame kind, ſeeing that
every fit of an Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is as it were alittle Continual
Fever, and a Continual as a long
fit of an Intermittent; the fit of
this, beginning, continuing, and
ending almoſt as a Continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The continuity proceeds
from this, that the Chyle intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the Bloud, could not
be perfected, and by conſequence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35103:22"/>
the maſs of Bloud could not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
a Ferment fit to make the
digeſtion of the Aliments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
'Tis alſo to be obſerved,
that the maſs of Bloud acquiring
a more <hi>acre</hi> and inflamable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
the Chyle, although na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
produces alſo a Continual
Fever; which is a thing to be
noted in the practice of Phyſick:
for then bleeding and cooling A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments,
and Medicines, will be
more convenient; and above all,
ſuch Acids as calm the agitation
of the Bloud, by thickning and
cooling it, and by precipitating
the ſulphurous parts which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Tumult.</p>
            <p>This being thus laid down, it
will not be difficult for me to
anſwer many Queſtions that
may be made about Fevers and
Febrifuges. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:35103:22"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whence come the Shiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in Fevers, and why are the
Shakings greateſt in Quartains?</p>
            <p>The Acid Liquors thickning
the Bloud among which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to mix themſelves, hinder it
from communicating its heat to
the parts; and the Bloud the
more diſtant it is from the
Heart, the leſs hot it is: This is
the reaſon why the Shiverings
begin at the Extremities of the
Body, and continue until, by the
efforts of the Heart and Arteries
to purifie the Bloud by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
pulſation, all that fume
be diſſipated, the heat of the
Bloud violently agitated ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the cold fit. The Ferment
of Quartains is more acid and
glutinous, and the Bloud more
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35103:23"/>
groſs; which cauſes moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the Cold to be more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
And as theſe Vapours
often have much acrimony in
them, they ſometimes affect the
membranous parts by which
they paſs, in ſuch manner, that
the Patient ſuffers pains as if one
ſtuck Pins in his Body. Thoſe
who have their Bloud ſubtile,
and the Chyle more groſs, have
their Fits without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Cold.</p>
            <p>2. Whence proceeds the heat of
Fevers which ſucceeds the cold fit,
whence the thirſt, pains of the
Reins, and Head-ach?</p>
            <p>The heat proceeds from the
irregular motion of the Particles
of the Bloud, which is compoſed
(according to the Obſervations
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35103:23"/>
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the <hi>Microſcope)</hi>
of an infinite number of little red
<hi>Globules</hi> ſwimming in a clear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for the heat of all Bodies
proceeds but from the motion
of their ſeveral Particles. The
thirſt proceeds from the heat,
which conſumes the ſeroſity of
the Chyle. The pains of the
Reins which accompany ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the cold fit, ſometimes the
hot, are cauſed by the ebullition
of the maſs of Bloud, in the great
Veſſels lying along the Reins.
The Head-ach is the effect of the
violent beating of the Arteries of
the Brain againſt the Membranes
that encompaſs it: ſo thoſe
whoſe Bloud riſes higher, or beats
ſtronger, or who have their
Membranes more ſenſible, have
alſo more of the Head-ach than
others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:35103:24"/>
3. Why are melancholy People,
which abound with acid humours,
leſs ſubject to Feavours than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
            <p>Becauſe the maſs of Bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infected with this Acidity,
and unapt to ferment, and the
Chyle, though it often contract
an acidity in the Stomach, yet
produces it no Fever, as being of
the ſame nature with the Bloud:
for two Liquors that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one to the other, do not
ferment together, no more than
two Friends whoſe Sentiments
are agreeable, do quarrel and
fight. So that you need not
wonder if in cold Countries they
be leſs ſubject to Fevers, than in
hot Climates; and if thoſe whoſe
Bloud is more groſs and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35103:24"/>
are leſs attacked by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
than others. This made
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſay, That thoſe who
have ſharp Winds, are not very
ſubject to the Pleuriſie; becauſe
their Bloud is more groſs, and ſo
leſs apt to precipitate it ſelf with
violence upon the ſide, to cauſe
Inflammation. I remember I ſaw
at <hi>Monpellier</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi> who in a
Fit of Melancholy had caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of a Window two ſtories
high into the ſtreet, and had
with the fall broken his legs and
arms: This man during his
whole Cure had no Fever at
all.</p>
            <p>4. Whence is it that Fevers are
more frequent and more obſtinate
in Autumn, than in the other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the year?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:35103:25"/>
'Tis becauſe the preceding
Summer has rendred the Bloud
too inflamable, and more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
of a Fever; beſides that
the inequality of the Seaſon helps
much to corrupt the Chyle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Further, Fruit coming in now in
abundance, produces in thoſe that
eat much of it, a Ferment that
cauſes long and obſtinate Fevers,
particularly Quartains; which
ſometimes continue from one
year to another, according to the
Sentence of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the
old method of curing them.
<hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, that Quartains begin
not in Winter; and indeed it is
but very rarely that they do:
But the temperature of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
is uncertain; for ſometimes
we ſee in the middle of Winter,
days like thoſe in the Spring or
Autumn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:35103:25"/>
5. How is it that Tertians
change into double Tertians and
Quartains, and Quartains into
Tertians?</p>
            <p>Tertians change into double
Tertians, and Quartains into
double Quartains, when the
Chyle becomes more diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
to the Bloud; and theſe
two Liquors not agreeing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
do juſtle one another the
oftener. Tertians become Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
when by a too cooling Diet
or cooling Medicines, unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
given, the Ferment becomes
ſharper or ſowerer, and the Bloud
thicker.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, Quartains
change into Tertians, when by a
too hot Diet or Medicines, the
Ferment and the maſs of Bloud
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35103:26"/>
become more ſubtile and more
inflamable. And generally, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents
may be changed into
Continuals, by an ill <hi>Regimen,</hi>
and over-hot Medicines; which
makes all the Ferment paſs into
the Veins, and renders the Bloud
too ſuſceptible of an Agitation
of long continuance. And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuals
become Intermittents,
when Nature ſtrives to diſengage
her ſelf from this Ferment, in
precipitating it into its firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages;
as after the ebullition of
Oyl of Vitriol and Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
there is precipitated to the
bottom of the Glaſs a white mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which we call <hi>Tartar Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. What is the cauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Return of Fevers?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:35103:26"/>
Though there be ſomething
inexplicable in the return of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
which is ſometimes as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as the flux and reflux of the
Sea, I ſay, that it ſeems probable
that it proceeds from the equal
portion of Aliments which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and of the Chyle which is
made: For thoſe who eat too
much, cauſe the Fit to come
ſooner, though indeed it might
come ſooner for other reaſons,
as when the Bloud, heated by
the preceding Fits, becomes more
ſuſceptible of Fermentation. On
the other ſide, it comes later,
when leſs nouriſhment is taken,
or when the Ferment begins to
grow milder. In fine, there are
ſome Fevers that are both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and unequal as to their
Returns; which is a mark of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35103:27"/>
diſorder either in the Orgains, or
in the maſs of Bloud, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the cure of ſuch Fevers more
difficult, and more ſubject to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes;
and this may be called a
Symptomatick Fever, as is that
which proceeds from Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>7. Why comes not the Fever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſick ſoon after Meal?</p>
            <p>The reaſon will eaſily appear,
if you do but conſider that the
laſt Fit of the Fever has diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and driven out, by a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Tranſpiration, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by a copious Sweat, a
great part of the Acidity of the
<hi>Lympha</hi> that produced theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders:
So that immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Fit, it is not ſtrong enough,
nor in quantity great enough, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35103:27"/>
give to the Chyle a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Acidity; which may
produce (when it is mixed with
the maſs of Bloud) that Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and Emotion, which
we call a Fever. But this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
having recruited its forces,
and being augmented both by
time, and the Aliments taken,
will not fail to give battel to the
Bloud, as formerly. Thoſe who
have any knowledge in <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi>
and have made Obſervations
on the Opperations of Nature,
will eaſily be of my Opinion:
for they will have obſerved that
a long Fermentation is required
to make a Liquor that is <hi>ſweet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
acid; and that there muſt be
a certain quantity of Liquors one
contrary to another, to produce
a Fermentation that is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
By this one may give
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35103:28"/>
a reaſon why thoſe who obſerve
no <hi>Regimen,</hi> and forbear nothing
that they imagine will gratifie
their Appetites, cauſe the Fit to
come ſooner, and to continue
longer. On the contrary, thoſe
who govern themſelves regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are ſooner delivered from
that domeſtick Enemy. At the
ſame time may be ſeen the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the Fever ceaſes, if the
Ferment be changed by a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament
contrary to its nature;
and which may reduce it to its
firſt ſtate, and that without any
conſiderable evacuation. Had I
been minded to make a Book ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a kind of Letter, I
ſhould here have made ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
upon the Nature and
Origine of Acids, and upon the
difference of Fermentations;
but ſince theſe things are ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35103:28"/>
treated of by <hi>D'Willis</hi> and
<hi>Monſieur Maiow;</hi> I ſhould have
done no great ſervice to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
by explaining in French
what they have written in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
            <p>8. Whence is it that the hands
and feet, and ſometimes the faces
of thoſe who have Fevers, ſwell?</p>
            <p>Becauſe the aqueous parts of
the corrupted Chyle being driven
to the extremities of the Body,
the heat of the hands and feet,
in compariſon of the other parts
of the Body, being ſo ſmall that
it cannot diſſipate it, and the
hardneſs and denſity of the skins
does not eaſily admit of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration.
This may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the hands and feet,
where working and walking ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35103:29"/>
the skin of thoſe parts harder
than that of the reſt of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
And our Practice ſhews us
that theſe Swellings happen moſt
commonly in thoſe who void
the leaſt Urine and ſweat not,
and in feeble and aged perſons.
So that theſe Swellings are not
ſo much to be feared, provided
they depend not on ſome Diſeaſe
of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and the Fever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh:
for they will afterwards
be diſſipated by Purgatives and
Cordials.</p>
            <p>9. Why do Quartains, when they
continue long, introduce a Dropſie,
hardneſs of the Liver, or Spleen,
or a Jaundice?</p>
            <p>A Dropſie ſucceeds a Quartain
by the ſame means that cauſe the
ſwellings of the extreme parts of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35103:29"/>
the Body. When this Seroſity,
inſtead of diſcharging it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hands and feet, falls into
the Belly, or when thoſe parts
are already puft up, then the
Swelling riſes up to the legs,
then to the thighs, and ſo to the
belly; or what is yet worſe,
when by the long continuance
of the Diſeaſe, the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are ſo
dried and hardened, that they
cannot purifie the Bloud, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the Seroſity from it. This
hardening and <hi>ſchircus</hi> of the
Liver and Spleen, are the effects
of the continual diſſipation which
the febrifick heat makes of the
nutritive moiſture. And the
Jaundice is an effect of theſe
hardenings and obſtructions of
the lower Belly, cauſed by the
acid Ferment, which makes the
Choler flow back into the Veins,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35103:30"/>
ſtopping the paſſages which
ſhould convey it to the bladder
of the Gall. Now it is certain,
that Acids obſtruct and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
in thoſe parts where they
predominate. So that what
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, That a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is not onely not dangerous,
but exempts thoſe that have it
from other great Diſeaſes, may
be true in <hi>Greece,</hi> which lying
under a hotter Climate than
ours, produces not Quartains ſo
obſtinate and incommode, as are
thoſe which reign in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
as well becauſe their Bloud
is not ſo groſs, as becauſe there is
a better Tranſpiration. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
Climates do ſtrangely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifie
Diſeaſes; for we are not
acquainted with thoſe <hi>Quintains,
Septain,</hi> and <hi>Nonain</hi> Fevers, which
have their Fits every fifth, every
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35103:30"/>
7th and every 9th day, whereof
the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks. A
Collegue of mine told me that
he had ſeen, not long ſince, a
<hi>Septain</hi> Fever, the Patient having
had five or ſix Fits, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
regularly every ſeventh
day. And I ſaw one lately who
had three Fits every ſeventh day,
which might perhaps be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of hazard, rather than of a
regular motion.</p>
            <p>10. Whether a great Abſtinence
can cure a Fever?</p>
            <p>That which gives occaſion for
this Queſtion, is, what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid, That it was the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and ſharp Chyle that was
the moſt ordinary cauſe of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
whence it might be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that eating nothing from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35103:31"/>
one Fit to another, would cure
the Patient. To which I anſwer,
That it is the ordinary Remedy
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have few
Phyſicians among them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
four or five days together
without eating any thing, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Broths, drinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Water wherein are
a few pounded Almonds; and
moſt commonly in this time they
are cured of the Fever, whether
it be Continual or Intermitting,
eſpecially of Tertians and double
Tertians. But this Example is
not to be imitated in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
For the <hi>Greeks</hi> keeping Faſt
two third parts of the year, and
oftentimes faſting whole days
without taking any thing at all,
'tis no wonder if they can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
ſo long an Abſtinence. But
in our Climate where we eat
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35103:31"/>
much, and that of very nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Aliments, it were no leſs than
the hazard of ones life, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſuch an Abſtinence: And
we have ſeen here a Perſon of
Quality die with faſting from
one Fit of a Quartain to another.
It may be objected, that they
ought to be cured after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
or third day; but you muſt
conſider that their Drink, which
has in it ſomewhat of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
makes a little Chyle,
which may cauſe ſome Fits,
though leſs than if the Patient
had taken more ſolid Aliments.
And yet the heat being at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the digeſtion of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
doth more eaſily diſſipate
the reſt of the Ferment. The
method of the moſt part of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Phyſicians is yet more cruel,
and leſs reaſonable: for they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35103:32"/>
forbid their Patients to drink du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Fit; which doth
grievouſly heat them, and for
the moſt part nothing advance
their Cure.</p>
            <p>11. Whether is Phlebotomy a
Febrifuge?</p>
            <p>As the word Febrifuge ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
every thing that may drive
away the Fever, there is no
doubt but that bloud-letting is
oftentimes a Febrifuge, eſpecially
when the Fever proceeds onely
from ſome exteriour cauſe, which
has excited an emotion in the
Bloud, as Exerciſe, heat of the
Sun, Wine, Anger: for in theſe
caſes bleeding has almoſt the
ſame effect that giving air to a
Tun when the Wine boils, leſt
it ſhould burſt. If bleeding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35103:32"/>
were not uſed, the Bloud which
then poſſeſſes more room than at
other times, might open the
veſſels of the Lungs, and of the
Brain, and ſo cauſe ſpitting of
Bloud, a Phrenſie, or ſome other
grievous Symptoms. But in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Fevers, where an acid
Ferment is the principal cauſe,
bleeding is no Febrifuge; not but
that we muſt often begin with
it, eſpecially in double Tertians,
which are next to Continuals,
and that with deſigne to render
the Bloud leſs ſuſceptible of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation,
or to diminiſh its ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude;
but I take it to be for
the moſt part dangerous in Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and onely apt to make the
Diſeaſe of longer continuance;
unleſs there be ſome other Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which require it, the
knowledge whereof belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Phyſician.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:35103:33"/>
12. Whether Laxatives, Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanes,
and other Purgatives, be
Febrifuges?</p>
            <p>When the Ferment of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is ſupported by Crudities of
the Stomach, then purging may
be a Febrifuge, and prevent the
Fit which would have followed
by delivering the Organs from
that burthen which loaded them,
leaving them the liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
themſelves, and to drive
out the reſt of the Ferment.
But if this Levain or Ferment
have its ſource in the <hi>poſts</hi> we
have aſſigned it, or if the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
have any diſeaſe which
may make it corrupt the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are taken, then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
cannot be a Febrifuge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
by accident: For Example,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35103:33"/>
by exciting a <hi>Diarrhea,</hi> which
often cures the Patient. Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
are for the moſt part neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to clear the way for Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges,
otherwiſe Catharticks do
not cure the Fever; whether it
be that the Ferment being not
yet qualified and tamed, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
rendered more fierce and
wild, or that they paſs but onely
into the Veins and Arteries.
Nay, it often happens that the
Agitation which they make in
the ſeveral parts of the Body,
pervert their Action, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
weaken the Patient, and
carry off too much <hi>Bile;</hi> which
is the balm of the Chyle and
Bloud, when it is not irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>13. Whether Vomitives be Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuges?</p>
            <p>

Vomitives are ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the ſick of Fevers, but
eſpecially when the ſick perſon
finds in himſelf a diſpoſition to
vomit, becauſe they diſcharge
the Stomach of thoſe impurities
which hinder it from doing its
office, and evacuate the matter
which would augment the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſo that they are not Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuges
but by accident: Nay,
they are very often dangerous,
becauſe they do much fatigate
the Patient, weaken the Stomach,
and ſometimes open the veſſels
of the Lungs. In a Quartain
particularly you muſt make no
uſe of them, when it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
too long, becauſe the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being glutinous and infil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
into the firſt Region,
cannot be diſlodged without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35103:34"/>
efforts: if they are mild,
they do but cauſe an emotion or
diſturbance; and if they are
violent, they put the Patient in
danger of his life, unleſs he be of
a very robuſt Conſtitution. And
herein I think my ſelf obliged to
give the Publick this Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That they be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
how they commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to thoſe Barbers, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
and Mountebanks, who
promiſe to cure all Diſeaſes with
a little Powder, or a little clear
inſipid Water; becauſe theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
are for the moſt part <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial,</hi>
and of the moſt violent,
which are put up in a little room,
or Water wherein they have
boiled <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Arſenic,</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale;</hi>
which never operate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſing a furious Irritation or
Convulſion of the Stomach.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35103:35"/>
And if they do carry off the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
yet do they leave behind
them impreſſions of heat in the
<hi>Viſera,</hi> pains in the Stomach,
and ſpitting of Bloud. It were
but juſt that the Judges of the
Court eſtabliſhed for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Poyſoners, ſhould take
cognizance of ſuch as kill the
ſick by theſe Poyſons. Though
they may ſay that a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of theſe Drugs is not capable
of poyſoning, yet I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that when they give them
to perſons of delicate Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
who die of it, one may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay that they have given them
Poyſon. Beſides that, under
pretence of theſe dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
it would be eaſie for a
Poyſoner to augment the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of his Doſe, and then ſay he
gave it onely for a Vomit.</p>

14. Whether the making ones
ſelf drunk with Wine or Aquâ
Vitae, will cure a Fever?</p>
            <p>Wine drank to an exceſs, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
a great ebullition in the
Bloud, and often drives out (by
different ways) the cauſe of the
Fever; and ſome have been ſo
cured: but this is not an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be imitated; for one
ought to be very well aſſured of
his own ſtrength, and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which a body, already
grown feeble with the effects of
the Diſeaſe, can make againſt the
effects of Drunkenneſs, as it may
be either a Lethargie, Pleuriſie,
or Death it ſelf: ſo that he muſt
neither have common Senſe, nor
any the leaſt tincture of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
that would preſerve the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35103:36"/>
health of his Body by a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Remedy, to the prejudice
of that of his Soul. I leave it
to others to think whether a
man dying drunk, die in a good
condition. As for Brandy, we
ſhall leave it to the Hollanders,
who have accuſtomed themſelves
to drink it, and ſo can better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the effects; they drink it
commonly before the cold Fit,
which it may poſſibly leſſen;
but muſt needs render the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
hot Fit more intenſe and
violent. And when they would
quite rid themſelves of it, they
drink whole pints; which has
ſometimes good ſucceſs upon Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and other robuſt bodies.</p>
            <p>15. Whether are Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Febrifuges?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:35103:36"/>
'Tis certain that Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are a great help towards the
cure of Intermitting Chronical
Fevers: but you muſt obſerve,
that 'tis thoſe Waters particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which are hot and impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a niterous ſalt like that
of the Antients, and with ſome
ſulphur, as thoſe of <hi>Bourbon l'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambaud,</hi>
and <hi>Vichy.</hi> This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in them, in the Journey I
made laſt Spring with <hi>Monſieur
Garnier</hi> the Son, and <hi>Monſieur de
Ville</hi> my Collegue. In this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
I ſay, we throughly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
our ſelves of all that ought
to be believed of theſe great <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines;</hi>
from which indeed many
ſick people return very much
relieved: but we found that they
were not univerſal Remedies, as
ſeveral Hiſtorians have written,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35103:37"/>
who have rather applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the making a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the magnificence of the
<hi>Bathes, Vaſes,</hi> and <hi>Buildings</hi> that
belong to them, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us by repeated Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of the Salt, and of the
Mineral wherewith they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated.
And when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
this, whether it be that
they underſtand not how to
make the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> or that they
believed that one ſingle Salt
could not be capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ſo many effects; one while
they tell us that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with Niter, Sulphur,
and Vitriol altogether; another
while they tell us, that 'tis with
Sulphur, Vitriol, and Alum:
After all this, they tell us that
they are impregnated with Iron,
Niter, and Vitriol; whereof they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35103:37"/>
are pleaſed to give us no other
proofs than the pretended Cures
done by thoſe Waters. But if
(happily for us) they had ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, as did the learned <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
du Clos,</hi> and after him <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Fouet,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Vichy,</hi>
they had ſpared us the trouble of
a Journey of ſix or ſeven weeks,
to examine the Waters of about
thirty Mineral Springs ariſing
thereabouts; of which one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rightly make uſe, without
firſt having taken the pains to
viſit them, and anatomize them
by ſeveral Experiments. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
may one avoid the confuſion
of ſeeing his Patients return from
the Waters in a worſe condition
than they went thither. And
had not the moſt part of our
Phyſicians been herein ſo often
deceived, the wittieſt Comedian
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35103:38"/>
of our Age would never have
made it the ſubject of his publick
Raillery. But to return, I ſay that
the Waters of <hi>Bourbon l' Archam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baud,</hi>
and thoſe of <hi>Vichy,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
one know how to uſe them,
and that great care be taken of
the ſtate and condition of the
ſick, are often Febrifuges, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their niterous Salt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are impregnated, and
the ſulphurous and balſamick
parts wherewith they are inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
By this Compoſition, I ſay,
the Acidity of the <hi>Lympha</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much ſweetned, the nutritive
parts are fortified, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
heat reſtored to its former
ſtate, the obſtructions of the firſt
Region opened, and in fine, what
remains of ſurcharge and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the whole maſs of Bloud,
is thruſt out from the centre to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35103:38"/>
the circumference, by Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Sweats, and Urine. Yet
nevertheleſs, if before the uſe of
theſe Waters the ſick be not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepared, or be ſubject to a
defluxion of ſharp Seroſities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Breaſt, or to Obſtructions
of the <hi>Hypochondres,</hi> then the
Waters which abound in Niter,
meeting with a maſs of Bloud
very ſulphurous and inflamed,
will not fail to raiſe very impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
motions, and to change an
Intermitting Fever into a moſt
acute Continual; and ſo reduce
the Patient to the laſt extremity;
as may be ſeen every day in thoſe
who neglect the Advice of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Phyſician.</p>
            <p>16. Whether Theriaca, Orvie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and ſuch-like, cure Fevers?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:35103:39"/>
It may happen that Bodies
that have been well prepared by
bleeding, purging, and other
means, wanting ſtrength and
vigour, have been holpen by a
dose of <hi>Theriaca,</hi> or other hot
Compoſitions which ſubtilize
the humours: But as People
give theſe Remedies without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
or method, it happens
oftentimes that the Bloud is
thereby rendred more apt to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which increaſes Thirſt,
Head-ach, and the Fever it ſelf.
There are ſome who cure a
Quartain when it is inveterate,
by rubling the back-bone with
<hi>Theriaca</hi> and <hi>Aquâ Vitae;</hi> which
ſubtilizes the Bloud, and helps to
diſſipate the Ferment by Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration:
But for the moſt part
ſtronger Machines are required
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35103:39"/>
to ſubdue an Enemy ſo pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
            <p>17. How can Fear cure a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</p>
            <p>Some have been known to be
cured of a Quartain by a ſudden
fear, even when they were ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
in their cold Fit. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth
cured one on this manner: He
had taken a Caſtle wherein he
found a Gentleman in a Fit of a
Quartain Ague; the King made
as if he had been in great anger,
and looking upon him, told him
he'd diſpatch his Fever preſently;
and call'd for a Paper, and wrote
thus:
<q>
                  <l>Quartain Ague, I conjure thee,</l>
                  <l>By the long Beard of <hi>Mercurie,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:35103:40"/>
Out of this Body thou diſlodge,</l>
                  <l>As from hence has done <hi>Deſloges.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The poor Gentleman, who
thought the King was writing the
Sentence of his Death, was ſeized
with ſo great a fear, that the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
left him. 'Tis the effect of
the extraordinary agitation of
the Spirits, which ſubtilizes the
groſs bloud of Quartains. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
this is a Remedy not
to be uſed: for if the Fear be but
ordinary, it is not capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the deſired effects; and if
it be great, it may cauſe Death:
for there are many that die of
Fear, either ſuddenly, or ſome
ſmall time after, by the diſorder
which it raiſes in the whole Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy
of the Body.</p>
            <p>18. Why are Fenny, Moriſh,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35103:40"/>
and Moiſt places moſt ſubject to
Fevers?</p>
            <p>Becauſe out of theſe places
there is a perpetual Exhalation
of acid Corpuſcules, which by
reſpiration mix themſelves with
the Bloud, and ſo communicate
their Acidity to the <hi>Lympha;</hi>
which produces different ſorts of
Fevers, according to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Body. This may be
ſeen in Iron, which in all moiſt
places contracts Ruſt in a very
ſhort time; and every body
knows that Ruſt is cauſed by all
Acids. And further, if in moiſt
grounds there be vaults which
may ſtop thoſe Atomes, they
become conſiderably furniſhed
therewith, and afford us <hi>Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which is ſo acid, that out of
it they make <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi> Hence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35103:41"/>
it is that going by Water, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
freſh water, is not good for
thoſe People who have Agues;
as for the Sea-water, ſo far is it
from being prejudicial to them,
that many loſe their Agues after
their going to Sea, becauſe the
Marine Air abounds with Saline
Particles, contrary to the acid
ones. There are notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſome Sea-ports which are
very ſubject to Agues, by reaſon
of the ſtanding Waters about
them, and the Vapours which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
from thence, mixed with
thoſe that ariſe out of the Earth,
infect the Neighbouring Air. So
there is no place more ſubject to
Agues than <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> where
almoſt all that arrive catch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues;
and no wonder: for the
place being very Moriſh by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the breaking down the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35103:41"/>
Harbour, and a very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
on the Eeaſt, which hinders
the Sun from ſhining upon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day be far ſpent. The
moſt certain and ready Remedy,
and that which is moſt practiſed
there, is to depart quickly from
thence, that they may breathe a
better Air. So likewiſe <hi>Smyrna;</hi>
which is ſeated at the bottom of
an Arm of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the unwholſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Marſhes, is ſubject to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
in the Autumn. And ſo
the Inhabitants of <hi>Lyons</hi> ſeldom
fail to catch Agues when they
go into the <hi>Dombe,</hi> which is a
Country full of Ponds and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Waters. From all this may
be drawn practical conſequences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which may be of good uſe: As
for Example, it may be good for
the ſick of Fevers or Agues to be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35103:42"/>
removed out of Ground-rooms,
and Apartments which ſtand
upon or adjoyn to Rivers, and
to cauſe thoſe who by an ill Air
have taken an Ague, to change
the Air.</p>
            <p>19. Whether the skin within
the ſhell of an Egg tyed to the end
of the Finger, or a live Tench ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the Back-bone, or to the
ſoal of the Feet, can cure an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue?</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Remedies of the
Country-people, which having
perhaps cured one of a hundred,
are ever after employed as if they
had ſome ſpecifick quality; yet
how often do we ſee their inuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?
If they have cured any,
'twas either by the force of the
imagination of the Sick, or by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35103:42"/>
the pain which their coldneſs and
binding them upon the heated
nervous parts, cauſed. The pain
cauſing an extraordinary agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bloud, even to that
degree, that we have ſeen a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
die here of the violent Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
cauſed by the application
of a live Tench to the ſoals of his
feet: the Tench becomes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
black, and then the People
ſtraight imagine that it is the
malignity of the Diſeaſe, which
paſſes out of the body of the
Sick into that of the Fiſh; though
it be no more than an effect of
the heat and moiſture which
corrupt the Fiſh. The Antients
(according to the report of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)</hi>
had ſome Febrifuges a great
deal more ridiculous and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,
which he himſelf laughs
at; as the paring of Nails, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35103:43"/>
they were to ſeek for before the
riſing of the Sun, and apply them
with Wax to another mans door,
and into this mans body the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
was to tranſmigrate. For
Quartains they took three drops
of Bloud out of the vein of an
Aſſes Ear, which they drank in
about a gallon of Water; the
Liver of a Cat kill'd in the wane
of the Moon, and ſalted and
drank with Wine before the Fit.
For all Intermitting Fevers they
took the Eye-tooth of a Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile
and filled it with Incenſe,
and tyed it to the right arm of
the Sick. <hi>Diaſcorides</hi> ſaith alſo,
that three Spiders pounded and
put in a linnen cloath, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the Forehead and the
Temples, cure the Tertian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:35103:43"/>
20. How do Veſicatories cure
Fevers, and particularly malignant
Fevers?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Holland</hi> they apply Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories
to the arms, thighs, and
legs, not onely in malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but alſo in ſimple Tertians.
The <hi>French,</hi> who are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate,
will ſcarcely ſuffer them to
be applied, unleſs it be in caſe of
a <hi>Delirium,</hi> Lethargy, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions.
'Tis true, the Remedy
is ſomewhat cruel, but yet it
produces great effects. And Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teaches us this way in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Fevers, in making depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of ſharp humours, where
the Gangrene takes hold, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
among the Muſcles of the <hi>Os
Sacrum,</hi> to which the heat of the
Bed (which heats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that part)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35103:44"/>
contributes much. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
this which at firſt ſeem'd a
thing of ill preſage, is the Cure
of the Sick, by the ſuppuration
and expulſion of the malignant
humours which Nature hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and that Art durſt not
have attempted. So it is by the
drawing out theſe ſharp Seroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that Veſicatories promote
the Cure of Fevers.</p>
            <p>21. Whether are Medecines
applied to the Wriſts (with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
to put away the Fever) Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuges?</p>
            <p>Theſe ſorts of Medicaments,
to which the People give ſo great
credit, are for the moſt part a
kind of Veſicatories, as being
compounded of Salt, Vinegar,
Gunpowder, Nettles, Soot, the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35103:44"/>
Root of <hi>Ranunculus,</hi> or Crowfoot,
Garlick, and other ſuch-like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.
They are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more troubleſome than
Veſicatories, becauſe they are
applied to the Wriſts, which are
rather membranous and nervous,
than fleſhy. Some are made of
Drugs that have not this quality
to ulcerate the skin, yet may
communicate to the Bloud a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and precipitating quality;
as thoſe made of <hi>Camphire</hi> and
<hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> or of fixing in ſome
ſort the Bloud; or thoſe made of
Spiders Webs with Snails, or
Shepherds Purſe, which is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent
Plant. However, we
ſee no great ſucceſs of this kind of
Medicines, unleſs the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Patient be ſtrongly
moved by thoſe which apply
them, promiſing a quick and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35103:45"/>
Cure. And it may be
alſo that they have not recourſe
to theſe, but when they are
weary of other Medicines which
have half cured the Patient. The
Fever perhaps ceaſes two or three
days after the application of theſe
Medicines; which it would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
have done, had they
never applied them. Theſe
may indeed be of ſome uſe for
Children who refuſe to take any
internal Medicines, and whoſe
Bloud is more ſuſceptible of the
impreſſions of an external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>22. Whether Centaury or Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
be Febrifuges?</p>
            <p>Theſe Plants are extremely
bitter; yet one is willing to do
any thing to be rid of ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35103:45"/>
a Companion. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-People
uſe the Decoction of
them to drive away their Agues.
Many Authors make great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
of the leſs Centaury, to
which they have given the name
of Febrifuge. And <hi>Diaſcorides</hi>
doth very much commend Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in Tertians: ſo that we
need not doubt but that they
are good when methodically
and duely adminiſtred; yet does
it not ſeldom fail of producing
the effects expected from it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe it is unſeaſonably
given, or elſe given to People of
too delicate Conſtitutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it ſtirs up Heat and Thirſt.
Further, they have not all the
qualities of a true Febrifuge,
which ought to be at the ſame
time <hi>Diuretick, Diaphoretick;</hi> or
<hi>Sudorifick,</hi> to drive out the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35103:46"/>
               <hi>Balſomick,</hi> to repair loſt
Strength; Styptick or Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
to fortifie the Fibres of the
parts; ſometimes <hi>Narcotick,</hi> to
calm the too great Agitations of
the Bloud; and alſo a true <hi>Alkaly,</hi>
to dull and break the points of
the Acids. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives
the Root of <hi>Pentaphillam</hi> or
Cinquefoil, in Tertians: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
that Plant had greater Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in <hi>Greece</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> it
could not effect the Cure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be ſomewhat Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
He alſo adds, that if the
Fever ceaſe not, the Patient muſt
take the juice of <hi>Trefoil,</hi> with that
of <hi>Silphium,</hi> in equal parts of
Wine and Water mixed. 'Tis
pity that we have loſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that famous Plant called
<hi>Silphium</hi> or <hi>Laſerpitium,</hi> which
the Antients cried up for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35103:46"/>
againſt ſo many Diſeaſes.
<hi>Pliny</hi> writes a whole Chapter of
its Vertues. It grew in <hi>Lybia,</hi>
and the figure of it may be ſeen
yet upon a Medal of the <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi>
where it has ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to <hi>Apium</hi> or <hi>Seleri,</hi> as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophraſtus</hi>
and <hi>Diaſcorides</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in their Works of Plants.
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> would have the juice
of theſe Plants given in pure
Wine, in Quartains; from which it
may be obſerved that he did not
ſo much fear to give Wine in
Fevers, as do moſt part of the
Phyſicians of our times, though
they boaſt themſelves to be his
Diſciples. He alſo preſcribes in
this Fever Garlick pounded and
mixed with Honey, which ſhould
heat much more than Wine.
<hi>Diaſcorides</hi> and <hi>Serenus Sammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
add to it <hi>Punaiſes,</hi> to render
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35103:47"/>
the ragouſt more excellent. The
Medicaments which the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Febrifuges,
were generally compoſed of hot
Ingredients, as may be ſeen in
<hi>Galen, Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Trallian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. Why does the breaking out
of the Lips ſhew that the Fever is
paſt?</p>
            <p>Becauſe it is a ſigne that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Medicines have made a
conſiderable Effort to drive out
the ſharp and acid Ferment of
the Fever, which in paſſing has
made impreſſions upon theſe
parts, being delicate and ſpongy.
And for the ſame reaſon, the <hi>Itch</hi>
breaking out in a Quartain,
makes it ceaſe; and ſtriking in
again, makes it return. This
ought not to hinder from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35103:47"/>
the Patient after the Fever,
to evacuate the Relicks which
neither Sweat nor ſimple Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
were able to carry off,
and which might cauſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe.</p>
            <p>24. Whence come Loathings
and bitterneſs of the Mouth after
Fevers?</p>
            <p>Loathings proceed from the
diſorders of the Stomach, which
has not of a long time rightly
done its office; or from the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Stomach, which the
heat of the Fever, and frequent
drinking, have diſſipated and
waſhed away. Bitterneſs of the
Mouth is cauſed by the fumes
which the boiling of the bloud in
the Veins, and of the Chyle in
the Stomach, has left, and which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35103:48"/>
have inſinuated themſelves into
the Tongue, being a very ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
part; for no body but
knows that Smoak and Soot are
bitter. So that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of attributing this bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Choler, which is often
unjuſtly accuſed.</p>
            <p>25. Why do Milk-meats, raw
Fruits, and new Wines, often cauſe
a Relapſe of Fevers?</p>
            <p>Milk-meats, new Wines, and
raw Fruits, abound much with
acid Particles, which in a weak
Stomach ſeparate themſelves,
and renew again the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of the Fever. So that it
was well ſaid of <hi>Pliny,</hi> That freſh
Grapes are naught for the ſick of
the Fever; yet it falls out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by accident that they cure
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35103:48"/>
a Fever, being eaten in a great
quantity at the time of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
becauſe they commonly
cauſe a <hi>Diarrhea,</hi> which carries
off all the ill humours, and the
Leven or Ferment of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The ſame things may be
ſaid of low Wines as of new
Wines, becauſe its Tartar or elſe
its Lye, being remixed with the
Wine, hath made it ſharp, and
by conſequence hath rendered it
proper to renew the Ferment:
And for the ſame cauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
ſhould, for some time after
he is cured, forbear Paſtry Meats,
ſalt Meats, and Ragouſts, or
compounded Diſhes, which are
commonly made up of ſharp, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and fiery parts. Theſe
raiſe a tumult in a weak Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
without being perfectly
digeſted; they fatigate the parts
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35103:49"/>
deſtined for the digeſtion, and
heat the maſs of Bloud: ſo that
'tis no wonder if we ſee many
Relapſes, becauſe there are a ſort
of Patients who will rather go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
their Phyſicians, than be
governed by them, and who
will deny nothing to their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.
Others there are who no
ſooner cured, but they ſtraight
conclude that they have no more
need of the Phyſician; and that
he preſcribes now onely for the
benefit of the Apothecary, to
make his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he longer: And
probably this may be the reaſon
why after the <hi>Engliſh Remedy</hi> ſo
few have been ſubject to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes;
for the great ſum they
paid for it, made thoſe that gave
it not to ſpare it. Indeed there
is no appearance that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
ſhould put the Patient out
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35103:49"/>
of all danger of a Relapſe, or that
it ſhould have power enough to
hinder a new Fermentation;
which an exceſs in eating or
drinking may cauſe in a Conva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent,
a fortnight or a month
after he has left taking it. But
Fevers that have continued long,
and much weakened the Organs,
are much more ſubject to return,
than when they are cured after a
few Fits.</p>
            <p>26. Whether there be any univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
ſpecifick Febrifuges which put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Fevers by an occult quality?</p>
            <p>Theſe occult qualities are a
very commodious ſubterfuge for
the ordinary ignorance of man,
who does not penetrate into the
eſſence of the Works of Nature:
And it cannot be denied but that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35103:50"/>
what is unknown unto us, may
juſtly be called occult; and that
there are ſome things in Nature
which it will be always more
eaſie, or if you will, more honeſt,
to admire than to explain.
However, we ought to have as
little recourſe as we can to this
Aſyle; and methinks according
to the Principles I have laid
down, it will not be ſo hard a
matter to give an account of all
thoſe pretended Specificks. I
have not ſpoken of <hi>Kinkina,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a famous Phyſician of <hi>Paris,</hi>
whom I do infinitely honour,
hath written a Book of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
putting his name to it; 'tis
the ſame Book which <hi>Monſieur de
Blegny</hi> thought to have been
written by one of <hi>Lyons,</hi> becauſe
it was firſt printed there.</p>
            <p>I ſay further, that there may
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35103:50"/>
be found every-where, in Plants
and Animals, whereof to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Febrifuges; and we cannot
imagine that Nature has been ſo
illiberal to our Climate, that it
ſhould not produce Aliments and
Medicines neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Life. We have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
a preoccupated opinion
in favour of Drugs which come
out of the <hi>Indies</hi> and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Countries, which makes
us put an eſteem upon them;
and on the contrary, ſlight and
deſpiſe thoſe that grow in our
own Gardens. If we have not
<hi>Rheuburb, Sena,</hi> and <hi>Caſſia,</hi> we
have inſtead thereof Peach-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and leaves, Roſes, Berbery,
and many other Purgatives,
which may be uſed with good
ſucceſs; provided that either one
Plant alone, or many Drugs
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35103:51"/>
mixed or united in a Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Chymiſtry, or a ſimple
Galenical Preparation, have all
the qualities which we have ſaid
to be neceſſary for a true Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge;
we need not doubt but
that they will have their effect,
without putting us to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of attributing it to an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
quality. But what is yet
conſiderable, and ſerves to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
our Hypotheſis of the cauſe
of Fevers, is, that all the Plants
and other Drugs which have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
gained a Reputation for
the Cure of Fevers, are ſo far
from having an Acidity which
might ſympathize with the acid
Ferment, that they have a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
an aſtriction, heat, volatile
ſalt, and Alkalies; the Enemies
of all Acids, and cure Fevers by
their manifeſt qualities: So that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35103:51"/>
one may with good hopes of
ſucceſs, taking ſuch Precautions,
and uſing ſuch Preparations as
are neceſſary, make uſe of the
Powder of Vipers, Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Pepper, Nutmegs, Sulphur,
Wormwood, bark of Aſh, roots
of Centrayerva, Mullein, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
wild Valerian, Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed,
Salt Armoniac, ſalt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
Salts of Centaury and Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
<hi>Panax</hi> or Clowns-all-heal,
Carduus Benedictus, Angelica,
Chamemile, Juniper, Sage, Rue,
St. Johns wort, Galengal, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,
Centaury, Germander,
Nettle, Aſarum, Celendine, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
Thea, Coffee, Opium, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
Saſſafras, Guyacum, nay
and Mercury it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine how one and
the ſame Medicament can cure
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35103:52"/>
all Fevers, they being diverſified
by a thouſand circumſtances;
yet I cannot deny but that there
may be found ſome, which either
naturally or by Art have almoſt
all the qualities of the true Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuge.
And as an ill Cook
with the beſt Ingredients, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a good diſh of Meat,
and on the contrary a good Cook
with a few Ingredients will make
a very good one; ſo a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
in Phyſick, and little
verſed in the work of Nature,
cannot ſucceed, unleſs by chance:
whereas he that a ſerious Study,
or at leaſt a frequent Experience
hath enabled, will cure his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
happily, and with a few
Medicines. In fine, I cannot but
perſwade my ſelf that all Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
may invent Febrifuges, and
adminiſter them ſeaſonably, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35103:52"/>
they underſtand well the
nature of the Fever in general,
and the ſtate of their Patient in
particular. The famous Sir <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore
de Mayerne</hi> Phyſician to
the King of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Talent lay in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi>
which he did admirably well;
he, I ſay, had Waters and other
lexipuretick Compoſitions, which
were made onely of Plants grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our Climate, as I find by
ſome Manuſcripts now in my
hands.</p>
            <p>Methinks for this effect, it
were expedient not to neglect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, and to try thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments
which may ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
provided they be not
ſuch as may endanger the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
The Liver of a Hare or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35103:53"/>
of a Cat, dried in an Oven, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and drank in Wine, may
to many ſeem ridiculous; and
yet theſe have been commended
by learned Writers; and there
may be ſome reaſon to believe
them to be Febrifuges, becauſe
theſe parts abound in <hi>alkalious</hi>
and volatile Salts, as doth the
bloud whereof they are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Authors are full of this
kind of Medicines, where in truth
a good Judgment is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
that the Phyſician be not
expoſed to the confuſion of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Patient become worſe
than when he firſt began with
him.</p>
            <p>For concluſion of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
we ought to rejoyce that
we live in an Age ſo fertile in new
Inventions, and under the Reign
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35103:53"/>
of ſo great a Monarch, who does
no leſs make the liberal Arts than
the Art of War to flouriſh; which
may rationably make us hope to
ſee the ſtudy of Phyſick arrive
every day at a higher point of
perfection, we on our parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
thereto (as 'tis but juſt
we ſhould) by our Reflections
and Experiments, whatſoever
may ſerve for its Ornament.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee how far the
Complaiſance I have for you, has
engaged me; I muſt confeſs, that
deſiring to inform you of thoſe
things you deſired, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
my ſelf, in examining a
matter which multiplied it ſelf
under my hands: And thinking
to write you onely a Letter, I
have almoſt made a juſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
which I may perhaps here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35103:54"/>
enlarge. However, I ought
to content my ſelf with theſe
Idea's, how unpolite ſoever they
are, ſince they have given me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of teſtifying unto you the
paſſion I have to be all my
