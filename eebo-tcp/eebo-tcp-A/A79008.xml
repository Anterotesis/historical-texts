            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>That I have juſt ground in charity to beleeve, that this <hi>Noble Earle</hi> was not only under the awe of Religion, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118934:22"/>
that he had the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>power of it</hi> in his heart. And therefore his death is the more to be lamented by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>greatneſse</hi> do ſo ſeldome <hi>center</hi> in one and the ſame perſon. In the <hi>God of heaven</hi> they both meet. He is <hi>optimus, maximus;</hi> infinite in <hi>goodneſs,</hi> as well as in <hi>greatneſſe.</hi> But in the <hi>Gods upon earth</hi> they rarely meet: They are many of them <hi>peſſimi maximi, greater</hi> in <hi>vices</hi> than in <hi>riches.</hi> It was a bold ſpeech of <hi>Buchanan</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> who ſent a meſſenger to him when he was dying to viſite him, and to know how he did; <hi>Buchanan</hi> deſired the meſſenger to tell the King, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note>That <hi>he was going to a place where few Kings come.</hi> Indeed the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi> But yet <hi>ſome</hi> are, though not <hi>many.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>greateſt,</hi> and the <hi>beſt</hi> man in the Eaſt. Such were <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Such was <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea.</hi> And ſuch a one was (I hope) <hi>Robert Earle of Warwick:</hi> And therefore the loſſe of him is the greater.

               </p>
               <p>Let me tell you, That we have loſt this day one of the <hi>beſt natur'd Noble-men</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; one who had not only a <hi>good nature,</hi> but (as I verily beleeve) <hi>gracious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and <hi>religious inclinations,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was religious,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In his own perſon:</hi> For he was very exact in <hi>cloſet duties.</hi> I have been often with him at private prayer in his cloſet in which he was very zealous and devout. And he hath left behinde him <hi>reall manifeſtations</hi> of his <hi>perſonal</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:118934:22"/>
                  <hi>piety,</hi> by many <hi>religious collections</hi> written with his own hand for the good of his ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reference to his deare and neare relations,</hi> both by giving them a <hi>good example,</hi> and <hi>good inſtructions.</hi> And my prayer to God is; that though the <hi>inſtructor</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, yet the <hi>inſtructions</hi> may live, and never die.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In his family-government.</hi> For he was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his <hi>morning and evening publick ſervice of God,</hi> and herein a rare patterne to the <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Country:</hi> He would not ſuffer any <hi>ſports or paſtimes</hi> to divert him from his <hi>dayly publique devotions.</hi> It is a great <hi>honour to God,</hi> and <hi>credit</hi> to <hi>Religion</hi> when there is a <hi>forme and outſide</hi> (though but a forme and outſide) of <hi>godlineſs</hi> in great families. This is like a candle ſet upon a hill to illighten all inferlour families. It is reported of <hi>Theodoſius the Emperour,</hi> that by his <hi>religious carriage in his family, he made all his Court a nurſery of religion.</hi> And it is ſaid of the houſe of <hi>George Prince of Anhalt,</hi> that for the good <note place="margin">Eccleſia, Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Curia.</note>orders therein obſerved it was a <hi>Church,</hi> an <hi>Academy,</hi> and a <hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In his <hi>conſcientious obſervation of the Lords day,</hi> and in cauſing the Sermons preached to be repeated in his preſence to the whole family. In his frequent attendance when he was at <hi>London</hi> upon <hi>weekly Lectures,</hi> and by his example and encouragement, drawing many <hi>perſons of quality</hi> to our congregations. And (which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable) in the <hi>Moneth</hi> in which he died, he went con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the <hi>Morning-exerciſe</hi> at St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the fields, thereby (as by a ſecret inſtinct) <hi>fitting and preparing</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for his death, which hapned towards the end of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In his <hi>extraordinary care and diligence in preparing himſelfe for the receiving of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> Herein he was very exact in ſetting apart
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118934:23"/>
a ſufficient ſpace of time for <hi>ſelfe-examination.</hi> And beſides this, give me leave (without offence) to relate a paſſage which in my opinion conduceth much to his <hi>honour,</hi> and may through <hi>Gods bleſſing</hi> become an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his relations, and to the <hi>Noble-men</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the Nation. When he firſt came to the <hi>Sacrament at Aldermanbury,</hi> he freely preſented himſelfe to the <hi>Miniſter and Elders</hi> to be <hi>examined:</hi> and although he gave ample ſatisfaction, yet being at that time indiſpoſed in body by reaſon of a ſudden diſtemper, he afterwards wrote me a letter in which he ſignified, that if we were not ſatisfied, he would rather come againe, than come without giving <hi>full ſatisfaction;</hi> here was <hi>humility</hi> in a high degree; here is a <hi>patterne</hi> to be admired, and imitated.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In his <hi>faithfulneſs to the truſt committed to him</hi> as in other things, ſo more eſpecially <hi>in diſpoſing of his Church-livings.</hi> Herein he was very eminent, and very exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being alwayes exactly careful to preferre <hi>able, godly, and painful Miniſters to them.</hi> And I doubt not, but there are <hi>thouſands</hi> bleſſing God in heaven for the good they have got by the <hi>Miniſters</hi> put in by this <hi>Noble Earle.</hi> The truth is, he was a great <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas</hi> to the <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>religious Miniſtry.</hi> We <hi>Miniſters</hi> may ſay of him as they did of the <hi>Centurion, he loved our Nation;</hi> we have great cauſe to weep over his herſe, and to bemoane his death: <hi>For we have this day loſt one of the greateſt friends that the godly and painful Miniſters had in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. I might adde (if need were) as a further, and a moſt <hi>ſignal teſtimony</hi> of his godlineſſe, his ſingular care, that not only while he was living, but that after his death alſo his Church-livings might be rightly diſpoſed, but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There are three things yet behind which I muſt not omit.</p>

1. He was <hi>bountiful and Prince-like</hi> in his hoſpitality and houſe-keeping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was very <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> to the poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I have often and often been his <hi>Almoner</hi> to diſtribute conſiderable ſummes of money to neceſſitous and pious Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was a <hi>liberal</hi> and moſt <hi>loving Maſter</hi> to his <hi>houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſervants,</hi> and hath given competent penſions to all his old ſervants during life.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In a word: He was one who did not make <hi>uſe of religion</hi> for his <hi>own private gaine</hi> and <hi>intereſt;</hi> he had no <hi>politick deſigne</hi> in profeſſing godlineſſe: his whole aime both by <hi>ſea</hi> and <hi>land,</hi> both in <hi>Parliament</hi> and in <hi>private</hi> was, to be ſerviceable to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular he was a <hi>true Nathaneel in whom there was no guile:</hi> he was a <hi>countenancer of religion</hi> in the <hi>worſt times,:</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>for God</hi> and for his <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>ſervants,</hi> when it was both <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>diſgraceful</hi> in the eyes of the leading men of the Nation; he received Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> (that <hi>eminent Miniſter of Chriſt)</hi> into his <hi>family,</hi> and <hi>protected</hi> him for a long while, till at laſt he was forced to fly out of the land. He was a very ſpecial friend unto that man of God of famous memory Dr. <hi>Sibbs.</hi> To ſumme up all in a few lines, As it is ſaid of <hi>Socrates</hi> (as I remember) that he was ſo good a man <hi>that all that knew him loved him; and if any man did not love him, it was becauſe they did not know him.</hi> So it may be ſaid of the <hi>Earle of Warwick:</hi> All <hi>who knew him loved him, and if any man did not love him, it was becauſe he did not know him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the manner of his death, it was ſomewhat <hi>ſudden:</hi> but you muſt know, that a <hi>child of God never dies ſuddenly, though he die never ſo ſuddenly;</hi> though he may dye <hi>ſuddenly</hi> in regard of <hi>time,</hi> yet he never dyes <hi>ſuddenly</hi> in regard of <hi>preparation.</hi> A wicked man <hi>dies ſuddenly</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:118934:26"/>
though he dyes never ſo <hi>lingringly,</hi> becauſe he dyes <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly;</hi> but he that dyes with <hi>grace in his heart,</hi> cannot be ſaid to <hi>die ſuddenly</hi> though he <hi>die never ſo ſuddenly.</hi> And yet this ſad ſtroak of death was not altogether unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For when the funeral of his <hi>Grand-child</hi> was delayed longer than he deſired or expected, he was heard to ſay, <hi>That if they tarried a little longer, they ſhould carry him down alſo to he buried with him.</hi> My hope is, That he dyed as theſe Noble Patriarkes in the text, <hi>he died in the faith in which he lived.</hi> He dyed profeſſing the <hi>true doctrine of faith,</hi> and (I hope) having his <hi>heart adorned with the grace of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let me aſſure you; that as he <hi>lived much deſired,</hi> ſo he now dyeth <hi>much lamented,</hi> eſpecially by men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing godlineſſe. I have heard a memorable ſtory of an ancient and religious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Knightly</hi> of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonſhire</hi> (well known to ſome here) who coming to <hi>Leeze,</hi> and beholding the brave <hi>Parkes,</hi> and <hi>goodly gardens,</hi> and other <hi>ſuch-like accommodations</hi> there to be enjoyed, was heard to ſay to this our <hi>Earle,</hi> My Lord, <hi>you had need be very good,</hi> it is <hi>ill going to hell from ſuch a Paradiſe:</hi> it will be a <hi>doleful and diſmal exchange.</hi> Or as others relate it; My Lord, <hi>you had need make ſure of heaven, or elſe when you dye you will be a great loſer.</hi> A rare ſpeech worthy to be laid to heart by all Noble perſons. Now I verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe, that this our dear and honourable Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an brother is no <hi>loſer,</hi> but a great <hi>gainer</hi> by his death. He is gone (I hope) from <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>heaven,</hi> from an <hi>earthly Paradiſe</hi> to a <hi>heavenly Pallace,</hi> from a <hi>houſe made with hands</hi> to a <hi>houſe made without hands eternal in the heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true (and it muſt be confeſſed leaſt I ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a flatterer) he had <hi>his failings,</hi> and his <hi>many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;</hi> which I truſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath covered with the roabe of his righteouſneſſe.</hi> My prayer to God is, That
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118934:26"/>
all <hi>his infirmities</hi> may be buried in the grave of oblivion, and that all <hi>his virtues</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> may <hi>ſupervive,</hi> and live in his <hi>ſon and heire;</hi> that as he <hi>inherits the eſtate, ſo he may alſo inherit the vertues of his Father.</hi> And that <hi>religion, piety,</hi> and <hi>godlineſſe</hi> may be entailed upon the <hi>Noble family</hi> of the <hi>Riches,</hi> from one generation to another till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto judgement; That while they live they may be <hi>profeſſors of the true faith,</hi> and indued with the <hi>heart-purifying grace of faith:</hi> And when they come <hi>to dye,</hi> they may make that <hi>gallant, noble, and bleſsed cloſure and concluſion of their dayes which theſe godly Patriarkes in my text did,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe all dyed in faith.</hi>
