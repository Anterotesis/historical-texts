            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Publisher's PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THERE being many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises already Publish'd upon the Subjects handled in this ensuing Discourse, you may think it needless to trouble the World with more of this kind; but those who think so, may be of another Opinion when they have considered, not only the Design of this Treatise, which is to Abridge into a small Manual what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have writ in many Volumes; but also the manner of handling the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters herein treated of, which you will find to differ very much from most of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55608:3"/>
               <hi>the Books written before upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: some Writers having screwed up the King's Prerogative to so extravagant a height, as to place the whole Essential Frame of the Government in the King's Sole Will and Pleasure, not considering the Fundamental Rights and Liberties of a Free-born Nation, more than as the forced Concessions of some Weak Princes, not otherwise able to appease an Angry People; and which they may therefore contract, or wholy abrogate, as their Power or Opportunities may either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, or permit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whilst on the other side, there are some who have too much debased the Royal Prenogative, by placing all Power immediately in the People, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the King accountable to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives for every small Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in Government. There is without doubt an Error in both these Extremes; since as the King can have no Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative which is inconsistent with the Ancient Rights and Liberties of the Subject, set down in</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>and other Ancient Statutes, which were</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55608:3"/>
               <hi>only declarative of the Common Law of</hi> England; <hi>So likewise, if the King be the Supreme Magistrate of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he cannot without a Soloecism in Government, be rendred accountable to any Power superior to his own; these things considered, hath induced the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to chuse a middle, and more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Course, by preserving to the King all such Prerogatives as are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the Supreme Executive Power, and which are necessary for the Common Safety; yet, without leaving the King absolutely irresistible in all Cases whatsoever, and without a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed impossibility of his falling from his Royal Dignity, in case of the highest Breaches of his Coronation Oath, and the utmost Violations of that</hi> Usual and Ancient Contract, <hi>which his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors have so often renewed with the People of this Nation, upon their Succession to the Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the proving of which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath made use of the best Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities he could collect either from our ancient Histories, Records, or Law-Books,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55608:4"/>
               <hi>beginning with the Grounds and Institution of Civil Government in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and ending with that of</hi> England <hi>in particular. And though he hath so far adapted this Discourse for men of ordinary Learning and Capacities, as not to stuff the Margin with many Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; yet he hath not fail'd to put them down, where-ever the Niceness or Uncommonness of the Subject might otherwise chance to shock the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of Readers not thoroughly vers'd in things of this Nature: Not but that the Author is very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that even where no Authorities are expresly cited, he is able to maintain what he there lays down by Arguments drawn from Law, as well as Reason, if any man shall think it worth while to call it in question; but if he requires larger and fuller Proofs on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he may, if he pleases, first consult the last Eight Dialogues of a late Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, called,</hi> Bibliotheca Politica; <hi>as also Mr.</hi> Atwood'<hi>s Learned Treatise</hi> concerning the Antiquity and Justice of an Oath of Abjuration. <hi>And I</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55608:4"/>
               <hi>hope he may thence receive sufficient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that the Principles here laid down, are founded not only upon right Reason, but the ancient Constitution of the</hi> English <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may suffice for the manner of handling this Argument. But now to say somewhat more of the ends of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Discourse, and they are these: First, to make every man (though of never so common a Capacity) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand (as well as the Author is able to perform it) what is the true, ancient, and legal Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 2dly, What are the main and most considerable Prerogatives of the Crown. And lastly, What are the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Rights and Liberties of the People. And that these are so far from being contradictory or inconsistent, that they rather serve to defend and strengthen each other; so that it hath been for the defence and preservation of all these, that this wonderful and happy Revolution hath been brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and Their Present Majesties pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the Throne; as also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb facs="tcp:55608:5"/>
those who traduce by the Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names of <hi>Whigs,</hi> and <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men,</hi> those that have been in the worst of times the only true Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this ancient limited Monarchy; so that if they plead for Resistance in some Cases, it is only in those of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and absolute necessity, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to preserve the Original Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to prevent the Head of the Legislative Power from devouring the Body: nor can they have any other Notions of Loyalty, but their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Government establisht, and exercised according to Law, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sense, as well as Etymology of that word imports.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Whosoever shall think fit to bestow a little money to buy, and time to peruse this small Treatise, the Publisher hopes he will find the design to be truly <hi>English,</hi> that is, sincere and honest, that all good Subjects may know <hi>how to render to</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars, <hi>and to God the things that are Gods,</hi> without blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrificing (under the will-worship
<pb facs="tcp:55608:5"/>
of a pretended Loyalty) the Religion, Civil Liberties and Properties of their Country to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Will, as some of late Years have done, who made these the darling (because most gainful) Doctrines as well of the Pulpit, as the Bar and the Press.</p>

               <p>GOOD Morrow Neighbour; What brings you hither so early? If you want a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I'll call my Clerk, and then hear your Business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>No, I assure your Worship, the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I come about is of greater concern, and that no less than the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subject, as well as the Power and Prerogative of our Kings; which though I heard you. Treat of in your late Charge to the Grand Jury last Quarter-Sessions, yet since I could not come near enough to hear it distinctly, not being of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55608:7"/>
that Jury my self, pray give me the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that Discourse; and I the rather desire it, because I have since heard it much censured by some of our Neighbours as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of Commonwealth Principles: But to save you the labour of a needless repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will ask you those Questions which I desire most to be satisfied in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Pray use your discretion, and begin when you please; I will do my endeavour to satisfie you as well as I can, though without putting my self to the trouble of quoting many Authors, which perhaps you never heard of; and therefore pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that whatever I shall tell you, I have not only Reason, but Authorities also for what I then said.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I have no cause to doubt what you say; therefore, pray Sir, in the first place tell me, what you then said about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural state of Mankind as to Civil Liberty: Pray Sir, what think you, Were men at first Born Subjects, or did they become so by some Human means?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>As to this, <hi>Adam</hi> (for example) being the First man, could not, as a Husband to <hi>Eve,</hi> or as a a Father to <hi>Cain, Abel,</hi> and the rest of his Children, be an Absolute Lord or Monarch over them: His Power, as that of all other Fathers of Families, not being a Civil Power, but that of a Husband, or Father, only for the direction of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55608:7"/>
Wife in all things relating to the affairs of the Family; and over his Children in order to their good Education in the Fear of God, and for their Maintenance whilst they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Members of it; so that Subjection to Government could never begin from mens being born Servants, or Subjects, as some will have it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Pray then tell me, Sir, what is Civil Government?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I think Civil Government is God's Ordinance, which he has ordained for the Good and Happiness of Mankind, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve men from the Violence both of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and Domestick Enemies, since the nature of man depraved by the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is too apt otherwise to fall into all manner of mischiefs and enormities, as well towards himself as others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>How then did it begin? Was it by any Divine Precept, or else by the Consent of many men who had found the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of living without it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Before the Flood there is no mention in Scripture of any sort of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any Precept left for it; the first that seems to prescribe it, being after the Flood, when God gave <hi>Noab</hi> that positive Precept, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>That whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed;</hi> whence Divines argue a necessity of Magistrates for putting this Law in execution; but who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55608:8"/>
were to appoint them, the Scripture is wholly silent; and though indeed there is mention made of Kings in <hi>Genesis</hi> very early in the world, yet is it not there told us how those Kings were made; therefore it is most reasonable to suppose, that they either at first began by the tacit Consent or Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Masters of Families, and other Freemen of the same Lineage, or Nation; or else by Conquest of other Nations by force of Arms.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, is there not an account given us in Scripture of Judges and Kings made by God's own Appointment among the <hi>Iews?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; but that concerned no other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but them; who are the only People, that I know of, that had a Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as Divine Law, from God's own Appointment.</p>

               <p>But, Sir, did not God's thus giving the <hi>Iews</hi> Kings, or Persons at least endued with Kingly Power, (though not under that Title) render Monarchy to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, so as that all other Nations are thereby obliged to have no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>No sure, not at all; for till the time of <hi>Saul</hi> they had no visible King over them; God himself was their King, and those that Governed under him could do nothing of moment without his express Command;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55608:8"/>
and where that did not interpose, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was by <hi>Moses</hi> and a Senate of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders, and also by the Heads or Princes of the several Tribes as Subordinate to them; and after his Decease, by <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the other Judges whom God raised up; who if they had been Kings in Power, but not in Title, it would have been in vain for the <hi>Israelites</hi> to have desired a King to be like other Nations; and you see when they desired such a King, God was angry with them, as if they had rejected himself; so that there is no other consequence to be drawn from all these Examples, but that Kingly Government is the most Antient, and may also be the best, if kept within due limits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Pray whence then do Kings now-a-days derive their Power, (since God hath long since left off making any Kings by Divine Precept)? Whether is it from God, or from the People?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I told you before, that all Power is from God, and consequently Kingly Power must be so too; yet this is so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that this Power cannot Rightfully be acquired without the People's Consent; I mean all those who being Master's of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Free-men at their own dispose, had at first a Power of setting up what sort of Government they pleased; and hence it is that we find so many sorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55608:9"/>
in the world; as for example, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which is either Absolute, as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Turkey;</hi> or Limited, as in <hi>England,</hi> and as it was not long since in all the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Kingdoms of <hi>Europe;</hi> or else Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, that is, the Government of the best sort, or Nobility; or else Democracy, where the Common People Govern alone, or else have the predominant Power. But all these, as they derive their Power from God, are alike ordained by him; though in respect also of men, who first found out and instituted these several Governments, they are also called by St. <hi>Peter, the ordinance of men,</hi> or <hi>a human creature,</hi> as the Original words it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But do we not also find in Scripture, that most of the great Kingdoms or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of the world have began from Conquest? Does not therefore Conquest of a Nation by Arms give the Conqueror a Power from God to Rule over that People without their Consents?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I will not dispute what Authority the <hi>Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchies might have over those Nations they conquered, by a particular Donation from God, who had long before foretold those Monarchies by <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the other Prophets; and as for the first of these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, the <hi>Iews</hi> are particularly Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> to serve the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55608:9"/>
King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> the like is foretold by <hi>Isaiah</hi> of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> yet for all this, I think no other Conquerors can pretend to the like Right over any Nation at this day; since all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is either by a just, or an unjust War; that the latter can give no right at all to the Conqueror, all Writers agree; and that even the former can give no right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Peoples consent, either tacit or exprest, seems also as certain, since in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them who are not capable Judges of the right or wrong of the Quarrel, it can lay no obligation of Obedience, farther than they please by some act of their own to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Conqueror for their Lawful Prince; which being once done voluntarily, is all one in respect of themselves, as if it were by their Election, or that of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Representatives: Nor could the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror (mighty <hi>Nimrod,</hi> for example) ever conquer the neighbouring Nations by the sole assistance of his own Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, without the conjunction of other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families, and Freemen, who 'tis most likely followed him for a share of the Spoil, and upon certain Conditions agreed upon between them; for the like we find of all other Conquerors in Ancient as well as Modern Histories.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But pray shew me, Sir, how this can be, since most Nations have been conquer'd at some time or other; but few of them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55608:10"/>
have given their Consents (as I know of) either in a whole Assembly of all that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or else by their lawful Representatives, as we do in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, they have not given their Consents all at once, but singly, and one by one, they have done, and constantly do it every day in Towns and Countries that pass from one King to another by Conquest; for it is certain that all such Subjects as do not like the Religion or Government of the Conquering Prince or Commonwealth, may lawfully retire out of the conquer'd City or Countrey, and carry their Estates with them, or else sell their Lands, and carry away the Money if they can, without any crime; so that it is apparent it is only from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment or Recognition of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Person who stays there, that this Conqueror comes to have any Right to the Subjects Allegiance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Pray how is this Consent or Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment given, since Oaths of Allegiance (as I am inform'd) are not exacted in all places of the world where Conquests are made?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it; but where they are not so imposed nor taken, the persons that have not sworn to this new Government, can never be oblig'd to an Active Obedience, or to fight for, or serve the Conquering Prince, against perhaps their former lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55608:10"/>
yet I think thus much I may justly maintain, That whatever Prince, be he a Conqueror, or Usurper (who is much the same thing in respect of the Subjects) who shall take upon him to administer the Civil Government, by protecting the conquer'd people, punishing Malefactors, and doing equal Justice by himself or his Judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man; whosoever of this conquer'd people will continue in that City or Countrey, and receive his Protection, and enjoy all the other Rights of other Subjects, is so far obliged by virtue of that Protection he receives, as to yield a Passive Submission to all the Laws that such a Conqueror shall make, and not to conspire against, or disturb his Government by Plots or Rebellions. But indeed this tacit Consent or Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Conqueror's Authority, because not given by the People at once, makes many men believe that their Consent is not at all necessary to make a Conqueror's Power ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory as to them; not but that I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Oaths of Allegiance are of great use in any Kingdom or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to bind men to a stricter Observance of their Duty, and also to an Active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all their Conqueror's lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, even to venturing their Lives for the Government, since it is for the Publick Good of the Community, if they are so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I am well enough satisfied as to the Original of Government, and the Right that all Kings and Commonwealths have to their Subjects Allegiance, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at first by the express Consent or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the People, or else by Conquest and their subsequent Consents; but pray sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy me in the next place concerning the Government of <hi>England;</hi> you said it was a Limited Monarchy, and I have never heard that questioned; but how did this Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begin? whether from the very first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Government, or else by the gracious Concessions of our Kings?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt, Neighbour, from the very Institution of the Government; for our first <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings were made so by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the People, in their great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, or Parliaments (as we now call them) and could do nothing considerable either as to Peace or War without its Consent; and this Council was to meet of course once a year, without any Summons from the King, and oftner by his Summons, if there was any occasion for it; and it is certain that the Freemen of <hi>England</hi> have always from beyond all times of memory enjoyed the same Fundamental Rights and Privileges (I mean in substance) that they do at this day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, what are those Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Rights and Privileges that you say we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55608:11"/>
have so long enjoy'd; tell me what they are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I will in as few words as I can: First then, The Freemen of <hi>England</hi> were never bound to observe any Laws, either in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Civil or Religious, but what were made by the King, with the Consent of the Great Council, consisting of the Clergy, Nobility, and Commons, assembled in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That no Taxes could be lawfully imposed upon the Nation, or any man's Property taken away without the Consent of this Council. 3. That this Great Council had ever a power of hearing and redressing all Grievances and Complaints of the Subjects, not only against the <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Mirror of Iustice,</hi> Cap. 1. Sect. 2.</note> Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of any of the King's great Officers or Ministers, <q>who were too great to be called to an account in any other Court; but also the particular Wrongs of the King himself, the Queen, or their Children.</q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Pray how could this be done, since the King may at this day dissolve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whenever he pleases?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it is so now; but certainly it was otherwise when Parliaments met of course at a certain place once a year without any summons from the King; yet after that time, I find it in the Ancient Treatise, called
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55608:12"/>
                  <hi>The Manner of holding Parliaments:</hi>

                  <q>That the Parliament ought not to be dissolved whilst any Petition or Bill dependeth undiscussed, or at least whereto no determinate Answer is given; and that if he do, or permit the contrary, <hi>perjurus est,</hi>
                  </q> i. e. he is perjur'd: And even at this day the Two Houses may justly refuse the King any supply of Money, whilst he refuse to redress their just Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>This is more than I ever heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but pray proceed to tell me, what are the rest of the Liberties and Priviledges of an <hi>Englishman?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>In short, they are these; Not to be banisht the Realm, or imprisoned, without just cause; nor to be kept there only as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but in order to a legal Trial; not to be tried, condemned, or executed, without a lawful Jury of his Peers first passed upon him, (unless in time of War, by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial-Law); lastly, no man is oblig'd to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Soldiers without his own consent, and then paying for what they have. There are other less Rights and Priviledges, exprest in the Petition of Right, acknowledged and confirmed in Parliament by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. all which I omit; but these being the chiefest that concern our Lives, Liberties and Estates, were only insisted upon in my said Charge.</p>

               <p>But pray, Sir, tell me, as to the King, Is he not the sole Supream Power in <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>No certainly; for then he could make Laws, and raise Money without the Peoples Consent; but every printed Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will shew you where the Supream Power resides, wherein it is expresly recited in these words, <hi>Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons of this Realm, and the Authority of the same;</hi> or as I can shew you in several Statutes of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the <hi>VIIIth.</hi> wherein it is recited thus, <hi>Be it enacted by the Assent and Consent of our Sovereign Lord the King, and the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the same;</hi> whereby you may see, that not only the words <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> but the word <hi>Authority</hi> is referred, as well to all the Three Estates, as to the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>This, I confess, is plain enough, but what are the King's chief Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55608:13"/>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you in as few words as I can; his Majesty's chief Prerogatives (for to enumerate them all would be endless) are these, First, to call Parliaments once a year, or oftner, and Dissolve them if he pleases; to give the last hand, or sanction to all Laws for raising of Taxes, and for the enacting all other things that his Majesty, joining with the Two Houses of Parliament, shall think fit to be Enacted; to appoint Judges to Try, Condemn, and Execute Traytors, and all other Malefactors for Treason and other Crimes; and to grant Pardons for those Crimes, if his Majesty shall think fit (yet still according to his Coronation Oath); to grant Commissions to all other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Officers, both Civil and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no Arms being regularly to be Rais'd but by his Authority; also by the Advice of his Privy-Council, to issue Proclamations according to Law, and for the Publick Good for enforcing the observation of such Laws, as shall be thought fit, in case those that are entrusted with the execution of them prove too remiss: Lastly, to make War and Peace, though the latter, as well as the former of these, were anciently very seldom made without the Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Parliament. These are the chief Prerogatives which I mentioned in my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55608:13"/>
Charge, tho' I grant there are divers others, tho' less material.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, cannot the King by his Prerogative do some things against the Laws, and Dispence with them in all cases which he himself may judge for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good of the Kingdom?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>The King had anciently no Power to Dispence with Statutes, with <hi>non Obstantes;</hi> and so it is solemnly declared in the Kings Bench in the 39th. of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> the year-book, Ter. Pasch.</note> by all the Justices as a Rule in Law, well known at that time, and I could tell you (were it not too tedious) how this Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Dispensations first began; but even then the King could not Dispence with any thing that was morally Evil in it self, or with what was Enacted by Authority of Parliament for the common Good and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole People, or Nation in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: And this is the true reason why the Late King <hi>Iames</hi> could not Dispence with all Statutes concerning the taking away the Test, because the whole Nation had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in them; nor could he Dispence with any Act which conferred a particular. Right
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55608:14"/>
or Priviledge on a third Person; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he could not commonly Dispence with any Statute wherein there was a particular provision to prevent the King from Granting Charters with Clauses of <hi>Non-obstantes;</hi> But now all Dispensations with such Statutes, are taken away by a particular Clause in the late Act of the Rights and Liberties of the Subject <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Will. <hi>&amp;</hi> Mar.</note> which you may see if you please; and which I take to be no more than a Solemn Declaration of what was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law of <hi>England,</hi> before <hi>non obstantes</hi> came up.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I am very well satisfied in this; but, pray Sir, tell me the reason, Why the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as the Supreme Executive Power of the Kingdom, exercise his Royal Prerogative, though it were to the prejudice of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I can give you a very good reason for this, because this would be contrary to that Trust which was at first reposed in the King by the Representative Body of the Nation when this Limited Monarchy was first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and which that ancient Treatise, called the <hi>Mirror of Iustices,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1. Sect. 2.</note> writ above
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55608:14"/>
Four hundred years since, very well sets forth the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> as it stood before the Conquest, as also the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Government of this Kingdom by one Person, or Monarch; which he thus recites, <q>That when Forty Princes (that is, Aldermen, or Earls of Counties) did Elect one King <hi>(viz. Egbert)</hi> to Reign over them, to Maintain and Defend their Persons and Goods in Peace by Rules of Right; they made him at first to Swear, That he would maintain with all his Power, the true Christian Faith, and would Govern his People by Right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect of Persons; and would also be Obedient to suffer Right <hi>(i. e.</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) as well as others of his People.</q> By which it appears, That all the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Crown are trusted in the King by Law, for the Good and Preservation of his People, and not for the exercise of an Arbitrary Will, or Power contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As also Sir <hi>Iohn Fortescue,</hi> once Lord Chancellor to King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIth. in his Treatise in Praise of our <hi>English</hi> Laws, has thus handsomely set forth, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That the King was Made, or Elected, for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the Law, the Bodies and Goods of his Subjects; and he hath this Power derived from the People; so that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long Govern them by any other</q>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55608:15"/>
Power; and he also gives us the reason why he cannot regularly Dispence with Acts of Parliament; <q>Because, says he, they are made by the general Consent of the King, and the whole Realm; and if there be any thing in them that proves inconvenient, the King may quickly, or in a short time, call another Parliament to amend it;</q> but not without that, as it certainly would if the King had an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Unlimited Power of Dispensing with all Laws. So that you see the King is entrusted with his Prerogative by Law (that is, by the Consent of the People only for their Benefit and Preservation); there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Judges, or any other inferior Officer act contrary thereunto, though by the King's express Letters, or Messages, they are Forsworn, and may be punished for it; and in this sence it is, that the King, whilst acting thus by his subordinate Officers or Ministers, is said to do no wrong, because they are liable to be questioned for it; and if he acts otherwise by his own personal Power, or Commands, it is not as King of <hi>England,</hi> but as a private Person; so that if we will consider our own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we <hi>Englishmen</hi> are blest with such noble Priviledges and Liberties, that I think there is no Nation in the world where all degrees and ranks of men may live more happily
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55608:15"/>
than we do: And as for the King, though it is true he hath not an Absolute Unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Power of doing whatever he will, yet he hath sufficient to Protect his Subjects, and bountifully to Reward those that serve him faithfully; and whenever he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes any Foreign War with the general Consent and Assistance of his People in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, he most commonly proves a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to those who dare oppose him.</p>

               <p>I am very sensible of this Happiness we enjoy; and therefore when I think how miserably the poor Country-men live in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries, we of the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry have all the reason in the world to venture our lives in the defence of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Constitution; since if ever we should be reduced to an Arbitrary Government, either by a standing Army at home, or a Conquest from abroad, we can expect no better than Wooden-Shoes and Canvass-Breeches, and to drink nothing but Water with the miserable <hi>French</hi> Peasants; and, I doubt, if things should once come to that pass, you Country-Gentlemen would be but in little better condition.</p>

pretty long upon that Head; yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts you were a little too short in tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us only that King <hi>Iames</hi> (who was once our Lawful King) could cease to be so; for you seem to rest contented with the bare words of the Convention's late Vote, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That King <hi>Iames</hi> having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to subvert the Constitution of the Kingdom, by breaking the original Contract between the King and the People, and that having violated the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, by withdrawing himself out of the Kingdom, he had Abdicated the Government, and that the Throne was thereby become Vacant.</q> So that tho you speak pretty largely of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Raising of Money without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Parliament, and of exercising his Dispensing Power; yet methoughts you seem chiefly to place this Vacancy of the Throne upon King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Abdication, or Desertion of it; which, let me tell you, as plain a Country Fellow as I am, will not down with me; for I can never believe the King would have deserted the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he thought he could have staid here with safety; therefore, pray tell me your meaning of these hard words, <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Kingdom, Original Contract,</hi> and <hi>Abdication of the Throne.</hi>

               <p>I was not willing to insist too long in the face of the Country upon these nice Points, which were not proper to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before an Assembly of ordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; but since you have always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me to be above the ordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of those of your Rank, I will tell you what I conceive was the true Sense of the Convention in every one of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: first for the Constitution of the Kingdom, which King <hi>Iames</hi> went about to violate, I take that to be the Government by King, Lords and Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he endeavour'd to violate, by his taking away of Charters from Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and doing his utmost to impose a Parliament upon the Nation, of such men as would not only take off the Penal Laws from Papists, and all other Dissenters, but who would also have confirmed to the King that Arbitrary Power of dispensing with what Laws he pleased; which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have render'd Parliaments wholely use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and was as good as putting the whole Legislative Power into the sole Person of the King.</p>

               <p>But the Original Contract puzzles us yet more than all the rest, and I heard <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Slave-all,</hi> at a neighbouring Gentleman's
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55608:17"/>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Pray tell that witty <hi>Parson</hi> next time you meet him, that if he pleases to look over our Histories and Law-Books, that in the very same Leaf where the Divine He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Right of Succession to the Crown in a Right Line is established as an unalterable and fundamental Law, in the very next Clause he may find this Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. But not to banter you, I will tell you my sense of this expression, which, in my opinion, signifies no more than that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or Bargain which was first entred into between King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Ancestors or Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, (and under whose Title he enjoy'd the Crown) whereby they bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by a solemn Oath, when they took the Crown upon them, at their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to keep and maintain the Laws of the Realm, and to govern the People according to these Rules of Justice and Mercy, that is in short, acting according to Law. Which Oath, or the substance of it, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly renewed every fresh Succession to the Crown, as soon as the King was capable of taking it, sufficiently declares, that as the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55608:17"/>
King upon observing this Compact, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning according to Law, had a Right to his Subjects Allegiance; so if he refused to act according to it, but would wilfully vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Ancient Constitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he thereby ceases to be King by Law, and by destroying his own Title to the Crown, thereby also dissolves that Bond of Allegiance which before bound his Subjects to him as well in Duty as Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But how can you prove that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was mutual, or that the King was to enjoy his Crown only upon this Condition, That he observe the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom? since I have heard it posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively asserted by those that are very well skilled in our Laws, that the King is as much King before ever he is crowned, as afterwards; and that he may chuse whether he will ever take any Coronation Oath or not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I will not now dispute that Point with you; but yet let me tell you, if a King should at this day refuse, to be crowned, because he had no mind to be tied by his Coronation Oath, I doubt whether the People, if they understood the force of that Oath his Predecessors
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55608:18"/>
have all along taken for so many Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, might not as well refuse to take him for their King, since he refused to hold the Crown upon those Conditions that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors at first took it; and so might look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves as good as discharged of all Oaths of Fidelity to him, since those Oaths were no doubt at first instituted on this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Consideration, that both should observe their part, and not that one side should be loose, and the other fast; but to shew you in the first place, that every Coronation Oath was in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, and long after the Conquest, a Renewal of this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract may appear from these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the Kings of the <hi>West Saxons</hi> were elected, or at least confirmed by the great Council or Parliament <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Spel. Concil. 1 Vol. p. 29.</note>; and I can shew you a particular Law of a General Synod or Parliament of all <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is particularly set down the Laws or Rules for the electing of their Kings, as that they were not to be Bastards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And pursuant to this Law of electing their Kings, this great Council <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Vitam Alfredi. Edit. Oxon.</note> often preferred the Younger Brother before the Elder, or the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55608:18"/>
Uncle before the Nephew, when either greater Merit, or the pressing Necessities of the Kingdom required it, which when once agreed upon by the Bishops, and great men of the Kingdom in the great Council, after their Election, and upon the day of their Coronation, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (whose Right it has always been to crown the King) went to the King Elect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever he proceeded to the Coronation, tender'd him a solemn Oath <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Old Form of the Coronation Oath before the Conquest, and after, in Mr. <hi>Attwood</hi>'s Treatise of the Antiquity of an Oath of Abjuration, <hi>p.</hi> 94. to the end.</note>, whereby he was to swear three things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That God's Church, and all the Christian People of his Kingdom should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy true Peace and Quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he should forbid Rapine, and all Injustice to all sorts of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he would command Justice together with Mercy in all Judgments: And then (and not till then) was the Crown set upon his Head, and the Scepter put into his Hand by the Archbishop; and till this was done, the Prince Elect was not looked upon as King, nor had any Right to the Subjects Allegiance. And thus stood this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55608:19"/>
immemorial Custom unaltered, not only during the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, but long after the coming in of the <hi>Normans;</hi> for the first seven Kings after <hi>William</hi> I. who till their Coronations were never owned nor stiled Kings until King <hi>Edward</hi> I. who was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected (or Recognized) for King, in a great Convention of the Estates, who then assembled of their own Accord, when he was in the Holy Land, and they caused an Oath of Fealty to be taken to him two Years before his arrival in <hi>England;</hi> and though I grant since that time the Crown hath been claimed as Hereditary, yet has it rather been by vertue of those Entails that have been successively made of it by express Acts of Parliament, and not from any Fundamental Law or Constitution of the Kingdom. This was the ancient Form of electing and making our Kings, the Footsteps of which Election still remain to later times, when the Archbishop used to lead the King or Queen to all parts of the Scaffold, as at the several Coronations of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Forms of those Coronations in <hi>Stow, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed.</hi> and others.</note>: asked all the People standing below, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would have this Person to be their King or Queen?</p>

               <p>I confess you tell me more of this matter than ever I knew before; but yet I am still to seek, how this old Coronation Oath, exprest in so few words, should tie those Princes to observe the Laws of the Kingdom, since it seems that by this Oath, he was rather to govern according to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>That is, because you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Legal Force of those words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Oath; for by the first Branch of it, whereby God's Church, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian People should enjoy true Quiet, is meant not only that the Clergy in particular should under him enjoy all their lawful Rights and Priviledges, but also all the other Lay-Members of Christ's Church should enjoy the free Profession of the Christian Religion as by Law establisht, without any molestation or disturbance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By forbidding Rapine and all Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, is meant not only his hindring Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, and all violent takings of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Goods, but also the illegal taking them by his own personal Commands, or by his inferior Officers or Ministers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By commanding Justice together with Mercy in all his Judgments, is meant no more, than his not pardoning the Guilty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55608:20"/>
when condemned, and also not to condemn the Innocent, or such whose particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances might deserve Mercy, and is no more than what was afterwards granted by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the sense of which is, <q>That the King there promises neither to deny nor defer, nor yet to sell Justice to any man;</q> which extends likewise as well to his great Officers and Judges, as himself, since they being the Keepers of the King's Oath and Conscience, he is guilty of the like Perjury, if he either connive, or is a wilful Partaker or Encourager of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice. And it was also declared for Law by the Judges, in the Reign of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> III. That not only the King, but the Prelates, Nobles, Governors, and Justices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this Realm, were tied by their Oaths to maintain the ancient Laws, Franchises and Customs of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> And also in a Letter sent from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> I. to the Pope <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Mat. West. p. A.

Customs and Laws of their Country, and to whose observance and defence they were bound by the Oaths they had taken, and which they would defend to the utmost of their power; nor would permit even the King himself, although he would do it, to attempt the same.</q> Now pray tell me what greater Assertion of a right of Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in some Cases, than this Letter from the Parliament, sent by the King's own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and consent.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But you have not yet shewn me how the King, who is an Hereditary Monarch at this day, can be tied by the Oath of his Predecessors, since (as your self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny) he is King before ever he is Crowned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I will not deny, but the Law is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be so at this day; yet it is also as true, that from the beginning it was not so, as I have here sufficiently made out; and yet for all this, I can prove, that tho the Succession to the Crown is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Hereditary, and so may alter the manner of acquiring it, (and this for the avoiding of Contests between Competitors at Elections) yet notwithstanding this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Succession, it does no ways alter the Conditions on which the Crown was at first conferred, any more than if the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55608:21"/>
Office of Lord High-Constable, or Earl-Marshal of <hi>England,</hi> having been at first granted for Life, and being afterwards by subsequent Grants made Hereditary, those that thus enjoyed them should have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were now no longer forfeitable for any Male-administration, tho never so enormous. Now, let us but apply the Case of those great Offices of Trust to that of Kingship, which is certainly an Office of the highest Trust, and then we may easily discover, that whether it be for life, or else entail'd to them, and their Heirs, they are still obliged by the first Contract of their Ancestors, which is for memory sake still renewed at every King's Reign; so that tho the manner of their Accession to the Crown be alter'd from what it was at first, yet the Conditions on which it was first taken, remain the same as long as the Oath it self continues; so being renewed at every King's Reign. And hence it is, that our Kings enjoy their Crowns, be it for Life or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail. Now it is certain, that this Solemn Oath or Contract which was taken by the first King, ought by Law to be renewed at the beginning of every King's Reign; and hence it is, that our Kings are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound by their own express Oaths or Contracts with their Subjects, but also by the implied Oaths or Compacts of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55608:21"/>
their Predecessors under whose Title they claim.</p>
               <p>And King <hi>Iames</hi> I. was so sensible of this double Contract, that he expresly mentions it in one of his Speeches to 1609. both Houses of Parliament, where he very well distinguishes between both those Contracts, telling them, <q>That a King in a setled Kingdom binds himself by a double Oath to the Observation of the Fundamental Laws of his Kingdom, <hi>tacitly</hi> as being a King [that is claiming under his Ancestors] and so bound to protect them as well as the Laws of his Kingdom; and <hi>expresly</hi> by his own Oath at his Coronation: So as every Just King in a setled Kingdom is bound to observe that Paction or Covenant made to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his Laws, in forming his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agreable thereunto, according to that Paction which God made to <hi>Noah, &amp;c.</hi> And then goes on to tell them, That therefore a King governing in a setled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into a Tyrant as soon as he leaves off to Rule according to his Laws. And then concludes, That all Kings who are not Tyrants, nor Perjured, will be glad to bind themselves within the limits of their Laws; and they that perswade them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, are the worst Vipers and Pests
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55608:22"/>
both against them, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that you see here by King <hi>Iames</hi>'s own Concession, that there are not only Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, but an Original Contract (which he there calls a Paction or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) to observe them from the time of the first King or Monarch to this day, and that when he ceases to Govern according to this Compact (which he here calls his Laws) he then becomes a Tyrant.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But I have heard some say, That <hi>William</hi> the First, after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>England,</hi> distributed almost all the Lands to his <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Followers; and that if there were any Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ever entred into by the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings, it was quite void upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors obtaining the Crown, and subduing all the People of this Nation; so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Liberties we now enjoy, they were but the gracious Concessions of himself, and his Successors, without any such Original Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact.</p>

               <p>I confess it is so alledged by some high flying Gentlemen, who, if they could, would make us all Slaves to the King's Absolute Will; but without any just grounds
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55608:22"/>
in my Opinion, since every one of their Suppositions are either false, or built upon rotten Foundations. For in the first place, a: Conquest in an Unjust War (as I have already proved) can confer no Right on the Conqueror over a free People; and if this War were never so Just, yet could not he thereby have acquired any Right over the whole Kingdom, since the War was not made against the <hi>English</hi> Nation, but <hi>Harold</hi> only, who had usurped the Crown contrary to Right: so that King <hi>William</hi> could have no Right to it without the People's Consent in their Great Council or Parliament, which most of the Historians of those times say he obtained; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, King <hi>William</hi> (whom you call the Conqueror) never claimed by that Title, but by the Donation or Testament of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or Election of the People of <hi>England,</hi> as all his <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Predecessors had done before him; nor did he give all, nor yet a third part of the Lands of <hi>England</hi> to his <hi>Norman</hi> Followers, as you suppose; or if he had, would it do the business for which it is urged, since his <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Followers to whom he gave those Lands, were never conquered, but were (if any thing) the Conquerors of others, and from them most of our Ancient <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:55608:23"/>
Nobility and Gentry are lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, or else claim under their Titles by Purchases, Mariages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to all their Rights and Priviledges. And at the worst, supposing King <hi>William</hi> to have in some Cases governed Arbritra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and like a Conqueror over the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish;</hi> this was not so, till he was provoked to it by their frequent Plots and Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies against him; and yet even that was done contrary to his Coronation-Oath, which was the same that all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings had taken before, only with this Addition, That he should govern as well his <hi>French</hi> as his <hi>English</hi> Subjects by <hi>equal Law or Right</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Coronation-Oath in Mr. <hi>Atwood</hi>'s Treatise of the Oath of Abjuration, p. 96.</note> so that his wilful Breach of this Oath could not give him, or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors any just Right by the Sword over the Lives, Estates, or Liberties of any <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman,</hi> who had never fought against him, nor offended his Laws. And tho I should grant that this King, and his Son <hi>William Rufus,</hi> governed his <hi>Norman,</hi> as well as his <hi>English</hi> Subjects very Arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and contrary to his own Laws; yet did his Brother, King <hi>Henry</hi> 1st, make both his <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Subjects large
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55608:23"/>
amends by the great Charter of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liberties, which he granted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his Election to the Crown by the Chief Bishops, Lords, and Free-men of the Kingdom; and upon which the great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> renewed by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and afterwards confirmed by his Son, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> were founded, being but larger Explanations thereof.</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I confess this is more than ever I knew before; but what if a King of <hi>England</hi> (as King <hi>Iames</hi> lately did) will cease to govern like a legal or limited King, and prove a Tyrant by breaking this original Compact, which his Predecessors made with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, does it therefore follow that he may be resisted if he does? or can he ever cease to be King, or forfeit his Royal Dignity, if he acts never so Tyrannically? for sure if all resistance of his Power be unlawful, as being so declared by several Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign, he can never cease to be King, except he will wilfully turn himself out of the Throne.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I am very well satisfied that those Acts you mention were only made upon this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, That the King would never violate the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55608:24"/>
which he became King, or go about to change the Constitution of the Government; since that had been to give the King an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Power to make us all Slaves whenever he pleased; so that our Religion, Lives, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberties, would lye not only at the King's mercy, but at the mercy of those Ministers that govern him; and therefore as it can never be supposed to have been the intent of that Parliament to tye up themselves, and the whole people of this Nation to the King on such hard terms; nay, supposing that the Parliament had done it, I do not think they had any right so to do, since they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted by those that chose them, not to alter the Fundamental Constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to strengthen and confirm it; so that if by this Act of Non-resistance the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might easily be altered, and the Legislative Power, as well as that of raising Money, may be taken out of the Power of the King, and the Two Houses, and should be put solely in the King's person, the whole frame of the Government would not only be altered, but actually dissolved, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Resistance in this case would not be a crime, but a duty; since Parliaments were instituted for the maintenance of the King's Legal, and not Tyrannical Power, and for preserving the people in that share of the Government, which by the Fundamental
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55608:24"/>
Constitutions of the Kingdom belonged to them.</p>

               <p>But pray tell me, Sir, Is there any express Law for this Resistance; for indeed I could never hear of any such? and therefore, I doubt, that if those Noblemen and Gentlemen, who went in lately to help his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty, when Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> had been taken Prisoners, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self defeated by the King's Army; but they would have all of them been guilty of High Treason, by the Statute of 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; and sure it would have been no good Plea, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Judges, that they took not up Arms against the King of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, because the Government was dissolved by the King's exercising an Arbitrary Power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I would not argue with you what would have happened if the King had got the better, and either taken the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> prisoner or driven him out of the Kingdom; for I never knew in all the Histories I have read, but that a Prince, who had the Armed Force of the Nation on his side, could hang whom he pleased;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55608:25"/>
and will always find Judges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-men enough ready to side with him in it, as we have found by many late Examples.</p>
               <p>But this is no Argument for the Right or justice of such Proceedings; for we know King <hi>Charles</hi> the First was tried and condemned by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority of the Rump Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithstanding, his denying that they had any Authority over him; and though it be true there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Act of Parliament to tell us when the Government is dissolved, and when, and in what case men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the King, or those commissioned by him; yet does it not follow that no such thing can ever be lawfully done; for it is sufficiently proved from the reason and necessity of the thing it self, though no express Law or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be made for it; which may be also observed in all Moral or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promises or Contracts. Thus if I promise, or swear to a man, never upon any account whatsoever to beat or kill him, this-is still so to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that he does not go about to beat, or kill me; for then my right of self-defence will take place,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55608:25"/>
notwithstanding my Oath: so when people are married, they mutually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise each other to live together till death do part, yet no man will say a man or woman commits a sin, or breaks this solemn Promise, if the former, by reason of Adultery in the Wife, or the latter, by the extream Cruelty or Harshness of the Husband, do separate from each other, and that perhaps for ever.</p>
               <p>But I shall now shew you that there is a Resistance allowed even by the Law it self in some cases, against those that have the King's personal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as may appear by this Instance. Suppose an Officer with a Company of Soldiers should under a colour of such a Commission take upon them to keep possession of a House, contrary to Law, do you not believe, but the Sheriff may upon a legal Process issued out thereupon, raise the <hi>Posse Comitatus,</hi> and restore the Possession by Force to the Right Owner, notwithstanding this Commission; and the Reason is plain, because though the Officer may have the King's personal Command for so doing, yet it is the Sheriff alone who acts by a Legal Authority, and who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55608:26"/>
alone can justifie the using of this Force: Now if any man should be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Action, no doubt but the Officer and his Soldiers, and not the Sheriff, and the men that assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, would be found guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I grant this may be so; but is not this the true reason of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sheriff acts by the King's implyed Authority, without which no man can lawfully take up Arms? But how can this be justified, in case Arms were taken up upon supposition the Government is Dissolved, which is all one as to affirm, That the King is no longer King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I allow that great part of what you say is true, but not all; for in the first place it is plain, that there is a Legal Resistance of those Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though issued by the King, and which is justifiable by Law, as appears by this instance; which rule holds good as long as the Laws can be permitted to have their due course: But what if the King will not permit that they shall, but will take part with this wicked Officer and his Soldiers, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55608:26"/>
maintain them in these violent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and either not let the Law pass upon them, or if it does, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly Pardon them as soon as they had committed any such violent ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Acts by his Commands contrary to Law? Can any man believe that such Proceedings, if commonly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, would not quickly dissolve the Government, and make such a King cease to be so, since he refused to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and Protect his Subjects accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law, and his own Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, which virtually contains those Conditions on which he holds his Crown? for when there is no Justice to be had in the Kings Courts, it then becomes a meer Anarchy, wherein there can be nothing but Rapine and Confusion, and consequently puts men in a State of War.</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I have I know not what to say to this; But can you shew me any express Law for the King's ceasing to be so, in case he thus leave off to Protect his People, and Govern them according the Laws of the Land?</p>

               <p>Yes that I can, for I can shew you a good old Law of King <hi>Edward</hi>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, How can this be, since our late Statutes declare the King not to be subject to any Coercive Power of the Two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I grant the Law to be so now; but from the beginning it was not so (as I said but now); many of the <hi>Saxon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Kings before the Conquest, were Deposed by the great Council of the Kingdom; and since that time King <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the IId. were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Deposed by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and that proceedings against them were never expresly Condemned or repealed by any subsequent Statute
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55608:28"/>
that I know of; but admit the Law is not so now, does it not therefore follow, that because the King is not Punishable, nor Accountable to the Parliament, that therefore he is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also Irresistable, and can never fall from his Royal Dignity, let him behave himself as he will towards his People? for sure it is one thing to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or Punishable by the Parliament as his Superior, and another to be Disobeyed and Resisted by the whole Nation, when it shall judge he has broken this Original Contract made by himself and his Predecessors, in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Fundamental Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Government, by vertue of which he became King; since the former course of Proceedings must be according to some Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for this there is no Law now extant, but the contrary declared by several Statutes; whereas Resistance in those cases I have now put upon a total breach of the Original. Contract, is not only justifiable from the very Constitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but also from the Right of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Self-defence; whereby, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever violently Assaults me in Life, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or Estate, I am justified in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending my self against him; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55608:28"/>
any Right were wholely insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, if it might not be Defended by Force, when endeavoured by Force to be taken away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But methinks this seems hard, and of evil consequence? to take this Power of Judging the King's Actions, whether Legal or not, out of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to place it in the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Body of the whole Nation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we of the high shoos would be made as capable of Judging when this Original<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Contract is broken, as the best Gentleman of you all; which, the temper of the meaner and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly sort of People considered, seems very dangerous, since this would give them a Right to Rebel, and take Arms whenever they had a mind to it, as I have read in our Chronicles they did in <hi>Richard</hi> the IId. and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the VIth. and <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth's time; and as they did lately in Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, Pulling down, and Burning Popish Gentlemen's Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>You very much mistake me, for I do not put this power of Judging any where, but where it ever was, much less to give a Power of taking
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55608:29"/>
up Arms, and raising Rebellion to the Mob, or most common sort of People; but first to shew you, that every man in his several Station, and at his Peril, is to judge of the Legality and Illegality of the King's Commissions, or Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations: Pray let me ask you this question, Suppose that the King grants a Commission to certain of us Country Gentlemen, to raise a Tax contrary to Law, are we obliged to Obey it, or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>No sure, you are not, because you should be Punished, not only in Parliament, but at Common Law, if you did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, it seems that we Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Deputy-Lieutenants may judge in this Case, but, pray tell me, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we should notwithstanding order this Tax to be levied, and you were High-Constable of the Hundred, Do you think your self obliged blindly to obey our Orders, being so Notoriously contrary to Laws?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I think truly I should not, but should plainly tell your Worships, that I was not obliged either by Law or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55608:29"/>
in Conscience to have any hand in oppressing my self and my Neighbours, and should desire you to put this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Task upon some Body else, since I thought my self liable to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Account one time or other, if I did it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Very well; but if you and the other High-Constable of the Country should agree with us Justices to raise this Tax, Do you think the Petty-Constables and Assessors were obliged to act by this New Commission contrary to Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I do not think that if we High-Constables should be such Fools and Knaves, the Petty-Constables and Asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors were obliged to be so too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, you see that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we Gentlemen, but you Yeomen can judge, (nay, are obliged at your Perils to do it) when things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon you contrary to Law; nay, and to refuse to execute them too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I grant all this is true, but this is not Resistance by force; but I suppose
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55608:30"/>
you Gentlemen would count it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Rebellion in us Country-Fellows, if you should tell us such a Tax al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready imposed was according to Law; and we should be so far from paying it, as to raise the Country, and fall upon you Commissioners that went about to raise it by distraining or imprisoning the Refusers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>By your favour, Neighbour, your very Refusal to levy this Tax is a Civil Resistance; since all Disobedience to the Command of Superiors is so, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a Right that those that disobey suppose they have of judging of the Legality or Illegality of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but as for forceable Resistance, though I do not allow it to you, or any man else, as long as no Force is used against them, yet so much let me tell you, that if we Deputy-Lieutenants and Justices of the Peace, should ever be so foolishly wicked as to take upon us to assist the King by the power of the Trainbands, or a standing Army, to levy any Tax without Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or colour of Law at least, but that not only you of this County, but of all the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> might lawfully stand upon your defence, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55608:30"/>
resist this Rapine and Violence; since if this were once permitted, it would in a moment alter the Constitution of the Government in a main Fundamental Point. The like I may say of any other matter of the same nature, if it should be imposed upon you by Force, contrary to Law, that is, contrary to, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Act of Parliament to warrant it.</p>
               <p>Nor would this justify all the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions you mention to have been raised by the Common People in those several Kings Reigns; since those were raised upon levying of Taxes imposed by the King and Parliament, which is the sole Supreme Legislative Power of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where I grant it is Rebellion to resist; whereas that Resistance, which I only now suppose to be Lawful, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King's personal Commands or Commissions in opposition to known Laws, which is not to resist the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power of the Nation, but only the King's Person, when he acts not as King, but as a private man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, is not this to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the King's Personal, from his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Capacity, to suppose the man may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55608:31"/>
be resisted, and not the King; or the King's Personal, but not his Legal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions or Commands? for to do this, I have heard, has been declared to be Treason?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>This is also justifiable by Law in some Cases; for if the King should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to prove mad, (as divers Kings have) pray do not his Servants about him hold or tie the Madman, and yet how can they do this, without bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King? And, pray tell me, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there between Madness, which is a Natural Disability and Tyranny, which is a moral incapacity to govern? since both are alike destructive to the Common Good of the Nation. And when you suppose we may lawfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the King's personal Commands, what do we but then by disobeying the King, distinguish between the King's politick and his personal Capacity; that is, when he acts legally as King, and when he issues out his Commissions or Commands, without any Law to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him? or else when the Persons commissioned are made by Law inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the King's Commissions, as the Popish Officers lately were? since other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we were all obliged to yield the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55608:31"/>
same Obedience to the one as well as to the other.</p>
               <p>Nor is it at all harder, but much easier to judge, when such Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or Commands are attended with Force and Violence, and when they are not; since certainly every plain Country-Fellow can much better tell, when a thing contrary to Law, is put upon or exacted of him by Force, than when it is only barely commanded or required of him by a Commission or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; seeing the latter only reaches the Understanding, but the former not only touches the Understanding, but the outward Senses of Hearing, Seeing and Feeling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To conclude, I would not have you therefore believe that I allow this general Resistance to the whole Nation, but only when by a General Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Fundamental Liberties, the whole Constitution of the Government comes to be in danger of an utter Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and Subversion, by breach of the Original Contract abovementioned: and that these Violations and Oppressions do some way or other concern the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People of this Nation, that is, all Orders and Degrees of men, and then only (and not till then) I look upon such a general Resistance of the King, and those
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55608:32"/>
commissioned by him to be lawful; that is, when all other Remedies are become ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely desperate and impracticable, thro' the King's wilful Obstinacy to amend such Violations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I grant this seems very reasonable, but pray tell me what those grand Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are, that can thus alter the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and can make a total breach of this Original Contract?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>They do, I conceive, consist but in a few Points, and they are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> If the King should take upon him to make Laws, either concerning Religion, or Civil Matters, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then upon the People without their Consent in Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he take upon him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with all Laws, and especially when his hands are tied up, by a particular Clause to the contrary, that he shall not so dispense with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If he take upon him of his own head, without the Advice or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Judges, to raise Money upon the Nation: Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55608:32"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If he corrupt the Judges to give their Opinions according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, either by promising of Rewards, or threatning them if they refuse; and will put none into those places, who will not do whatever he commands them, or turns them out as soon as they act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If he go about to alter the ancient Constitution of Parliaments, and bring the Election of the Members of the House of Commons, only into the hands of those of his own Party or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, whereby our Liberty of Electing and Voting by our Lawful Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives would be quite taken away. The like I may also say of the House of Peers, if he should go by Force either to exclude the Bishops or Temporal Lords, who have a Right of sitting there by Prescription; and should, under pretence of his Prerogative, bring such as had no Right to sit there at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, and lastly,</hi> If he should go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout commonly or generally, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Subjects Lives, Liberties or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, by an Arbitrary Power, contrary
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55608:33"/>
to Law, upon pretended Crimes, and without such due Trial as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>Now I think you cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that most (if not all) of these Heads, are easily to be judged of by all the People of <hi>England,</hi> when they are come to that extremity that we can have no reason to doubt of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, tell me who shall judge of these Violations, or what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may be allowed to rise and redress them?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>The Judges are, I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the whole Body of the Nation or People, every one in his private Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that is, not the Clergy alone, or the Lords alone, or the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> Nobiles Minores.</note> less Nobility or Gentry, and much less you Yeomen, or landed men, and least of all the meer Rabble or Mob, but all men of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Conditions taken together; and as for the number, it is any, though never so small, that are able to make a head till more can come into their Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But would not a Free Parliament be a much better Judge of these Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, than this general Body of the People?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it, if a Parliament may be had that were free and unbiass'd; but what if the King resolves not to call any? or, if he does, will not give them leave to sit till they have redrest our Grievances? Or, what if he will not call one, till he thinks he can make or pack it according to his own mind? The Nation may at this rate be enslaved as much, nay worse, by having the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Parliament to confirm the King's Arbitrary Power, than if he had acted by none at all; so that in these Cafes there can be no other Remedy left us, but an Appeal to the General Body of the People, with whom that Original Contract I mentioned was at first made; not but that a Free Parliament or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, when ever it can meet, may be of excellent use to examine what the People (who thus take up Arms) have acted in defence of their just Rights and Liberties, and to judge and declare it to have been well or ill done, and upon what grounds; and this hath been the course
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55608:34"/>
of all Parliaments that have been called immediately after any great and general Resistance or Revolution, made upon the Accounts abovementioned. This I could prove to you from several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in divers Kings Reigns since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, were it worth my pains; but still in all those Cases the first opposition hath been from the great Body of the Clergy, Nobility and People together, as you may particularly read in the Reign of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> not long before the great Council at <hi>Runney Mead.</hi>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, can you also justify those Lords and Gentlemen who took up Arms, and declared for the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> and also those Lords, together with the Officers and Soldiers, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the King, and went into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Army? Pray, Sir, did you look upon the Government to be then actually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved when they went in to him, and that the King, by the breach of the Original Contract, was then no longer King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I do not say so; for though those Violations, if obstinately persisted in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amendment, were enough to create such a Dissolution, and consequently a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55608:34"/>
Forfeiture of the Crown, as they wrought at the last; yet the Government can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be dissolved, so long as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any hopes that the King will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend those Violations he has made, in a Free Parliament; for the obtaining of which, as it was the chief cause of his Highness's coming over, so was it also of those Lords, Gentlemen and Officers going in to him, or declaring for him: and this, I think, they may very well justify both in Honour and Conscience. And though there be no express Law for it, yet it is no more than what the Nobility, Gentry and People of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms as well as this, have many times done before in former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when their Kings being misled and deluded by evil Councellors or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, have made the like Breaches upon their Liberties. And though I confess such taking up of Arms have not always met with the desired Success, yet for the most part they have, and then such wicked Judges and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors have not failed to be punished, and those Lords, Gentlemen and others, who so nobly and stoutly stood up for the Rights and Liberties of the Nation have been also pardoned by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that with the King's own
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55608:35"/>
consent, when those wicked men were once removed; but the King himselff was never touched, till by his own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obstinate persisting in such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courses, he let the Nation see that he was wholely irreclaimable, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent to destroy our Liberties, and set up Arbitrary Government and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in this Kingdom, as I could shew you from several Instances in the Reigns of King <hi>Iohn, Henry</hi> III. <hi>Edward</hi> I. and <hi>Richard</hi> II. if it were necessary to give you a particular History of all those Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions; so that I suppose a twofold Right of Resistance in the People, the one warranted by the Laws and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Government, which may well consist with our Loyalty to the King, and to the intent only to obtain a Free Parliament, to redress Grievances, and punish those evil Councellors who have been the chief Ministers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signers of Arbitrary Power, as in the Case of King <hi>Iames</hi> before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the other Natural, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by the King's wilful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate refusal to redress such Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by ceasing to govern us according to Law, he thereby also ceases to be King; and then the Commonwealth or Civil Society being without a Head to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

Common Justice, was absolutely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>

               <p>What then is meant by these words in the late Vote and Declaration of the <hi>Convention,</hi> viz. <hi>That King</hi> James <hi>having withdrawn himself out of the Kingdom, hath</hi> abdicated <hi>the Government?</hi> Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the King's bare delertion of the Kingdom, when he declared he could not help it should be looked upon as in <hi>Abdication</hi> of the Government. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that seems somewhat hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>To deal freely with you, I never understood the word <hi>Abdicate</hi> in that Sense, but only according to all the precedent Clauses in this Vote, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the King, by endeavouring to break the Original Contract, between the King and his People, and by the Advice of Iesuits and wicked Persons, having violated the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, and having withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of this Kingdom, hath</hi> abdicated <hi>the Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where you may observe that the word <hi>Abdicated,</hi> relates to all the Clauses afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, as well as to his deserting the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55608:36"/>
Kingdom, or else they would have been wholely in vain; so that the meaning of this word in this place is no more, than that King <hi>Iames,</hi> by violating the Original Contract abovementioned, and by endeavouring to subvert the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Constitution, and by refusing to restore it to its former Condition, (all which was expressed by his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself out of the Kingdom) hath <hi>abdicated</hi> the Government; that is, by refusing to govern us according to that Law by which he held the Crown, he hath implicitly renounced his Title to it; as when, for example, a Tenant for Life aliens in Fee, though he take back from the Grantee a Lease for Life or Years, yet he thereby forfeits his Estate, and the Tenant in Reversion may enter; and the reason is, because he parts with that Estate which he held by Law, and will hold by another Title which the Law doth not allow; for <hi>abdicare</hi> in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Tongue, signifies no more than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, or disclaim, as I could shew you from divers Phrases in that Language, were you a Scholar good enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them; and this may be done by divers other means, besides express words: For if Kingship be a Trust for the preservation of the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55608:36"/>
of the People, than such Actings contrary to that Trust as plainly strike at the very Fundamentals of the Constu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, are not only a breach of that Trust, but a tacite Renunciation of it also, which I prove thus; the doing of any Act that is utterly inconsistent with the Being and End of the thing for which it is ordained, is as true a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, or <hi>Abdication</hi> of that thing, as if it were made in express words, as I have now proved in the Case of Tenant for Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I confess this is more than ever I heard before; but, pray, What do you think was the reason that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention made use of this Hard word <hi>Abdicate;</hi> (which I confess, to us Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Fellows, seem'd as bad as Heathen Greek) when they might as well have made use of plain Expressions, such as Renounce or Forfeit, which you have now made use of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you, Neighbour, my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of this Matter, and if I am out you must pardon me; because those Wise men in the Convention, who had the Wording of this Vote, were afraid
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55608:37"/>
that those plainer words you mention, would have been of too hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion to a great part of the Country Gentlemen, who had been bred up with different Principles; and therefore used the word <hi>Abdicate,</hi> as that which though it implied both a Renunciation, and also a Forfeiture of the Royal Power, yet not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly so understood, made some men only to understand it of the King's Desertion of the Throne by his going away; a Notion, which because it served a present turn, mens heads were then very full of: But indeed if this Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be closely examined, it will not do the business for which it is brought, as you have already very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I confess I never understood the true sence of this word <hi>Abdicate</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, much less the reason why it was made use of; therefore commend me to the honest bluntness of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Convention, which (as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) did not stick to declare, That King <hi>Iames</hi> by subverting the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of that Kingdom, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the Crown: But, pray Sir, tell
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55608:37"/>
me, what those Acts, or Violations of this Original Contract were, which you suppose to cause this tacit Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Crown?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>As for these I need not go far, since they are all plainly expressed in the Convention's late Declaration, as striking at the root, or very Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Constitution of the Government it self, <hi>viz.</hi> Raising of Money contrary to Law, that is, without any Act of Parliament, as in the late Levying of the Customs, Excise, and Chimney-Money upon Cottages and Ovens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the several Statutes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them on the Crown. 2dly. His Assuming a Legislative Power, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing with all Statutes for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion established by Law; whereby he at one blow took away above Forty Acts of Parliament; and he might at this rate as well have Dispensed with the whole Statute-Book at once by one general Declaration. 3dly. Raising a Standing Army in time of Peace, and putting in Popish Officers, contrary to the Statute provided against it; for these being but the King's half Subjects (as King <hi>Iames</hi> the 1st. called them
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55608:38"/>
in a Speech) might be looked upon when in Arms, as no better than Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the State; so that by thus Arming our Enemies, it was in effect a declaring War upon the People, since it was abusing the power of the Militia, which is intrusted with the King for our Safety and Preservation in our Religion, Liberties and Civil Properties, and not for the destruction of them all, as we found by woful experience, must have inevitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us. 4thly. The Quartering of this standing Army in Private houses contrary to Law, and the Petition of Right, acknowledged by the late King his Father. 5thly. His Erecting a new Ecclesiastical Court by Commission, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Statute that took away the High Commission Court. 6thly. And by the pretended Authority of this Court, suspending the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> from his Ecclesiastical Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and turning out almost all the Fellows and Scholars of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not chuse a President uncapable of being Elected by that Colledge Statutes. 7thly. By Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Six other Bishops, only for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55608:38"/>
him with an humble Petition not to impose the reading of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Toleration, upon the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as being contrary to the known Laws of the Kingdom; and then Trying them for this as a High Misdemeanor, though it was contrary to the Opinion of Two of the then Judges of that Court of Kings-Bench. There are also other things of lesser concernment, as Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juries, and unjust and partial Proceedings in Tryals, with excessive Fines and cruel Whippings; which because they were done by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Iefferies,</hi> and the other Judges, contrary to Law, I leave them to answer for it; whereas the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have now given, were in such grand Violations, as were done by the King's own personal Orders and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, or else could never have been done at all: So that by his willful acting these things, and obstinately refusing to let a Free Parliament sit to Settle and Redress them, but rather chusing to leave the Realm, than he would give way to it, when he might have done it: I think, upon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole matter, it will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55608:39"/>
appear, that the Convention had good and just Reasons for declaring the Throne Vacant, since the King had not only broke his first declaration he made in Council, to maintain the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law Established, and the Liberties and Properties of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but his own Coronation-Oath besides, if he took the same his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors did; and if he did not, he ought not to receive any benefit by his own default, but is certainly bound by the Oaths which his Grandfather King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Father King <hi>Charles</hi> took before him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I confess these seem to be great breaches of the very Fundamentals of our Religion, Liberties, and Civil Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, if done by the King's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Order and Directions; and if that he afterwards refused to disclaim them, and suffer the Authors to be Punished in Parliament, as they deserved, makes all those faults indeed fall upon the King himself, and consequently seem to amount to a Forfeiture of the Royal Dignity, according to that Law of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confessor, you have already cited, <hi>That if the King fail to Protect</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:55608:39"/>
                  <hi>the Church, and Defend his Subjects from Rapine and Oppression; the very Name (or Title) of King shall no more remain to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, pray Sir, shew me in the next place, how the Convention could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their Voting the Throne Vacant; for Granting that King <hi>Iames</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly Abdicated, or Renounced all his Right to the Crown by the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you have but now recited: Yet if this Kingdom (as I have always ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it to be) is Hereditary, and not Elective, I cannot conceive how the Throne can ever be Vacant, that is, void of a Lawful Heir, or Successor, as long as one of the Blood-Royal, either Male or Female, is left alive, since I have heard it laid down as a Maxim in our Law, <hi>That the King ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I grant this to be so upon all ordinary Deaths or Demises of a King or Queen (as the Lawyers term it): But there are great and evident Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why it could not be so upon this Civil, though not Natural, Death of the King; as First, the natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55608:40"/>
of the late King being still alive, none can claim as Heir to him whilst he lives, since it is a Maxim, as well in our Common as in the Civil Law, <hi>That no man can be Heir to a Person alive.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I grant this may be so in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Estates of Inheritance in Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simple; but I take it to be otherwise in Estates Tail; for if a Tenant in Tail had become a Monk whilst Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries were in being in <hi>England,</hi> the next Heir in Tail might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the Estate, because the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a Religious Order, was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a Civil Death: now I take the Crown to be in the nature of such an Estate-Tail, where the Heir Claims not only as Heir to the last King, but to their first or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ancestor, on whom the Crown was Entailed; otherwise Brothers or Sisters by the half Blood, could never Succeed to each other, as Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did to King <hi>Edward</hi> the VIth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Neighbour, I see you have either read <hi>Littleton,</hi> or else been very well instructed in this Law concerning
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55608:40"/>
Entails, and therefore I will argue this Point no farther with you; but if the Throne were not Vacant, pray then tell me, whom think you the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention should have immediately Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red King or Queen, whether the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular, or pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> or the Princess of <hi>Orange;</hi> Since only one of these can Claim as Heir by vertue of the Entail you now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt but the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> would have been the Right Heir, could we have been assured of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really born of the Body of the Queen; but since; I confess, there is a great doubt in most Persons through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Nation concerning it, I must so far agree with you, that he could not well be declared King till his Legitimacy were cleared, and those just suspicions we lye under to the contrary, taken away; but then on the other side, till this were done, I do not see how the Convention could well justifie their placing the Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> or any Body else in the Throne.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:55608:41"/>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>We shall come to that by and by, but in the mean time, pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that here was a great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral doubt, who was the next lawful Heir, whether the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> or the Princess of <hi>Orange;</hi> now in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes of this nature, in all the heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, limited Monarchies in <hi>Europe,</hi> the States of the Kingdom have always been the sole Supream Judges of such Controversies; and whom they have owned, and admitted as next Heirs, have always been taken and owned for Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kings, both at Home and Abroad; as I could shew you from divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, not only in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal:</hi> And till this were done, the Throne must necessarily remain vacant, and all this without making the Crown Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; for what is this vacancy of the Throne, but when through the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the ordinary Subjects whom to place therein, by reason of divers Claims of different Competitors, none can be admitted to fill it, (that is, to the exercise of the Kingly Office) till these disputes could be decided by their proper Judges, <hi>viz.</hi> the Estates of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55608:41"/>
Kingdom, which is all one, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Throne to be vacant? since it must necessarily be so, till they were fully satisfied who ought to fill it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I confess, what you have now said, carries a great deal of reason with it; but how can you justifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention's placing their present Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties on the Throne, without ever so much as examining whether the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> were really born of the Body of the Queen. or not; which, in my Opinion, ought to have been the first thing to be enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whereas I do not find that the Convention, nor yet the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have taken any more notice of him, than if there had been no such thing in nature, as a Son then born, or pretended to be born, during the Marriage between the late King and Queen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>If the Convention have done well in declaring the Throne vacant, I think I can easily justifie their filling it with their present Majesties; and that upon two several Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:55608:42"/>
The First is, that I suppose the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by his Victory over King <hi>Iames,</hi> sufficiently declared by his flying from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and disbanding his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and then quitting the Kingdom, (if he had done nothing else) did thereby lose his Right to the Crown; and so consequently to the Peoples Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; and the Nation being then free, and without any King, who had a better Right to be placed in the Throne, than the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> their Deliverer? and besides this, in respect of the Nation, King <hi>Iames</hi> (as I have already proved) having Abdicated or Forfeited his Right to the Crown, by his notorious Breach of the Contract above-mentioned, and by his wilful persisting in it; I look upon the whole Nation at his departure as fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from all Oaths of Allegiance, not only to King <hi>Iames,</hi> but to his Heirs likewise; and therefore were not obliged to look after this supposed Prince, nor to examine his Legitimacy as Heir apparent to the Crown.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot comprehend how this can consist with those Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55608:42"/>
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Iames,</hi> which oblige all the Subjects of this Realm to take the Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Allegiance to the King or Queen, and to their Heirs and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Successors; and sure, I think, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than an Act of Parliament can alter these former Statutes and solemn Declarations concerning the Succession in a Right Line: And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you will not say, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention (who certainly were no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) could without the Authority of a Lawful King and Parliament, alter the Ancient Laws of Succession, since I have heard it is a Maxim in Law, <hi>that nothing can be undone, but by the same Power that made it;</hi> And therefore, in my Opinion, the Convention was too quick in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their present Majesties King and Queen, before they had examined the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s Title; who was commonly reputed, and prayed for in all our Churches, as Heir Apparent to the Crown.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>I confess you have in few words urged all that can well be said against the late Act of the Convention, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their present Majesties King
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55608:43"/>
and Queen: Therefore in Answer to this Objection, give me leave in the first place to tell you, that you have been misinformed, That because the Acts for the Oaths of Supremacy and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, obliged us to take it to the late King, and his Heirs and Lawful Successors; that therefore no Person can be such a Lawful Successor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he Claim in a right Line, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent from the last King; since long before these Acts were made, by the Ancient Oath of Fidelity at Common Law, and which used to be required in all Court-Leets, men were as much obliged to the <hi>King, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,</hi> as they can be by any of these later Oaths, and yet no body then doubted, before those Acts were made, to pay Allegiance to that Person whom the Estates of the Kingdom had so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declared to be lawful King or Queen, without ever examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such Kings, or Queens, were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly next Heirs by Blood, or not; as I can shew you from divers Examples, had I now time for it.</p>
               <p>And there is indeed great reason for their so doing; for since all disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55608:43"/>
the right of Succession to the Crown, must be decided by some proper Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; or else be left wholly to the Decision of the Sword; and since (as I said but now) in all the limited Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Estates of such Kingdoms have been always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to by all the contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as their only proper Judges of their disputed Titles; it is but reason, that all private Subjects should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and acquiesce in their final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; since they are all virtually Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in such Assemblies, as the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative Body of the whole People, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore, if the Convention of the Estates of <hi>England,</hi> have for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers weighty Reasons, thought fit to declare their present Majesties Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King and Queen, and to place them on the Throne, as then vacant by King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Abdication, I think all the Subjects of this Kingdom are bound to bear true Allegiance to them, and to confirm it by the Oath appointed for that end, whenever they shall be lawfully required thereunto.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, but is not this to alter one part of the Original Contract,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55608:44"/>
which those that are against the present Settlement, suppose to be the Right of Hereditary Succession to the Crown, and that in a right Line: So that if the supposed Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir to King <hi>Iames,</hi> to place any body else therein, seems to render the Crown for the future not Successive, but Elective; for if it may be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now according to the humor of the present Convention, it may be done so again the next Succession, and so the right Heirs put by from time to time, for the same, or some like Reason as now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>That does not at all follow; for if you will allow that the Throne was vacant by the Abdication of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and that her present Majesty Queen <hi>Mary</hi> is lawful Heir, if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> were away; I will prove to you, that the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and present Parliament, have done all they could or were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do in this juncture, in placing Their present Majesties on the Throne, and Recognizing their Title, without taking any notice of this pretended Prince; of whose Birth, whether true
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55608:44"/>
or false, I shall not now say any thing one way or other; nor shall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my self to inquire into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of those Suspitions that may render his Birth doubtful to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Nation: And therefore in the first place, I desire you only to take Notice, that this Child was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by his Mother, when he was scarce yet six Months Old; 2dly, That the Midwife and all the chief Witnesses, who could Swear any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queen's being really with Child, and brought to Bed of him, were likewise conveyed at the same time into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it; but what do you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from hence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Why, only these two Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> That neither the Convention nor Parliament are Obliged to take Notice of the Rights of any Person, tho' Heir to the Crown, that is out of the Dominions of <hi>England,</hi> if he be no necessary part, or Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; if neither himself, nor any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55608:45"/>
for him, will put in his Claim to the Crown, upon the Demise of the King, either by Death, or Abdication; as in the Case now before us, there being then a Claim made in the late Convention by his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> on the behalf of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort the Princess, as Heir apparent to the Crown: The Convention were not obliged to look any farther after this supposed Prince, or to know what was become of him; whether he was Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or taken at Sea by Pyrates, or he being Dead, another put in his place, or carried by his Mother into <hi>France:</hi> Since any of these might have happen'd for ought they knew, no body appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put in any Claim for him, or to desire that his Cause might first be heard, before he was Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> That if such Claim had been made by any body for him, yet the Convention could by no means be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do more than lay in their Power, or to hear, or examine the Validity of this Child's Birth; unless the Midwife, Nurses, and others, who were privy to all the Transactions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55608:45"/>
it, were likewise present, and sent back to give their Testimonies in this Case; for if the Convention had proceeded to examine this matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient evidence, they could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have heard it <hi>ex parie,</hi> on but one side, and so might have sat long enough, before they could have come to any true decision in this matter; whilst in the mean time, the whole Nation for want of a King, were in danger of utter Ruin and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, why could not the Parliament have sent over Summons to those Witnesses (which they say are no further off than <hi>France)</hi> to come and give Testimony in this great Cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had proceeded to have declared the Prince and Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> King and Queen?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>There may be several good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons given for it:</p>
               <p>First, Because this Child being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Dominions of a Prince who is a declared Enemy of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Civil Interest of the <hi>English</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55608:46"/>
Nation, he would never have consented to his being sent over to be viewed by those that the <hi>Convention</hi> should appoint for that purpose; without which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, the Nation could never have been morally assured that this was the same Child that was carried away; since every one knows, that Infants of that Age are not easily distinguisht one from another, but by those that have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them from the very time of their Birth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because his Reputed Parents counting themselves already injured by the <hi>Convention,</hi> in declaring that the <hi>King had</hi> abdicated <hi>the Government,</hi> and that the <hi>Throne was thereby become vacant,</hi> would never have obeyed any Summons the <hi>Convention</hi> should have sent over, because they looked upon them not to have any Authority at all, as not being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd, nor sitting by vertue of that King's Writs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Admitting that the <hi>French</hi> King would have permitted this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Prince to have been sent back, and that King <hi>Iames</hi> and his Queen would have obeyed this Summons, yet was it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55608:46"/>
not for the safety of the Nation to stay for or rely upon it; since before this Question could have been decided, great part of this Year had slipt away, and we being left without a King to head us, nor any Parliament Sitting, able to raise Money (which cannot be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally done, without the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Parliament) the <hi>French</hi> King might, whilst we were thus quarrelling amongst our selves about a Successor to the Crown, have sent over King <hi>Iames</hi> with a great Fleet, and an Army of old Soldiers, and so have placed him again in the Throne, more Absolute than ever he was before; since besides that Legal Right of Succession, (which I grant he, once had) he might also have set up a new Right by Conquest, over this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>So that all things being seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, since the safety of the <hi>People ought to be the Supream Law,</hi> as ever hath been agreed as an undoubted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by all wise Nations, I think we have done all that could well be done, in this Case; nor have broken the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Succession, in declaring King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to be our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55608:47"/>
Lawful King and Queen; since if she were Lawful Queen, they might also declare him to be King, and make it Treason to conspire against him as well as the Parliament could do in the case of Prince <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> the Act of 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 
                     <hi>Mariae,</hi> confirming the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Marriage with King <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </note> declared King joyntly with Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> tho' he had no other Right, but by Act of Parliament: So that if the late Convention have declared, That the Administration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should remain solely in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King <hi>William</hi> during his Life; this was only to put it out of all dispute, that none might at all doubt in whom the Supream Power lay, since it will not admit of any Division.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>All this seems reasonable enough; but pray how comes it to pass, that King <hi>William</hi> is to enjoy the Crown, not only during the Queens Life, but his own also? this I heard Squire High-Church, and the Parson I last mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, cry out upon, not only as a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Breach of the Hereditary Succession,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55608:47"/>
but also as a great wrong to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and her Heirs, were the supposed Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> now dead, since it is directly contrary to the Act of Recognition of King <hi>Iames</hi> I. whereby the Parliament do not only <q>declare him to be lawful and lineal Heir of the Crown, as descended from the Eldest Daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. But also they do thereby engage themselves, and their Posterity; to yield Obedience to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Right Heirs.</q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Pray satisfie those Gentlemen when you meet them, that if they once will grant that the late King <hi>Iames</hi> could Abdicate the Crown without his own express consent, and that declaring this supposed Prince to be King was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unpracticable and unsafe for the Nation, (as I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) I think they need not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, whether his present Majesty enjoys the Crown for Life, or not; as long as it is for the Peace and Safety of the Nation that it should be so; since it was for those ends alone that King <hi>Iames</hi> was set aside, and the supposed Prince past by, without so
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55608:48"/>
much as Enquiring into his legitimacy. If the Convention had lawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to decide the greater points, they had certainly after they became a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament much more Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide and settle the less material parts of this Controversie, <hi>viz.</hi> The settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Crown after the Queens decease; since it is no more than what all former Parliaments have done in like cases: Thus <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the VII. were, formally declared, (nay the latter recognized) for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kings by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; notwithstanding the lineal Heirs by blood were then alive and in being; and not only so, but before ever <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. married with the Princess <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the IV. the Crown was settled upon him, and the Heirs of his Body, by an Act which you may find in Print in our Statute-Books: Tho' he had no Right at all by Succession, since his Mother the Countess of <hi>Richmond,</hi> from whom all the Right he could pretend to the Crown was derived, was then alive, nor had made any Cession of it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55608:48"/>
So that if this be true (which I am able to prove) that an Hereditary Succession in a right Line, was never any Fundamental Law of this Kingdom. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That after the Crown came to be Claimed by an Hereditary Right, which was no older than <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Ist</hi>'s time, the Parliament have, often taken upon them to break in upon this Hereditary Succession, whenever the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and necessity of the Kingdom requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That all those Kings who have thus succeeded without this lineal Right of Succession, have been not only, during their own Reigns, owned for true and Legal Kings; Attainders (of Treason, holding good against all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that conspired against them) but also after their Reigns were ended; for we see all such Acts of Parliament made under them stand good at this day, unless it were those that were Repealed by subsequent Parliaments: and can there then be any Question made, but that the present Parliament have as much Power to settle the Crown upon his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55608:49"/>
present Majesty for Life, as they had to settle it upon King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. or <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. and the Heirs of their Bodies? since those Princes could not deserve more from the Nation, in freeing it from the Tyranny of the two <hi>Richards,</hi> the II. and III. than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty hath done by freeing us from the Arbitrary Power of King <hi>Iames.</hi> And let me tell you farther, that the Gentlemen you mention were mistaken in their Repetition of that Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Ist</hi>'s Title; for though it is true they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him for undoubted lineal Heir of the Crown, yet they do no where in that Act tie or oblige themselves and their Posterity to him, and his right Heirs, by that Act of Parliament; but only in general, that they promise Obedience and Loyalty to that King, and his Royal Progeny; and sure none will deny Their present Majesties to be the true Progeny of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Ist.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I grant this seems very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but those Gentlemen I now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned also said, that <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. was in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the IV. declared an Usurper by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55608:49"/>
and as for <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, he had either a Title from the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> by the tacite concession of his Mother, or else from that of <hi>York</hi> by the like tacite concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife; or else if there were no such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, he was an Usurper till he had Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the said Princess, she being Heiress of the Crown. Pray what say you, Sir, to this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Pray tell those Gentlemen from me, that they are quite out in their Suppositions; for if an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, be of sufficient Authority to prove <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth an Usurper, I can give you another Act of Parliament (though not Printed) which reverses the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> his Queen, and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> their Son; wherein it is expresly declared, <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Par. Rolles 1. H. 7. N. 16.</note> 
                  <q>that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was contrary to all Allegiance and due order, attainted of High Treason in the first Year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; wherefore it is by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Assent of the Lords Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55608:50"/>
and Temporal, Assembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Enacted, That all Acts of Attainder, Forfeiture, and Disablement, made in the said Parliament against the said Blessed Prince King <hi>Henry,</hi> are made void, Annulled and Repealed.</q> So that if the Attainder of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was against all due Order and Allegiance, then certainly the said King must have been a Lawful King, and not an Usurper at the time of his Death; and if he were not so, then certainly the like must be affirmed of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, from whom he was descended, and under whom he claimed: And as for <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, there was no formal Cession of their Right ever given by the Countess his Mother, or the Princess his Wife, either before, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his coming to the Crown: And as for a tacite and implied Cession, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by saying nothing against it, pray tell me why we may not as well suppose a like tacite consent in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s not making any Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Protestation against this Act, whereby the Crown was settled upon his Majesty during his Life, but rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to it? for I have heard that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of her Servants in both Houses,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55608:50"/>
did declare, that the Princess did not design that her future Right should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hindrance to the present Settlement. Pray therefore tell me, why may not King <hi>William</hi> hold the Crown after the Death of the Queen (if she should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen first to die) without any Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh held it after the Death of his Queen, notwithstanding his two Sons, Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> both lived to be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before their Father Died; and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth was then in his nineteenth or twentieth Year of his Age; old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of conscience to govern himself?</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I confess these things were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown to me before, as they are I believe to most of my condition; and I give your Worship many thanks for your kind Information. But, pray Sir, resolve me one Question more, and I have done; Do you think a Man may Lawfully take the new Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to Their present Majesties, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding King <hi>Iames</hi> is still alive? and do you think I could justifie it (in Law) should I be called to an account for it, if he should again by some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected means or other obtain the Throne?</p>

               <speaker>I.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Neighbour, to satisfie you as to the first of your questions, I answer thus; I doubt not but you may Lawfully take this Oath, since the Parliament have done no more in thus setling the Crown, than what many former Parliaments have done before in like Cases; whose Proceedings have been still looked upon as good, and held unquestioned unto this day; as appears by the President of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. I now gave you; and upon which Declarations of Parliament (who are the only proper Judges, who have most Right to the Crown, in case of any dispute about it) the People of this Kingdom have still thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sufficiently obliged to take such Oaths of Fidelity and Allegiance, as the Government thought fit to frame, and require of them according to Law.</p>
               <p>But, I confess, the latter of your questions is somewhat harder to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, because it depends upon a matter that is farther remote, since we cannot tell whether if (ever at all) King <hi>Iames</hi> should re-obtain the Throne, by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55608:51"/>
what means it may happen; for if it should be by the Force either of the <hi>Irish,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Nations, I doubt not but we should be all made mere Slaves and Vassals, without any Law or setled Property, but his own Will: But if it should be by any Agreement or Composition with him upon his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to Govern according to Law; the<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> me tell you, Not only your self but every other Subject that takes this Oath, will have a good Plea in Law for taking it, by the Statute of the 11th. of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1.</note> whereby it is expresly Enacted; <q>That every Subject, by the duty of his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is bound to Serve and Assist his Prince and Sovereign Lord at all seasons, when need shall require; and then follows an Act of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for all those that shall personally serve the King, for the time being, in his Wars:</q>  Which were altogether unreasonable, if Allegiance had not been due before to such a King as their Sovereign Lord, mentioned in the Preamble; and if Allegiance were due
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55608:52"/>
to him, then certainly an Oath may lawfully be taken to observe it; since it is no more than what the Law hath ever required from Subjects to such a King, not only by this Statute, but at Common Law too, as appears by my Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> Comment on the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the IIId. where he asserts not only from the Authority of this Statute, but also from the old Year-Books, that a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> or for the time being, is our Lord the King, intended in that Statute; and that the other, who hath a Right and is out of Possession, is not within this Act.</p>
               <p>So that, you see, according to this Act of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. as also by the Judgment of the best Lawyers of <hi>England,</hi> whatever Person is once so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> and hath been so Recognized by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Pariiament (as Their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesties have now been) are, and ever have been esteemed Lawful and Rightful Kings or Queens, though they had no Hereditary Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession as next of Blood, as I have proved to you from the instance of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55608:52"/>
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. and 7th. and could do also by the Examples of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (take which you please) since they could not both of them succeed as the Legitimate Daughters and Heirs of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: So that it is plain, one or other of these Queens had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Parliamentary Title to the Crown: Therefore, upon the whole matter, whether Their present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties are Heirs to the Crown by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Descent, is not the Question; but whether by the Law of <hi>England</hi> they are not to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Lawful and Rightful King and Queen; so that an Oath of Allegiance may be lawfully taken to them, and all men obliged to serve them in all their Wars and other Affairs, even against King <hi>Iames</hi> himself; since we cannot serve Two Masters, that is, owe Allegiance to Two Kings at once.</p>

               <p>I cannot deny but what you say seems not only very reasonable, but also according to Law; but I heard the Squire and the Parson we but now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, positively assert, That the King
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55608:53"/>
and Parliament had no Power to alter the Succession to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Crown, though they would; and that therefore this Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, you now mentioned, which indemnifies all those that take up Arms in defence of the King for the time being, is void: First, Because made by an Usurper who had no Right to make such a Law in prejudice of the true King, or the next Heirs of the Crown; but also because (as they said) it was but a Temporary Act, and was to last no longer than during his life; and lastly, because this Statute hath never been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or held for good in any cases of Assisting Usurpers, since that time; for the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Executed for Treason, in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> because he had Assisted and Taken up Arms on behalf of the Lady <hi>Iane Gray,</hi> who was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Queen, and Reign'd as such for about a Fortnight; and yet, tho the Duke Pleaded afterwards that he had Acted nothing but by Order of the Queen and Council for the time being; yet this Plea was over-ruled by the Peers, who were his Judges, and he was Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted notwithstanding. Lastly, they said, That this Statute was implicitly, or by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55608:53"/>
consequence Repealed by those Statutes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iemes,</hi> which appoint the Oaths of Allegiance to be only taken to the King, his Heirs, and lawful Successors; besides a Statute of the 28th. of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, by which it is made Treason in any of those on whom he had setled the Crown, or should bequeath it by his last Will, to Usurp upon the Right of each other; which could never have been, if the King or Queen for the time being must have been Assisted and Obey'd by all the Subjects of this Realm, as if they were Rightfully so; and therefore they concluded, that this Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh could make no alteration in the ancient Law concerning the Succession, but that it stands still as it did before that Statute was made, and as it was declared in the Case of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, by which it was affirmed, That the <hi>Henries,</hi> the <hi>Fourth Fifth,</hi> and <hi>Sixth,</hi> were Kings only in Deed, and not of Right, and but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Kings, and that the Statute which setled the Crown upon <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth and his Issue, was absolutely void, against the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and his Heirs.</p>

               <p>If this be all they had to say, I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55608:54"/>
doubt not but to answer it well enough; and therefore as to their first Objection, which would make this Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. void, because made by an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper; methinks they might have been so civil as to have allowed him to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King in Right of his Wife at least; this Statute being made during the time of his marriage with the Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but indeed nothing more betrays these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ignorance in our Laws; since if they will but look on any ordinary Statute Book, they will find that the Statutes of those Kings they look upon as Usurpers, are of as much force at this day, as those ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Princes in a right line, unless it were such as have been since Repeal'd by some subsequent Statutes. <hi>2dly.</hi> Their Objection of its being a Temporary Law, only during that King's Life, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as vain, since the Statute it self men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no such thing; but speaks of the King for the time being, in all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, without any mention of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. in particular. <hi>3dly.</hi> That the Judges have lookt upon it as a void Law, or else Repeal'd it also as false; for the Case of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> does not prove it to be so; for though the Duke did not, as we can ever find,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55608:54"/>
plead this Statute at his Trial, yet I think if he had, it would not have helpt him, since the King or Queen, for the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within this Statute, I only take to be he or she that have been solemnly Crowned and Recognized by a free Parliament; or such a one on whom the Crown is entail'd by Statute; which it never was on the Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> on whom the Crown was only bestow'd by King <hi>Edward</hi> the VIth's Letters-Patents, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had no Title by Act of Parliament. And lastly, that this Statute of 11th of <hi>Henry</hi> VIIth. was never Repeal'd by any subsequent Act, is likely as certain; for I never heard before, that any Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament could ever be Repeal'd by Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but only by express words: But indeed, none of those Statutes you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have done it so much as by Implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for though the Oaths of Allegiance, and Supremacy are to be taken to the King or Queen, and their Heirs, and Lawful Successors; yet who those Heirs or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Successors shall be, can only be known by some Law or other; now who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what this Law is, or shall be, but the King and Parliament the sole Supream Legislators? And that this is Law at this day, appears by this undeniable Authority,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55608:55"/>
that it is by the Statute of the 13th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> declared to be <q>Treason, during the Life of the Queen, for any Person to affirm that the Queen and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not Power to make Laws, to limit, and bind, and govern the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Crown, in Possession, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, or Reversion; (and to shew you that this Statute is still in force) every Person so holding, or affirming after the said Queen's Decease, shall forfeit all their Lands, and Goods.</q> But as for the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth. that will help them least of all; for it appears by the Statute it self, that the Treason thereby Enacted, could only arise from thence, and extend no farther than the Persons therein menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; nor is the Succession of the Crown in a right line setled or confirmed by this Statute, but the clear contrary; since King <hi>Henry</hi> had Power by this Statute to bequeath the Crown by his last Will and Testament, under his Seal and Sign Manual; which he afterwards actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally took upon him to do; so that the Law still continues as it did before that Act of <hi>Edward</hi> the IVth. you now mentioned was made, since it is declared by that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed Act of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIth. I have now cited, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIth. was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55608:55"/>
unjustly deposed, and his attainder rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and consequently his Right to the Crown is thereby declared to be good and valid to all intents and purposes.</p>

               <p>I confess you have throughly convinced me in this matter, and I think it highly reasonable that it should be so; for how can we ordinary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects know to whom to pay our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, in cases of any disputes that may arise about the different Titles of Princes to the Crown, without appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some proper Judges of it; and who can these Judges be, but the great Council of the Nation, in which every person thereof is either personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly present, or vertually represented? and if this were the effect of your late Charge at our Sessions, I wonder any persons should be so malicious as to misrepresent you for a Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but pray tell me what I shall say to those Gentlemen if I happen to come again into their Company?</p>

               <p>Pray assure them from me, that I am no more a Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than themselves, and am not only for keeping up and defending the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55608:56"/>
Original Constitution of King, Lords, and Commons, and the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People; but am also for an Hereditary Monarchy by Lineal descent, by all those lawful means by which our Ancestors have maintained them, and that in all cases; except where the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Affairs, and the necessity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the Publick Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Commonwealth, have not obliged the Estates of the Kingdom se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times to take a different course when it could not be avoided without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Ruin; and, I suppose, the same Estates have still, by the very Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the same Power and Right of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the Peace and Safety of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Preservation of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Liberties, and Properties, as ever they had in all precedent times: So that granting the most that can be said, that the Convention have now exercised that ancient Power, in placing Their present Majesties on the Throne; yet this would be no more an Argument for our making a common course of it upon every Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Crown, than it would be for you when you were a Travelling upon the Road to break into any bodies ground you pleased, because you may have been forced
