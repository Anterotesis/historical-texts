            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THO' Complaints of <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Scarcity</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> are unhappily become no leſs <hi>general</hi> than <hi>lamentable,</hi> ſo that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we go, our Ears are aſſaulted with the ſad <hi>Rhetoric of Beggary,</hi> and our Eyes with deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Objects of Pity; yet it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that we rail impertinently at the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Times, ſince it is ourſelves that make them ſuch; Men, generally, by <hi>Sloth</hi> or <hi>Vanity, Pride, Negligence,</hi> or <hi>Extravagancy,</hi> twiſting thoſe <hi>Chains</hi> of Neceſſity wherein they lie <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled</hi>: wherefore, ſince Diſeaſes are not cured with our Cries, nor Miſeries redreſſed by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, let every one wipe his Eyes, and make uſe of his <hi>Head</hi> and his <hi>Hands</hi> to preſerve or recover him out of the Quagmire of Want; it being certain that, <hi>ſtill,</hi> every Man in Health and Strength may acquire a <hi>Fortune</hi> by <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Frugality,</hi> and obtain (tho' not yet a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did) a comfortable Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>The general Cauſe of Poverty is either <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs,</hi> or not <hi>Improving</hi> thoſe Talents GOD has lent us. Of the firſt kind we may reckon up.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>Gaudineſs in Apparel</hi>; and we will rank it firſt becauſe it is moſt viſible. How many do ſhipwreck their Credits, and ſcore vaſt ſums in <hi>Silkmen's, Mercers, Drapers, Taylors,</hi> or <hi>Sempſtreſſes</hi> Books, only to follow ſome fooliſh <hi>new Faſhion,</hi> and make themſelves ridiculous Apes; or, at beſt, but like the <hi>Cinnamon-tree,</hi> whoſe Bark is worth more than its Body; when a <hi>thrifty</hi> wiſe perſon can accouter himſelf with good, decent, and creditable Apparel, for Half, or a Third Part of the others Charge? Can our beſt-ſtudied <hi>Faſhionmongers</hi> tell us what uſe there is of Perriwigs of ſix, ſeven, or eight, nay twenty or thirty Pounds a Wig; or of daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Coats or Petticoats with Silver Lace?

No leſs vain is Extravagancy in ordinary <hi>Houſe keeping</hi>; the Variety of Diſhes does but oppreſs Nature and diſturb Digeſtion. The Belly never ballances Accounts: what Madneſs is it therefore to keep ſuch a Stir to gratify it; eſpeci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <item>III. <hi>Drinking,</hi> or (as they nick-name it) <hi>Good-fellowſhip,</hi> is not only a ſhrewd <hi>Drainer of the Purſe,</hi> but a great <hi>Conſumer of Time,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cauſing <hi>Neglect of Buſineſs,</hi> and many times rendering one incapable of doing any thing ſome Days after: beſides, it weakens the <hi>Body,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the <hi>Intellectuals,</hi> brings one into <hi>ill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> ruins one's <hi>Credit,</hi> and leads to a thouſand Inconveniencies; for what Folly, Miſchief, or Villainy will not a man engage in when he is drunk?</item>
               <item>IV. <hi>Courting of Women.</hi> Experienced <hi>Solomon</hi> calls a Whore a deep Ditch; and, certainly, whoever follows her Enticements, tho' his Way ſeems paved with Delight, greads the Paths of Deſtruction; and, tho' he have never ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful an Eſtate, ſhall, in a ſhort Time, find <hi>Emptineſs</hi> in his <hi>Purſe, Rottenneſs</hi> in his <hi>Bones, Horror</hi> in his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Infamy</hi> entailed on his <hi>Memory.</hi> Nor is it any other than a <hi>fooliſh Vanity</hi> to treat any Women often at <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Expences</hi>; for, if they be <hi>virtuous,</hi> they will not <hi>expect it</hi>; if otherwiſe, they do not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>V. <hi>Gaming</hi> is the Highway to <hi>Beggar's Buſh</hi>; a bewitching Vanity, that will not ſuffer a Man to keep his Money in his Pocket, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to the Hazard of a <hi>Throw,</hi> whether it ſhall continue his own or another's. I have known a <hi>poor Citizen</hi> ſo beſotted with this Itch of <hi>Shaking his Elbow,</hi> that no ſooner could he get Half a Piece, but away he muſt go, till he had played it away every Farthing; though his poor Wife and Half a Dozen ſmall Children were ready, in the mean while, to ſtarve for Want of Bread, and himſelf glad <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <item>VIII. In ſhort, whoever would <hi>thrive,</hi> muſt continually have an eye to <hi>Frugality,</hi> a Virtue that is the Root of all Liberality: for that, by retrenching all unneceſſary Expences, avoiding much Buying, continual Borrowing, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Buildings, vexatious Law-ſuits for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, chargeable Recreations, and expenſive Studies, as the Philoſopher's Stone, &amp;c. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and maintains a plentiful Eſtate, which not only renders the Owner's Life comfortable, but alſo ſerves as a Spring, whence he can ſend forth Streams of Bounty upon any neceſſary Occaſion; which Prodigality would ſoon dry up, and leave him miſerable himſelf, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to others.

Add to this a Wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Expences and Bargainings, buying, if poſſible, with Ready-money; preſerving his Credit, by <hi>keeping Touch</hi> when he appoints any Payments; Affability and an obliging Carriage to all in Matters that cannot damnify him, but to avoid all Engagements for any to his Preju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dice, nor to concern himſelf in another's Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; not to go to Law but upon Neceſſity; then firſt to take <hi>good Advice</hi> on his Caſe, and afterwards proſecute it with all imaginable <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,</hi> that ſo the Succeſs may make others afraid to contend with him unjuſtly.

'Tis the moſt <hi>critical</hi> Action of a Man's Life; not only his <hi>own</hi> Happineſs or Ruin, but his <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Poſterity</hi> are concerned in it; and ſince it can be done but <hi>once,</hi> it concerns us to conſider more than <hi>twice</hi> before we undertake it. The <hi>Fear of God, Conſent of Parents,</hi> and a <hi>Fitneſs</hi> between the Parties for each other, are requiſite: a true and mutual Affection above all Things ſhould preceed; for nothing can be a greater <hi>Torment</hi> than a loathed Bed. Yet ſince Love is a <hi>Flame,</hi> it is convenient to have <hi>Fuel</hi> of an Eſtate, leſt the <hi>Damps</hi> of Neceſſity ſhould extinguiſh it. He that weds merely for <hi>Money,</hi> turns <hi>Marriage</hi> into a <hi>Bargain</hi> and <hi>Sale,</hi> and he that marries one wholly <hi>portionleſs</hi> does the worſt of <hi>Drudgeries</hi> for nothing. I would take the Woman for her own Sake, but wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Bag or two as good Additions; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Wealth,</hi> in relation to her, as <hi>Cyphers</hi> in Arithmetic, which, though ſignifying nothing themſelves, do yet much <hi>vary</hi> the Signification of thoſe <hi>Figures</hi> wherewith they are joined.</item>

                  <p>Hereby it appears, that <hi>One Penny</hi> a Day comes to 1l. 10s. 5d. in a Year; and therefore, in 21 Years, it will come to 31l. 10s. 9d. only by the Saving thereof. But if you employ this ſo, that you may gain after the Rate of <hi>Five</hi> in the <hi>Hundred,</hi> it will amount above 43l. in the ſaid Time, which may be a good <hi>Portion</hi> for a Man's Child.</p>
