            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEing one of those Thousands to whom your Lordship's <hi>Short Discourse, concerning the Reading his Majesty's late Declaration in the Churches,</hi> hath brought Conviction and Contentment; I think it my Duty to give your Lordship my very humble and hearty Thanks, for defending so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the great Sin of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's Vicegerent; into which they might have fallen, with a World of blind Guides, had they not happily been upheld by your Lordship's <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> which is indeed very <hi>short,</hi> but withal very sufficient, for the attaining of those prudent and pious Ends, by which your Lordship was induced to Pen, and Print it.</p>
            <p>Together with my said Thanks, I humbly present Another <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> to your Lordship's Patronage and Protection, grounded upon the same Text, and the same Authority of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self unto your Lordship <hi>as an Anchor whereby to fix and hold fast your Soul, and compose your Conscience,</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) to which is added the equal Authority of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the yet greater Authority both of the <hi>Precept</hi> and the <hi>Example</hi> of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and by his Apostles, hath made Obedience to <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and most especially to the <hi>Supream,</hi> in whatsoever he commands which God does no where forbid, a principal Doctrine of the Gospel; A Fundamental of Christianity; A great Essential to all Religion; And (I crave leave to add,) the very greatest <hi>Characteristick,</hi> whereby a <hi>Genuine</hi> Son of our most Holy Mother, <hi>The Church of England,</hi> is to be known; even our <hi>Heartiness of Submission to every Ordinance of man</hi> and that as well <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> for <hi>the Lord</hi>'s <hi>sake,</hi> as for <hi>our own</hi>; not only for <hi>fear of wrath,</hi> but <hi>for</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>Conscience sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why <hi>I</hi> chuse to call this a principal Doctrine of the Gospel, a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental of Christianity, and the great Essential to all Religion, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> seem to my self to have so many and great Reasons, that if they were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52727:3"/>
every where urged and laid to Heart, (especially by the Parties who are the least aware of them, but most concern'd to take them in,) they might suffice to put an end to those numerous Schisms and Part-takings, which now do threaten to put an end to our whole Religion. Your Lordship knows better than I, that the Doctrine of Obedience to God's Vicegerent upon Earth, is certainly the aptest of any other, (next to That of our Obedience to <hi>God Himself,</hi> whereof This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is a most necessary Part too,) <hi>to keep the Vnity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace</hi>: and to congregate into one Body the most disjoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and scattered Members in Church, and State. A Doctrine laid for this purpose by <hi>God the Father</hi> from the Foundation of the World, and that in the Law of the first Creation. A Doctrine propagated by <hi>Moses,</hi> as taught by God to teach others. A Doctrine perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Christ,</hi> as by <hi>the Wisdom</hi> of <hi>the Father,</hi> who pray'd his Followers might <hi>be One,</hi> even <hi>as his Father and He were One</hi>: which yet without Obedience to this very Doctrine can never be. A Doctrine inculcated and inforced by <hi>God the Holy Ghost,</hi> as by <hi>The Spirit</hi> of <hi>Love and Meekness,</hi> of <hi>Peace and Vnion.</hi> A Doctrine extended to all Authority upon Earth, not only Regal in the first Place, but Ecclesiastical in the second. A Doctrine in absolute Opposition to the Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> because to the <hi>Hildebrandine</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Deposing Kings,</hi> and <hi>freeing Subjects from their Allegiance,</hi> and so <hi>Authenticating Rebellion</hi> against God himself in his Vicegerents. To summ up all, in a Word, There is not a Doctrine in all the Gospel, either more <hi>earnestly,</hi> or more <hi>assiduously,</hi> either more <hi>plainly,</hi> or more <hi>expressly</hi> prescribed to us, (and that under the pain of Damnation too,) than That of our <hi>Vniform Obedience</hi> to <hi>all that are over us in Authority,</hi> and above All, to <hi>the Supream,</hi> from whom all inferiour and subordinate Authority is derived. I say to <hi>All</hi>; not only to the <hi>Best,</hi> (<hi>the Good and Gentle</hi>) but as well to the <hi>Worst,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.18.</note> and most <hi>Froward</hi> Governours.</p>
            <p>For with your Lordship's Approbation, I beg leave to say, It is not only most <hi>foolishly,</hi> but most <hi>nefariously</hi> pretended, (and that by some in these Dregs of Time, acted by that unclean <hi>Spirit,</hi> which now is every where <hi>working in the Children of Disobedience,</hi> that the Piety, or Impiety; the Religion, or Irreligion of them that are over us in the Lord, can either widen or contract our <hi>Divine Obligation</hi> to strict Obedience. For never was any Incarnate Devil more incomparably impious than those Emperours of <hi>Rome, Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> whom yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> commanded their Followers to obey, and obey'd themselves. For <hi>Obedience</hi> to God's Anointed being of <hi>Divine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52727:3"/>
Right,</hi> strongly founded upon the Will, and the Word of God, and even a Part of our <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>God Himself,</hi> (whilst it is paid to that Authority which God has commanded us to pay an Obedience to,) cannot possibly be due to the <hi>Men, as Men,</hi> or <hi>to the Good, as they are Good</hi>; but to the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> or <hi>Masters, reduplicativè,</hi> as they are <hi>Such.</hi> 'Tis due to the Governors, <hi>as they are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> and <hi>as the Ordinance of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1, 2.</note> let their Practices and Opinions be what they will.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I wish some of our Clergy would pay at least as much Obedience to our present most Gracious and Rightful Sovereign, as they paid (when time was,) to a most Scandalous Usurper; when there lay an <hi>Exception</hi> to their Obedience, <hi>Due to God, rather than Man.</hi> But this Exception makes strongly for your Lordship's irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable <hi>Discourse,</hi> and now for mine in Pursuance of it: and that by Virtue of the Old Axiome, <hi>Exceptio firmat Regulam in non exceptis.</hi> So that by this Rule and Reason, that when God and his Deputies do stand in Competition for our Obedience, God must have our whole <hi>Active,</hi> and his Deputies our <hi>Passive</hi> Obedience only; It cannot but follow, that when our Governours are <hi>Rightful,</hi> and do only <hi>command</hi> what <hi>God does no where forbid,</hi> or do only <hi>forbid</hi> what <hi>God does no where command us, There</hi> we must obey God, <hi>by</hi> obeying Man: there being no other way of paying God our Obedience in such a Case. For there our <hi>Governour</hi>'s Command is the Command of <hi>God</hi> also. There the very same Command which is <hi>immediately Humane,</hi> is also <hi>mediately Divine.</hi> Seeing we <hi>There</hi> are commanded by <hi>That</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon Earth, which in the Old and New Testament God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to obey. Nor is there <hi>any one Duty,</hi> belonging to us, as <hi>Men,</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> which God is pleased to make a stricter provision for: we are no more commanded to <hi>fear God,</hi> than to <hi>honour the King</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Pet 2.17.</note> as your Lordship most loyally and most religiously observes, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) nor are we more forbidden <hi>to worship Idols,</hi> than to <hi>resist</hi> or <hi>disobey God's Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> upon Earth.</p>
            <p>This (my Lord) I do the rather insist upon, in my common conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Men abus'd by these Times, because I am of Opinion with the Learned and Reverend Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in his <hi>Seasonable Treatise,</hi> for <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> (more seasonable <hi>now</hi> than when 'twas first print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that <hi>to reproach and vilifie Government</hi> (much more fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

without Valiant Leaders and Force of Arms. Nor can I any more separate the <hi>Sin of Disobedience,</hi> from some Degree of <hi>Resistance</hi> of God's Vicegerent, than I can separate <hi>Resistance</hi> from <hi>Rebellion against the Gospel,</hi> or a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Damnation</hi> from either of them.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I observe, the Lords Commissioners for Ecclesiastical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, (who are not less able to judge of things than their Inferiours) do call a wilful <hi>Omission or Neglect</hi> of Dispersing and Reading <hi>the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a manifest Contempt</hi> of <hi>his Majesty's Authority Royal.</hi> An Assertion very dreadful, in my Opinion. For a manifest contempt of Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, link'd with an Obstinate Contumacious fomenting Jealousies and divisions, is such a Monster, that the least Errour of Judgment which had been <hi>Venial</hi> in it self, is by these Aggravations made <hi>great</hi> and <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>; and contracts unto itself as well a <hi>diabolical,</hi> as <hi>damning</hi> Quality.</p>
            <p>The following <hi>short Discourse</hi> upon your Lordship's well-chosen Text, may not unfitly be called a <hi>Sermon</hi>; though never preached in any Pulpit, or in any particular Congregation, either by the Author of it, or by any other Person he ever heard of: but only from the Press to all in general, who may stand in need of such a Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from Disloyalty, in times of Trial, and Temptation.

So that however our present Soveraign may be and continue a Roman Catholick, he cannot possibly be a <hi>Papist</hi> (in the true Notion of the Word) whilst his Royal Declaration does stand in Force, and affords Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to all sorts of <hi>Haereticks,</hi> (as the rigid Papalins make bold to call us.) All Recusants and Dissenters are but <hi>permitted.</hi> We alone are <hi>allowed,</hi> who are of the truly Catholick, and Apostolick Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereof our late gracious King had so transcendent an Esteem, for her Faithfulness and Abhorrence of all the <hi>Hildebrandine</hi> Doctrines in all degrees, that He thought fit to say to the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> University waiting on him at <hi>New-Market, Sept.</hi> 18. 1681. That <hi>He would constantly own and defend the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as

established by Law.</hi> Giving them this for his Reason, <hi>that there is no other Church in the World, that taught and practised Loyalty so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously, as that did.</hi> Your Lordship's Assertion is tantamount to it, in the 15<hi>th. Page</hi> of your Discourse, and from <hi>Both</hi> I make this Inference; That they who will not obey the King, in whatsoever he commands, which God does no where forbid, are <hi>No true Sons of the true Church of</hi> England, let their Professions and <unclear>Pretences</unclear> be what they will. And if God shall ever permit our ever dear though dread Soveraign, to be provoked out of his Patience, by the Undutifulness of Subjects, (to whom his sacred Majesty hath been the most muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and meritorious,) to the hazarding of <hi>Truth and Peace among us, They will have much to answer for</hi> (to use your Lordship's own Words <hi>p.</hi> 13.) <hi>who shall have been the Authors of it.</hi> But the great and good God of Heaven and Earth, in whose Hand the King's Heart is, will never suffer him (I believe) through any the greatest provocations, to violate his Promises to the established Church of <hi>England.</hi> And as our late King of blessed Memory, in his said <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Speech</hi> at <hi>New-Market</hi> to that most Learned University, <hi>Bid them all be assured that he would never break his Word, notwithstanding whatever Representation either had or should be made of him to the contrary</hi>; So, what ever unworthy Jealousies others may have of our present King, and his gracious Promises; yet long Experience being my Mistress to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me by all Injoyments of the King's Truth and Generosity, I do protest unto your Lordship, that could I possibly be <hi>willing,</hi> I should not be <hi>able</hi> to distrust him.</p>
            <p>My Lord, when I observed the different Judgments, of <hi>Seven</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops on one side, and <hi>Six</hi> of another, I stood pendulous for a time between <hi>Six</hi> and <hi>Seven</hi>; like an hovering Piece of Iron between two Loadstones; But after due Deliberation, (like that of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>p.</hi> 4.) I thus determin'd within my self, That supposing (though not granting) <hi>Both</hi> sides to be <hi>Erroneous,</hi> it would concern me, (if I must err) to err as <hi>safely</hi> as might be possible;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of <hi>Two</hi> supposed Evils to take the <hi>Least.</hi> If (thought I) the <hi>Six</hi> Bishops are in an Errour, their Errour is on the <hi>Right hand,</hi> because on the side of strict Obedience to the <hi>Lord's</hi> Vicegerent, <hi>for the Lord's sake,</hi> though in a <hi>doubtful,</hi> or <hi>undue</hi> Instance. But if the <hi>Seven</hi> Bishops are in an Errour, their Errour is on the <hi>Left hand,</hi> because on the side of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God's Vicegerent, (not for the Lord's, but) for the Law of the Land's sake, as all but <hi>the Iudges</hi> and <hi>other great Lawyers</hi> do expound it. Now this <hi>Left handed</hi> Errour (if an Errour) is an

Errour with a Witness; and like <hi>Sinon's Trojan Horse</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Aeneid</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> carries an Army of Destroyers within its Bowels, and endangers the very <hi>Palladium</hi>; after the Loss of which Security, <hi>Down goes our</hi> Troy: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> grounds Obedience to the <hi>Higher Powers among Men,</hi> upon their being <hi>all of God,</hi> not only <hi>permitted,</hi> but <hi>ordained of God,</hi> and thence infers, That <hi>whosoever resisteth the Power,</hi>

            <p>Hence, (My Lord) I took my final Resolution, to follow my King, with my Obedience, through thick and thin, <hi>usque ad Aras,</hi> though not a whit farther. And rather to mark the unerring Judgments of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of those great Divines, now with God, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> (two the most exact <hi>Casuists</hi> in all the World) and now at last of your Lordship also; than the more obnoxious Judgments of all the other Bishops of <hi>Christendom,</hi> which are, or shall be. I do expect to be a <hi>Sufferer</hi> from the one side, or the other, at least of Obloquy and Railing, (<hi>for hereunto we are appointed,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21.) But my Study is for <hi>whom,</hi> and for <hi>what</hi> to suffer. If I suffer for <hi>doing well,</hi> from the Sons and Daughters of Disobedience, I suffer <hi>wisely,</hi> and as a <hi>Christian</hi>; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> does assure me, <hi>This is acceptable with God,</hi> (v. 20.) yea, <hi>This is Thank wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> (v. 19.) But if I suffer for a scandalous Recalcitration and Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God's Vicegerent, and follow a Multitude into the Pit, I only suffer as a <hi>Fool,</hi> and an <hi>Evil Doer.</hi> And for all that shall follow, must <hi>thank my self</hi>; am not worthy of Thanks from God, seeing, I would not (like the <hi>Israelites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7.) <hi>That God himself should reign over</hi> me by his Vicegerent.</p>
            <p>Now that God will ever bless, and reward your Lordship for your Loyalty, with a Continuance of the Blessings you now enjoy, even the Blessings in the Left and in the Right Hand of Wisdom, Riches, and Honour, and Length of Days, is, and shall be ever the Vote and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of</p>
