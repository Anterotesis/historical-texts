            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>Reverend Sirs</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Do ſeriouſly account it a part of my infelicity to ſee the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and diviſions among us touching the Worſhip of Almighty God, and his holy Child Jeſus, whom I truſt we do all love and fear, and therefore it is the greater pitty that we who differ not about the Godhead, ſhould at all differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things which pertain to his bleſſed Service. May it therefore pleaſe God to move upon all our hearts to conſider (laying aſide all carnal intereſt) where the cauſes on either ſide are given. And ſith, perhaps we are more quick ſighted about each others miſtakes then our own, give me leave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, to ſhew briefly what I conceive is really amiſs on your part, and I ſhall as willingly conſider what may fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be objected concerning us againſt that confideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, when I look upon your <hi>reformation</hi> from Papall errors, I cannot but heartily congratulate the piety and zeal of your Martyrs, &amp;c. Specially in their being inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to bring that ſacred inſtitute of the <hi>Lords Table</hi> from under manifold corruptions wherewith it had been incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in the darkneſs of Popery: But yet withall I muſt needs condole their ſhortneſs in not looking with like diligence to the Priſtine Inſtitution of ſacred Baptiſm, by which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight we which ſurvive them, are the more expoſed to our preſent diſtractions, and I think I may ſay in this, as <hi>David</hi> in another caſe, becauſe they did it not at the firſt therefore the Lord made a breach upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:107507:3"/>
Secondly, when I conſider the articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I think it very ſtrange that we who agree ſo firmly in them all ſave three or four, and differ but in ſome points touching them neither, ſhould not conſider of ſome expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to remove what obſtructs our intire agreement.</p>
                  <p>May it therefore pleaſe your Biſhops, with their Brethren, to admit of a friendly conference with our Biſhops and Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, to try if by any means away may be found to bring us to brotherly concord, for whatſoever hath happened in the heat of diſputation, or fallen from the Pens of paſſionate Writers on eitherſide, yet be pleaſed to know, we are no haters of the pious Proteſtant, but ſincere lovers of them and the truths by them maintain'd, as indeed we ought to be of all who love Chriſt, though differing from us in many things. And though it is true we hold a ſeparation from you in our Congregations, yet we do this of neceſſity, becauſe none among your Leaders will treat with us about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of thoſe things which do offend.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, to reform what is amiſs on your part touching ſacred Baptiſm is a difficult undertaking, yet not more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then it was to reform what was amiſs in the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether we conſider their errors, who for ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, gave it to Infants, or theirs who by their tranſubſtantiation changed the very nature of the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if no endeavouts of this kind muſt be admitted, then am I out of hopes ever to ſee Chriſtian concord among us, for thoſe coercive ways (which ſome incline to) will but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the breach (which is too great already) &amp; render your cauſe the more ſuſpitious, and conſequently more confirm us in our perſwaſion againſt your way. Now the Lord himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us all to the way of truth and peace in all things;</p>

                  <p>DIſputation is not more hurtful when needleſs, then profitable when neceſſity calls for it. And hereupon our Lord Chriſt himſelf was frequent in diſputes about his Doctrine. This way went the Apoſtles to try the matter in Queſtion about Circumciſion, <hi>Acts 15.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> defended Chriſtianity by diſputing dayly in the School of one <hi>Tyrannus Acts 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The occaſion of the diſpute at <hi>Blyton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> September 18. 1673.</hi> was on this wiſe. A ſmall remnant of baptized Chriſtians meeting in that Town, it pleaſed Mr. <hi>Fort</hi> Miniſter of the Perochial Congregation there, to come to their Meetings, and to hinder their proceedings, ſo that they could not edifie one another, as their manner was. And this he did many times, and told them he was reſolved they ſhould not meet in that Town. And when the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> endeavoured to maintain their principles, he ſlighted them, ſaying they were fooliſh Men not fit to diſcourſe of religion becauſe they underſtood not the rules of Logick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he bad them find him a Man that had Brains, and underſtood the Languages, and knew Logick and he would diſpute with him. They told him they had few that underſtood theſe things. But he not ceaſing to diſturb them they conſented to his motion, and a day was appointed, and becauſe the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> had not a convenient place, Mr. <hi>Fort</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a large room, and ſent for them to come thither, where himſelf with two other Miniſters and divers of the Neighbourhood were met togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For the account of the diſpute it ſelf, take this information that much of it is here reported according to what Memory could ſerve in upon recogitation, but yet be aſſured of this that for ſubſtance it is not altered by this account, the arguments varying very little, or not at all from the very terms wherein they were expreſſed in the Diſpute, and Mr. <hi>Fort's</hi> anſwers, rendred rather more advantagious, then in their firſt delivery.</p>
                  <p>If it ſeem ſtrange that a Perſon of ſuch Learning and Gravity, ſhould anſwer and argue with no more advantage to his cauſe, the Reader may take notice that God hath ſaid, <hi>He will confound the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and bring to nought the underſtanding of the Prudent</hi> And when he doth this, then where is the Scribe, where is the Diſputer of this World.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas in this Diſpute <hi>I</hi> have uſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Finally, my hearts deſire and prayer to God, is, that though our preſent differences in Religion, be matter of infelicity, yet ſith we all agree, that Chriſtianity is the only true Religion in the world, that we therefore may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>SIR, I ſuppoſe that you are come hither to defend ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Meetings in this place which I have laboured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, now that which I have to charge them with is this: That their Meetings are unlawful. 2. That their way of Anabaptiſm is ſinful, And 3. I will prove that our way of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants is lawful.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I came not hither to defend any Mans ſayings or doings, but to vindicate the truth of the Goſpel (as much as in me is) ſo far as I am concerned, and for Anabaptiſm I am againſt it as much as you, nor do I think it needful to diſpute about the baptizing of Infants till ſome body be found to baptiſe them, for I think that there is no Man in <hi>England</hi> that baptiſeth any Infants.</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen, you have no cauſe to laugh as yet, for I ſay (and ſhall

                     <p>Gentlemen, this doth not become the gravity of your Perſons, did you come hither to make ſport? But becauſe you make this ſo ſtrange, give me leave to put you in mind of the Apoſtles ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>This is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> and yet the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did celebrate the Lords Supper as they ſuppoſed in the Bread and Wine which they ſet apart, but going from the Inſtitution of Chriſt, the Apoſtle denies it to be the Lords Supper. I therefore ſay you do not baptiſe at all, becauſe you have loſt the Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Fort.</hi>

                     <p>I am not ſo much a ſtranger to the Meetings you ſpeak of, but I think they may be defended, but yet I ſuppoſe it the beſt way to try our principles, for if they be good, our Meetings to promote good principles need not offend you, and truly till this day, I did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that our Meetings ſhould be the ſubject of our Diſpute.</p>

John</hi> baptiſed in <hi>Enon</hi> becauſe there was much water there. <hi>Phillip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> went both down into the water.

                     <p>I mean a thing to be laughed at, and put the caſe you had occaſion to waſh your hands only, would it not be ridiculous to ſee you go into the River to do it? even does thus your pretended way of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing, render the way of Chriſt ridiculous and reflects diſhonour on him and his followers, as if they were not ſo wiſe as you, to know the beſt way to be baptized, but we are reſolved to follow Chriſt though we differ from you.</p>

                     <p>I ſhew the contrary thus, your way of baptiſing admits of as many ſeveral ways, as there are parts in a mans body; for whether the Fore-head, the Breaſt, Back, Hand or Foot, or ſome other part ought to be only ſprinkled, or whether any of theſe may not ſerve, you can ſhew no reaſon, ſo that you thus bring confuſion into the Church:</p>

                  <p>But chiefly my aim is, to move, if it may be, the learned Authour, to conſider how much he injures the Cauſe he manages againſt the Papiſts, with ſo much Judgement and Learning, whilſt he endeavours to ſupport his Traditional <hi>Infant Sprinkling</hi> (for Baptiſm it is not) which being allowed, other innovations of Popery, or other Sects will certainly be ſupported together with it, as having the ſame grounds, and in ſome reſpect fairer pretences to obtrude upon the Church of God, from all which errours let her be delivered, by the protection of the Almighty, to whoſe grace I comit thee.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That the ground of the circumciſion of Proſelites was fetched from the end of the inſtitution, is not true. And indeed had it been left to that, Mens various conceits about the ends of ſuch inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions might have made as ill work, as we ſee yours do now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore the wiſdom of God to prevent thoſe dangers, gave expreſs order in that caſe as appears, Gen 17. 13. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 44. 48. <hi>And when a ſtranger ſhall ſojourn with thee, and will keep the Paſſeover, let all his Males be circumciſed, and</hi> verſe 49, <hi>One Law ſhall be to him that is home born, and unto the ſtrager that ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth among you.</hi>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:107507:17"/>
Thus we ſee the Law is as expreſs for the circumciſing Proſelites and their males, as for <hi>Iſrael</hi> themſelves <hi>Diodate</hi> alſo expounds the firſt place by the ſecond (The ſervant that is born) <hi>meaning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Proſelite who of his own free will ſhall add himſelf to the Church by the profesſion of Gods true worſhip.</hi>

                  <p>Not from ſome ends only (and thoſe too only which we pleaſe) as Dr. <hi>S</hi> doth unadviſedly teach, for ſo there would be no Man, or but very few, but might be brought to Baptiſm, or other ordinances, ſeeing they are capable of ſeveral things ſignified therein, as the death of Chriſt for the ſins of the world and his Reſurection, by which all ſhall riſe again; and whether they believe it or no, yet he is the Lord that bought them, and a mediator between God and them, that his long-ſuffering might lead them to repentance</p>
                  <p>Wherefore your inſtance of our Saviours being baptiſed without repentance avails you nothing, unleſs you were a le to prove a ſpecial caſe to be a general rule for the practiſe of ordinances, which yet you cannot but know is pernicious many ways, nor can you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally believe that becauſe Chriſt who was no ſinner was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized without repentance, that therefore you muſt baptiſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners without repentance alſo; if otherwiſe, then why may not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be admitted to the Lords Table without ſelf examination, ſeeing Chriſt did partake of it without ſelf examination, having no need to do ſo? certainly though Chriſt did this it ſhall never
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107507:18"/>
be demonſtrated that the Members of his Church may do it without ſelf examination, and yet thus went the matter in old time for hundreds of years together, ſo true is the maxim admit one abſurdity and more will follow.</p>
                  <p>But to make an end of this, its evident: Chriſt in being baptiſed did his duty to God, and had he not been baptiſed he had not fulfilled all righteouſneſs; Let it now be ſhewed that it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s the duty of infants to be baptiſed, or that they or any body elſe commits ſin in refuſing infant baptiſm, and then we ſhall ſtand upon no further capacity on their part nor oppoſe this inſtance as to the end for which it is brought but till this be done we juſtly reject ſuch Argumentation.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it true, that what we ſay of the incapacity of infants <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reflects upon the wiſdom of God in appointing circumciſion for infants, for Gods command made them fit ſubjects for it, together with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the covenant which he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his, according to the fleſh, which covenant he alſo ordained to be in their Fleſh by circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. Now therefore when it ſhall appear, that the covenant of the Goſpel, (I mean it, as eſtabliſhed by Chriſt in his Church) is made with any Man and his ſeed according to the Flesh, and that God hath required the Goſpel covenant should be in their Flesh by baptiſm, and ſo every infant born of them, or ſervant bought with Money to be baptiſed we shall then grant that to inſiſt on the incapacity of infants would reflect upon the wiſdom of God, but ſith this neither is, nor can be done, all theſe pretended reflections falls really upon Dr. S. for denying infants the Lords Supper, becauſe of their incapacity, who yet were admitted to the Paſſeover, of which they were as uncapable as of the Lords Table.</p>
                  <p>What the Dr. ſays further <hi>of the ends of baptiſm to repreſent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the nature of the grace of the Goſpel and to confirm the truth of the covenant on Gods part:</hi> We have conſidered before, and to what you here add, ſaying, <hi>It inſtates the partakers of it in the priviledges of the Church of God,</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>That though the Dr. ſpeaks right according to the right adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of baptiſm, yet according to his way of infant baptiſm it is not ſo, ſeeing we all know, infants (while ſuch) though ſprinkled have no more priviledge in your Church then thoſe who are not ſprinkled, for the priviledges next following baptiſm, is to be taught to obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt commanded, and to continue in fellowship with the Church in breaking of Bread and prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 42. <hi>Ma.</hi> 28. 20. Now
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107507:18"/>
to tell us that infants are inſtated in theſe things, and yet whilſt infants have nothing at all to do with them is too groſs a vanity. For,</p>
                  <p>If you ſay they are inſtated in theſe priviledges upon future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance, Faith and newneſs of Life according to the Goſpel, I anſwer when this comes to paſs they are no infants, nor as infants partake of theſe priviledges, but as thoſe that are now the Sons of God by faith, and thus truly all infants are inſtated in Church privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as ſoon as born, ſeeing by the death of Chriſt they have a right upon the conditions of the Goſpel when capable to perform them, thus you miſlead the world with a ſpecious pretence of inſtating their infants in Church priviledges, when 'tis only an empty ſound of words.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Jews</hi> Infants as they were inſtated in the priviledges of their Church, by circumiſion, ſo they entred upon the enjoyment of their priviledges in infancy, appearing by Gods commandment three times a year in the Temple with the offerings accuſtomed and to partake of the Paſſeover, with the congregation or family where it was eaten.</p>
                  <p>The Dr. ſaith, <hi>nothing can ſeem wanting of the ends of Baptiſm</hi> (in reſpect of Infants) <hi>but that which ſeems moſt cerimonial which is the perſonal reſtipulation, which yet may reaſonably be ſupplyed by Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That there is much wanting beſide this reſtipulation in your infant baptiſm is shewed before, and it is unadviſedly ſaid that the reſtipulation of the perſon baptiſed is the moſt ceremonial thing in baptiſm, ſeeing it is the moral and ſubſtantial part being indeed our covenanting with God and in truth the external washing is far more ceremonial as appears 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. And for your ſaying that the perſonal reſtipulation in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may be reaſonably ſupplyed by Godf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And though the Dr. conſider never ſo much what apprehenſions the Apoſtles had concerning the Church ſtate of ſuch as were in external Covenant with God, yet he cannot rationally imagine that <hi>they ſhould meaſure the ſtate of the Goſpel Churches by the reaſon of the Covenant which God made with the</hi> Jews <hi>and their Seed according to the fleſh.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is expreſly ſaid <hi>from henceforth,</hi> to wit from the vanishing of the old Covenant, <hi>know we no Man after the fleſh—But</hi> now <hi>if any Man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature.</hi> And now Men are not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Church becauſe they are <hi>Abraham</hi>

part whereof by all experience are wicked perſons yea in thoſe very Nations, which Men pretend to have made into churches of Chriſt of which would God <hi>England</hi> were not ſo full an evidence as it is this day.</p>
                  <p>The Dr. grants that the order of words Mat. 28, 19. (Teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions baptiſing them) was neceſſary for thoſe who were then to be proſelited to Chriſtianity. And we ſay they are as neceſſary for the generations following, who have as much need of true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the firſt principles of Chriſtianity in order to their being Chriſtians, as them that went before, and it is a pernitious alteration of the order of Chriſts commiſſion, to out-run it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s direction ſo, as to make perſons to be Chriſtians, before they do or can know the leaſt title of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The caſe which the Dr. puts, about going to Diſciple the Indians Baptiſing them, is not at all rational, but upon the pre-ſuppoſition, that the perſon ſo doing, to have ſeen or known them, that gives him his authority to Baptiſe infants, and then indeed it's rational to ſuppoſe ſuch a Perſon would not underſtand that the words, Diſciple the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Baptiſing them, would exclude infants. But yet I muſt alſo ſay, that his ground to believe ſo could not ariſe from the words themſelves but from the practice preſuppoſed. Wherefore the Apoſtles having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to teach all Nations Baptiſing them, without the leaſt knowledge of any Infants Baptized by any Baptiſts which were before them, or from whom they received their authority, here is no place for the Drs. ſuppoſitions at all.</p>
                  <p>As little cauſe hath he to think that had any one ſaid to <hi>Abraham</hi> he that believeth and is circumciſed ſhall be ſaved, it ought ſo to have been interpreted, as that infants ought to be circumcized. For if this had been all the rule given for circumciſion, it muſt of neceſſity have been limited to ſuch as believe only, and unleſs the Dr. know how from good ground to ſatisfie his conſcience, that Infants are believers of that which is taught or Preached according to <hi>Mark</hi> 16. (which place he aludes unto) he muſt ſo limit the diverſion for baptiſing. But if indeed he take Infants to be ſuch believers, then he is anſwered by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Let. of Reſol. p. 297. who ſaith, as for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether Infants have faith? I profeſs my ſelf to be none of thoſe who are concerned in it.

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:107507:20"/>
The concluſion therefore is, ſith in the caſe you put, the word (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) cannot concern infants, and that they muſt be deemed capable of Salvation, though they believe not, it is every way ſafe to think them unconcern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That if it had been Chriſts intention to exclude Infants, there had been far greater reaſon for an expreſs prohibition then for an expreſs command, if his intention were to admit them, becauſe this was ſuitable to the general grounds of Gods diſpenſation among them before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, Here is little ſaid but what hath been anſwered before, and may be anſwered by ſaying, had it been Chriſts intention that infants ſhould not be admitted to the Lords Table there had been more need of an expreſs prohibition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then of an expreſs command, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe ſuitable to Gods diſpenſations among them before. Thus <hi>Argumentum ad hominem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I anſwer further, it is dangerous arguing to our preſent right to Sacraments, from Gods diſpenſations among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeing the ſtate of the Church, and the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>penſation is ſo much altered as that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was but carnal, in reſpect of the Spirituality of the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Dr. ſaith, <hi>it is very hard to conceive that the Apoſtles thought Infants excluded by Chriſt, when after Chriſts aſcention they looked upon themſelves bound to obſerve the Jewiſh Cuſtomes, even when they had baptized many thouſands,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, It is ill ſaid that the Apoſtles were bound to obſerve any ſuch Jewiſh Cuſtomes becauſe of any ſuitableneſs between them and things under the Goſpel (which is the mark you ought to hit or you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) but the reaſon why they did obſerve ſuch Cuſtomes for a time, was the weakneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and we find the Apoſtles did as ſpeedily put a period to ſuch Cuſtomes as they could <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. to 32. <hi>Acts</hi> 1645. which clearly ſhews <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtomes was not ſuitable to things under the Goſpel, and here circumciſion one of the chief of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> rites, is clearly aboliſhed among the reſt, ſo that a man would think infant baptiſm ſhould never have been built upon it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Dr ſaith <hi>If admiſſion of infants to Baptiſm were a meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of judaiſm, it ſeems ſtrange that none of the judaizing Chriſtians ſhould be charged with it; who yet are charged with the obſervation of other judaical r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But great is this truth of believers baptiſm, and will ſtand notwithſtanding the injury done by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> for it was no jewiſh rite, the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins was from Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 25. and the Phariſees who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Anſwer, Since the falſe Apoſtles was ſo earneſt to have the chriſtians circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their children, it's ſtrange that none of the true Apoſtles could or would quiet them by ſaying inſtead of infant circumciſion you have infant baptiſm if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there had been any ſuch thing practiced, For, this way went the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to ſtill them, vvhen they would have brought the believers themſelves under circumſion, <hi>Col.</hi> two.
