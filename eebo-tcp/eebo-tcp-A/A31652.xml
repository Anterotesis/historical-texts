            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is hardly that Man living, but has some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for <hi>PAINTING,</hi> and that does not even pretend sufficient Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to controll the <hi>Works</hi> which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces: for not only <hi>Learned men,</hi> and persons of <hi>Condition,</hi> who are ever probably the most rational, are emulous of this Knowledge; but the very <hi>Common-People</hi> will adventure to spend their Judgements too; so as it seems, this Art is in some sort, the <hi>Vniversal Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is this presumption a Vice peculiar to the French alone, or of this
<pb facs="tcp:58393:3"/>
Age of ours only; 'tis as old as <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it selfe, and sprung from her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cradle in <hi>Greece.</hi> This is evident by that which <hi>Pliny</hi> has recorded of <hi>Apelles</hi>; who before he gave the last touches to his <hi>Pieces,</hi> was wont to expose them in <hi>Publique</hi> to the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of all the <hi>Passengers,</hi> whilst he conceal'd himselfe behind them, that he might hear what every one said, and make use of it accordingly; whence the Proverb, <hi>Apelles post Tabulam.</hi> Most of our <hi>Painters</hi> do to this day observe something of this very <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> or at least, something like it, but which they have turn'd into a kind of <hi>Complement</hi>: For they usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest such as have the Curiosity to visit their <hi>Works,</hi> freely to tell them what they <hi>think</hi> of them; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they observe any thing which needs <hi>reforming.</hi> But as <hi>Complements</hi> are but vain and insignificant <hi>words,</hi> they seldom produce any real <hi>Effects</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58393:3"/>
upon these encounters; and to speak sincerely, these <hi>Painters</hi> would be but justly punish'd, should one really take the liberty of effectually rendring them this friendly Office, which they ask but in Ceremony, and that instead of those ordinary compliances with which they usually flatter them, they did ingeniously discover to them their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable failings. But instead of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this <hi>Instruction</hi> in good part, and gratifying the <hi>Censure</hi> as becomes them, they would certainly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the freedom, and we should see them rather <hi>Confounded</hi> than <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi> by it; because they do not so much seek to be <hi>Able men,</hi> as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to <hi>appear</hi> so. The days of <hi>Apelles</hi> are now past, and our Modern <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> are quite of another strain from these Old <hi>Masters,</hi> who never came to be <hi>Considerable</hi> in their <hi>Professions,</hi> but by the study of <hi>Geometrie</hi> and <hi>Perspective,</hi> the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58393:4"/>
the assiduous Observation of those <hi>Characters</hi> which expres'd the <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Emotions</hi> of the Soul; by the Lecture of the <hi>Poets</hi> and good <hi>Historians</hi>; and in fine, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>re-search</hi> of whatever might best contribute to their Instruction.</p>
            <p>They were in those days so <hi>Docile</hi> and <hi>Humble,</hi> that they not only would submit their <hi>Works</hi> to the <hi>Criticismes</hi> and <hi>Animadversion</hi> of <hi>Scholars</hi> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> but even to the <hi>Common People</hi> also, and to <hi>Artificers</hi> of all <hi>Trades,</hi> who did frequently and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times judiciously reprehend them. This was (I confess) something a tedious way, and is indeed inaccessible to a great part of our <hi>Painters</hi> in this <hi>Age,</hi> who have neither the <hi>Genius</hi> of these illustrious <hi>Antients,</hi> nor the same <hi>Object</hi> in their working.</p>
            <p>In effect, those <hi>Painters</hi> propos'd to themselves, above all other things, the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> of their <hi>Names,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58393:4"/>
for the sole, and principal <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense</hi> of their <hi>Labours</hi>; whereas, most of our <hi>Moderns,</hi> regard only the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent <hi>Profit,</hi> and therefore they hold a quite different <hi>Method,</hi> and strive as much as they can to compass only their proposed aime.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, they have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into their <hi>Cabals</hi> I know not what kind of licencious <hi>Painting,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally differing from those pretended subjections, which heretofore rendred this <hi>Art</hi> so incomparable and so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, whilst this incapacity of theirs makes them imagine, that this rare <hi>Painting</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> was but an old <hi>Dotaress,</hi> who had only slaves in her service.</p>
            <p>Under this pretext, they have dress'd themselves up a new <hi>Mistriss,</hi> trifling, and full of <hi>tattle,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing of them but <hi>Fard</hi> and <hi>Colour</hi> to take at first sight, without being at all concern'd whether she pleas'd long or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58393:5"/>See then, this <hi>Idol</hi> of the present <hi>Age,</hi> to which most of our <hi>Painters</hi> sacrifice all their Pains, whilst those of more sublime and noble Spirits, and that find themselves capable of this excellent <hi>Profession,</hi> run generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the same path, by which those renowned <hi>Antients</hi> arriv'd to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their <hi>Skill</hi>; and leaving those lazy Ignorants behind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it with as much compassion as disdain, <hi>Aulaedus sit, qui Citharaedus esse non possit,</hi> compassionating those whom <hi>Nature</hi> having deny'd those necessary <hi>Endowments</hi> of being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attain the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> are compell'd by that weakness and want of Talent, to acquiesce in the single Practise of doing Things as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically</hi> as they first learn'd them from their ignorant <hi>Masters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how despicable are those poor-spirited men, who are so affrighted at the study, that to avoid the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:58393:5"/>
of it, they chose rather to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with the revolted <hi>Cabalists,</hi> and to pull on the same hypocritical <hi>Vizor,</hi> than give themselves the trouble of acquiring, and effectually possessing the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, which they so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly affect the reputation of?</p>
            <p>What's now become of the <hi>Glory</hi> with which those antient <hi>Greeks,</hi> those Gallant souls had Crowned <hi>Painting,</hi> when they pronounc'd her <hi>Queen</hi> of all the <hi>Arts,</hi> and permitted only the most <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>renowned</hi> of men to be of her <hi>Retinues</hi>? what regard, think you, would they have to this <hi>Age</hi> of ours, which has so unworthily aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd her? and to these abject <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> who daily dishonour her by the contempt and disrespect which they put upon her <hi>Laws,</hi> and who by a yet more insufferable attempt, have resign'd her sacred <hi>Name</hi> to this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick <hi>Idol</hi> which they have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd in her place? with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<pb facs="tcp:58393:6"/>
may we suppose do true and able <hi>Painters</hi> look on the temerity of these insolent <hi>Rivals,</hi> whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold so gay and jovial in this present Age, by the <hi>Capriciousness</hi> of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and the favour of an ignorant conjuncture? I must confess, I am strangely surpriz'd at it; and though I know there is nothing less permanent, or more Caduque than this <hi>false</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, I cannot but be sensibly toucht, and even altogether impatient of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once a period to this odious <hi>Abuse,</hi> so reproachful to an <hi>Age,</hi> that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise extraordinarily flourishing in the knowledge of <hi>Letters,</hi> and of all other <hi>Sciences,</hi> which we find every day entertain'd, and more perfection'd than ever, maugre the importunate jarrs and hostilities which have unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly molested them for so many years past; nay, even <hi>Painting</hi> it self, whose <hi>deminution</hi> and <hi>decadency</hi> we so much deplore, and which seems not
<pb facs="tcp:58393:6"/>
to have been born for times of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquility,</hi> was happily never in higher esteem amongst us, nor more sought after, than it is at present; which may partly be the occasion of its Corruption and decay: For as <hi>Arts</hi> flourish, and are cherished by the Honors which are conferr'd upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Artists</hi>; so, on the contrary, a blind <hi>Affection,</hi> and indiscreet <hi>flattery</hi> ruines and destroys them.</p>
            <p>To recover then its pristine Lustre, and restore her to <hi>original Purity,</hi> we must of necessity recall that <hi>Primitive</hi> severity, by which they were wont to examine the <hi>Productions</hi> of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Painters,</hi> who were of old so esteemed; and whose <hi>Works</hi> have surviv'd their <hi>Authors</hi> so many <hi>Ages,</hi> and rendred their own Names <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To accomplish this, there is nothing more expedient, than the exact obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of those <hi>Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58393:7"/>
which consummate its <hi>Perfection,</hi> and without which 'tis imposible she should subsist.</p>
            <p>But forasmuch as the long neglect hereo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> has almost banish'd the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to the infinite loss and prejudice of those who are curious of <hi>Painting</hi>; and since, without this succour, they can never enjoy the satisfaction which a cleer and perfect understanding will present them; I have made it here my particular enquiry; that laying before them in this <hi>Dissertation</hi> the same <hi>Compass</hi> by which the <hi>Antients</hi> steer'd their <hi>Course,</hi> they may <hi>sail</hi> by the same <hi>Route</hi> themselves, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover those things to the very bottom, which they had never attain'd to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but superficially, and with much imperfection.</p>
            <p>And since I consider how extreamly difficult it is to disabuse those who are already infected with so common, and pernicious an abuse, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb facs="tcp:58393:7"/>
of a specious <hi>Liberty:</hi> I could not think it sufficient to <hi>talk</hi> of things only, and to prove them from pure and undeniable <hi>Reasons</hi>; had I not also made it appear, of what import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it is by authentique <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this effect, I have made choice of some amongst the <hi>Works</hi> of our most celebrated <hi>Painters</hi>; to which, having apply'd all those <hi>Principles</hi> which I have produced, there remains no more cause for us to suspect their Fidelity. And that I may the better and more generally comprehend the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> effects which result from them, by either <hi>observing</hi> or <hi>neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> these <hi>Rules,</hi> I shall here present them in Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raphael Vrbino,</hi> the most excellent of the <hi>Modern</hi> Painters, and universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so reputed by those of the <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> is the <hi>Person</hi> whose <hi>Works</hi> I shall propose as so many <hi>Demonstrations</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:58393:8"/>
the absolute necessity of exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the <hi>Principles</hi> which we have establish'd in this <hi>Treatise.</hi> And on the contrary, <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in <hi>Fame,</hi> but far inferior to him in <hi>Merits,</hi> shall by his extravagant <hi>Compositions,</hi> amply furnish us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Temerity</hi> of those <hi>Libertines,</hi> who trampling all the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Maximes</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> under their feet, persue only their own <hi>Caprices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in this part chiefly, that the disinteress'd <hi>Reader</hi> may possibly find my <hi>Animadversions</hi> most agreeable: But to enjoy the diversion more intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it were requisite he laid before him those <hi>Prints</hi> of <hi>Raphael</hi> which I pretend to examine and propose, as just, and regular <hi>Works,</hi> conformable to my <hi>Principles</hi>: These are the <hi>designs</hi> of the <hi>Iudgement</hi> of <hi>Paris; That</hi> of the <hi>slaughter</hi> of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> and our B. <hi>Saviours taking down from the Cross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58393:8"/>These three first <hi>Stamps,</hi> were <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven</hi> by <hi>Marc. Antonio,</hi> and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very rare and curious <hi>pieces.</hi> The <hi>Fourth</hi> is a most noble <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> usually call'd The <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Athens.</hi> The <hi>Graving</hi> is one of the best hands, nor in truth so good as the other; but the <hi>Ordonance</hi> of the <hi>Figures</hi> is much more magnificent and stately.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> wee'l con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with that representation of the <hi>Vniversal Iudgement,</hi> which has rendered him so famous amongst the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and this <hi>Work</hi> is possibly the most <hi>Numerous</hi> of <hi>Figures</hi> that was ever painted; as it is likewise in my opinion, the most copious <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> that can be propos'd to disabuse those who have the <hi>Name</hi> of this <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> in so great veneration, that they commonly admire whatsoever is his, with so strange a preoccupation of their <hi>Iudgements,</hi> as to preferr even
<pb facs="tcp:58393:9"/>
the very <hi>Abuse</hi> which is in <hi>Vouge,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Reason</hi> her self, and dare not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that with <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> to which they manifestly incline without her.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I am not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so blind, nor scrupulous; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other <hi>design</hi> then to investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and find out the <hi>Truth</hi>; and I hope that the <hi>Research's</hi> which I have endeavoured to make after her in the following <hi>discourse,</hi> may be according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received of all who are real <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Painting</hi>; as for the approbation of the <hi>Cabalists,</hi> despise them perfectly.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Friend of mine, who Fortun'd to see this <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> whilst I was writing <hi>it,</hi> understanding that it was my intention to <hi>Publish</hi> it, and that my principal design was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to the view of the <hi>Court;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd me of certain obscure <hi>Italian Terms,</hi> which I had made use of in my <hi>Discourse;</hi> the understanding of which would doubtless be very difficult to many, who were not acquainted with that <hi>Tongue;</hi> and that one should strive to
<pb facs="tcp:58393:10"/>
render things as clear and intelligible to the <hi>Reader</hi> as was possible. And truly, though I conceiv'd the <hi>Counsel</hi> was but reasonable, it gave me a great deal of trouble; nor was I able to find out <hi>words</hi> which were <hi>purely</hi> ours, capable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press those <hi>Barbarismes,</hi> which <hi>Custome</hi> has as it were naturaliz'd amongst our <hi>Painters:</hi> And therefore I was resolv'd to <hi>retrench</hi> as many of them as I could, especially, the least necessary. But for the <hi>rest</hi> which really are proper <hi>Tearms</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> I believ'd it would be sufficient to make an <hi>explanation</hi> of them for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction</hi> of those who are <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> and that would discourse of the <hi>Art</hi> like <hi>Knowing</hi> Persons with <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>Profession.</hi>

as to the <hi>decorum</hi>) was hardly exceeded for what he perform'd in <hi>Sculpture</hi> and the <hi>Statuary</hi> Art by many even of the <hi>Antients</hi> themselves, and happ'ly by none of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> witness his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Christo in gremio,</hi> and several other <hi>Figures</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; to say nothing of his Talent in <hi>Architecture,</hi> and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation the <hi>world</hi> has to his memory, for recovering many of its most <hi>useful Ornaments</hi> and <hi>Members,</hi> out of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected <hi>Fragments</hi> which lay so long bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and for vindicating that <hi>Antique</hi> and <hi>Magnificent</hi> manner of <hi>Building,</hi> from the trifling of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>

            <p>The next usual reproach of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> has been the want of <hi>judgement</hi> in <hi>perspective,</hi> and bringing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>History,</hi> then is justifiable upon one <hi>Aspect,</hi> without turning the <hi>Eye</hi> to each <hi>Figure</hi> in particular, and <hi>multiplying</hi> the <hi>points</hi> of <hi>Sight</hi>; which is an <hi>error</hi> into which our very <hi>Author</hi> (for all the pains he has taken to magnifie that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>decision</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>) has fail'd in: For the knowing in that <hi>Art</hi> do easily perceive, that even <hi>Raphael</hi> himself has not so exactly observ'd it; since

            <p>But would you know from whence this universal <hi>Caution</hi> in most of their works proceeded, and that the best of our Modern <hi>Painters</hi> and <hi>Architects</hi> have succeeded better than others of that <hi>Profession</hi>: It must be consider'd that they were <hi>Learned men,</hi> good <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi> and generally skill'd in the best <hi>Antiquities</hi>: Such were <hi>Raphael,</hi> and doubtless his <hi>Scholar Iulio</hi>; and if <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi>

            <head>AN IDEA of the <hi>Perfection</hi> OF PAINTING.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is a very subtle and curious <hi>Enquiry,</hi> to know, from whence it should come to pass, that the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is so much degenerated from that perfection, which it once obtain'd, and how it happens, that considering the weakness of its productions, compared with those admirable <hi>Master-pieces</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> it seems of late to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the World with nothing but the meer <hi>shadow</hi> and <hi>phantosmes</hi> of it?</p>
            <p>For my own part, I conceive, the principal cause of its decadence to have proceeded from that little esteem
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58393:22"/>
which it preserv'd, during the ignorance and barbarity of the <hi>Lower Empire,</hi> which did so far ignoble and debase it of its pristine Honour; that instead of that preheminence which it then held amongst the <hi>Sciences,</hi> it is now reduc'd and reckon'd amongst the most vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <hi>Trades</hi>; sufficient to let us see, how much the spirit and <hi>Genius</hi> of these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ages,</hi> have declined, in which the rare Inventions and Lights of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Art</hi> are, for want of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, almost totally extinguish'd.</p>
            <p>However yet, that good <hi>Genius,</hi> which by a certain providence of <hi>Nature</hi> does still preside over Noble things, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways furnish'd us with some excellent <hi>Men,</hi> preserving, as it were, some <hi>Seeds</hi> of them from time to time: But as we find it in <hi>Trees,</hi> and even in the most perfect Bodies, that they attain not to their consummate forme upon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and till after many years; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which they are yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to destruction every instant, without any means of restauration, but the same from whence first they sprung: even so it is in the productions of <hi>Wit,</hi> which coming once, through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to be lost, or opprest under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58393:22"/>
of evil <hi>Government,</hi> never recover themselves but by a long and laborious re-search; so, as 'tis realy prodigious; that in the <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> and <hi>Raphael</hi> (who were the <hi>Protogenes</hi> and <hi>Apelles</hi>'s of the Modern <hi>Painters</hi>) we should see the <hi>Art</hi> revive again with so much vigour, and flourish in so short a space. For <hi>Painting</hi> is none of those simple Arts, which <hi>Chance</hi> does now and then present us with, without any disquisition, and which every one may light on without an extraordinary Talent, or study to attain them.</p>
            <p>There is happ'ly nothing of <hi>Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> amongst <hi>Men</hi> of more <hi>sublime,</hi> and whose Perfection is more difficult to attain, than <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Instance which humane wit can boast of: 'Tis therefore plainly an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable abuse, to obscure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found her amongst the <hi>Mechanical Arts</hi>; since she is established upon a <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative Science,</hi> infinitely more inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reasonable, than that Pedant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which produces us nothing but frivolous <hi>Questions</hi> and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whence some have styl'd it, <hi>The Art of Doubting,</hi> a steril and idle spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; whereas <hi>Paynting,</hi> founded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58393:23"/>
upon the real <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie,</hi> makes at once a double <hi>demonstration</hi> of what she represents: But it will indeed require different <hi>Eyes</hi> to contemplate and enjoy her Beauty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely: For the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is the first and principal <hi>Iudge</hi> of what she undertakes.</p>
            <p>It will, in my opinion, be necessary therefore, in order to the restauration of her Honour, to evince by undeniable reasons, that she is still as worthy of the rank and dignity, which she formerly possest amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of <hi>Genius</hi>'s that ever Nature form'd, and that the shameful deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which has since arriv'd her, could proceed from no other cause but an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal depravation.</p>
            <p>She has moreover had this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular misfortune, that all the <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> which should contribute to her <hi>Instruction,</hi> and that divers excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Painters</hi> had long since publish'd for the better intelligence of their <hi>Art,</hi> have been buried and lost by tract of time. Nor is it strange, that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident has more concern'd them, than all that has happen'd to the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Orators, Philosophers, Historians,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58393:23"/>
others; since 'twas sufficient for them to find out People that could transcribe them again, and by that means continually replenish their <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>; whereas, for the <hi>Writings</hi> of our great <hi>Master-Painters,</hi> the <hi>Copists</hi> were of necessity to be good <hi>Designers,</hi> and knowing in the <hi>Matter,</hi> which they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, to be able but to accomplish a very few <hi>Volumes</hi> in a great deal of time; so as one could hope for no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter event than what is come to pass, by reason of those tedious and very difficult <hi>Figurations,</hi> which go to the composure of its principal, and most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Parts, as may easily be deduc'd from that <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> which it had been impossible to have explain'd, without the advantages of the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Graving,</hi> and of <hi>Printing,</hi> which this latter <hi>Age</hi> of ours has produc'd.</p>
            <p>The same unhappiness arriv'd to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture</hi>: All the <hi>Antient Books</hi> of it being utterly lost, that single work of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> being only excepted, which is very defective too, for want of its <hi>Profiles</hi> and <hi>lineal Demonstrations,</hi> which this <hi>Author</hi> set forth in a particular <hi>Volume</hi> that is perished; but which was to have been the <hi>Crown</hi> of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58393:24"/>
though we may yet affirm, that the <hi>Moderns</hi>; persueing his steps, have made that Glorious and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Art</hi> to flourish and revive again.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, one might render the same service to that of <hi>Painting</hi>; since we have a <hi>Philostratus</hi> to our guide in so worthy a designe: But as <hi>Architect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure</hi> is more gross and material in what it undertakes; the <hi>Solidity</hi> of it, which constitutes one of its very <hi>Principles,</hi> has honour'd it with some prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, even above <hi>Painting</hi> it selfe. It stands <hi>firm,</hi> and has continu'd many of its productions, which wonderfully supply the defect of those <hi>Books</hi> that are lost; whereas <hi>Painting,</hi> which is, as it were, altogether <hi>spiritual,</hi> has not been able to furnish us with such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent monuments. And yet for all this, she has within these two <hi>Ages</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd with so much vigor, as if she had receiv'd the very same assistances. And truely, she seems to me to have been the <hi>Restauratrix</hi> of <hi>Architecture</hi>; since we find, that almost all the first <hi>Masters</hi> of that <hi>Profession</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so great <hi>Painters</hi>; such as <hi>Bramante, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dassar Petrucci, Raphaelo, Iulio Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and several more, which is no other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58393:24"/>
then the result of being able to <hi>designe</hi> well, which is in truth the veritable <hi>Principle</hi> and only <hi>Basis,</hi> not of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> alone; but, as one may well affirm, the universal <hi>Organ</hi> and <hi>Instrument</hi> of all the politer <hi>Arts.</hi>

            <p>'Twas a singular felicity and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the re-establishment of this rare <hi>Profession,</hi> that its <hi>Mechanical</hi> part did preserve it selfe so intire; in which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I conceive we have nothing more to desire of the <hi>Antients.</hi> On the contrary, the very use of <hi>Oyl</hi> only, which the <hi>Moderns</hi> have discover'd, does infinitely advance it. Add to this, its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining on Colours; and their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that multiplicity of different kinds, as even superabound, and are more than necessary; so as now a man needs only to understand, and be well vers'd in what this excellent <hi>Talent</hi> of the great <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> consists, and the prodigious Effects, which <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> report of them in their <hi>Works.</hi> Nor is this a thing so difficult to resolve; since by that only <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> one may easily make it out, that a <hi>Painter</hi> well instructed from his Youth in all the necessary <hi>Precepts</hi> so methodically prescrib'd in the first

Chapter of his <hi>Book,</hi> cannot fail of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be an able Man in the <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>: but if to this, <hi>Nature</hi> likewise fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> which consists in a certain vivacity and flowing of <hi>Invention</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> (which all the study in the World will never attain) he must then of necessity be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</hi> And if his <hi>Works</hi> perfectly conform to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the rest of that exact <hi>Dissertation</hi>; one may safely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce as much of his <hi>Pieces</hi> as of those of <hi>Apelles</hi> himselfe, <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> or <hi>Parrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi> But forasmuch as our <hi>Author</hi> put not the last hand to his <hi>Book,</hi> but left it us imperfect; or the Project rather of a more finished <hi>Composure,</hi> which he had under contemplation; I shall here adventure to set down some general <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi> for the supply of what seems most <hi>defective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Supposing then, that all <hi>Arts</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever have their <hi>Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> the knowledge whereof is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary for those who intend the <hi>Profession,</hi> and that <hi>This</hi> of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is superior to the rest, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more difficult: It is not to be expected, there should any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble progress be made without a due and

perfect cognisance of those <hi>Principles</hi>; and they consist of no mean speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Perspective</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi>; without which, a <hi>Painter</hi> can never emerge good <hi>Artist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing now, it is not enough, that to the forming an able <hi>Painter,</hi> he be learned in these two Points alone (which <hi>study</hi> will soon accomplish) without three or four other more curious <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> which he ought to be <hi>Master</hi> of; but which are not usually attain'd to without a singular favour of <hi>Nature</hi>; it happens that there appear so very few good <hi>Workmen</hi> amongst the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of this <hi>Profession,</hi> that it may well be verified of <hi>Them,</hi> which was said of the <hi>Poets</hi>; That a <hi>Painter</hi> is so <hi>born,</hi> not <hi>made</hi>; and really their <hi>Genius</hi> is so conform, as it became <hi>Proverbial</hi>; That <hi>Picture was mute Poesie,</hi> and <hi>Poesie vocal Painting.</hi> The reason of which will appear very obvious in the ensueing periods, where we shall Treat of the different <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> which necessarily concurr to the production of an acomplisht <hi>Painter.</hi>

               <p>BUt as the <hi>three first Parts</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary for all <hi>Painters</hi> in <hi>general</hi>; this <hi>Fourth,</hi> which concerns the <hi>Expression</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, excells them all, and is indeed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable; for it gives not only life to <hi>Figures,</hi> by representing their <hi>Gestures</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi>; but seems likewise to make them <hi>vocal</hi> and to <hi>reason</hi> with you. It is from hence, a Man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl'd to judge of the worth and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a <hi>Painter</hi>; for such an <hi>Artist</hi> paints <hi>Himselfe</hi> in his <hi>Tables,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, as in so many <hi>Mirrours</hi> and <hi>Glasses,</hi> the temper of his own <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>Genius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is none but easily perceives, by paralleling the <hi>Compositions</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> of <hi>Raphael,</hi> with those of <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Angelo</hi>; that the <hi>First</hi> was the very sweetness of <hi>Grace</hi> it self; whereas, on the contrary, <hi>Mic.

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58393:28"/>
This is evident in that great <hi>Work</hi> of his in the <hi>Chappel</hi> of the <hi>Vaticane</hi>; where, being to represent the <hi>Final Iudgement</hi> over the very <hi>Altar</hi> it selfe, he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces certain <hi>Figures</hi> in <hi>Actions</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <hi>undecent</hi>; whereas <hi>Raphael</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves a <hi>Modesty,</hi> even in the most licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of <hi>Subjects.</hi> From hence it is, we may conjecture, how highly important this Talent of <hi>Expression</hi> is in a <hi>Painter</hi>; 'tis really his greatest <hi>Excellency,</hi> and should accordingly be accompanied with a peculiar <hi>Iudgement</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection</hi>; since by that alone, one may conjecture at the force of his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> which being far from ever acquiring any renown by his <hi>Works,</hi> whilst he violates the forms of <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> will doubtless, be the scorn and reproach of every Man; seeing the greatest <hi>Libertines</hi> amongst Persons of Condition, generally abstain from lewd and impure expressions; which, though but in passing, as we say (which makes not so lasting impressions as what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the eye) are taken up only by the dregs and vilest of the <hi>People.</hi> And therefore, a <hi>Painter</hi> who makes profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of so noble and excellent and <hi>Art,</hi> is extreamly obliged to Modesty and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58393:29"/>
good Manners in all his productions, and should never pollute his <hi>Pensil</hi> with any <hi>Subject,</hi> but what may endure the <hi>chastest</hi> eyes to behold it; for as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to render his <hi>Works</hi> famous, and worthy to be sought of all the World; it oftentimes fortunes, that those pieces, which are express'd with too much Liberty, happ'ning to fall into the hands of <hi>scrupulous</hi> persons, never appear in the light, by which means those <hi>Workmen</hi> are deservedly depriv'd of what they most of all affected.</p>
               <p>I do not inferr from hence, that one should be so precise, as not to endure any kind of <hi>Nudities</hi> whatsoever, and be so peevish and moross, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to neglect both the excellency of a <hi>Work,</hi> and the <hi>History</hi> which they often represent so; or in case they do retain some of them, that they should cloath and cover them, by the hand of some wretched <hi>Dauber,</hi> which not only more defiles the <hi>Picture,</hi> but renders it more ridiculous: But I would shew our <hi>Painters,</hi> what are the Rocks and Shelves they ought to avoid in that which concerns <hi>Expression</hi>: For though this <hi>Animadversion</hi> may at first seem but impertinent; since com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58393:29"/>
our <hi>Wits</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> are more vigorous and inventive upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; yet when men shall seriously reflect upon the indignity and vileness of the <hi>Liberty</hi> which some of them as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume; and consider, how much more easie it is to succeed in those <hi>wanton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, than in more worthy and <hi>Heroic</hi> Subjects; (as 'tis easier to make one <hi>Laugh,</hi> than to make one <hi>Admire</hi>) Men will but despise their extravagance and brutality: And in effect, they are never seen but in obscure <hi>Corners,</hi> as asham'd to behold the Light; or in the houses of <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>abandon'd</hi> Persons, who feed themselves with such impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.

               <p>BUt in the first place, let us dispatch what we have to offer, touching the due <hi>Collocation</hi> and <hi>Position</hi> of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> in a <hi>Piece</hi>; since it is the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of the whole <hi>Edifice</hi> of <hi>Painting</hi>; or, as I may term it better, the <hi>Ligature</hi> of all those <hi>four Parts</hi> we have hitherto discours'd upon; which without <hi>this,</hi> have neither <hi>Form,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>subsistence.</hi> For as it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in an <hi>Architect,</hi> to have amass'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and made a vast provision of <hi>Materials,</hi> nor even to have assign'd each <hi>Member</hi> of his <hi>Building</hi> its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form, unless he also skill how to <hi>dispose</hi> of them all in their proper <hi>places</hi>; Nor that a <hi>Sculptor</hi> should carve out each Member of a <hi>Statue</hi> with just and due <hi>Proportion,</hi> without he know how to unite them in their natural <hi>Postures,</hi> and not place an <hi>Arm</hi> where a <hi>Leg</hi> should stand, nor the <hi>Foot</hi> where should be the <hi>Hand</hi>; but he must not so much as take one <hi>hand</hi> for <hi>another,</hi> nor the <hi>left Leg</hi> for the <hi>right,</hi> which would be to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58393:30"/>
form a <hi>Monster</hi> instead of a <hi>Man.</hi> In like sort, a <hi>Painter</hi> would be found to work in vain, and loose his time, if when he has laudably pass'd through the first <hi>four Parts,</hi> he should fall short of this <hi>last,</hi> in which the whole <hi>Eurith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> and perfection of the <hi>Art</hi> consists. It were the same folly to <hi>Invent</hi> and <hi>Compose</hi> a <hi>Subject,</hi> to have studied the <hi>Beauty,</hi> and just <hi>proportion</hi> of every <hi>Figure</hi>; to emerge as an able <hi>Colourist,</hi> and know how to give the <hi>Lights</hi> and the <hi>Shadows</hi> to each Body; their <hi>taints</hi> and natural <hi>Lustre,</hi> nay, and withal possess that Divine Talent of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the very <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> in his <hi>History,</hi> (which is the <hi>soul</hi> of <hi>Painting</hi>) if after all these noble accomplishments, he be ignorant, how to give his <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> their due regular <hi>Positions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do therefore conclude, that if those <hi>other,</hi> or all of them united, or asunder, are advantagious to a <hi>Painter</hi>; this <hi>last</hi> which we have spoken of, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary. For though a <hi>piece</hi> may possibly not answer in every part, some <hi>one</hi> of the former requisites be weak, nay, in some measure, defective in all of them; yet, if this <hi>last</hi> be well perform'd, the <hi>Work</hi> will always deserve
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58393:31"/>
esteem, and credit the <hi>Painter. Order</hi> is the sourse and <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> and as it concerns the <hi>Arts,</hi> has this of peculiar, and to be admired, that it is the parent of all <hi>Beauty,</hi> imparting its graces to the meanest productions which it renders considerable.</p>
               <p>Let us then consider a while, in what <hi>this</hi> so important, and indeed accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht <hi>part</hi> consists, which not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats a <hi>Painter,</hi> but comprehends in it whatsoever the whole <hi>Art</hi> has of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entific,</hi> and emancipates from the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> to give it place even amongst the <hi>Sciences</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Geometricians,</hi> who are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine <hi>Masters</hi> of this <hi>Question,</hi> and can best explain it, have nam'd it <hi>Optica,</hi> by which term they would signifie, that 'tis an <hi>Art of seeing by our Reasons</hi> and <hi>Eyes intellectual</hi>; for 'twere imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to imagine, that our <hi>corporal Eyes</hi> alone should be capable of so sublime an operation as to pretend themselves judges of the Beauty and perfections of a good <hi>Picture,</hi> whence a thousand absurdities would ensue. And should the <hi>Workman</hi> think to imitate things according to their <hi>external</hi> appearance; 'tis certain, that if he <hi>place</hi> them <hi>ill,</hi> he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58393:31"/>
                  <hi>represents</hi> them <hi>so,</hi> and will form but an ill resemblance of them; so as before he takes the <hi>Crayon</hi> and the <hi>Pensils</hi> in his hand, he should first adjust his <hi>Eye</hi> with his <hi>Reason</hi> by the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> which teaches us to behold things, not as they appear in <hi>themselves</hi> only, but as they <hi>ought</hi> to be; and it were a fault unpardonable to paint them precisely as they are seen, how <hi>Paradoxical</hi> soever the assertion seems.</p>
               <p>Now this so necessary <hi>Art,</hi> which the learn'd call <hi>Optical,</hi> Painters and Design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Perspective,</hi> prescribes us infallible <hi>Rules</hi> of exactly representing upon any surface (be it <hi>Cloth</hi> or <hi>Table,</hi> a <hi>Wall, sheet</hi> of <hi>Paper,</hi> or the like) whatsoever is <hi>visible</hi> at one view or aperture of the <hi>Eye,</hi> without changing our place.</p>
               <p>I shall not here insist upon the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and various <hi>Methods,</hi> which the <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Art</hi> have invented for the execution of it, which were to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress from my present <hi>Institution</hi>: But presupposing my <hi>Reader</hi> competently knowing in it, shall shew him here by divers <hi>Instances,</hi> and a <hi>Critical</hi> examen of sundry <hi>Pieces</hi> engraven after <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> (the most renowned certainly of our Modern <hi>Painters,</hi> and most accurate

in his <hi>Works</hi>) of what importance this <hi>Perspective,</hi> or regular <hi>Collocation</hi> of <hi>Figures</hi> is; since by <hi>that,</hi> a man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely determine, and pronounce defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitively what is <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> done in a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</hi> Nor let any impute it a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if in this survey, which I pretend to make of <hi>Prints,</hi> I spare not even <hi>Raphael</hi> himself, where I find him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; since, it is neither my purpose to injure or flatter any man; besides, many of the <hi>errors,</hi> which I take notice of, may possibly proceed from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence and ignorance of the <hi>Graver,</hi> who perhaps have abus'd, or altered the <hi>Original Drawing</hi>; as I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently observ'd, that the <hi>Prints</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Mantegna,</hi> and <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> which were cut by their own hands, appear'd a great deal more regular and just, than those of <hi>Raphael,</hi> which had not the same advantage. And if the manner of those two great <hi>Painters designs,</hi> had been as pleasant, and noble, as they were accurate, their <hi>stamps</hi> had been without comparison; those only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which <hi>Marc. Antonio</hi> executed by the direction of <hi>Raphael,</hi> who took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary care, not only to furnish him with <hi>Drawings,</hi> extreamly finish'd, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58393:32"/>
instructed him likewise in the very <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of them; so as one would esteem those Papers of <hi>Marc. Anthony,</hi> amongst the greatest curiosities that <hi>Painting</hi> has produc'd of the kind. And it were to be wish'd, for the <hi>Virtuosi</hi>'s sakes, that the same hand had <hi>Grav'd</hi> all that are to be found after this great <hi>Master</hi>; at least, those larger <hi>Compositions</hi> of his which are painted in the <hi>Vaticane,</hi> the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and divers other places at <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Battails</hi> of <hi>Constantine</hi> against <hi>Maxentius</hi>; the <hi>School</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi>; the <hi>Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> about the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> with several more, which <hi>ill-Gravers</hi> have wretchedly abused.</p>
               <p>To fix our <hi>Critic</hi> then on a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Augure,</hi> I suppose, it will redound both to the Glory of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and our own satisfaction; to begin with good <hi>Examples,</hi> and to propose <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> of the <hi>best</hi> of <hi>Marc. Antonios</hi>-pieces, as <hi>Antipasts</hi> of the rest; that from what we shall observe from those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we may the better judge, how great a misfortune it is for a <hi>Painter</hi> to fall into the hands of ill <hi>Gravers,</hi> and how infinitely our loss has been, that so many excellent <hi>Works</hi> of the same

               <p>THe very <hi>First</hi> sheets which carried the name of <hi>Raphael</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that shewed all the <hi>Painters</hi> of his <hi>Age,</hi> who was their <hi>Coripheus</hi> and <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> was that noble and famous <hi>Print</hi> of the <hi>Iudgement of Paris</hi>; in which, <hi>Raphael</hi> made so happy an <hi>Essay,</hi> both for his own, and his Scholar <hi>Marc. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonios</hi> reputation, that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he continu'd him in the same <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi>; and for that end, expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd him several other rare things, which probably we had never seen, but upon this <hi>occasion,</hi> because he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did <hi>paint</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Let us now examine in the Figures of this <hi>Stamp,</hi> whether our Painter have sufficiently acquitted himself in our <hi>five Fundamental</hi> points; and that we may proceed orderly in the research, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence at the <hi>First,</hi> which is the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>: But forasmuch, as it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58393:33"/>
necessary, e're we can rationally discuss it, to understand the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this <hi>Poetique-History,</hi> we shall briefly repeat it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paris,</hi> Son to King <hi>Priamus,</hi> being soon after his <hi>Birth</hi> expos'd on Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> and there abandon'd to the wild <hi>Beasts</hi> (by reason of the funest <hi>dream,</hi> fatal indeed to his <hi>Country,</hi> which his Mother <hi>Hecuba</hi> had of him, during her great belly) happen'd to be taken up by one of the Country <hi>Shepheards,</hi> who bred him up as his <hi>Son.</hi> This young <hi>Prince</hi> (unknown of his <hi>Foster-Father,</hi> and indeed to himselfe) by a strange and secret virtue of the <hi>Royal-bloud</hi> in him, became so accomplish'd in his <hi>Youth,</hi> as to surpass all his other <hi>Contemporaries</hi> in Strength, Beauty and Address, and in summe, in whatsoever was esteem'd most <hi>qualified</hi> amongst them. Hitherto, it holds some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a true <hi>History</hi>; but the <hi>Poets,</hi> who are somewhat neer of kin to the <hi>Painters,</hi> have refin'd upon all this, and mingled it with several capricious fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies; and pretend, that once upon a time, as all the <hi>Deities</hi> were invited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the <hi>Nuptials</hi> of <hi>Peleus</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> the Goddess <hi>Discordia</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58393:34"/>
this malicious <hi>Lady,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the affront, secretly convey'd amongst the Crowd that were at the <hi>wedding,</hi> a <hi>Golden-Ball,</hi> upon which there was engraven, <hi>Be it given to the Fairest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury,</hi> the busiest of all the rest, perceiving the <hi>Ball,</hi> catches it up, and reads the words aloud; which inflam'd all the <hi>Goddesses</hi> (emulous, who should be counted <hi>fairest</hi>) with so burning a <hi>jealousie,</hi> that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself refus'd to decide the <hi>controversie,</hi> fearing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please his Wife <hi>Iuno,</hi> should he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in favour of any of the rest; or at least, be suspected of Interest. The only Rivals of <hi>Iuno,</hi> were the fierce <hi>Minerva,</hi> and the lovely <hi>Venus</hi>; so as the <hi>difference</hi> being by mutual consent of the <hi>Competitors,</hi> referr'd to the decision of the <hi>Royal-Shepherd,</hi> (who was in those days himself a handsome Youth) <hi>Mercury</hi> was immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht from <hi>Iupiter</hi> with the <hi>Apple</hi> or <hi>Ball,</hi> with order to deliver it to <hi>Her,</hi> who of the Three, <hi>Paris</hi> should judge to be the <hi>Fairest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have here, what <hi>Raphael</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to represent by this <hi>Designe,</hi> wherein, for a <hi>general</hi> consideration, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58393:34"/>
almost ever a <hi>necessary</hi> one; he has plac'd the principal <hi>Figures</hi> of his <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in the <hi>Center</hi> of his <hi>Ordonance</hi>; and that with admirable variety both of <hi>Aspect</hi> and <hi>Expression.</hi> There, you may behold <hi>Minerva,</hi> fill'd with <hi>disdain</hi> for missing the <hi>Prize</hi> she pretended to, turn her <hi>back</hi> upon her <hi>Iudge</hi> with a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regard: <hi>Venus,</hi> in whose favour the <hi>Sentence</hi> was pronunc'd, stands in the middle of her two <hi>Rivals,</hi> and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Symbol</hi> of her <hi>Victory</hi> with a <hi>Modesty,</hi> accompanied with a marvelous Grace: The <hi>Painter</hi> has made her be seen by a side <hi>Profile,</hi> as the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to discover the shape and regularity of each part of a beautiful face. <hi>Iuno,</hi> the haughtiest of all the rest, inraged with despite, that she had not the preference, seems altogether transported with rage at poor <hi>Paris,</hi> who appears not for all this the least concern'd, but continues sitting as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Iudge,</hi> pronouncing <hi>Sentence</hi> with the <hi>Fatal-Apple</hi> that soon after oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd those tragical dissasters amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and concluded in the total subversion of <hi>Troy,</hi> which was the place of his <hi>Birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This last <hi>Goddess</hi> presents her self in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58393:35"/>
                  <hi>front,</hi> as the most <hi>confident</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi>; and <hi>Raphael</hi> has expresly design'd them all with different <hi>aspects,</hi> to make as great an emulation, even between his own very <hi>Figures,</hi> as possibly he was able. I observe likewise in that of the Shepheard <hi>Paris,</hi> a certain variety in the <hi>Profile</hi> from that of <hi>Venus</hi>; for where this fair <hi>Deesse</hi> discovers a little of her breast, <hi>Paris</hi> on the other hand, shews a part of his shoulders side-long; so extraordinary a care our <hi>Painter</hi> took, that each part of his <hi>piece,</hi> should have something diversified.</p>
               <p>Besides these <hi>Four,</hi> by which indeed the whole <hi>History</hi> had been sufficiently illustrated, he has yet introduced <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> (having finish'd his Commission) in a posture of returning to carry back the news of the event to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who that happy <hi>person</hi> was, that obtained the Victory.</p>
               <p>After this, the rest of the <hi>Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is nothing but a <hi>Poetique</hi> expression of the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Painter,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the <hi>Ordonance</hi> of his <hi>Table</hi>: For the <hi>Nymphs</hi> with their <hi>Cruses,</hi> and the two naked Men, who sit neer them with Bull-rushes in their hands so unconcern'd with what passes,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58393:35"/>
relates only to Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> which abounds in <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Springs</hi> of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and 'tis evident, that he whom you see leaning upon the Bank, is the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Xanthus,</hi> which washes the very walls of <hi>Troy</hi>; next to him, is the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Simois,</hi> both whose <hi>Sourses</hi> rising in the same Hill, with their frequent Meanders refresh the large and irriguous <hi>Campanias</hi> of the <hi>Troada,</hi> and at last unite themselves at the mouth of the <hi>Hellespontic</hi> sea, neer the <hi>Sigean</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory.</p>
               <p>Now, as there is not the least parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in this whole <hi>Composure,</hi> which our <hi>Painter</hi> has not mannag'd with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, address to shew that Mount <hi>Ida</hi> was of an exceeding height, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly fertile; he discovers a <hi>part</hi> of it only, which successively ascending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one of the Angles of his <hi>piece,</hi> and being not only already parallel with, but even piercing some of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Clouds, makes one thence easily to conjecture its prodigious altitude. The plenty of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Cattel</hi> which adorn it, speaks also its great fertility: But of all this <hi>Representation,</hi> the most difficult to interpret, is that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses amongst the <hi>Gods</hi> in the <hi>Clouds</hi>: For
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58393:36"/>
at one hand you have <hi>Iupiter</hi> sitting on his <hi>Eagle,</hi> arm'd with <hi>Thunder,</hi> born up of one of the <hi>Winds,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by <hi>Diana,</hi> and two other <hi>Deesses</hi>; and on the other part, <hi>Apollo,</hi> (the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Diana</hi>) inviron'd with his <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> and attended by two young <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> (whom I suppose to be <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> the Brothers of <hi>Hellena</hi>) hastning to meet <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and seeming to be plac'd there as a kind of <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> of the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> which this jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous contention produc'd, and which soon after kindled so dire a Flame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the unfortunate <hi>Umpire,</hi> that it reduc'd both his <hi>House,</hi> his whole <hi>Race,</hi> and his <hi>City</hi> into ashes; and made so strange a discord, even amongst the <hi>Deities</hi> themselves, that every one of them siding with his own passion, band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such a League in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as was not ended till <hi>ten</hi> years after.</p>
               <p>The rest of the <hi>Fable,</hi> for contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little that concerns our <hi>Piece</hi> in it, I need not explain here; and haply, I may already be thought over tedious; but I have expresly enlarg'd, that after we have well consider'd in the <hi>Print</hi> all these observations; and that there is nothing in the entire <hi>Composition</hi> but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58393:36"/>
what is essential to the <hi>Subject</hi>; the <hi>Idea</hi> and freedom of our <hi>Painters</hi> invention, may appear with the more lustre and advantage; for seeing, that in so small a space, at one view, and with so few <hi>Figures,</hi> he has shew'd us such a consequence of varieties, we must needs the more admire the force of his <hi>Invention,</hi> which is the <hi>Talent</hi> we so much celebrate, and the <hi>first</hi> Member of our present disquisition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> which concerns the <hi>Proportion</hi> of the <hi>Figures,</hi> will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any large discussion; 'tis too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to those who look with <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> eyes: we may only observe in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, what a judicious difference <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> has assign'd to every one whom he Personates, as their particular qualities distinguish them: for the three <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses,</hi> being the most illustrious and principal ones of his <hi>Piece,</hi> he makes of a more august and stately <hi>Mine</hi> than the rest.</p>
               <p>The Shepherd <hi>Paris, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> discover a more light and Airy proportion, such as the <hi>Italians</hi> would call <hi>Svelta.</hi> The two Rivers are made more robust and heavy; and the Fountain <hi>Nymphs</hi> fatter than usual,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58393:37"/>
to denote their fertility and abundance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Division, which imports the projection and disposure of the <hi>Shades</hi> and <hi>Lights</hi> upon the <hi>Objects,</hi> needs as little particular enquiry into, as the former; since it is generally very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. We shall only take notice of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>licence,</hi> familiar amongst <hi>Painters</hi> upon such occasions; which is, that <hi>Apollo</hi> (who signifies the <hi>Sun,</hi> and consequently the Fountain and Center of the universal Light) appearing here in humane shape but as a particular <hi>Figure</hi> of the story, does not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part no <hi>light</hi> to the rest of the <hi>Figures,</hi> but receives both <hi>light</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> with the other, as the point requires, which our <hi>Painter</hi> has given to his <hi>Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Fourth</hi> Part, which is the <hi>Expression,</hi> that admirable and peculiar Talent of <hi>Painting,</hi> which not only discovers what every <hi>Figure</hi> does, and <hi>speaks,</hi> but even what it <hi>thinks</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, a thing almost incredible; I shall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise pass it over without much enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my <hi>discourse,</hi> as having sufficienly examin'd it in the narrative of this <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>; and in particular, where I treat of the <hi>Invention,</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Painter</hi>; where I observe no less than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58393:37"/>
three distinct <hi>passions</hi> most judiciously express'd in the <hi>Contentions</hi> of the <hi>Goddesses</hi>; as first <hi>Disdain</hi> in <hi>Minerva,</hi> who turning her back towards her <hi>Iudge,</hi> casts a sleer over her shoulder, and lifts up her arme after a very disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful manner. In the <hi>second,</hi> which is <hi>Venus</hi> (receiving the <hi>Prize</hi> of her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Conquest</hi>) I remark a certain se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and bashful complacency, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all the grace that <hi>Beauty</hi> is capable of. As for <hi>Iuno,</hi> she is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conspicuous, according to the <hi>Poets</hi> description of her, full of <hi>Choler, Revenge</hi> and <hi>Arrogancy,</hi> threatning her <hi>Iudge</hi> with her very looks, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her arme towards him after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream audacious and haughty manner. The next is <hi>Mercury,</hi> in a <hi>Posture</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly describing his sedulity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, since he seems both to <hi>speak</hi> and to <hi>move</hi> forwards at the same instant, and that with an address and Meene, which sufficiently denotes his agility, and how proper he is for his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Royal Shepheard</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, who is <hi>here</hi> one of the Principal <hi>Personages,</hi> though encompassed with <hi>Divinities,</hi> preserves still a settled Countenance, as becomes a <hi>Iudge</hi>;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58393:38"/>
nay the very <hi>Dog</hi> by his side, neither sleeps, nor importunately barks as Currs use to do; but seems as it were to bear some part, and give attention to his Masters <hi>Sentence.</hi> All the other <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Springs</hi> seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little concern'd at what passes, as I have already noted.</p>
               <p>I confess yet, at first, I once imagin'd, that the <hi>Nymph</hi> who sits so neer the two <hi>Rivers,</hi> and seems so extreamly melancholy, might have been <hi>Oenane</hi> the <hi>Mistris</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>; and he might well be jealous at what he saw; but her tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>hearbs</hi> about her head, and the <hi>Water-pot</hi> which she holds, do not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate with this conjecture: Above in the <hi>Clouds</hi> the two young <hi>Harbingers</hi> full of heat, and precipitancy, appear as augures of the ensuing <hi>Warr,</hi> which soon overflowed all <hi>Greece,</hi> by the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous resentment of the angry <hi>Godesses,</hi> enraged at their <hi>Iudge,</hi> and by that direful revenge which they espress'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all his <hi>Posterity,</hi> sufficiently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning us, how perillous a thing it is, to intermeddle with the affairs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of <hi>Great Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those who are knowing in the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Iudiciary Astrology,</hi> will find
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58393:38"/>
also by the <hi>position</hi> of the <hi>Figures</hi> about the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> that our <hi>Painter</hi> was not only expert in placing them in their right order; but that he was likewise skilfull in what concerns the <hi>Figuration</hi> of <hi>Horoscops,</hi> and erecting of <hi>Schemes</hi>: For, pretending to represent those great disasters which were to proceed from this fatal <hi>Contestation,</hi> he turn'd it to the place of <hi>Aries,</hi> which is the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> in which <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruscations</hi> are ingendred: the <hi>next</hi> is <hi>Taurus,</hi> the <hi>Domicile</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> who is fortunate in that <hi>Sign</hi>; Then succeed the lucky <hi>Twins,</hi> signifying to the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> and representing the two young <hi>Cavaliers</hi> who ride before <hi>Apollo.</hi> From these <hi>Particulars</hi> so accurately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>search'd, we may inferr with how great judgment and art he has compos'd this <hi>Piece.</hi> There is little else considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; save the <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>Iupiter</hi> riding upon <hi>Eolus</hi> in an extraordinary garb, accompanied with three or four <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> the <hi>Lightning</hi> in his hand, and an <hi>Eagle</hi> near him in a menacing posture, as being interested in the <hi>Difference,</hi> which also presages a <hi>Tempest</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to examine how
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58393:39"/>
our <hi>first</hi> and principal <hi>part,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>position</hi> of the <hi>Figures</hi> in true <hi>Perspective,</hi> have been observ'd in this Ordonance. Our common <hi>Painters</hi> imagine <hi>Perspective</hi> to be no more than a certain particular manner of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting things in <hi>Architecture,</hi> as they call it; never conceiving that it signifies any thing in <hi>Histories</hi> which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Figures,</hi> so as this may be: and I confess it does not appear so perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the eyes of our half-<hi>Paynters,</hi> who do not comprehend it any farther than they are <hi>Mechanically</hi> taught by by a certain concourse of <hi>Lines,</hi> tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>poynt</hi> of <hi>sight,</hi> which is the uttermost limit of their skill: But those <hi>grand Masters</hi> who own it for the Universal <hi>foundation</hi> of their <hi>Science,</hi> are curious to observe it in every the minutest <hi>touches</hi> of a Piece, as I pretend to <hi>demonstrate</hi> by this <hi>Instance,</hi> which is so much the more commodious for my purpose, as at first sight it seems as if <hi>Raphael</hi> had thought of nothing less in the <hi>Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> than of <hi>Perspective:</hi> so free and disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd it appears from any kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint imaginable; there being neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>degradation</hi> of the <hi>Plan, Buildings,</hi> or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58393:39"/>
other form of <hi>Horizon,</hi> from whence those simple practisers of <hi>Lineal Perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> can derive the least conjecture how to proceed by in their <hi>Mechanical</hi> way: But these men are to know, that 'tis a most subtile, and refin'd address in <hi>Painting,</hi> to work things exactly <hi>regular</hi> and precise, and yet to <hi>conceal</hi> the <hi>Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us begin then first to determine the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>sight</hi>; since it is as it were, the very <hi>Center,</hi> to which every part of the <hi>Table</hi> has reference; and for that we have in this <hi>Piece,</hi> no <hi>lineal</hi> guides to conduct us; our <hi>Reason</hi> must supply that defect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> of this <hi>History</hi> being chiefly about <hi>Sight,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son principally concern'd in it; the <hi>Paynter</hi> could not have plac'd the <hi>Visive point</hi> more judiciously, than in the <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> which, for this very cause, he has represented in <hi>Profile,</hi> to shew that there ought to be but <hi>One</hi> only, as <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians</hi> teach us in their <hi>Optics,</hi> where they represent <hi>Vision,</hi> or the function of <hi>Seeing,</hi> by a radiated <hi>Pyramis</hi> with an <hi>Eye</hi> fixt upon it.</p>
               <p>This establish'd, and rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, we proceed to observe in the <hi>Ordonance</hi> of this Composition, that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58393:40"/>
the <hi>Plan</hi> on which the three rival <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses</hi> stand, has its <hi>degradation</hi> towards the <hi>Eye</hi> of their <hi>Iudge,</hi> towards which likewise all the rest of the <hi>Piece</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Now <hi>Perspective</hi> being an <hi>Art</hi> compos'd of reciprocal proportions, it follows, that from the knowledge of <hi>one</hi> part, one may easily pass to that of <hi>another</hi>; and by this alternative, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in fine, to the knowledge of them altogether: so as from this <hi>first</hi> point of <hi>Sight,</hi> and the consequent <hi>diminution</hi> of the <hi>three</hi> prime <hi>Figures,</hi> we likewise inferr <hi>another</hi> essential <hi>point,</hi> exceedingly necessary for such as practise <hi>Designing</hi>; and <hi>this</hi> they usually call the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Distance</hi>; because it determines the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval</hi> between the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Spectator.</hi> As for the <hi>right-line,</hi> compris'd between the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Distance,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Eye,</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>visual Pyramis,</hi> which is alwayes to remain <hi>fix't,</hi> and <hi>parallel</hi> to the <hi>surface</hi> of the <hi>Plan,</hi> and the <hi>height</hi> of the <hi>Horizon.</hi> This <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Distance</hi> has certain <hi>regular</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>limits,</hi> beyond which it works no effect; for approaching too <hi>neer,</hi> it causes the <hi>Plan</hi> to be so far <hi>elevated,</hi> and the <hi>Diminutions</hi> of the <hi>Figures</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:58393:40"/>
come so suddenly upon us, that it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises the <hi>eye</hi>; and, on the contrary, if it be too <hi>remote,</hi> it renders things as much confus'd; so as there is that <hi>mediocrity</hi> to be observ'd, which the skilful in <hi>Optics</hi> have agreed upon in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Angles</hi> of <hi>Equilateral Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles.</hi> By this general <hi>Maxime,</hi> one may immediately discover, where the precise <hi>term</hi> of <hi>Distance</hi> resides, which we are seeking: And therefore I will dwell no longer upon it; the <hi>particulars</hi> being also so absolutely <hi>important</hi> to those who are already vers'd in the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,</hi> though something difficult, I confess, to be conceiv'd by those who never heard any thing of it before.</p>
               <p>Presupposing then these first <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> dispos'd according to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Art</hi>; You are only to consider, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Figures</hi> (as well those which stand after the usual manner upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> as those who are elevated in the <hi>Air,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Clouds</hi>) be plac'd in an <hi>aspect</hi> agreeable to their <hi>Situations,</hi> with regard to the <hi>visual point</hi>; and whether they <hi>diminish,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the <hi>degradation</hi> of the <hi>Plan</hi> which they should observe; since it is only in these <hi>two</hi> particulars, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58393:41"/>
the whole intention and effect of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective</hi> in a <hi>Painting</hi> does consist. And though they are now adayes much <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected</hi> by those of the <hi>Profession</hi>; Yet is the <hi>Consequence</hi> of such <hi>weight,</hi> that whosoever <hi>observes,</hi> or <hi>knows</hi> them not, is <hi>unworthy</hi> the name of a <hi>Paynter</hi>; all <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> defective in <hi>this</hi> part, being both <hi>contemptible,</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> in the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>intelligent</hi> Persons, who instead of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> look on them but as so many <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera's,</hi> represented without any <hi>possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The importance of this <hi>Remark</hi> will be better understood by <hi>Instances</hi> of <hi>Ill-pieces,</hi> than by <hi>that</hi> of which we are now discoursing, wherein all is so <hi>regular</hi> and conformable to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Art:</hi> for if we shall examine the first effect of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective</hi> in <hi>Figures,</hi> which consists in making them appear <hi>lesser,</hi> or <hi>greater,</hi> according as they are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in the <hi>depth</hi> of the <hi>Plan</hi>; 'twill be manifest, that they successively <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>; so as from the very <hi>first,</hi> which is that of <hi>Minerva,</hi> compar'd with that of <hi>Mercury</hi> (the farthest off in the <hi>piece</hi>) there is a considerable difference in the <hi>height:</hi> And that of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> is yet more remarkable, though the

                  <hi>diminution</hi> be <hi>mediocre,</hi> and but <hi>just</hi> to the <hi>distance</hi> which they mutually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve between each other.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Sight</hi> (which is the <hi>first</hi> thing <hi>observable,</hi> as being indeed, the very <hi>Compass</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> to all the rest) being precisely in <hi>Paris</hi>'s <hi>Eye</hi>; the <hi>Figures</hi> which are aloft in the <hi>Ayr,</hi> as the <hi>Victoria</hi> putting the <hi>Garland</hi> on <hi>Venus; Apollo</hi> in his <hi>Zodiaque; Eolus,</hi> who seems to support and fore-run <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and other of the <hi>Deities</hi> of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; shew altogether their <hi>Nether-Parts,</hi> according to the Third <hi>Axiome.</hi> Descending then to the <hi>Earth,</hi> towards the <hi>right side,</hi> and most distant from the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Sight</hi>; You have the <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>River Xanthus,</hi> sitting, and halfe lying-along the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Picture</hi>; so as by our last <hi>Axiome,</hi> this <hi>Figure</hi> must appear in the same <hi>Aspect</hi> in <hi>Perspective</hi> with the graduated <hi>Square</hi> of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place; and therefore as it regards
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58393:43"/>
the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Sight</hi> (which is here at a considerable <hi>distance</hi> from it) that part of the <hi>Breast</hi> (which according to the Position of the <hi>Body,</hi> could not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, if it stood directly <hi>opposite</hi> to the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> of the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>sight</hi>) shews it-self almost as fully at this interval, as if really the <hi>Figure</hi> had been design'd to stand <hi>fronting</hi>; Whereas now, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Plan,</hi> it stands altogether in <hi>Profile</hi>; the traverse <hi>line</hi> of the <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> ascending also somewhat towards the <hi>Horizon,</hi> according to our <hi>Third Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome.</hi> The same may be observed of the <hi>Nymph</hi> sitting neer this <hi>River,</hi> whose <hi>Aspect</hi> (though different as to <hi>Faces</hi>) is yet upon the same <hi>Parallel,</hi> and sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation on the <hi>Plan</hi>; both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> being seen in <hi>Profile</hi> also. For, presupposing one should advance the <hi>Plan</hi> of their <hi>Position parallel</hi> to the <hi>Visual point</hi>; you would find, that as the <hi>Figures</hi> approach'd it, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi> and <hi>out-lines</hi> of each of their <hi>parts,</hi> would <hi>diversifie</hi> successively, without any <hi>alteration</hi> or <hi>change</hi> in their <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>aptitude</hi>; and so coming at last to be <hi>perpendicularly</hi> opposite to the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>sight,</hi> would appear exactly in <hi>Profile,</hi> which is in truth, their <hi>proper</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:58393:43"/>
and genuine <hi>Position</hi> in this admirable <hi>piece</hi> of <hi>Painting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Would you now proceed to place them on the <hi>other side,</hi> or <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>point of Sight</hi>; the more they incline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>left-hand</hi> of the <hi>piece,</hi> the more they alter the <hi>apparent Forme,</hi> and will come in fine, to an <hi>Aspect</hi> so contrary to their <hi>First</hi>; that the <hi>Figure</hi> which <hi>here</hi> discovers part of the <hi>Breast,</hi> will <hi>there</hi> turn its <hi>back</hi> to you, and so would the other also.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of this Practical <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> will be no difficulty to those that possess the <hi>Genius</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> and that are any thing conversant in <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi>; but 'tis of such universal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to all <hi>Painters,</hi> that whoever do not rightly comprehend it, will be found to work but like a <hi>Blind-man</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> and especially those, who would accommodate to their <hi>designes, Figures</hi> which they <hi>borrow,</hi> and <hi>Copy</hi> after <hi>Prints</hi> of several <hi>Masters</hi>; or indeed their own <hi>Academic</hi> studies, who, above all, should take especial care, so to place them in their <hi>Works,</hi> as may the most regularly adjust, and punctually answer the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>sight,</hi> under which they were first of all <hi>designed.</hi> For 'tis a <hi>Principle</hi> in <hi>perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58393:44"/>
that whatever <hi>Figure</hi> is once fixt upon a <hi>Plan,</hi> can never be transported from thence to <hi>another,</hi> without viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the present <hi>aspect</hi>; since (as we have sufficiently show'd) the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>sight,</hi> is a thing <hi>stated,</hi> and immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so as 'tis absolutely impossible to place such a <hi>Theft</hi> out of another <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Works, with any tollerable certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or handsomness in another <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> without this assistance of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could inlarge these <hi>Remarks</hi> on the rest of the <hi>Figures</hi> of this particular <hi>Print,</hi> but to avoid repetition; and therefore I think it better to make choice of another <hi>Subject,</hi> in the <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> whereof, and of those which follow it, I shall only insist upon what is most <hi>important,</hi> and worthy of <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; referring the rest to the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of particular <hi>students,</hi> who by the <hi>Plan,</hi> I have already trac'd out to them, may happ'ly be curious to make the same <hi>disquisitions</hi> upon every one of our five <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> as I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd them in this <hi>Treatise.</hi>

For this <hi>Painter</hi> did always observe an extraordinary <hi>Modesty</hi> in all his pieces; and doubtless, had not this impudent <hi>garb</hi> been the most proper to express this <hi>Subject,</hi> he had certainly clad them like <hi>Soldiers</hi> in their <hi>Arms.</hi> As to the <hi>Third</hi> part, which imports the <hi>Shades</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58393:45"/>
the <hi>Lights</hi>; I find nothing that requires any particular observation; every thing appearing so regular: But in examining the <hi>fourth</hi> (which we call the <hi>Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) I must confess, that I expected more from <hi>Raphael</hi> upon so advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an <hi>Argument</hi>; for to speak truth, he has handled those violent <hi>Passions</hi> with very little force; whence one may easily conclude, how averse his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> was from such tragical and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous representations. I should have made those cruel <hi>assassines</hi> of fierce and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant <hi>Countenances</hi>; with <hi>fear, rage,</hi> and <hi>dispair</hi> in the faces and actions of the unfortunate <hi>Mothers</hi>; their tresses <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevel'd,</hi> and their limbs <hi>bruised</hi> with the strokes and blows in defending their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Sucklings</hi> against the savage and merciless Soldiers: That the ground should have been cover'd with <hi>Arms, Legs, Heads,</hi> cut off from their mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and lacerated <hi>Trunks</hi>; that all about should have been nothing seen, save an horrible <hi>butchery,</hi> with the dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of an affrighted <hi>People</hi>; some <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> up and down, others <hi>crying,</hi> and the tender <hi>Mothers</hi> even expiring for sorrow upon their dead and massacred <hi>Babes</hi>; others again, endeavouring by flight
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58393:45"/>
to save their <hi>Children</hi>: In summe, that on all parts, there should nothing have appear'd but <hi>desolation, bloud</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi>: But our <hi>Painters</hi> Idea was not, it seems, so warm, and would certainly have succeeded much better, in a less violent <hi>Composition,</hi> more conformable to his <hi>Genius.</hi>

of the <hi>Bodys</hi> and to their <hi>situation</hi> upon the same <hi>Plan,</hi> and <hi>visual</hi> point; there is nothing but what is most exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regular: For, albeit the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> whom we behold in <hi>front</hi> of the <hi>Table,</hi> with one of her knees upon the ground, holding her <hi>Child</hi> under her <hi>right</hi> arme, and protecting it with the <hi>other</hi> against a <hi>Soldier,</hi> who seems to deal a back-stroak with his <hi>sword</hi> at its head; and that the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> appear also at first, as if they should rather be seen by the <hi>side</hi> of the <hi>should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> than by <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Breast</hi>; Yet, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due and mature consideration of the <hi>line</hi> of their <hi>position,</hi> which is directly turn'd towards the <hi>Diagonal</hi> of the <hi>squares,</hi> and <hi>divisions</hi> of the <hi>Plan</hi>; one shall perfectly discover, that their <hi>Aspect</hi> ought to differ from <hi>those,</hi> whose <hi>situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is <hi>parallel</hi> to the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Picture</hi>: Besides, that in the contention of those two <hi>Figures,</hi> one may perceive a great and violent contorsion in their <hi>Bodies,</hi> towards the parts which they discover to us.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58393:47"/>
in all our five <hi>Fundamental</hi> points; since there is no other expedient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can arrive to the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 'ere we speak of the <hi>Situation</hi> of the <hi>Figures</hi> in this Design, we must first consider, that the <hi>Square</hi> of this <hi>Table</hi> is very different from the two <hi>precedent</hi> ones, where the Extent of the <hi>Ground-plot</hi> exceeded that of the height; when as in this <hi>Piece,</hi> the height is superiour to the <hi>bredth,</hi> by a great space, and as was meet, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the form of the <hi>Cross,</hi> which is the principal <hi>Figure,</hi> and as it were the <hi>Scale</hi> of the <hi>Table</hi>; which I therefore observe, and mention beforehand, that when I shall hereafter come to discourse of the <hi>Site</hi> or <hi>Collocation</hi> which each <hi>Body</hi> has in <hi>Perspective,</hi> we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comprehend the Particular difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is usually met withal in such <hi>Histories</hi> as these, where the greatest part of the <hi>Figures</hi> are up in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and suspended above the <hi>Plan</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being <hi>established,</hi> let us consider, with what circumspection our judicious <hi>Painter</hi> placed his <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> not onely in the midst of his <hi>Piece,</hi> but as he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58393:48"/>
has turn'd him also towards the right side, whence he receives the <hi>Light</hi>; and so makes him to descend between the armes of his beloved <hi>Disciple,</hi> who receives him with a <hi>Compassion,</hi> and a <hi>Love,</hi> better perceived by the <hi>Figure,</hi> then possibly to be described.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Composition</hi> of this <hi>Piece</hi> has this singularity remarkable, that it comprehends as it were two several <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donances</hi> of <hi>Figures</hi>; the <hi>one</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Women</hi>; the first of which being all in the <hi>ayre,</hi> represent those who are working to <hi>un-naile</hi> our B. <hi>Lord,</hi> and take down his <hi>Body</hi> from the <hi>Cross</hi>; and those are <hi>Men</hi>; as being of the most vigorous and active <hi>Sex,</hi> and therefore fittest to set their hands to this painfull enterprise: The other <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donance,</hi> which is disposed after the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual manner upon the <hi>Plan,</hi> consists of four <hi>Women,</hi> amongst whom the B. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> is the onely considerable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has assign'd her the most <hi>eminent</hi> place at the foot of the <hi>Cross,</hi> where the <hi>Maries,</hi> about her, do as it were, render her the same <hi>devoires,</hi> which <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and his <hi>Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> do to her <hi>Son.</hi> These judicious <hi>Observations</hi> you shall ever find in the

                  <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Raphaels</hi> Scholars; but since they are in very small number, and that <hi>Raphael</hi> sufficiently shews himself to have been their Master, as may easily be seen in comparing his <hi>Compositions</hi> with that of <hi>others,</hi> by some transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent markes of his <hi>Invention</hi> above them, I will onely touch <hi>one</hi> of them in passing, as being of that <hi>Mode</hi> which the <hi>Italians</hi> usually call <hi>ill Costume.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose one were to <hi>paint</hi> the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the <hi>terrestrial Paradise,</hi> when upon the suggestion of the <hi>Serpent</hi> they tasted of the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <hi>Fruit:</hi> A <hi>Painter</hi> is here to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he introduce no other <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> or any <hi>Buildings</hi> in the <hi>Land-skip,</hi> which would be a fault <hi>unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,</hi> and repugnant to that <hi>Costume</hi> and <hi>Decorum</hi> of which we speak: And yet even this strange <hi>inadvertency</hi> has been committed by our famous <hi>Artist,</hi> in one of his best <hi>Pieces</hi> graven by <hi>Marc.

                  <p>But we have yet found a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable <hi>Error</hi> in a <hi>Piece</hi> of that great <hi>Tramontan</hi> Master, <hi>Albert Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>; where <hi>painting</hi> the <hi>Nativity</hi> of our

                  </p>
                  <p>These few <hi>Instances</hi> may suffice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the importance of this piece of <hi>Art,</hi> without which a <hi>Painter,</hi> be he never so great a <hi>Designer,</hi> knowing in <hi>Perspective,</hi> good <hi>Colorist,</hi> and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a <hi>Practitioner</hi>: I say, if with all these, he be not well skill'd in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> men will take exceptions at his work.

the eyes of the <hi>judicious</hi>; they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless reproachable: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as they are frequently the most obvious to <hi>them,</hi> and subject to the <hi>Censures</hi> of <hi>Learned</hi> Persons; they prove the more unexcusable, and of worse Consequence; as it were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shame for an <hi>Historian</hi> to insert some false <hi>passage</hi> in his <hi>Relation,</hi> or talk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly, and to no purpose, then to have us'd an <hi>obsolete</hi> Word, or un-usual <hi>Phrase.</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Painter</hi> therefore who would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to some degree of reputation in his <hi>Profession,</hi> should be exceedingly exact in this <hi>Decorum,</hi> and make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one of his principal <hi>studies,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing universally agreeable to all our Five <hi>Fundamental Maximes,</hi> and so far perfecting its harmony, that one may well esteem it for the crown of all the rest: But when all this is done, we are not yet to imagine, that to comply with these <hi>Essentials,</hi> 'tis enough we avoid the <hi>Impertinences,</hi> and <hi>grosser</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes which we have mention'd; but we must also endeavour to appear <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,</hi> and knowing, how to <hi>express</hi> the <hi>subjects</hi> which we take in hand.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58393:56"/>
absolutely necessary, and without <hi>which</hi> he is never to be reputed for an <hi>Able-man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us in the first place then consider what the <hi>Evangelist</hi> teaches us of this <hi>History,</hi> that we may the better see, whether the <hi>Idea</hi> which this great Wit <hi>Mich.

                  <p>We read in many passages of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> particularly towards the end of St. <hi>Matthews Gospel,</hi> That at the last <hi>Iudgment day,</hi> the <hi>Sun shall be darkned, and the Moon shall not give her light.</hi> That the <hi>Starrs of Heaven shall fall</hi>; and <hi>the Sign of the Son of Man</hi> shall be <hi>displayed</hi> before all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> who shall then be surprised with horrid consternation, when they shall see this terrible <hi>Iudg</hi> appearing in the <hi>Clowds,</hi> accompanied, and environ'd with all the <hi>Celestial</hi> Court, and sitting upon a dreadful <hi>Tribunal,</hi> with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressable <hi>Majesty</hi>; the twelve <hi>Apostles</hi> being at his right hand as <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Assessors,</hi> with a most glorious assembly of <hi>Saints</hi> following in goodly <hi>Order</hi>; whilest there stands beneath at his left hand, an innumerable multitude of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58393:57"/>
                     <hi>Reprobate</hi> and wicked Persons, in fearful and unimaginable <hi>Confusion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What shall we now say of this <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Mich. Angelos,</hi> if we find nothing of all this in it! Is it to be conceiv'd he should not <hi>think</hi> of what he was to do, before he took <hi>Pencil</hi> in hand? Or that he should engage himself in a <hi>story</hi> so considerable without knowing of it, and a <hi>story</hi> of <hi>Iudgment</hi>!</p>
                  <p>This modern <hi>Painter</hi> had been very unhappy to have lived in the dayes of those Ancient <hi>Criticks,</hi> who used to be so rigorous and exact, as never to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don any thing; no, not even in the greatest <hi>Masters,</hi> who by the excellency of their <hi>Pensils,</hi> and sublime <hi>Genius's,</hi> had so much exalted the <hi>Art,</hi> and born the renown of their <hi>Profession</hi> to that pitch, as had been altogether inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to this <hi>Scrabler.</hi> I deny not but he might have pass'd among them, for the <hi>Mechanical</hi> part of <hi>Painting</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one who well enough design'd the <hi>Contours,</hi> out-strokes and <hi>Proportions</hi> of his <hi>Figures</hi>) but his strange <hi>impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> in what concern'd <hi>Invention</hi>; his fanatical <hi>Ideas,</hi> full of filthy and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Expressions,</hi> had for ever rendred him uncapable of being admitted into

the <hi>Society</hi> of good <hi>Painters</hi>; nor would he ever have been numbred amongst them but as a <hi>Sophist</hi> amongst true <hi>Philosophers,</hi> or as a Stone-cutter, or inferior <hi>Mason</hi> in the equipage of a good <hi>Architect.</hi>

               <p>But before I pass to the next <hi>Print,</hi> I would willingly resolve a <hi>Quoere,</hi> which may happly appear difficult to some, Why so near the <hi>Cross,</hi> upon a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and rocky piece of ground, he should plant that single great <hi>Tree,</hi> furnish'd with leaves, and flourishing as in the height of Summer; the H. <hi>Gospel</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning nothing of any such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? Upon consideration of our learned and judicious <hi>Workmans</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I perceiv'd that it was a <hi>Cedar</hi>; tall, strait, and without any fruit: And in truth this Mystical <hi>Introduction</hi> is highly ingenious; the <hi>Cedar</hi> being the real <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> who is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58393:63"/>
styled the <hi>Spouse</hi> in so many places of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> particularly the <hi>Canticles</hi>; where he is so curiously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted for his ravishing beauty, by a comparison of the <hi>Cedars</hi> of Mount <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus, Species ejus ut Libani, electus ut Cedri,</hi> &amp;c. from the extraordinary <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude, incorruptibility, Odor, strength, use</hi> in <hi>Building,</hi> and salutary <hi>shade</hi> of this goodly <hi>Tree</hi>: so as from this assembly of so many <hi>transcendent</hi> Qualities, it does most fitly (of all other Trees) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the <hi>Church,</hi> and those principal <hi>Heads</hi> that compose her; namely, the <hi>Apostles, Prophets,</hi> and holy <hi>Fathers</hi>: Besides, mystically apply'd, it may farther be taken for the <hi>Cross</hi> of our B. <hi>Saviour</hi>; since the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Cedar</hi> is esteemed so soveraign a <hi>Remedy</hi> against <hi>Leprosie,</hi> which, 'tis reported, it both cleanses and heals. In summe, it most visibly appears, that it was placed in this <hi>Composition</hi> with so much reason and judgment, as from hence alone we may safely pronounce in favour of this <hi>rare,</hi> though <hi>modern</hi> Painter, worthy in truth of all that <hi>glory</hi> which has been attributed to the most <hi>renowned</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> since his <hi>Works</hi> discover to us the same <hi>Genius</hi> that they so much

admir'd in their <hi>Trimantes:</hi> For even the <hi>least</hi> things to appearance are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd <hi>great</hi> and considerable, by the <hi>mysterious</hi> intention of the <hi>Painter,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> and minister as much to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of the <hi>Learned,</hi> as the most principal <hi>Figures</hi> of an <hi>History</hi>: This is the <hi>Talent</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> so singularly admires in all the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Timantes,</hi> and where he takes occasion to say of him, that <hi>In omnibus ejus operibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligitur plus semper quam pingitur, &amp; cum ars summa sit, Ingenium tamen ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra artem est.

of our <hi>modern</hi> Workman, somewhat bold and over-confident, as it concerns his foundation (not to judge of the greatness and strength of the <hi>Lyon</hi> by one of his <hi>Claws</hi>;) I shall prevent their objections; if taking the sense of my <hi>Proposition</hi> rigorously, they conceive my intentions were to render the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of these two <hi>Painters</hi> so equal, as to assign them the same rank: I must then explain my meaning, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my esteem for <hi>Raphael</hi> may be, my resolution is to render all just defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to those illustrious <hi>Ancients,</hi> and such as were like <hi>Timantes,</hi> and do cheerfully acknowledg, that the <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the latter <hi>Age</hi> are inferiour to them; from whence I infer, in favour of <hi>Raphael,</hi> that he having best of all succeded in discovering the <hi>path</hi> which those great <hi>Masters</hi> trod, and being born with a <hi>Genius</hi> equal to them, did not onely arrive to the first degree of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> but seems to have even been incorporated of their <hi>Company,</hi> and of the same <hi>Sect</hi> with those ancient <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals</hi> themselves, who have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us such glorious <hi>Ideas</hi> of their excellency in the <hi>Memories</hi> of <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:58393:65"/>Now if we consider in what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they speak of them, and what it was that we find so highly celebrated in their <hi>Works,</hi> we shall perceive, they esteem'd nothing in them so much, as the <hi>Novelty,</hi> and (as I may call it) the <hi>arguteness</hi> and ingenuity of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>; by which they discover'd, that <hi>Painting</hi> was an <hi>Art</hi> purely <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>: For that which consists onely in the <hi>Mechanical</hi> address, is so material and heavy, that they hardly made any account of it. Neither did they regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the <hi>Prise</hi> of their <hi>Tables</hi> either by the <hi>number</hi> or <hi>largeness</hi> of the <hi>Figures</hi>; for it frequently happen'd, that the straitness and inconveniencies of the <hi>Place,</hi> and barrenness of the <hi>subject,</hi> gave occasion to those great <hi>Genius's</hi> to derive advantage from it; and to produce something which surmounted the reputation and renown of the more exuberant <hi>Compositions.</hi> This <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us also in the same <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he has made so handsome a recital, and elegant description of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> painted by <hi>Timantes,</hi> in which were assembled a very great number of <hi>Figures.</hi> For he afterwards speaks of another <hi>Work</hi> of the same

               </p>
               <p>By this means it is, that <hi>Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Iulio Romano</hi> have not only exceeded all other <hi>Painters</hi> of their <hi>Age,</hi> but have in some degree rendred themselves comparable to the most renowned of the <hi>Antients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we may now make some useful reflexions upon those two several <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi>

of the same <hi>subject, viz.</hi> the sleeping <hi>Polyphemus's</hi>: The first, which is that of <hi>Timanthes,</hi> will shew us, that a small <hi>Piece</hi> may sometimes emerge a great and noble <hi>Master-piece,</hi> according as the <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Painter</hi> is qualified and heightned, whence one may judge, that there is no <hi>Argument</hi> so poor and barren, but what may be inrich'd by an ingenious and fruitful <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>; and that 'tis now and then more advantagious to the glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the <hi>Work</hi> to be oblig'd to adorn and <hi>Cultivate</hi> a mean and sterile <hi>subject,</hi> than to be overwhelmed under the abundance of a more ample <hi>History,</hi> from which one should rather retrench, and <hi>abate</hi> something of <hi>Essential,</hi> than presume to <hi>add</hi> any thing of our <hi>own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the other <hi>Composition</hi> of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Iulio Romano,</hi> it does in effect shew us, that an ingenious <hi>Imitation,</hi> may equal, and even exceed the <hi>original</hi>; and that by consequent, it is not less glorious so to imitate by a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of another, and refine upon them, as he has done, than it is reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a <hi>Painter</hi> mechanicaly to <hi>Copy</hi> a whole Piece, <hi>Figure</hi> for <hi>Figure,</hi> without
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58393:68"/>
any thing of his own, but the pains he has taken, and the servile subjection of a simple <hi>Workman</hi>: Seeing this kind of Labour is not so much esteem'd the <hi>work</hi> of a <hi>Painter,</hi> as the <hi>study</hi> of an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentise</hi> only. Hence we find, that those <hi>Copiers,</hi> who are so poorly spirited as to aspire no higher than to make <hi>that</hi> their aime, have never been reputed among the <hi>rank</hi> of <hi>Painters,</hi> but as <hi>Eunuches</hi> are among <hi>Men,</hi> uncapable of <hi>producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and defective in their particular <hi>species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>digression</hi> has a little deverted us again from <hi>Raphael,</hi> our first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Object,</hi> though we still kept sight of him, and pursu'd his footsteps, by the guidance and signal of <hi>Iulio.</hi> But 'tis now high time to rejoyn again, and make no more such sallies from him, who has hitherto furnish'd us with all our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by his excellent productions, the <hi>examen</hi> whereof has greatly aided us in forming that visible and demonstrable <hi>Truth</hi>; namely, the necessity of those <hi>Principles</hi> which we have establish'd, to attain the perfection of <hi>Painting.</hi> Let us therefore return to this first <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and conclude our <hi>discourse</hi> in the same <hi>stile</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> we began with.

Now this incomparable <hi>Painter,</hi> whose <hi>Works</hi> are so many <hi>exemplars</hi> from whence we may deduce the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> has produc'd such variety of them, that amidst such <hi>Plenty</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, 'tis hard to resolve upon the choice of <hi>one</hi> before <hi>another,</hi> that which we saw <hi>last,</hi> always seeming to be the <hi>best.</hi> But since it is not our intention to <hi>Criticise</hi> his <hi>Compositions</hi> piece by piece, to judge <hi>decisively</hi> which of them to <hi>preferre,</hi> (which were an odious, and a rash undertaking) it shall suffice us to elect <hi>one</hi> of the most remarkable which is in <hi>Print,</hi> that the <hi>curious</hi> setting it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and studying it at leasure, may together with us, pass their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon it.</p>

               <p>But before we proceed to the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> of this <hi>Composition,</hi> I shall adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise the <hi>curious,</hi> that the <hi>Graver</hi> who design'd and publish'd it, was not so well acquainted with the <hi>Subject</hi> which it signifies, as may appear by the <hi>Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> in these words. <hi>Paulus Athenis

               </p>
               <p>That which makes me take notice of the <hi>Inscription</hi> is, the importance there is of knowing the truth of the <hi>History</hi> which lies before us: for if this great <hi>Doctor</hi> speak truth, <hi>Raphaels Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> will prove very extravagant; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, being rightly understood, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Authors</hi> intention, 'tis both admirable and excellent, as we shall demonstrate in what we are going to add farther.

it was very necessary to discover to the bottom, the quality and spirit of this ample <hi>Historian</hi>; since by a lesser <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> I should never have disabus'd the world, and shew'd them the weak and trifling reasonings of their great <hi>habla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>; his <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> having been, till now, in such esteem with the Lovers of <hi>Painting,</hi> and who in effect, have some reason for it; because generally you find in them the principal <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Painters,</hi> and a <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of their most considerable <hi>Works:</hi> besides, the <hi>Author</hi> being a pretty tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable <hi>designer,</hi> and (as indeed it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears sufficiently) had more wit in his <hi>fingers-ends,</hi> than in his <hi>head,</hi> he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd his <hi>discourse</hi> with their <hi>Pictures,</hi> which compose the best, and most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious part of his <hi>Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though from this quality of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,</hi> one might reasonably conclude him a good <hi>Painter</hi>; yet the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his <hi>Idea</hi> (which has made him to fancy such strange <hi>Chymaeras</hi> in this Composure of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and render him strangely impertinent) appears to me an indubitable proof, not only of his <hi>Ignorance</hi> of any real knowledge in <hi>Painting,</hi> but of the <hi>weakness</hi> also and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58393:74"/>
incapacity of his <hi>Genius,</hi> as to those <hi>two</hi> prime <hi>Talents</hi> of this incomparable and most judicious <hi>Profession,</hi> namely, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> and <hi>Decorum,</hi> of which by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous <hi>admirations,</hi> he discovers that he had not so much as the least tincture, nor indeed any natural disposition of acquiring them; so as it has prov'd a kind of misfortune to <hi>Raphael,</hi> that he fell into the hands of so miserable a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrist,</hi> who instead of celebrating <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>works,</hi> does miserably <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>grace</hi> them by his wretched and ignorant <hi>descriptions.</hi> But</p>
               <p>As of <hi>old,</hi> it was not lawful for every one that had a mind to't, to go to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>; so, nor is it for every <hi>Painter</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>discourse</hi> upon the <hi>works</hi> of this admirable Painter. It had far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter become <hi>Vasari</hi> to have mention'd him as a simple <hi>Historian</hi> onely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out presuming to the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of his <hi>Thoughts</hi> in his <hi>Composures</hi>: for if what he <hi>here</hi> describes after his guise, and which he endeavors to magnifie by so many wild exaggerations, were no more visible than his <hi>Writings</hi> have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it; what can we tollerably judge or conclude of them?

and gentleness of his Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; besides, that such <hi>vague</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd <hi>Subjects</hi> as this is, leave am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple field to <hi>Invention</hi>; so as 'tis suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they do not exceed the limits of <hi>verisimilitude,</hi> without captiuating their <hi>Genius</hi> to the rigor of precise <hi>Truth.</hi>

               <p>Beholding our <hi>Table</hi> then in this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> one may allow a much more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious application to each <hi>Figure,</hi> than by contenting our selves in general, to pass them all for simple <hi>Academicians,</hi> Sectators of our two great <hi>Gymnasiarch's</hi>: And 'tis probable enough, that <hi>Raphael</hi> did propose to himself something more refin'd in this ample and magnifical <hi>Composition.</hi> For wherefore should he else set a <hi>Crown</hi> upon the head of the <hi>Astrologer</hi> or <hi>Geographer</hi> (take Him for either) who holds a <hi>Globe</hi> in his hand, had it not been to shew us by it, that he meant <hi>Ptolomie</hi> whom he would digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with that <hi>Character</hi>; and for that he is call'd, by way of eminency, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Astrologers</hi> and <hi>Geographers</hi>? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding yet, since he was neither <hi>Contemporary,</hi> nor so much as <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot</hi> with any of the former, it might well create some <hi>scruple</hi> amongst <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics</hi> to meet them <hi>here</hi> together.

days, St. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Boulognia, Rosso, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toret, Paulo-Veroneze, Parmesano, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minet, Iosepin,</hi> and a number of such <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signers,</hi> Practitioners of the same forme) may render them so remiss and stupid, that they will rather choose to remain and dwell in the possession of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful good, than take the pains which the sedulous <hi>study</hi> and application of these knowing <hi>Masters</hi> do necessarily exact of them: For certain it is, that <hi>Things</hi> which are <hi>excellent,</hi> cost in their <hi>Production,</hi> and are attain'd with <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>; the <hi>second-Thoughts</hi> of <hi>Wise-men</hi> are commonly the more <hi>judicious</hi> and advis'd than the <hi>first</hi>; whence 'tis just to conclude, that those <hi>Painters</hi> to whom all <hi>subjects</hi> seem'd <hi>alike,</hi> who <hi>find</hi> no more <hi>difficulty</hi> in <hi>one,</hi> than in <hi>another,</hi> and who after the first <hi>Idea</hi> which they form of a <hi>Table,</hi> set down, and <hi>excogitate</hi> no farther, by either <hi>changing</hi> or <hi>adding</hi> any thing in their <hi>Pieces</hi>; I say, such <hi>Painters</hi> have but superficial endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whose productions will never gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Intelligent men, who finding nothing of <hi>rare</hi> and well <hi>studied</hi> in their <hi>Works</hi> extraordinary, will be soon wearied with a transitory view of their <hi>Labors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I call nothing <hi>studied,</hi> but that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58393:82"/>
which concerns the operations of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and those judicious <hi>Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon that part of <hi>decorum,</hi> which is the very ligament and band of <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Expression,</hi> the noblest of our <hi>Five Principles,</hi> and in which all that's ingenious and sublime in <hi>Painting</hi> does consist. The other <hi>Three,</hi> namely, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, Colouring</hi> and <hi>Perspective,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port rather the <hi>Mechanical part</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> than the more <hi>spiritual</hi> and refined, and are, as one may say, the <hi>Instruments</hi> of the <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> so as those who bend all their <hi>studies</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon <hi>them,</hi> work rather like Men of a <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Mysterie</hi>; and therefore have never obtain'd other <hi>name</hi> amongst the universally knowing, than <hi>Practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi> in <hi>designing,</hi> who would never have been considerable amongst the <hi>Antient-Painters</hi>: Howbeit, seeing they far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the rest in multitude, the current Abuse, and a certain presumptuous <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> which at present <hi>tyrannises</hi> over this <hi>Art,</hi> has so abandon'd the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Painters</hi> to them, and added so many fortunate advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages above <hi>Those</hi> who are truly the Sons of <hi>Art</hi>; that the <hi>last</hi> we speak of, come seldom to enjoy the fruit, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58393:83"/>
which is due to them, till it be very late; continuing for the most part op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest as long as they live, by the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> and <hi>Cabals</hi> of the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> amongst whom, <hi>Painting</hi> is at this day but a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> and gross <hi>Idol,</hi> whereas heretofore <hi>she</hi> was consider'd as a <hi>Deity</hi> altogether <hi>spiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poor <hi>Dominiquin,</hi> who was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless the most able of all <hi>Caraces</hi> Scholars, and happ'ly, the most worthy the name of <hi>Painter,</hi> had long succum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed under this disgrace; though almost all his <hi>Competitors</hi> were inferior to him, and not worthy to be nam'd in the day with him; excepting <hi>Guido,</hi> who was indeed by <hi>Nature</hi> more favour'd than the other for a <hi>Gracefulness</hi> which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him singular in his time; but who was no ways comparable to him for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> and <hi>less</hi> yet in the skill of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Perspective</hi>: What shall we say then of the blindness and stupidity of the <hi>Painters</hi> of our days; who prefer a <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sepin,</hi> a <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> and such <hi>Manierists</hi> before him, whose <hi>Works</hi> containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing save the false dazle of I know not <hi>what Novelty,</hi> which they stile, forsooth, a <hi>Fury</hi> of <hi>Designe,</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi> that their ignorance of the <hi>native
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58393:83"/>
Beauty,</hi> and true <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> makes them admire, never preserv'd their <hi>Reputation</hi> any longer, than this transitory favour and partiality of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> continued to indulge them; so as they are now banish'd out of the <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> and <hi>Collections</hi> of the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> who being at last dis-abus'd, are grown quite weary of them.</p>
               <p>The same perversion of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> seconded with the natural jealousie of the <hi>Italians</hi> (who will by no means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that <hi>Painting</hi> should smile upon any other <hi>Nation</hi> but their <hi>own</hi>) had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to exercise the like <hi>Injustice</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that illustrious <hi>Frenchman, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Poussin,</hi> the worthiest certainly, that has appear'd since the days of those renowned <hi>Antient</hi> Painters, <hi>Apelles Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes, Protogenes,</hi> and the rest of those <hi>famous</hi> men.</p>
               <p>But since it were difficult for <hi>me</hi> to render this <hi>Testimony</hi> of him without suspicion of flattery, speaking of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (<hi>so lately</hi>) living, and born a <hi>French man</hi>; yet as his Works have already gain'd so many <hi>Triumphs</hi> over all their <hi>Envy,</hi> and that his merit has been so powerful (though in a strange <hi>Countrey</hi>) to produce, and elevate it self with so
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58393:84"/>
much Luster, above its <hi>Rivals,</hi> at no less than <hi>four hundred Leagues</hi> distance from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and in the Reign of the greatest <hi>Favourer,</hi> that the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> must ever hope for, since the <hi>King</hi> himself (who has so far honor'd him as to call him to his service) is an excellent <hi>Designer,</hi> and universally <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in all good <hi>Arts</hi>: It has proved a <hi>conjuncture</hi> infinitely advantagious to our <hi>Painter,</hi> and a <hi>Iustice</hi> which <hi>Fortune</hi> owed him; so as it seems, <hi>she</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways blinded, nor envious at the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of <hi>deserving-men.</hi> Since that time, all the reputation of his <hi>Competitors</hi> has rather serv'd to establish his <hi>Glory,</hi> than be an obstacle to it; and now we see visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, by comparing their <hi>Works</hi> together, that this <hi>Poussin</hi> is in effect a great <hi>Eagle</hi> in his <hi>Profession,</hi> or to say better, and without a <hi>Trope,</hi> the most perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd <hi>Painter</hi> of all the <hi>Moderns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no difficulty in making this appear to knowing-men, who examine and judge things like <hi>Geometritians,</hi> that is to say, rigorously, and as they ought, by pure <hi>demonstration,</hi> and the <hi>Analyses</hi> of its <hi>Principles,</hi> without gratifying <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> or <hi>Favour</hi>; which are the very <hi>bane</hi> and <hi>peste</hi> of <hi>Truth:</hi> But those who are

                  <hi>Masters</hi> onely of superficial knowledge, and will yet be presuming upon their <hi>Iudgements,</hi> may happ'ly take this for a <hi>Paradox,</hi> and thereby render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves uncapable of being inlightned: I shall therefore quit this <hi>discussion,</hi> and content my self to have in this <hi>Treatise</hi> establish'd the Fundamental <hi>Maximes</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> which we make use of in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining</hi> the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Painters,</hi> without any farther interesting my self in this <hi>Controversie</hi>: Onely, I would add by way of <hi>Advise,</hi> that those who have the <hi>Curiosity</hi> to come to the <hi>decisive</hi> Proof of what I affirm, will find it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently demonstrated in that <hi>Work</hi> of his of the <hi>Seven Sacraments,</hi> which are to be seen at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the <hi>Possession</hi> of <hi>Monsieur de Chantelou, Master</hi> of the <hi>Houshold</hi> in <hi>Ordinary</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> an intimate and dear <hi>Friend</hi> of this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Painter.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Consequence</hi> of <hi>Seven</hi> Uniform <hi>Tables,</hi> of a midling size, but consisting of an extraordinary <hi>study,</hi> where this noble <hi>Artist,</hi> seems to have given us the utmost proof, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>regularity</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> according to all the <hi>Parts</hi> explicated in the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> but of its <hi>supremest</hi> excellency likewise, by the <hi>Novelty</hi> of his <hi>Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58393:85"/>
the greatness of his <hi>Idea</hi> upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Argument,</hi> by the profound and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious observation of the <hi>decorum,</hi> (in which he is almost singular) by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of his the <hi>Expressions,</hi> and in a word, by all the very <hi>Qualities</hi> of those illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Genius's</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> amongst whom (I perswade my self) he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd one of the most eminent ranks; since we generally find in his <hi>Works,</hi> the same excellencies which <hi>Pliny</hi> and others have observ'd of their <hi>Apelles, Zeuxis, Timantes, Protogenes,</hi> and the rest of that first <hi>Class</hi> of <hi>Painters</hi>: For if <hi>Apelles</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd so rare a <hi>Person</hi> amongst them for his knowing how to represent the noise of <hi>Thunder</hi>; one may see in the subject I am speaking of, that our <hi>Poussin</hi> has even painted the very <hi>Voice</hi>; which is so much the more <hi>difficult</hi> to express, as in effect it is less <hi>sensible</hi>: I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd this ingenious <hi>stroke</hi> in his first <hi>Piece</hi> of the <hi>Seven Sacraments,</hi> where St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> conferring <hi>Baptisme</hi> on our B. <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Standers-by</hi> who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and ready to receive him for their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> do visibly discover it by the <hi>surprise</hi> and astonishment in which they appear looking up to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and on every side about them,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58393:85"/>
from whence the <hi>Voice</hi> seem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, <hi>This is my Beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Author</hi> who propos'd (as altogether <hi>miraculous</hi> in <hi>Painting</hi>) this expression of <hi>Thunder,</hi> adds farther, that this great Master <hi>Apelles,</hi> took delight to represent the <hi>Histories</hi> of <hi>Agonizing</hi> and dying Persons; And we <hi>here</hi> meet with (by I know not what fortuitous encounter) that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream <hi>Unction</hi> presented the same <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to our <hi>Painter</hi>; who being about to handle this holy <hi>Mysterie,</hi> under a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and magnificent <hi>Idea,</hi> suitable to his <hi>Genius,</hi> has expresly chosen the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of a <hi>Roman Captain</hi> in his last <hi>Agony,</hi> environ'd by all his <hi>Relations; Mother, Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and a number more of his <hi>Domestics,</hi> every one of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally afflicted with regret or compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; amongst whom, and in the most <hi>conspicuous</hi> place, he has painted the <hi>Priest</hi> assisting the poor <hi>Dying-man,</hi> and administring the Holy <hi>Oyls</hi> with a <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> full of <hi>Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should be over tedious to undertake here the description of all those other <hi>Considerations,</hi> and judicious <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> to be seen in this admirable Composition: I should sooner have said
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58393:86"/>
in a word, that 'tis the real <hi>Parallel</hi> of that famous <hi>Master-piece</hi> of <hi>Timanthes</hi> upon the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> which I have already mention'd, and which <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> describe to us as the rarest, most ingenious and accomplish'd <hi>Table</hi> of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> But to determine whether of the <hi>Two</hi>; their <hi>Old,</hi> or our <hi>Modern</hi> has express'd his <hi>Subject</hi> with greater <hi>Art,</hi> and more <hi>Pathetically,</hi> is a <hi>Question</hi> I cannot resolve; contenting my self in affirming <hi>this,</hi> that amongst all our <hi>Modern Painters,</hi> our <hi>Poussin</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears another <hi>Timantes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same reason which restrains me from any farther engaging in the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of this excellent <hi>Composition,</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me to pass over the rest of this great <hi>Work,</hi> which makes up but its <hi>Seventh part</hi>; besides, that the <hi>Enterprise</hi> would prove too vast for me, who have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy transgress'd the <hi>limits</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to myself at my first setting out.</p>
               <p>I will only add <hi>one</hi> thing in general, which seems very considerable to me, and worthy of <hi>remark,</hi> with which I shall conclude. That every one of these <hi>Pieces</hi> are so <hi>admirable</hi> in their kind, that 'tis <hi>Impossible</hi> to particularise in any <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> one of the whole <hi>Seven,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58393:86"/>
to have the least advantage of the <hi>other,</hi> as to what concerns the <hi>Artist</hi>: For though the <hi>story</hi> of the respective <hi>Mysteries</hi> which they <hi>represent,</hi> were not always equally redundant, and fit for <hi>expression</hi>; yet this puissant <hi>Genius</hi> knew so well how to <hi>proportion</hi> each part of his <hi>Subject</hi> to the tearms of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>equalities,</hi> and give so <hi>relative</hi> a <hi>perfection</hi> to the <hi>whole,</hi> that he has left us no place for our <hi>choice,</hi> or that we could <hi>wish</hi> for any <hi>one</hi> of them, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>another</hi>: For though each <hi>Table,</hi> consider'd by it self, and separated from this <hi>Vnion,</hi> or, as one may say, this <hi>Encyclopedia</hi> of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> be usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look'd on as a compleat and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>History</hi> from the rest; yet our <hi>Painters</hi> original <hi>Intention,</hi> being to form of them <hi>One particular mystical body,</hi> compos'd of these <hi>seven</hi> holy <hi>Members</hi> (which is the oblest <hi>Idea</hi> could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the <hi>Mind</hi> of a <hi>Christian Painter,</hi> and which is so <hi>peculiar,</hi> that it seems not to have been ever thought of by any before him) striv'd to render it a <hi>Chef d' Oeure,</hi> in which he has discover'd himself such a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of the <hi>Subjects</hi> he undertakes, that we may easily conclude, he knew how
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58393:87"/>
to have done as much, even in the most <hi>barren</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> Argument, as in the most <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>magnificent</hi>; the fecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his <hi>spirit</hi> having no need of any aids from <hi>Matter,</hi> which at first appears as incredible to be <hi>affirm'd</hi> of him, as it is realy <hi>true,</hi> and visible in the <hi>Works</hi> of his, by the equality which he has introduc'd with so much <hi>Art</hi> in each particular, that there is nothing which <hi>domineers</hi> above the rest; And this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of <hi>Perfection</hi> is an <hi>Effect</hi> of the most <hi>Consummate</hi> Excellency which is to be attain'd.</p>
               <p>I thought to finish this <hi>demonstration,</hi> which certainly had been very glorious to him, in setting <hi>one</hi> of these <hi>seven</hi> Compositions in <hi>Parallel</hi> with a subject resembling it, treated of either by <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onardo da Vinci,</hi> or <hi>Raphael</hi>; for after these two <hi>Soveraigne Painters,</hi> we need seek no more of the <hi>Moderns</hi> capable of this noble <hi>Contestation.</hi> But when I had well consider'd, that those kinds of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons</hi> are almost always <hi>odious,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to refer the <hi>Decision</hi> to all the <hi>World,</hi> without a syllable more, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self to affirm, that I had for this reason cast mine eyes upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> that renowned
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58393:87"/>
                  <hi>Supper</hi> of our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> which he <hi>paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> in the time of our great <hi>King Francis</hi> the <hi>First</hi>; which succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so well for the fortunate <hi>Artist,</hi> that it purchas'd him the good Grace of their illustrious <hi>Monarch,</hi> who did him the honour to invite him to his <hi>Court,</hi> and retain him ever after in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Service.</hi> We have in the Royal <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> of St. <hi>Germains</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good <hi>Copy</hi> of this <hi>Supper,</hi> which many believe to be of the very hand of <hi>Leonardo</hi> himself. But the same <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> has been frequently treated of by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi> and are all to be seen in <hi>Stamp,</hi> which is a most commodious expedient by which to <hi>paragon</hi> them, with that which we have in our <hi>Poussins Work</hi> of the <hi>Seven Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to arrive to this accurate <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme</hi> with the requisite circumspection, and follow the guidance of our <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>; we must above all things remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with what importance we have there establish'd the diligent <hi>observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>decorum,</hi> in which consists the principal <hi>Magistry</hi> of <hi>Painting,</hi> and which is indeed (as we may say) the very <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul</hi> of it, as the rest of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical</hi> supplements, <hi>Colour</hi> and the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:58393:88"/>
of <hi>Figures</hi> compose the <hi>Body</hi> only with its <hi>Organical</hi> members: so as without the intelligence of this <hi>first</hi> part, nothing can be acceptable to the eyes of knowing men, who are always more offended with <hi>errors</hi> in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> the most <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in an <hi>History,</hi> than in what may possibly be defective in the <hi>Mechanical</hi> part. Behold <hi>here</hi> the very <hi>knot</hi> of the <hi>Question,</hi> which yet will not prove so difficult to unravel, when we shall be fully instructed in the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> of this <hi>Supper,</hi> and above all in the <hi>posture</hi> which they us'd at <hi>Table</hi> in those days, which is here a very important conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and without which it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to conceive, how St. <hi>Iohn</hi> could decently repose his <hi>head</hi> upon the <hi>bosom</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi>; since in that which we may observe in some <hi>representations</hi> of it, there is expres'd a most unpardonable indecorum.</p>
               <p>In pursuit of this grand remark (the <hi>fame</hi> whereof is totally due to our knowing and most judicious <hi>Poussin</hi>; since before him we find it scarce consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by other <hi>Painters</hi>) it must visibly appear, that as this <hi>Action</hi> past at <hi>Night,</hi> the <hi>Figures</hi> could not be conspicuous,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58393:88"/>
but from an <hi>artificial</hi> light; for what other circumstance could represent it to be a <hi>Supper,</hi> and not a <hi>Dinner</hi> as well? Now these two are <hi>points</hi> so <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> that they are not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd withall without an inexcusable <hi>fault,</hi> and against all <hi>decorum.</hi> After these <hi>two</hi> rigorous <hi>observations,</hi> one may make <hi>other</hi> less important <hi>recherches</hi>; which yet would be attended with certain <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> and remarkable <hi>Circumstances,</hi> without which something will still be defective: As suppose upon that suddain <hi>emotion</hi> amongst the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> when our <hi>B. Lord</hi> had advertis'd them, that <hi>One</hi> of <hi>them</hi> should that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>night</hi> betray him; one should see St. <hi>Iohn</hi> not only <hi>leaning,</hi> but <hi>asleep</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his dear <hi>Masters</hi> bosome, without so much as taking any <hi>notice</hi> with the <hi>rest,</hi> of what was said: This would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a most <hi>unseasonable</hi> and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether disadvantagious <hi>Posture</hi> in this <hi>Instance.</hi> I purposely take notice of this <hi>Absurdity</hi> amongst others, because it is realy so <hi>usual</hi> amongst our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Painters,</hi> and did once escape even <hi>Albert Durer</hi> himself, as is to be seen by one of his <hi>stamps,</hi> though this great <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> had few <hi>equals</hi> in his <hi>Profession</hi>; but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58393:89"/>
