            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But (as God himſelfe declareth, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned us, and made us, and knoweth us beſt,) the very true end why man was made, was to know &amp; to honour God: Therefore whoſo knoweth him beſt, and honoureth him with moſt reverence, he is moſt perfect, he commeth neereſt the end of his creation.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Solomon</hi> had deſcribed the deceave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vanities of the world, and ſaid, <hi>vanitie of vanities, vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie.</hi> When he had concluded by long diſcourſe, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <note place="margin">Eccl. 1.</note> Empires, honour, pleaſures, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and whatſoever elſe under the Sunne, is but vanity: he knitteth up the matter with theſe words, <hi>Feare God, and keep his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:</hi>

               <hi>for this is the whole dutie of man:</hi> that is, this is truth, and no vanitie; this is our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; to this end are we made: not to live in eating and drinking, not to paſſe our time in pleaſure and follies, not to heap up thoſe things which are daily taken from us, or from which we are daily taken away; but that in our words, in our life, in our bodie, &amp; in our ſoule we doe ſervice unto God; that we look above the Sunne and Moone, and all the heavens; that wee become the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the holy Ghoſt; that the holy Spirit of God may dwell in us, and make us fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the glory of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore God gave his holy word, and hath continued it from the beginning of the world untill this day: notwithſtanding the Philoſophers and learned men in all ages, who ſcorned it out as the word of folly, (for ſo it ſeemeth to them that periſh;) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the wicked Princes, and Tyrants, &amp; high powers of the world, who conſumed and burnt it, as falſe and wicked and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine; notwithſtanding the whole

world and power of darkneſſe were ever bent againſt it, yet hath He wonderfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and preſerved it without loſſe of one letter untill this day: that we have whereby truly to know him the true and onely God, and his ſonne <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> whom he ſent.</p>
            <p>Therefore have we Temples &amp; Churches, places to reſort unto all together; to honour, to worſhip, and to acknowledge him to be our God; to joyne our hearts and voices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to call upon his holy name. In ſuch places God hath at all times uſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Majeſtie, and to ſhew his power; In ſuch places God hath made us a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to heare our praiers, whenſoever wee call upon him: Therefore are they called the dwelling place and houſe of God; In ſuch places all godly men ſet their greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; &amp; thought themſelves miſerable, when they were ſecluded or put off from the ſame: as the Prophet and holy Prince <hi>David, Laeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

            <p>Therefore when the Tabernacle was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; when the Arke was fet home from <hi>Obed-edom,</hi> and ſet in the mount <hi>Sion;</hi> when religion Revived, which through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and malice of <hi>Saul</hi> was forſaken; when he ſaw his Nobilitie, his Biſhops, his

            <p>But the godly man, as he rejoyceth at the beauty of Gods houſe, ſo when contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſeeth the ſame diſordered filthily, when he ſeeth the Sacraments of God abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, truth troden under foot, the people mocked, the name of God diſhonoured; he cannot but lament and mourne, and finde himſelfe wounded at heart.

When <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaw the wilfulneſſe and frowardneſſe of the people, which would not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and be obedient unto God, he cried, <hi>Oh that my head were full of water, and mine eies</hi>

            <p>Zeale (if any man know not the nature of the word) is an earneſt affection, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement love: as is the love of a mother to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her children, or of the naturall childe towards his mother: This zeale cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to ſee that thing which it loveth, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or hurt. Such zeale &amp; care carrieth God over his people; he loveth them as a mother

loveth her children; he will not ſuffer them to be hurt. By the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> he ſaith, <hi>can</hi>

            <p>But as every man, be he never ſo wicked, yea even he <hi>that ſaith in his heart, there is no God;</hi> which is become filthy and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all his doings, yet in his talke outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaith, he hath a God, and that he believeth in him: even ſo there is none ſo wicked, or ſo forſaken of God in his heart, but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth himſelfe he hath the zeale of God: and what he doth in ſelfe-love of his owne fantaſie, he will beare in hand he doth it for

But their meeting was (as <hi>David</hi> foreſpake, and as <hi>Peter</hi> declareth, and as We know) againſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed: they were touched with the zeale of their own glory, and not with the zeale of Gods truth; they ſought their own praiſe, but not the praiſe which is of God:

they made cracks that they knew the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they were the Temple of God, that they had the conſent of all Antiquity: as others have done ſince that time, and as wee ſee many doe this day: &amp; in very deed, theſe men have now even as much as they had then, as by proofe and triall it will appeare.</p>
            <p>There are others, which have a feeling of God, and a great care for his Church: but ſuch a feeling and care as cometh either of their own fantaſies, or of ſome opinion &amp; credit they have in their fathers which were before them; not of the underſtanding of Gods pleaſure.

And theſe things doe they, not of malice, nor of wilfulneſſe, nor againſt their conſcience, but becauſe they know not God the father, nor his Chriſt whom he hath ſent: therefore they ſtumble at Chriſt, and ſpurne away the Goſpell of God and think ill and ſpeak evill of the word of life, becauſe they know not the Goſpell of God, nor the word of life.

            <p>But this pride was ever in the heart of man and it appeared even in our grandfire <hi>Adam:</hi> whatſoever liketh us well, we think

that cannot but pleaſe God.

               <hi>and made Jeruſalem heapes of ſtones: the dead bodies of thy ſervants have they given to be meat unto the foules of the heaven, and the fleſh of thy Saints unto the Beaſts of the earth.</hi> At this time, when the Tabernacle was loſt, when <hi>Saul</hi> was unquiet, and the Prieſts were ſlaine, and the Prophets deſpiſed, and the people left without all comfort, he powreth out his heart in theſe words; <hi>Zelus domûstuae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edit me: O Lord the zeale I beare unto thy houſe, hath eaten me up;</hi> it inflameth my he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So Chriſt, when he ſaw the Temple of God foulely and unſeemly abuſed; that they made the holy place a place for their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unhoneſt gaine by uſury; that they turned Religion into robbery, ſold Oxen, Sheep, and Doves, and kept their banks for exchange in the Temple; when the <hi>Priests</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94673:15"/>
and <hi>Levites,</hi> which ſhould ſerve God, were become Merchants, and ſerved themſelves; when the Temple or houſe of God (which <hi>David</hi> purpoſed, and <hi>Solomon</hi> finiſhed, and <hi>Ezechias</hi> and <hi>Eſras</hi> and other godly Princes preſerved, in which was kept the book of the law, whither all the people aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to ſerve God) was not uſed like Gods houſe, but like a common faire or market, &amp; was made a denne of theeves; when theſe groſſe abuſes were ſuffered, and things were let runne to ſuch extremities, and all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of holineſſe; as if it were not only lawfull, but needs it muſt be ſo: moved with zeale, he could not abide it; <hi>he made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, and drove them all out of</hi>

was a man that heareth not, and in whoſe mouth are no reproofes; And <hi>Christ</hi> ſaid, learne of me, for I am humble and meeke: when his Diſciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> grew wrothful againſt the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> that would not receive him, and ſaid, <hi>Lord wilt thou that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 9.</note> 
               <hi>we command that fire come down from heaven, &amp; conſume them, even as</hi> Elias <hi>did? He turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and rebuked them, and ſaid, yee know not of what ſpirit you are:</hi> yet through zeale for Gods houſe, Chriſt whipped out the buyers and ſellers, <hi>David</hi> ſhed forth teares abundantly, and <hi>Moſes</hi> daſht in pieces the tables of Gods Commandements. All men ought to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and gentle in matters appertaining to themſelves: but in Gods cauſe no man muſt yeild or be patient.</p>
            <p>In our daies, upon whom the end of the world is come, when we did lately ſee thoſe times whereof our Saviour foretold ſo long ſithence, that deſolation ſhould be in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place; and ſuch confuſion, ignorance, and blindnes, that men ſhould ſtumble at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies; that truth ſhould be a ſtranger upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94673:16"/>
earth; that men ſhould forſake wholſome doctrine, and give eare unto fables; that the myſtery of iniquity ſhould worke; and the very elect (if it were poſsible) be deceived, what tryall was made of true &amp; godly zeale? How notably did it ſhew it ſelfe againſt the rage and fury of the wicked? What ſhould I ſpeake hereof? The examples are freſh: you cannot forget them, you heard of them ſo late, it is ſo late ſince you did behold them. What moved ſo many, ſo learned, ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to yeild their backs to the ſcourge, their necks to the tormenters, their bodies to the fire, to forſake their goods, their friends, their parents, their wives &amp; children, but the zeale of Gods houſe? Neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor things preſent, nor things to come, was able to ſeparate them from the love of God: they continued ſtedfaſt unto the end. The zeal of Gods houſe did eat them up.</p>
            <p>But now God hath reſtored us; he hath taken away the deſolation from us; he hath given us his truth; he hath revealed the man
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94673:17"/>
of ſin; he hath raiſed up a banner of hope: we ſee and enjoy ſuch things as many Kings &amp; Prophets would have enjoyed, &amp; could not: what remaineth, but that we take the zeale of the Lords houſe into our hearts, and ſeek by all meanes the glory of the ſame? As our good fathers and brethren ſhewed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of their love in diſliking the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which troubled the Church of God, ſo in this bleſſed peace which God giveth to his Church, let us witneſſe our earneſt zeale in ſeeking that it may be made beautifull &amp; eſtabliſhed for ever.</p>
            <p>Let our next care be, to continue poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Kingdomes are preſerved by the ſame meanes, by which they were firſt gotten: that which is conquered by zeale, by carefull zeale muſt be kept. It was ſaid of <hi>Anniball,</hi> that he knew how to get the victory, but how to uſe it he knew not: Many have loſt that by negligence, which they had by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence wonne. Therefore we ought, as our hearts were carefull and deſirous to ſee theſe daies, ſo by our thankfulneſſe to God for ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94673:17"/>
great a bleſſing, and by chriſtian and godly providence fore-ſee ſuch meanes whereby we may long hereafter enjoy the ſame. When <hi>Phydias</hi> had made the pourtraiture of <hi>Jupiter Piſanus,</hi> he overlaid it with oyle, that it might continue freſh and greene, &amp; never putrifie: When God gave order to <hi>Noah</hi> for making the Arke, he ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt pitch it within and without with pitch,</hi> that it might be ſound and ſure and abide the waves.</p>
            <p>He which challengeth to himſelfe that proud and wanton name, to be called the head of the univerſall Church, after by litle and litle he was gotten into poſſeſsion, was not behinde hand by all meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and keep the ſame: In this policie he took away the reading of the Scriptures from the people; he made Noble-men and Princes his Cardinalls; he threw down, and ſet up, and changed whom and what hee would; The Kings and States of the world, the Biſhops, Profeſſours, and Schollars in Univerſities, and Preachers, were brought to ſweare allegiance and obedience unto him:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94673:18"/>
I deviſe not this the ſtories here of are abroad, and the oath which they took is known; his authority grew greater then the authority of generall Councells; nothing might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in Councels, but what pleaſed him; none might be admitted to ſpeak in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, but ſuch as were ſworne to him; he had all law in his breaſt. There was ſometimes a proclamation made in <hi>Rome</hi> that, for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, no man ſhould erect or build up any Theatre; and that if any were ſet up, it ſhould be raſed &amp; pulled downe: <hi>Pompeius,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great wealth and noble courage, did build a Theatre; ſuch a one as before had not been ſeen, which would receive 2500 men, contrary to the Proclamation and order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: But doubting leaſt the next Magiſtrates ſhould deſtroy it, he cauſed a place of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſet upon it, and called it the Temple of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enw:</hi> whereby he provided, that if any would overthrow it becauſe it was a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, they might yet ſpare it for the Temples ſake: for to pull down a Temple, was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Even ſo there have been proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94673:18"/>
&amp; Canons that no man ſhould be called the chiefe or the head of all Churches, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp ſuch authority over others: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Pope</hi> built up his ſupremacy againſt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſuch Canons, he pretended religion for his doing; he ſaid it was. <hi>de jure divino</hi> that no man ſhould preſume or attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and that ſo his power might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue forever.</p>
            <p>If they have been thus carefull to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine falſhood, how much more carefull ſhould we be to maintaine the truth? If they to advance their own kingdome, how much more we to ſet forth the kingdome of God, and to build up the Church of Chriſt? And if they ſought to doe that by lyes, and by falſe meanes, why ſhould we be ſlack to uſe the right, and true, and good meanes, whereby that good thing which God hath wrought for us may be eſtabliſhed? And albeit there be many waies, by which the kingdome of God may be maintained; as the favour and countenance of the Prince, which ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth and cheriſheth the Church, as the ſun
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94673:19"/>
beames comfort and cheriſh the earth; and knowledge, and learning, and diſcipline, which are as the life &amp; the ſinewes, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Church muſt needs fall aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: at this time, I will leave to ſpeak of the reſt, &amp; only ſtay upon <hi>Learning,</hi> which may truly be called the life or the ſoule of the Church, and of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>How neceſſary a thing they have counted Learning to the ſetting forth of Religion, the ſtories of our old Fathers, of Heathens, &amp; Chriſtians in all ages doe witneſſe: They thought that neither Religion might ſtand without knowledge, nor knowledge were to be eſteemed without Religion. <hi>Charles</hi> the great, that he might the better plant Religion in <hi>Saxonie</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> did erect many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for increaſe of Learning: he knew well that there was no other way better to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Religion. The Cathedrall Churches, before ſuch times as ignorance and blindnes grew over all the world and brought in an univerſall corruption, maintained Schooles of learning, that the doctrine which was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94673:19"/>
taught in thoſe places, might be defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the gaineſayers by ſuch learned men as were there bred up. The Princes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the free cities, after they had received the Goſpell, they diſſolved their Monaſteries, which had been harbourers for ſuch as lived in idleneſſe: and ſet up Schooles and Colledges, which ſhould be nurceries to breed up learned men that might be able to teach the people, &amp; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Religion: whereby it came to paſſe, that in ſhort time they had great ſtore of worthy and learned men.</p>
            <p>This did they well ſee, that have been the enimies of Religion: and therefore uſed all meanes to hinder the increaſe of Learning, that they might have the better way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Religion: For if Learning decay, it is likely that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot abide. Beare with me, if I ſpeak that which may ſeem more fit for ſome other place, then for this audience: the beſt here underſtandeth me well. Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries the receiving of the Goſpell hath alwaies been cauſe that Learning was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94673:20"/>
more ſet by, and learning hath ever been the furtherance of the Goſpell. In <hi>England</hi> I know not how it cometh otherwiſe to paſſe: for ſince the Goſpell hath been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the maintenance for learning hath been decayed, &amp; the lack of Learning will be the decay of the Goſpell. Would God it were not ſo, or that yet, before the fault be incurable, there may be ſome redreſſe.</p>
            <p>Loath I am to ſpeak; yet the caſe ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that it is needfull to be ſpoken. I truſt I ſhall ſpeak in the hearing of them that will conſider it. Maintenance of Learning, whereby an able and ſufficient miniſterie may grow and bee eſtabliſhed in all the Churches of this Realm, is to be wiſhed for: The good eſtate of this noble Kingdome, the comfort of poſterity, the ſtay of Religion, the continuing of the Goſpell, the removing of darkneſſe hangeth upon it. One asked ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, how it was that in <hi>Athens,</hi> ſo goodly and great a Citie, there were no Phyſitions? To whom this anſwer was made, becauſe there are no rewards appointed for them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94673:20"/>
that practiſe Phyſick. The ſame anſwer may be made for our times: the cauſe why the Church of God is ſo forſaken, is the want of zeal in them that ſhould either for their cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, or for their abilitie, be foſterers of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and increaſe the livings where occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and give hope and comfort to learned men. What ſaid I? increaſe? nay the Livings and proviſion which heretofore were given to this uſe, are taken away.</p>
            <p>Have patience, if any ſuch be here, as I well know there are, whom theſe things touch ſuffer me to ſpeak the truth; it is Gods cauſe. The livings of ſuch as are in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, are not in their hands to whom they are due: all other labourers &amp; artificers have their hire increaſed double as much as it was wont to be: only the poore man that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth and ſweateth in the Vineyard of the Lord of hoſtes, hath his hire abridged and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. I ſpeak not of the Curates; but of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages and Vicarages, that is of the places which are the Caſtles and Towers of fence for the Lords Temple: They ſeldome paſſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94673:21"/>
now adaies from the Patron, if he be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a Gentleman, but either for the Leaſe, or for preſent mony: Such Merchants are broken into the Church of God; a great deale more intolerable then were they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt chaſed and whipped out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus they that ſhould bee carefull for Gods Church; that ſhould be Patrons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the conſciences of the people, and to place among them a learned Miniſter (who might be able to preach the word unto them out of ſeaſon and in ſeaſon, and to fulfill his Miniſtery,) ſeek their own, and not that which is Jeſus Chriſts; they ſerve not Jeſus Chriſt, but their belly. And this is done, not in one place, or in one country, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>England:</hi> A Gentleman cannot keep his houſe, unleſſe he have a Parſonage or two in farme for his proviſion.</p>
            <p>O mercifull God, whereto will this grow at laſt? If the miſery which this plague wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth would reach but to one age, it were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable: but it will be a plague to poſterity; it will be the decay and deſolation of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:94673:21"/>
Young men, which are toward and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſee this; they ſee, that he which feedeth the flocke, hath leaſt part of the milke; he which goeth to warfare hath not halfe his wages: Therefore they are weary &amp; diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, they change their ſtudies, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come prentices, ſome turne to Phyſick, ſome to Law, all ſhun and fly the Miniſtery. And beſides the hinderance that thus groweth by wicked dealing of Patrons by reaſon of the Impropriations, the Vicarages in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in the propereſt market-townes are ſo ſimple, that no man can live upon them: and therefore no man will take them. They were wont to ſay, <hi>Beneficia fine cura; Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without charge:</hi> but now may be ſaid, <hi>Cura fine Beneficio; Charge or cure without Benefice.</hi> I ſpeak not this of myſelfe: many here preſent know I ſpeak the truth: and my ſelfe know the places which have continued ſtill theſe many yeares without a Miniſter reſident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and have provided themſelves as they might with their own mony.</p>
            <p>Your Graces ſubjects had hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94673:22"/>
in your Graces late Viſitation: but yet it ſtandeth ſtill in caſe as miſerable as it did before. I know, your Grace heareth not of theſe matters: And I hope, God will work in Your Gracious heart, to provide ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt them. For otherwiſe, the Schools will be forſaken, the Church deſolate, the people wild and diſmaied, the Goſpell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited: otherwiſe, we ſhall ſee that wrought againſt the houſe of God, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>Licinius</hi> could have brought to paſſe againſt us. This noble Realme, which ever was famous for the name of Learning, is like thereby to come to ſuch Ignorance and Barbariſine, as hath not bin heard of in any memory before our time.</p>
            <p>I know, that there are grievous complaints made, that the Biſhops appoint Prieſts &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that are ignorant, and have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Latine tongue. Would God it were not true: or would God that they which be the cauſers hereof, would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what help to amend it. But alas, are we able to make learned men upon the ſudden? Or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94673:22"/>
can we make others then ſuch as come unto us, or will come to live in miſery?</p>
            <p>But there are many which can ſay, ſuch as be Miniſters in the Church, ſhould teach freely, without hope of recompence or hire for their labour; Our preaches are no better then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles; they are no better then the holy Prophets, who lived poorely; poverty is a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate. So ſay ſome, in like devotion as did <hi>Judas, What needed this waſt? this might have, been ſould for much, &amp; given to the poore not that he cared for the poore, but becauſe he was a theife and had the bag, and bare that which was given.</hi> I doubt not, there are many w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> teach Chriſt for Chriſts ſake; which ſay in their ſoule, the Lord is my portion; who in that heavy time, from which God delivered the, if they might have received their life only for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, would have been glad to take the paines; who ſeek you, and not yours; which have forſaken all they had, to follow Chriſt: I doubt not there are ſuch.</p>
            <p>But for the hope of poſterity, I report me
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94673:23"/>
to all you which are Fathers, &amp; have childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for whom yee are carefull. Although your ſelves have a zeale and care for the houſe of God, yet will you breed them up, keep them at ſchoole untill 24 yeares old to your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that in the end they may live in glorious povertie, that they may live poorly, &amp; naked, like the Prophets and Apoſtles? Our poſterity ſhall rue that ever ſuch fathers went before them: and Chronicles ſhall report this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Learning among the puniſhments &amp; murraines &amp; other plagues of God. They ſhall leave it written in what time, &amp; under whoſe raigne this was done. Or if we grow ſo barbarous, that we conſider not this, or be not able to draw it into chronicle, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine nations will not ſpare to write this, &amp; publiſh it to our everlaſting reproach and ſhame.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, what may be gueſſed of their meaning, which thus ravin and ſpoile the houſe of God? which decay the proviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof, &amp; ſo baſely eſteem the Miniſters of his Goſpell? they cannot ſay to God, the zeal of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94673:23"/>
thy houſe hath eaten me up. Howſoever in other things they doe well; howſoever they ſeem to rejoyce at the proſperity of <hi>Sion,</hi> and to ſeek the ſafety and preſervation of the Lords anointed, yet needs muſt it be that by theſe meanes forraigne power (of which this Realme by the mercy of God is happily delivered) ſhall again be brought in upon us. Such things ſhall be done unto us, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffered: the truth of God ſhall be taken away; the holy Scriptures burnt and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in fire; a marvellous darkneſſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity muſt needs enſue. For if the tempeſt be ſo dark in the ſea, that the load-ſtar looſe her light, and the needle faile to give token of the North Pole, no marvell though the ſhip loſe her courſe, and be ſwallowed up in the ſands.</p>
            <p>The Goſpell of Chriſt is the fountaine of light and of knowledge: It cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ignorance and darkneſſe; theſe be the props of their kingdome, which take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Scriptures; which hold the people in blindneſſe; which fly the light; which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94673:24"/>
have their Common-prayers, adminiſter the Sacraments, marry, bury their dead in a ſtrange tongue, that the people may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing; which make a famine of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of God; which ſtop up the ſprings of the water of life; which take away the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, &amp; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer them that would enter; which ſay, ignorance is the mother of devotion; and the Church is then in beſt order, and the people moſt devout, when they are hood-winkt, and blinded, &amp; ſee nothing.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not fit inſtruments wherewith we may overcome the adverſaries; this is not the ſword of the Spirit; theſe are not the ſpirituall weapons which caſt downe holds and every high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God. What man, that would keep out his enimie, will pull downe his holds? What Captain that meaneth to give a forcible aſſault upon the enimy, will diſcourage his fighting ſouldiers? but our ſouldiers are out of courage; our Caſtles are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94673:24"/>
falne: therefore that which we feare, will fall upon us.</p>
            <p>The Oxe that treadeth out the corne is muſsled; he that goeth to warfare, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not his wages; the cry hereof goeth up into the eares of the Lord of hoſts. He will not abide ſo great contempt of his word and preachers: his owne name is thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>he that deſpiſeth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 1. Theſs. 4.</note> 
               <hi>you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul, he that deſpiſeth theſe things, deſpiſeth not man but God.</hi> And think we, that he will ſuffer his holy name to be deſpiſed? nay, his wrath is already kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; he hath already begun his judgements, &amp; therfore many places are left deſolate. There is none that can warn them of their ſin, none that can move them to repentance, none that can preach unto them forgiveneſſe through Chriſt, none that can inſtruct them in the comfort of everlaſting life: becauſe they work ſuch things againſt the Lord, the hearts of many are aſtoniſhed; though they heare, they underſtand not; they ſcorn &amp; jeſt at the word of ſalvation; it is unto them a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94673:25"/>
ſavour of death unto death; they are earthly minded; whoſe God is their belly, &amp; whoſe glory is their ſhame.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe you liue ſtill in your ſins, in adultery, in covetouſnes, &amp; in pride, without any feeling of conſcience, without any feare of God. Your daughters, your Heires, to whom you ſhall leave your lands, are ſtolne away from you. Robberies and thefts are ſo common, as if it were not only lawfull, but alſo commendable; as if ſin were no ſin, and hell fire but a fable.</p>
            <p>Thus we provoke God to anger: many walk, of whom we cannot think but with weeping: they are the enimies of the croſſe of Chriſt: the name of God is blaſphemed through them. Many are ſo ignorant, they know not what the Scriptures are, they know not that there are any Scriptures, they call them hereticall and new Doctrine: many will believe neither ſide, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover they alleadge; bring they truth, bring they falſhood; each they Chriſt, teach they Antichriſt, they will believe neither, they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94673:25"/>
have ſo hardned their hearts: Be the Preacher rough or gentle, learned or unlearned; let him uſe authority of the Scriptures, of the Doctors, of the Councels, of Decrees or Decretals, of Gods law, of mans law, nothing will move them, nothing will pleaſe them, becauſe the Miniſtery of God, and thereby God himſelfe is deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe words haply ſeem ſharp &amp; over ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement: but the darknes of our hearts againſt God, and the lack of zeale to his houſe, inforce me to them. We are almoſt fallen into the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pit: we are left without zeale, as ſenſleſſe men, and as if we had clean forgotten our ſelves, as the heathen, which know not God. Therefore, unleſſe we repent, the kingdome of God ſhall be taken away from us: he will ſend upon this land a famine of the word: <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſhalbe overthrowne, and made an heap of ſtones: the man of ſin, &amp; they which have not the love of the truth, ſhall prevaile with many, and withdraw them from obedience to the Prince: this noble Realm ſhall be ſubject to forraigne nations. All this will the zeale of the Lord of hoſts bring to paſſe.</p>

I could have ſpent this time in opening ſome other matter: but nothing, in my judgement, is more worthy your good conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy redreſſe. I would be loath, raſhly or rudely to abuſe the reverence of this place: but unleſſe theſe things be cared for; unleſſe we ſhew forth greater zeal then hitherto; if the yeares to come eat up and take away from the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the late yeares have done, there will not be left, within a while, any to ſpeak the word of God out of this place, the Pulpits ſhall have none to uſe them, the people ſhall grow wilde and void of underſtanding.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Xerxes</hi> beheld the great company of Souldiers, ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly he brake into teares &amp; wept bitterly: one ſaid to him, ô Sir, you have cauſe to rejoice, you have a goodly company, they are able to fight for you againſt any nation. But what ſhall become of them, ſaith <hi>Xerxes?</hi> after a 100 yeares not one of all theſe ſhall be left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. If the view of the ſmall number of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers might be taken, how few they are, and how thin they come up, we have greater cauſe then <hi>Xerxes</hi> to lament, if we have any zeale to the houſe of God: for of the Preachers which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94673:26"/>
now are, within few yeares none will remaine alive. And <hi>Xerxes</hi> his ſouldiers left iſſue behind them, which might afterwards ſerve their country: But there is like to be ſmall increaſe for the ſupply of learned men. The Lord ſhall lack men to bring in his harveſt: the litle ones ſhall call for bread, and there ſhall be none to give it them. They that ſhall come after us, ſhal ſee this to be true; there is no houſe ſo ſpoiled, as the houſe of the Lord; there is no ſervant ſo litle rewarded, as the ſervant of Chriſt, and the diſpenſers of the myſteries of God.</p>
            <p>Oh that your Grace did behold the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſorder of Gods Church: or that you might foreſee the calamities which will follow. It is a part of your Kingdome, and ſuch a part, as is the principall prop and ſtay of the reſt. I will <note place="margin">Cyrill: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt: ad The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſ: &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> ſay to your Majeſtie, as <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſometimes ſaid to the godly Emperours <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, Ab ea quae erga Deum est pietate Reipub: veſtrae status pendet; the good eſtate and welfare of your Commonwealth hangeth upon true godlineſse.</hi> You are our governour, you are the Nurce of Gods Church; we muſt open this griefe before you. God knoweth if it may be redreſſed, it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94673:27"/>
hath grown ſo long, and is run ſo farre: but if it may be redreſſed, there is no other beſide your Highneſſe, that can redreſſe it.</p>
            <p>I hope, I ſpeake truly, that which I ſpeake without flattery; that God hath endued your grace with ſuch meaſure of learning &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as no other Chriſtian Prince: he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you peace, happineſſe, the love and true hearts of your ſubjects. Oh turne and employ theſe to the glory of God; that God may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in your Grace the thing which he hath begun. To this end hath God placed Kings and Princes in their State, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that they may ſerve the Lord; that they may ſee, &amp; cauſe others to ſee to the furniture of the Church. The good Emperour <hi>Justinian</hi> cared for this, as much as for his life: <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> and other godly Princes called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Vaſallos,</hi> the ſubjects and bond-ſervants of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they remembred that God furniſhed them in their houſes; and were not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to furniſh his houſe.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had beautified <hi>Rome</hi> with ſetting up many faire buildings, he ſaid, <hi>

                  </gap> later it iam, marmore am reddidi: I found it made of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94673:27"/>
brick, but I leave it made of marble.</hi> Your Grace, when God ſent you to your inheritance &amp; the right of this Realme, found the Church in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſion: &amp; in reſpect of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God a Church of brick; or rather, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> ſaith, daubed up with unſeaſoned morter. Your Grace hath already redreſſed the doctrine now caſt your eies towards the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery; give courage and countenance unto Learning, that Gods houſe may be ſerved: ſo ſhall you leave to the Church of God, a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the zeal of the Lords houſe had eaten you up.</p>
            <p>And you, ô dearely beloved, if there be any ſuch which are neither hot nor cold; which doe the work of the Lord negligently; which eſteem the word of God but as a matter of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; which are aſhamed to be called Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the Goſpell of Chriſt: pray unto God, that he will increaſe your zeal. Let us continue rooted and built in Chriſt, and ſtabliſhed in the faith: let us have care for the houſe of God. Whoſoever is not after this ſort zealous, is a man of a double heart. We may not halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two opinions: If the Lord be God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94673:28"/>
him; but if Ball be he then goe after him: he that is not with Chriſt, is againſt him. Many talke of the Goſpell, and glory in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: but it is neither talke, nor knowledge, which ſhall ſave them in that day. He that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Lord, and ſerveth him with a pure heart, and may truly ſay, the zeal of thine houſe hath conſumed me, he ſhall be ſaved. If they ſhall not eſcape which have zeale without knowledge, what ſhall become of us, which have knowledge without zeale?</p>
            <p>And you, whoſoever you are that by ſuch meanes have decayed the Lords houſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged the proviſion and maintenance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſee the miſerable wrack of Gods Church: if there be any zeale of God in you, if you have any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any compaſſion and mercy, if you love God, if you deſire the continuance of the Goſpell, Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you have the Patrimonie due unto them that ſhould attend in the Lords houſe. You take unto your ſelves wrongfully that which was not lotted for you Give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe things which belong to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and unto God the things which appertaine to him, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94673:28"/>
make for the beautie &amp; furniture of his houſe. Enrich your ſelves by lawfull meanes, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpoile and waſt of Gods Church. Let not the Miniſtery by your meanes be deſpiſed: you enriched them which mocked, &amp; blinded, and devoured you; ſpoile not them now that feed, and inſtruct, and comfort you. Let us ſeek the glory of God; let us at length ſerve the Lord, and not our belly and greedie wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>So ſhall God bleſſe you, and proſper you in all your affaires: ſo ſhall he ſtrike a terrour of you into all forraigne Princes that dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you: ſo ſhall your heart be kept ſtedfaſt in the hand of God: ſo ſhall your heart be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before the Lord: ſo ſhall you leave ſuch as ſhall alwaies praiſe the Lord in <hi>Sion:</hi> ſo ſhall you ſee your childrens children, and peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thou, ô moſt mercifull Father, grant that thy words be not ſpoken in vain: it is thy cauſe. Thou art our Father, we are as clay in thine hands. Thou haſt the key of our hearts. give zeale to them that have knowledge, give
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94673:29"/>
knowledge to them that have zeale; that they may be enflamed and raviſhed with the love of thy houſe, to ſorrow for the decay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to doe all their endeavour to build up and eſtabliſh the ſame for ever.</p>
