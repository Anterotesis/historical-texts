            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SUrely the said <hi>Samuel Bradley</hi> hath had time sufficient to have
studied and brought forth far more sound matter than he
hath done in his pretended REPLY, it being above one
year and a half since the paper touching our dispute went
forth; when as his pretended REPLY to it came but lately
abroad as to our hands, and exceeding darkly, as a false cover to his
folly and Confusion, which so long since was discovered, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Spirit of Truth in us; and in this his pretended Reply,
hath he often Reproached and belyed us, called <hi>QVAKERS;</hi> even
in a time, in which the foggy mist is risen out of the pit, to darken the
Air, and the Sun also if it were possible, and the multitude of slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and lyes is gone forth against us, and among them is this <hi>S. B.</hi>
and his work found, which shall return back to perdition; who hath
sought to guild and smooth over his former cause, as if he thought
we had either forgotten his former folly that he vented at the dispute,
or else, that he did not intend that his work should come forth to
the Light to be tryed, he sending it so hidenly in manuscript a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his hearers: Therefore note his matter as followeth, and
seriously read the <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Bradley</hi> the Baptist, to the Reader, sayes these words, <hi>viz.
I must needs write my self less than the least of all Saints, and altogether</hi>
unworthy <hi>to engage in any work for</hi> Jehovah; <hi>much more altogether</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<hi>to engage in a work so weighty, and so such publique concernment
as this is.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>Then its evident, that this <hi>S. B.</hi> is not in Gods work, but
in his own work, he being <hi>altogether unworthy to engage in any work
for JEHOVAH:</hi> so note that what he hath done, both in his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the people called <hi>QVAKERS,</hi> and in his writing against
them, was not any work of <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> but of his own; done in
darkness, and the enmity of the wicked one, against <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> and
his work. And what profit can you that are the hearers of the said
<hi>Samuel Bradley</hi> reap from him, since he is altogether unworthy to
engage in any work for <hi>JEHOVAH?</hi> as also the sequel hereof will
further discover; and this <hi>S. B.</hi> professeth himself <hi>to be a poor labourer
in the Vineyard of Christ, and in the service of the Lord;</hi> and thus hath
he played the hypocrite, and confounded himself; for how can he
be either a Labourer in the Vineyard of Christ, or a Servant of the
Lord, <hi>when he is altogether unworthy to engage in any work for JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH?</hi>
So its plainly manifest, that he is one of them that runs, &amp;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58878:3"/>
the Lord hath not sent him; and one of the false prophets, that steal
the words from their neighbours, and say, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, when
God hath not spoken to them:</hi> But all the true Ministers and Labourers
in Christ Vineyard were in <hi>JEHOVAHS</hi> work, which <hi>S. B.</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unworthy to engage in; and therefore he had better been
silent, and have done nothing than have uttered so many words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowledg as he hath done; if he had been silent, his folly had
not so much appeared as it now doth.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>saith,</hi> I shall count it a mercy, that God hath given me such a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to contend for the faith that was once delivered by Christ.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>In this hast thou <hi>S. B.</hi> spoken falsly; for to contend for the faith
which was once delivered unto the Saints, <hi>is a work for JEHOVAH,</hi> but
thou art altogether unworthy to engage in any work for him, as thou
hast Confessed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. B.</speaker>
               <p>Those people who are known by the name of QVAKERS, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to prove two things, 1st. That the Disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ were
Commanded to Baptise with the Spirit. 2d. They undertook to prove that New
Testament-Ordinances were abolished.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>As for the former of these assertions upon the <hi>QVAKERS,
(so called)</hi> we did say something in order to it, (<hi>&amp; proved it also.</hi>) viz.
<hi>That the Disciples of Christ were in his work, and had power given them to
Baptise people into the Name of the Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghost,</hi> which was
with the Spirit, as hereafter is further discovered: And as for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them, its exceeding false; for we never affirmed <hi>that New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Ordinances
were abolished,</hi> nor undertook to prove it; but we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Baptists affirming water Baptism, to be in force as a New
Testament-Ordinance, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. when there is no water men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
but Baptising them into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, (as it is in the <hi>Greek</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>into the name</hi>) which Name,
Baptising or plunging people in outward water, doth not Baptise men
into; for the outward baptism was but a figure of the inward baptism,
(<hi>and so had relation to the Law, and that state under it, which had the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Shadows</hi>) and is not by these Baptists proved a New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Ordinance,
as in force by any New Testament Law; for New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Ordinances,
as Preaching, Praying, Baptising into the Name and
Body of Christ, and other Ordinances which the Spirit of Christ leads
to, we own, and are in the Life and Practise of them, as Christ hath
called us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. B.</speaker>
               <p>Water Baptism is an Ordinance of Christ still in force, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
till the second coming, and Glorious Appearing of our Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Then in his pleading for Water Baptism, to continue till the
end of the World (<hi>according to his account</hi>) he hath denyed that the
Saints are yet come to the second coming of Christ to Salvation:
wherein he hath discovered his ignorance, of Christs appearance and
Salvation, and so would keep the Saints under shadows, and from
the Substance all their life time: When as the coming of Christ in the
flesh, (<hi>wherein he was offered to bear the Sins of many,</hi> Heb. 9. 28.) was
one coming; and his appearance in Spirit, to save his people from sin,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58878:3"/>
is another coming, which they that truly looked for did receive; and
they that yet have that his coming to look for, and waite for it, he
shall so appear to their Salvation.</p>
               <p>Sam. Bradley <hi>saith of the</hi> QVAKERS, The first thing they mention,
as the Captain General of their manifold untruths, that <hi>Sam. Bradly</hi> a
Baptist Teacher affirmed, That the Baptism of the Spirit was Metaphorically
spoken of in that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. and that the baptism of water was
intended. <hi>To which I say, herein hath he wronged our words, and
falsified our sayings; for we said, that</hi> S. B. <hi>affirmed, touching 1 Cor.</hi>
12. 13. That the baptism of the Spirit (there spoken of) was metaphorical, but
the baptism of water was intended. <hi>And</hi> S. B. <hi>then Replies thus, viz.</hi>
I did not, nor do not affirm, that the Baptism of the Spirit was metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
spoken of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. And that the baptism of water was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
Therefore, I would advise these men for to learn to speak the
Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>We have affirmed no untruth against thee <hi>S. B.</hi> for what we
said of thee in that particular mentioned, was, that thou saidst
that the Baptism of the Spirit was metaphorical, but the baptism of
water was intended: and this is notoriously known by many that thou
affirmedst it upon our urging that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. and one of thy brethren
sought to vindicate thee in it, when thou wast baffled about it, as count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Apostle spoke metaphorically in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. about the
body and the members, (<hi>which was nothing to the purpose</hi>) also, it was
several times upon thy assertion asked thee, What the Baptism of the
Spirit was a Metaphor or a Figure of, if it was Metaphorical as thou
saidst? about which thy mouth was plainly stopt, &amp; it was so often in
the Meeting cast upon thee; that thou discovers an exceeding impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
lying spirit in thee, now to deny it, and to say, <hi>that what we said
of thee about it is altogether untrue,</hi> as thou sayest: About which I could
produce several witnesses, who know that thou hast spoken absolute
falshood in this thing; and let the Reader mark thy silly shuffling in
this thing, thou sayest, <hi>Thou didst not, neither dost affirm, that the baptism
of the Spirit was metaphorically spoken of in that place,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13.
which implyes then, that thou hast counted it metaphorical in some
other place, though not in that place; but where ever any true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
counted the Spirits baptism metaphorical, and water baptism
intended, that thou hast not shewn so its evident, that in thy blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

               <p>I did say the Apostle in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. Spake of one Lord, one Faith, and
one Baptism; which these men brought in opposition to water baptism; to
it I made this Answer, <hi>thou sayest,</hi> This is not exclusive; for there be Lords
many, as you may see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. And yet but one Lord Jesus, and we read
of divers Baptismes, as of affliction, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 50. 2dly, The Baptism of the
Spirit, which is spoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 3dly, The Baptism of water, as in <hi>Acts</hi>
8. and 10. and yet there is but one properly so called, to wit that of water: <hi>Also
thou sayst,</hi> we instance three Baptismes in Scripture, and prove one properly
so called.</p>

               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>If there be so many Baptismes, and yet but one propely called
baptism, which is the Baptism of water; then from this it follows
that the baptism of the Spirit, or the baptism by which the Saints were
saved, was not properly called Baptism; and this would charge the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
with speaking improperly, or falsly, when they spoke of the
Baptism by which they were saved, or of their being all baptised by
one Spirit into one Body And thus this said Baptist's falshood and folly
appears, who here also counteth the one Baptism spoken of in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.
the Baptism of water; and so hath shut out the baptism of the Spirit,
as not properly called Baptism, and Idollatrously hath set water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
above it; when as the baptism of the Spirit was that which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
baptism did but shadow or figure forth; for by one Spirit were the
Saints baptised into the body of Christ, which the baptism of outward
water doth not baptise any into; for such as uphold water baptism
now are in the strife, and much in devision, when as they who are
baptised into the body of Christ are in unity. Though thus far we say
of water baptism, that in its time it was a Command from heaven to
<hi>John,</hi> which was in the time of the Law, and the least in the Kingdome
was greater than <hi>John,</hi> who decreased; and in the time of that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismes
decreasing, it was used by some of the Apostles in their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for the sake of some that were weak or young in the truth, and
not wholly redeemed out of the state that such carnall or weak ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
related to, which were upheld in the time of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy:
But when the carnall minds of some ran into these outward
things, and something got up in the minds of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to lead
them too much to stick in them, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, That
Christ sent him not to baptise, but to preach the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. and
yet <hi>Pauls</hi> Commission was as large as any of the Apostles was, for he was
not behinde the very chief Apostles, and shunned not to declare all
the councell of God <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27. And whereas <hi>S. Bradley</hi> instanceth as
his paralel, <hi>That there be Lords many, and yet but one Lord Jesus,</hi> for the
divers Baptismes he speaks of, as <hi>of affliction, the baptism of the Spirit,
the baptism of water, and yet but one properly so called, to
wit that of water.</hi> To this I say, herein hath he discovered his
gross darknesse, and false comparison which will not hold paralel; for
it's as if he had said there be Lords many, and Gods many, yet to us
but one true God; and so there are many baptismes, as the baptism of
affliction, the baptism of the Spirit, and the baptism of water; yet
to us there is but one true baptism, to wit the baptism of water;
and the other, as that of affliction, and the baptism of the Spirit are
false baptismes, and not properly so called: For the many Gods and
many Lords (<hi>or that are called Gods</hi>) are in the world, where the false
Gods are. And thus <hi>S. B's.</hi> folly and Idolatrous Spirit is seen in his
so confusedly setting up water baptism above the baptism of the
Spirit, and so he is not at all fit for <hi>Jehovah's work</hi> indeed.</p>

               <p>I tell you this Baptist doth make an Idoll of water baptism,
when he hath said all he can; for he hath here set it above all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the New Testament, but he hath apparently in this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
false doctrine; for preaching the Gospel, was an ordinance of the New
Testament, and it was done in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>holy
Ghost,</hi> as well as baptising; seeing the Disciples were commanded
to teach (<hi>or disciple</hi>) all Nations <hi>baptising</hi> them into the <hi>Name</hi> of the
<hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>holy Ghost:</hi> so that Teaching was commanded to be done
in as sollemn a manner as Baptizing, for both Teaching and Baptizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Name of the Father, &amp;c. were performed by the power of
God, which the Disciples of Christ were indued with, and which
wrought by them, who were made instruments in that work of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
into the Name of God and Christ, &amp;c. And whereas I charged
<hi>S. B.</hi> and his brethren with being ignorant of the baptism of the

               <p>I do demand what they mean by the baptism of the Spirit, &amp;c.
If by the baptism of the Spirit, they mean the Spirit that doth bear witnesse

               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>What is this man but ignorant of the baptism of the Spirit, when
you may see here he cannot distinguish between the Spirit and the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of it? for if by the baptism of the Spirit, we mean the Spirit that
doth bear witness, they do experience it, he saith. Did you ever hear such
a doctrine before, that the baptism of the Spirit is the Spirit? as if he had
said, the work that is wrought is the worker of it: and thus whilst they
are doting about outward shadowes and signes, they are confounded
and blinded, that they see not the substance, nor understand the work
of the Spirit, which baptizeth into Christ, and into his Name, which is
his Word, by which salvation comes; which is a working of men into
the power and life, to which they are discipled, and led in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospell.</p>

               <p>—The gift of tongues is called in Scripture the baptizm of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>see Act. 1. 5. again he saith,</hi> we do not deny, but acknowledge that we
are baptized by one Spirit into one body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>In this he hath rested the scripture, and spoken falsly; for the gift
of tongues is not called the baptism of the Spirit, but the gift of
it; now the baptism of the Spirit was a work of it, by which the
Saints were all baptised into one body, many of whom had not the gift of
tongues, for it was onely a proper gift to some: and as for the baptists
saying <hi>they are all baptized by one Spirit into one body,</hi> and yet hath called the
gift to tongues the baptism of the Spirit, which he hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
they are ignorant of: herein he would make two baptismes
of the Spirit, when as the Apostle said, there is one Faith, and one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. and thus he sheweth his ignorance of the baptism of
the Spirit, and so is not worthy to engage in any work <hi>for JEHOVAH,</hi>
as he hath confessed.</p>

               <p>—We need not require an immediate Call or Authorithy from heaven
to preach and baptize, in as much as we have a sufficient call or warrant granted
us by Christ himselfe on earth, which doth plainly appeare in the Commission it
self, the Disciples being Commissioned, &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>What falshood and confusion is here? For both the <hi>Papists</hi>
and the <hi>hireling Priests,</hi> and others (<hi>whom the</hi> Baptists <hi>themselves have
declared against</hi>) do pretend as much for their call to preach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
as this baptist hath done; who hath pretended the Commission
which the Disciples of Christ had, to be his warrant or call to preach,
and baptize: when as he never had any immediate Call or Authority
from heaven to either (<hi>and so he never had any Call or Authority from God,
either to preach or baptize:</hi> Which is like as if that the false Prophets
had said the Commission which the true Prophets had to preach, did
Authorize and warrant them to preach also; What deceiver cannot get
such a deceitfull cloak as this? so it's evident that this <hi>S. Bradley</hi> is one
of these deceivers who runs, and the Lord never sent him, and speaks
when the Lord hath not spoken to him; and that commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
which the Disciples of Christ received from him, was given by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from heaven (<hi>upon which this S. B. doth so much build and falsly
argue</hi>) and it doth not warrant them to baptize with water neither,
for it was to baptize <hi>into the Name of the Father, Son</hi> and <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> which
Name many do professe in words, who are yet out of it as this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
is.</p>
               <p>And whereas I said to these Baptists, that they practise baptism by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,

               <p>Let those men put a stop unto their lying tongues, for fear vengeance

               <p>Oh! how Ignorant and full of gross darkness it self art thou

hadst any command from Christs mouth for to baptize with water, as
the Jewes read the Scriptures without, who had neither heard the
voice of God at any time nor seen his shape and such art thou, who
hast neither any immediate Call or Authority from Heaven to preach,
and, therefore hast neither Call nor Authority from God, either to
Preach or Baptize, (and yet thou wouldest be counted a Minister of
Christ) so its time for thee to stop thy mouth, for thou art one of
them who are presumptuous, who take upon them to speak in the

               <p>—I do affirm that the Baptism spoken of in the Commission in the 28.
of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the 16. of <hi>Mark,</hi> is the Baptizm of Water, <hi>and for proof,</hi>
S. B. <hi>Argues thus,</hi>—It is not the Baptizm of the Spirit, because this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
is Commanded, but the Baptizm of the Spirit was never Commanded,
nor was it any mans sin, not so to be baptized, therefore it cannot be meant
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58878:5"/>
the Baptizm of the Spirit, <hi>and to this S. B. adds this Lye</hi> That we did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
at al to this Argument.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>This Argument is both False and Grounded upon a falshood,
and in it he hath confuted himselfe, for mark, that he hath owned,
<hi>That they lay no stress for Salvation upon water Baptizm, neither is it of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
unto Salvation,</hi> But that Baptism which Christ Commanded in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. is of necessity unto Salvation; for by it they were
to Baptize men into the Name of the Father, Son and holy Ghost: Now
without being Baptized into this Name a man cannot be saved, for by
no other Name under heaven comes Salvation, but by the Name of
Jesus; who is a Saviour of the people from their sins, <hi>Mat. 1. 21. Act.</hi> 4. 12.
and Christ said, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, <hi>Mark.</hi>
16. 16. So that there is stress or necessity upon this Baptism which
Christ commanded for Salvation; but so is there not upon water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
as these Baptists confesse; and therefore it was not water baptism
but the spirituall baptism, which was an effect of the Gospell which
is the power of God, which the Disciples preached; for thereby they
turned people from Darknesse to Light, and from the Power of Sathan
unto God, which is known in the Baptism of the Spirit: And the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
by which the Saints were saved, was not the putting away of the
filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.
And whereas he saith <hi>That it was not any mans sin not to be baptized with
the Spirit,</hi> in this he hath spoken falsly; for when men resist the Spirit
of God, and refuse to be led or baptized by it, when it is tendred to
them; then it is their sin, as it was the Lawyers sin to frustrate the
Councell of God within themselves, not being baptized of <hi>John</hi> when
his Baptism was (in its time) a Command from heaven, much more
is it a sin in men now to to resist the spirit of God, and thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it's baptism.</p>

               <p>If any should be so weak to say this baptism here (<hi>viz. in</hi> Mat. 28.)

when and where the Disciples did obey this Command.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>They did obey it, when they Discipled and Baptised men
into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; when they Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
the Spirit, and turned men from darkness to light; and a
Testimony of this was manifest, when the Holy Ghost fell on them
that heard the Disciples Preach; who were Instruments with whom
God wrought, when they had received power from on high, and
they were sent into the world, as Christ was sent into the world,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 18. who baptised with Fire and with the Holy Ghost; and
in the same Power and Spirit they went forth, Preaching and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
people into the Word of God, which is the Name of Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi>
19. 13. And moreover <hi>Peter</hi> said, as I began to speak the Holy Ghost
fell on them, as on us at the beginning, then Remembered I the Word
of the Lord, how that he said, <hi>John indeed baptised with water, but ye
shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 11. 16. which doth plainly
evidence, That that Power or Holy Ghost, accompanied the Disciples
Ministry, that did so baptise men (<hi>which was the end of</hi> Johns <hi>Baptism</hi>)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58878:6"/>
in which work, the True Ministers were Instruments, not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

went forth in Spirit and in Power.</p>

               <p>We can prove that some were baptized with water after they
had received the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 46. And if these poor Creatures

instance as this ingage them unto obedience.</p>

               <p>How poorly do these Baptists Argue for Water Baptism to
Continue? who having denyed any immediate Call or Authority from
Heaven, either to Preach or Baptise, as this Baptist hath done, now
would make an Example a Law, to engage us to be baptised (<hi>when
as there are many Examples that are no Lawes</hi>) so that you may see
these Baptists do not baptise by any Authority from Heaven, and so
serve not in the newness of the Spirit, but meerly Act by Tradition,
and their Carnal Imitations without; and then why do they not as
well Circumcise, keep the Passover, Purify in the Temple, all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein
from Blood and things strangled, and command men to keep
the Law, and shave their Heads, &amp;c? For there are as plain examples
for the observing and doing these things from some of the Apostles
Command and example, (<hi>after that baptising with water was spoken of</hi>
Acts 10. 46.) see, <hi>Acts 15. 2, 6, 7, 20, &amp; 16. 3. &amp; 18. 18. &amp; 21. 24,
25, &amp;</hi> 24. 18. and the Apostles example of observing these things for
a time, hinders them not from ending in Christ, as <hi>S. B.</hi> falsly intimates
that water baptism ends not in Christ, because it was practised after
his Assention; in like manner might he as well have pleaded for Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
outward offerings, purifying in the Temple, &amp; the like to continue
because they were practised after Christs Assention: But as people
(<hi>who had a zeal for these outward Figures</hi>) grew into the Substance
and Life wherein they ended, that they were able to bear the denying
of them; the Apostles Preached the end of them, and refused to be
in bondage to them again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I humbly conceive that some Scriptures are not to be taken litterally as
they are laid down,</hi> as for instance, in the 13. verse of this Chapter, it is said,
That whatsoever ye ask the Father in my Name, that will I do; yet
God intends to give us the answer of no Prayer, but that prayer
that comes up according to his will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>If Christs Words in John 14. 12, 13. be not to be taken as
they are laid down, as this Baptist plainly Intimates; then from this
it follows, that Christ spoke not right or true, and therefore this
<hi>S. B.</hi> with his own conception (<hi>who is but in his conceivings</hi>) would
amend or correct what Christ hath said; and yet he hath no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from Heaven for it: Who is it that will believe his deceit and
absurdity herein? again, his Instancing Christs saying, <hi>Whatsoever ye
ask the Father in my Name, that will I do,</hi> as not to be taken as it is
laid down, and for his proof, saying, that God intends to give us the
Answer of no Prayer, <hi>but the Prayer that's according to his will:</hi> This
also Implyes, that Christ spoke not truly, as if something the Disciples
might ask in his Name, which was not according to the will of God,
and which was not to be answered; when as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was the Disciples
of Christ that asked in his Name, and they asking in that Name, they
asked in the Word of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and this could not be contrary
to the will of God. Again the Baptist (to prove that Christs words
in <hi>John</hi> 14. 12. are not to be taken as they are laid down) saith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. B.</speaker>
               <p>Christ speaks generally, he that believeth on me, the works that I
do, he shall do, and greater works than these; this cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in this sense, that these men bring it for because there be some works
that Christ did, as he was the only Son of God, which we cannot do; Christ
did perfect and compleat the work of Redemption for us by his death, and
Sufferings upon the Cross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> To this I say, what a silly shift is this, as also what falsehood
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58878:7"/>
is in it? for Christ said these words, in <hi>John</hi> 14. 12. (<hi>That he that
believeth on him should do the works that he did</hi>) before he suffered on
the Cross; and how was the work of Redemption perfected or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
by that his suffering, for thee <hi>S. B.</hi> and such as thou art,
when you are yet in bondage to your sinnes and to the Spirit of
delusion, which leads you to pervert the Scriptures, as thou hast
done? But hadst thou proved that Christs work of baptising with the
Spirit (<hi>or any work tending to lead to it</hi>) was by Christ excepted, as
not to be done by them that believed on him, then thou hadst done
what thou aimedst at, and desired to do; but that thou couldest not
do, seeing thy folly is so greatly manifest already in thy assaying
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. B.</speaker>
               <p>If water baptism be an Indifferent thing, it may be done, or it
may be left undone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>What is it else but an indifferent thing, when there is no
stress for Salvation laid upon it, neither is it of necessity to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as these Baptists Confess? And how can water baptism be of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity to obedience, as this Baptist affirms, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
produce any express Law, or Commission in force for it? <hi>for where
there is no Law, there is no Transgression;</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not behind
the very cheif Apostles, whose Commission extended as far as theirs,
<hi>He was not sent by Christ to baptise; but to Preach the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. B.</speaker>
               <p>If the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was a Church of Christ in Gospel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
than they were baptised with water, and we must be plunged or dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in outward water, if we do intend to walk according to the Rule of
Christ, and the Pattern of his House.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>So then this Baptist Judgeth all to be out of the Church of
Christ, and out of the Gospel Order, and out of the Rule of Christ,
who are not plunged or dipped in outward water: and thus he owns
none to be of the Church of Christ, or in Gospel Order, but a
company of Baptists, and yet they lay no stress for Salvation upon
their water baptism, so that men may be saved without it: Now
then the People of God that are saved, who are not plunged or
dipped in outward water, hath this Baptist judged to be none of the
Church of Christ, nor in Gospel Order; as if the Gospel Order consisted
in peoples being plunged or dipped in outward water; or as if
that were the way to bring them into the Church of Christ, and yet
men may be saved without it. Oh! what confusion and darkness
hath this Baptist about this uttered? And as for <hi>S. B</hi>'s. accusing us,
<hi>with casting durt in the Face of Christ</hi> (as he did) <hi>and to be led into a
desperate Condition, for to fly in the very face of God, in his Holy appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
To this I say, besides the falsehood of these two charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, what absurdity is intimated in them? which is as if our
opposing their baptising with water, (which they have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from Heaven for) were a flying in the very face of God; as if
the face of God were in water baptism, which he counts the Holy
Appointment; wherein he shewes that he never saw the Face of God:
for as the Lord is departed from water baptism, since it was practised
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58878:7"/>
in mens wills without any Authority from God, and it hath been, and
is made an Idoll of, neither the Face of God, nor his Power is
seen in it; and where the Face of God is seen, there is a further State
enjoyed, then that state which the outward Figures Related to; for
there the thing that was figured forth is enjoyed, but the Face of
God they see not, who are seeking it in Carnal or Shaddowy things,
for it is spiritually discerned with a Spiritual eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas Sam. Bradley saith,</hi> They dare not Administer the Baptism
of water unto any as fit Subjects of such a blessed ordinance as that is, till they
can perceive that they have, and enjoy the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
               <p>To this I say, how doth this Assertion agree with some of these Baptists,
saying, (at the dispute as this <hi>S. B.</hi> hath also related) <hi>That for people to
make a visible confession of their faith, is enough to entitle unto water baptism?</hi>
When as many can make such a confession of their faith, who enjoy not
the Spirit of Adoption, being out of that Spirit: And thus these Baptists
Confound themselves, one while saying that men must have and enjoy
the Spirit of Adoption, before they be fit Subjects for water baptism;
another while saying that a visible confession of faith is enough to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
unto water baptism. Which is like the Baptists saying, that men must
Repent, and be baptized with water, that they may receive the holy
Ghost; and for it they instance <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. and <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 16. Another while say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they dare not admit people to water baptism, until they can perceive
they have the holy Ghost or Spirit of Adoption; and for that instancing
<hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47 and thus we see their confusion and uncertainty, which is like
the Baptists, one sort of them pleading for water baptism from <hi>John's</hi>
baptizing; others of them deny to plead for it from <hi>John's</hi> Baptism,
but set their baptism above <hi>John's,</hi> saying, as that they do it by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Christ's Disciples baptizing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 22. and 4. 2. And so
they call their's Christ's baptism; when as <hi>John's</hi> baptizing with water,
and the Disciples baptizing with water, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. was of one Nature or
Kind; and as it was a figure of the inward baptism, so it had Relation
to the State that was under the Law, before the Adoption of Sons was
attained to, wherein the Redemption from the weak Elements which
the world is in, is known: And in the time of <hi>John's</hi> Administring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
baptism, Christ had not fulfilled his Testimony upon Earth
through suffering, by which he blotted out the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and Nailed it to his Cross, that one new man in him, and the
Peace might be made which could not be done by <hi>John's</hi> Baptism, nor
such Types, Figures, and Shadowes; for they being imposed since the
Transgression entred, and being changeable, they do not reach the Seed
(which must inherit the Peace and the Promises) but the changeable or
earthly part in man which they have Relation to. And did not all Types
Figures, and Shadows end in Christ the substance? Again, how should
these Baptists perceive who do enjoy the Spirit of Adoption, when
they have no immediate Call or Authority from heaven to Preach
and Baptize according to <hi>S. Bradley's</hi> confession? From which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that these Baptists who have no Authority from Heaven to
Teach or Baptize, (and who are altogether unworthy to engage in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58878:8"/>
any work for <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as <hi>S. B.</hi> is) they do set themselves to be Teachers
and Baptizers of such as they say have the Spirit of Adoption; as if he
had said, they that have not the Spirit or Authority from heaven, must
be Teachers and Ministers to them, who have the Spirit or Authority
from Heaven: and so in these things all may see their blindness, and
what a <hi>Babel</hi> they have Builded in their Confusion.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Samuel Bradley,</hi> to Thee I say, seeing that Thou art altogether
unworthy to engage in any work for <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and hast shewed thy ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
so much, touching the baptism of the Spirit, having counted
it Metaphoricall, and hast set water baptism so much above it, that
thou hast accounted no baptism properly so called, but that of water,
and hast not any Call, nor Authority from Heaven to Preach or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize:
it's high time for thee to be silent, and proceed no longer in thy
folly, and intruding into things which thou hast not seen, and cease
from slandering us, as thou hast done in many things which I have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Record; as also much more of thy confusion, falshoods, and absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
I have herein omitted to mention.</p>

            <div type="arguments">
               <head>Here are <hi>Samuel Bradley's</hi> Arguments, (which he hath made
great account of,) for the continuance of water Baptism; and
an Answer to them.</head>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Argu. 1.</speaker>
                  <p>WHatsoever the Apostles were Commanded, that they did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise;
but they were commanded to baptize with water,
and therefore they did practise it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
                  <p>The Minor proposition of this Argument being grounded
upon his supposed assertion, that it was water baptism that Christ
commanded, in <hi>Mat. 28. Mark</hi> 16. Its already confuted; and however
it being Universall, its false; for <hi>Paul</hi> who was one of the chiefe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
was not sent to baptize with water, but to preach the Gospell.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Argu. 2.</speaker>
                  <p>That which was commanded by Jesus Christ, the great Prophet
of the New Testament, and never repealed by him, is still in force, and to
continue; but water baptism never repealed by him, is still in force, and to
continue; but water baptism the Lords Supper, with the rest of the institutions
of Christ, were commanded by Christ, and never repealed by him; therefore
they are still in force, and to continue.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
                  <p>I deny the minor proposition again, so far as it relates to water
baptism, for where provest thou by Scripture that water baptism was
commanded by Christ, and never repealed by him; certainly if it had
been so commanded, and never repealed by Christ, but still in force, it
would have been in force by the same command upon the Apostle <hi>Paul;</hi>
but he saith the contrary 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Argu. 3.</speaker>
                  <p>As long as teaching is in force, and to continue, so long is baptism
in force; but that teaching is in force; and to continue to the end of the world all
men will easily grant: therefore baptism, and all the rest of the Appointments
of Christ, the Scrpture saith expressely they are to continue to the end of the
world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
                  <p>The Major proposition of this Argument is false, as the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58878:8"/>
of water is intended in it to be in force, as long as teaching; for
teaching was of force, where that baptism was not, as <hi>Paul</hi> was a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
who was sent to the one, not to the other; also Teaching is of
force to many who are not plunged in outward water, and by true
teaching are converted to Christ, when there is no stresse for Salvation
upon water baptism, neither is it of necessity to Salvation, as <hi>S. B:</hi>
hath confessed: And where he concludes that baptism, and all the rest
of the Appointments of Christ, are in force, and to continue to the
end of the World, and for proof saith, that the Scripture saith express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are to continue to the end of the world, and quotes <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.
and 20. I say this conclusion is as false as the major, and herein hath
he perverted the Scripture, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20. For neither doth it expressely
say that teaching and baptizing with water, are to continue to the end
of the world, nor yet doth it prove water baptism a command of Christ
to his Disciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he saith, Loe I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world: And not that water baptism is to continue unto the end
of the world.</p>
                  <p>And as for the rest of thy Arguments for the continuance of water
baptism, which are grounded upon thy asserting, that it was water
baptism that Christ Commanded, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. They are
herein confuted, in that the ground of them is overthrown.</p>
                  <p>Here follows some Reasons or Arguments relating to the aforesaid
Answer, to prove that in the Commission which Christ gave to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
in <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Mark</hi> 16. 16. Water baptism was not intended,
but the baptism of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>If the baptism which Christ commanded in</hi> Mat. 28. 19. <hi>and</hi> Mark. 16.
16. <hi>was a Baptism without which a man cannot be saved, then it was not the
baptism of outward water</hi> (for water baptism is not of necessity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
neither is there any stresse of Salvation laid upon it,) <hi>But it was
that baptism without which men cannot be saved; which Christ commanded,</hi>
Mat 28. Mark 16. <hi>Therefore not water baptism.</hi> I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
thus, No man can be saved without being baptized into the
Name of God, and his Son Christ Jesus; for his Name is the Word of
God, by which Salvation comes, and by no other Name; and the Lord
is one, and his Name one, and it was into this Name that the Disciples
were Commanded to baptize people.</p>
                  <p>2. He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.
Which implyes that this Baptism which Christ commanded is of necessity to
Salvation; but so is not water baptism; for the Saints were saved by that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
which was not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the Answer
of a Good Conscience, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Therefore it was not water baptism which
Christ Commanded in <hi>Mat. 28. and Mark.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>If the Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>had as large a Commission given him by Christ, as any
of the Apostles had; then the commission which Christ gave to the Disciples</hi>
Mat. 28. <hi>was not enjoyning them to baptize with water; But</hi> Paul <hi>had as large
a Commission as any of the Apostles had</hi> (for he was not behind the very
chiefe Apostles) <hi>Therefore that Commission in</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>did not enjoyn the
Disciples to baptize with water.</hi> As both these propositions are clear
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58878:9"/>
according to Scripture; so the conclusion of each is as clear from <hi>Paul's</hi>
own words, where he absolutely doth declare, That Christ sent him
not to baptize, but to preach the Gospell (<hi>notwitstanding he had baptized
some as before he mentioned</hi>) And <hi>Paul</hi> doth not say as the Baptist falsly
intimates, that baptizing was some of <hi>Paul's</hi> work that he was sent to,
but preaching the chiefe, as if he had said: <hi>Paul</hi> was not onely sent by
Christ to baptize, but also to preach, which would render <hi>Paul's</hi>
words, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. both false and defective.</p>
                  <p>And now you, whose hearts are simple, who are yet held in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
under outward Shadows, and Figures; which do decrease, wax
old, and have an end; To you I say come to the Light of Christ in
you, and muddle no more in the dark, nor dote any longer about Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and Elementary Things; neither be ye in bondage to men, nor to
their Doctrines, and Sleights, which tend to keep you in Shadows
from the substance; for it was the Jews without, whose minds stuck in
the Figures and Shadows, many of whom came so far as the baptism
of <hi>John,</hi> who decreased, and yet they stumbled at Christ the Substance:
but now he is not a Jew, that is one outward, but he is a Jew, that is
one inward: and so it's not the outward Circumcision, nor the outward
baptism that availeth any thing to Salvation, but a New Creature. So
wait you in the Light of the Lord in you, that with it you may be led
unto Christ, who is the Substance; and the one Bread, which he that
careth of, shall live for ever; and receiving Christ, you come to feel
the water of Life in you, and the one Baptism of the Spirit: of which
things, the outward bread and the outward water, were but Figures,
when as <hi>he that believeth,</hi> as the Scripture saith, (to wit in the Light
of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 26.) <hi>Out of his belly shall flow Rivers of the water of
Life,</hi> and he shall possess the end of the things abollished, and have a part
in God, who is Light, by whom the vail comes to be destroyed, and the
shadowy part removed, that the Shadows fly away, and the Lord God
is become the Light and the Life of his people, and from his Throne
comes the water of Life which waters his holy City, where the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
substance is enjoyed.</p>
