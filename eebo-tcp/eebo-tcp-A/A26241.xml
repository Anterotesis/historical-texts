            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TIs very fit the World ſhould have ſome Account of what was ſaid at the Execution of theſe men, and how they came to ſay what they did.</p>
            <p>Their Confeſſion (as 'tis called) was a Denyal of the Fact, which was Pen'd and prepar'd in a very Formall manner, and taken out of the Pocket of <hi>Hill,</hi> who had neither Pen, Ink nor Paper, all the while he was in <hi>Newgate;</hi> Yet after he was dead, Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſaw the Executioner take it out of his Pocket;</p>

I call God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men to witneſs, that I am wholly ignorant of the Manner, Cauſe or Time of the death of Juſtice <hi>Godfrey,</hi> although on that account by the malice of wicked men brought to this ſhameful death, which I hope will give me a ſpeedy paſſage to Eternal Life. In this hope I die cheerfully, becauſe of my Innocence,

and the benefit of the pretious wounds of my bleſſed Saviour, by whoſe Merits I hope for Salvation. I die a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> deſiring all ſuch to Pray for me: And I beſeech God in his Juſtice to Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this horrid Murder, with the Contrivers thereof, that my Innocence may appear: And though from my heart I forgive my Accuſers, yet I Cyte all ſuch as have had a hand in this Bloody Contrivance, before the great Tribunal of Gods Juſtice, to anſwer for the wrong they have done the Innocent; and particularly the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> and the Brothers of Sir <hi>Edmond Godfrey,</hi> with Jury, Witneſſes, and all their partakers. Oh Lord bleſs and preſerve His Majeſty, and be merciful to this poor Nation, and lay not Innocent Blood to its Charge: So I bid you all Farewel in Jeſus Chriſt, into whoſe hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit.</p>

            <p>This Paper was ſhewn to <hi>Hills</hi> Wife; and ſhe being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether it was her Husbands Hand-Writing; affirmed it was not: And being further asked whether ſhe convey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it to him, ſhe proteſted ſhe knew not how he came by it, and declared that ſhe never ſaw it before.</p>
            <p>Of this Leſſon <hi>Hill</hi> repeated as much as (in ſuch an ill time for conning) he could remember; wherein theſe particulars are very obſervable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That theſe words were not the Priſoners own words, but prepared by another for him to ſay.</p>
            <p>And that in a matter which required only plain Truth, but not Art, and ſo the Writers skill was needleſs.</p>
            <p>For all that the Priſoner could inſtruct the Penner in, muſt be, that he was not guilty of the Fact; which certainly would have been much more Credible out of his Mouth from his Heart, then out of this Paper from his Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65369:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 30 -->But the Obedience of the dying Proſelite, and the Charity of the Inſtructing Prieſt, (for ſuch without queſtion is the Indicter,) is very remarkable.</p>
            <p>For no man certainly in <hi>Articulo Mortis</hi> would have troubled his mind with a parcel of formal words, if the Awe of the Prieſt had not been prevalent, even above his conſiderations for a future ſtate.</p>
            <p>But above all, The exemplary Charity of the Holy Father is not to be forgotten; who after he has made his dying Penitent ſay that from his heart he did forgive his Accuſers; yet in his very next breath (which was almoſt his laſt too) he makes him cyte both Judge, Jury and Witneſſes, with all their partakers, before the great Tribunal of God's Juſtice, to anſwer for the wrong they have done him</p>
            <p>Which (beſides the incoherent Non-ſenſe) contains in it, Firſt the very Spirit of a <hi>Romiſh Priest.</hi> Then it manifeſts what regard they have to the Souls of their dying Diſciples, to make them call for Vengeance, when they ſhould forgive: And it ſhews the direct equivocation of a Prieſt too, who when he ſays from his heart he forgives, Yet hopes God will not; Elſe why does he Cyte them before the Dreadful Tribunall, to anſwer the Wrong they have done? And when the Priſoner was to ſay this at his Death, I would fain have any Man tell me, why he might not as well at his laſt hour denie the Truth, as depart from Charity, if his Prieſt requires it?</p>
            <p>I commend the Prieſt for his Care of their Church, in that the World ſhould know he died a Roman Catholick, but not ſo much for his care of the <hi>Man,</hi> When he would not let him deſire the Prayers of any but <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let any unprejudic'd perſon conſider well vvhat is naturally to be collected from this <hi>Paper,</hi> and he vvill eaſily judge, vvithout breach of Charitie, upon vvhat grounds Men of that Perſvvaſion are firſt ſeduced to commit a Sin, and then obſtinately to denie it to the laſt.</p>
