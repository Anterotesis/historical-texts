         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

CONSIDERATIONS
On the Principal
Objections and Arguments</head>
            <head type="sub">Which have been Publish'd against
Mr. Lock's Essay of Humane Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</head>
            <p>ยง I. IT is no Disparagement, I conceive, to
any Book, nor an Attributing more to
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Essay of Humane Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
than it most justly deserves, to say,
That Essay is a Book the best Adapted
of any I know, to serve the Interest of Truth,
Natural, Moral, and Divine: And that it is the
most Worthy, most Noble, and best Book I
ever read, excepting those which were writ by
Persons Divinely inspir'd. This excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
having been published several Years, and
received through all the Learned World with
very great Approbation, by those who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
English, a mighty Out cry was at last, all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57659:3"/>
on the sudden, raised against it here at Home.
There was, no doubt, some reason or other,
why so many hands should be employed, just
at the same time, to Attack and Batter this
<hi>Essay;</hi> tho' what was the weighty considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which put them all in motion, may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
continue a long time a Secret. Several
Persons have discovered their Inclination to find
fault with this Treatise, by nibbling at several
passages in it, which it appears they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
and concerning which they have been
at a loss how to express themselves Intelligibly.
Some have spoken handsomly of the Author,
others have treated that Incomparable Gentleman
with a rudeness peculiar to some, who make a
Profession of the Christian Religion, and seem
to pride themselves in being of the Clergy of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But whatever Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
may accrue to them on either of those
accounts, their Conduct doth not contribute any
thing to the Honour either of the one or of the
other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ยง II. The principal Passages in this excellent
Treatise, which have been insisted on as faulty,
are these two: First,</hi> Certainty of Knowledge is,
to perceive the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas,
as expressed in any Proposition. This (<hi>saith
Mr.</hi> Lock) we usually call Knowing, or being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Truth of any Proposition. <hi>Essay of
Humane Understanding,</hi> B. 4. c. 6. <hi>ยง 3. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
We have the Ideas of Matter and Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but possibly shall never be able to know, whether
any meer natural Being thinks or no; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for us, by the contemplation of our own
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57659:3"/>
Ideas, without Revelation, to discover whether Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
has not given to some Systems of Matter
fitly disposed, a power to perceive and think, or else
joined and fixed to Matter so disposed, a thinking
immaterial Substance: It being, in respect of our
Notions, not much more remote from our comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to conceive, that God can, if he pleases, super-add
to our Idea of Matter a faculty of thinking,
than that he should super-add to it another substance,
with a faculty of thinking; since we know not
wherein thinking consists, nor to what sort of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
the Almighty has been pleased to give that
power, which cannot be in any created Being, but
meerly by the good pleasure and bounty of the Creator.
<hi>Essay,</hi> &amp;c. B. 4. c. 3. <hi>ยง 6. To which I will
add, the better to shew Mr.</hi> Lock'<hi>s sense, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, which he immediately subjoyns
on this occasion; which those, who have thought
fit to excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>โข</desc>
                  </gap> against what he says here, have
thought fit always to omit, how fairly I will
not say. Mr.</hi> Lock'<hi>s following words are,</hi> For I
see no contradiction in it, that the first Eternal think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Being, or Omnipotent Spirit, should, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
give to certain Systems of created senseless
Matter, put together as he thinks fit, some degrees
of sense, perception and thought; tho', as I think,
I have proved, <hi>lib. 4. c.</hi> 10. it is no less than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to suppose Matter (which is evidently in
its own nature void of sense and thought) should be
that Eternal first thinking Being.</p>
            <p>ยง III. Against the first passage, <hi>viz. Certainty
of Knowledge, is to perceive the Agreement or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of Ideas, as expressed in any Proposition.</hi>
There are two Charges exhibited: First, That
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57659:4"/>
the Proposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ion is not true. In consequence of
which, <hi>the way of Ideas</hi> is condemned as <hi>no way
at all to Certainty, or Knowledge;</hi> and in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the way of Ideas, we are told, That to
argue or make Inferences from <hi>Maxims,</hi> is the
way to <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Certainty.</hi> Secondly, That
the Proposition is inconsistent with, and of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence to the <hi>Articles of the Christian
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ยง IV. First, It is said that the Proposition is
not true. Now, in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>der to make a right deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
whether the Proposition be true or
no, it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>it to consider in what the Truth
of a Proposition doth consist: For, I suppose it
will be allowed, that our being certain of, or
knowing the Truth of a Proposition, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in our perceiving that wherein the truth of
the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>oposition do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>h consist; otherwise we may
know, or be certain, that a Proposition is true,
tho' it be not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ue, which carries such a sound
with it, I conceive few will be ambitious to
grant it, whatever way they take to attain to
Certainty. The truth of a Proposition consists
<hi>in words being so put together in the Proposition, as
exactly to express the agreement or disagreement of
the Ideas they stand for, as really it is.</hi> This
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> calls <hi>Certainty of Truth,</hi> just before
those words in his Book which are pretended
to be fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>lty. This passage I take for granted,
will be permitted to pass for true, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ction hath been started against it,
after so strict a scrutiny, to find out something
from whence a colour might be taken, to give
the Book an ill Name, but because otherwise it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57659:4"/>
must be owned, that a Proposition may be true
tho' it is not true; or tho' the agreement or
disagreement of the Ideas, signified by the terms
which make up the Proposition, is not such as
the Proposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ion doth express. And if the truth
of a Proposition doth consist in what hath been
related, it is most evident that our being certain
of, or knowing the truth of a Proposition, must
consist in our perceiving that the Ideas, for
which the words, which make up the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
(or of which the Proposition doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist)
do stand, do so agree, or disag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ee, as the
Proposition doth express. For there is no way,
by which we can attain to be certain, or to
know that the Ideas do so agree, or disagree,
as the Proposition doth declare they do, but by
perceiving that they do so agree, or disagree,
unless certainty, or knowledge of the truth of
Propositions, may be had without <hi>perception,</hi> or
without perceiving the truth of what is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And if it may be had, without perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the truth of what is expressed, perception
is of so little moment, or use to certainty, or
knowledge, that those who can digest that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may easily be of the opinion, That Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
considered meerly as an extended, bulky,
figur'd Substance, may be certain of, or know
the truth of Propositions, tho' it cannot think
or perceive. This I suppose may suffice, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition is true; and
consequently, that the way of Ideas is a sure,
and indeed the only way to Cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ainty or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
so far as Men are capable of attaining to
know the truth of Propositions. Yet because
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57659:5"/>
another way to Certainty or Knowledge is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in opposition to the way of Ideas, <hi>viz.</hi>
The way of Maxims, or of Arguing, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or drawing Inferences from Maxims, I
will briefly consider that way, and what oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
it hath to the way of Ideas. But several
Propositions, commonly reputed and looked on
as Maxims, being not true, unless taken in a
very limited sense, I will change the term
Maxims, and place Self-evident Propositions in
its room. Now Self evident Propositions have
this in common with other Propositions, That
they consist of Words, which stand for Ideas.
And there is no way, by which a Person can
be certain, or know the truth of a Proposition,
we call Self-evident, but by perceiving that the
Ideas, signified by the words of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
doth consist, have such a connection
or agreement, or repugnancy, or disagreement,
as the Proposition doth express; for tho' the
Proposition be such, that no other Idea is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or can be made use of to help any Man
to a certainty, or knowledge, that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is true, because the Ideas signified by the
words, have, by an immediate comparison of
them, a visible agreement, or disagreement, yet
no Person can be certain, or can know that the
Proposition is true, who does not perceive that
the Ideas, signified by the terms of which the
Proposition doth consist, do so agree, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree,
as the Proposition doth express. Nor
can it be said to be a Self-evident Proposition,
to him who doth not perceive that the Ideas do
so agree, or disagree, as the Proposition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57659:5"/>
they do. And if there can be no way,
by which Persons can attain to be certain of the
truth of those Propositions we call Self-evident,
but this of perceiving the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, as expressed in them, the
only way, by which we can attain to know the
truth of other Propositions, must be that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
Ideas, that being the only way whereby
we can attain to perceive their agreement or
disagreement.</p>
            <p>ยง V. A Person's being certain of the truth
of a Proposition we call Self-evident, doth not
make him know the truth of another Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It may be a great help to his attaining to
know the truth of other Propositions, but it
will not contribute any other way to his being
certain of the truth of other Propositions, than
as it helps him to perceive that the agreement,
or disagreement of the Ideas, signified by the
words which make up those Propositions, is
such as the Propositions express. He that knows
the truth of a Self-evident Proposition, may, by
the help of that Proposition, easily attain to be
certain of the truth of another Proposition,
which hath an immediate connection with it;
but his knowledge of the truth of the latter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
will consist in his perceiving that the
Ideas, signified by the words of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
have such agreement, or disagreement, as
the Proposition doth express: For, if he does
not perceive that, he cannot be certain that the
Proposition is true, tho' he is most certain that
the former Proposition is true. If the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
he would know the truth of, be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57659:6"/>

2. 3. or 4. This I take to be demonstratively
certain, unless Certainty or Knowledge may be
had without Perception. Perhaps it will be
pretended, that we come to Certainty or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
not by perceiving the agreement or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of Ideas, but by Inferring, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Rational Deductions from known Self-evident
Principles, or Propositions. To this I
answer, That he who doth Rationally infer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57659:6"/>
any thing, or makes a Rational Deduction, does
not do it, that by that means he may attain to
Certainty or Knowledge, but that he may assist
and help others to that Knowledge or Certainty
he hath already obtained, by laying before them,
in a train of Proposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ions, the connection of all
the intermediate I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>eas, whereby the first and
the last are tied together. For a Person to
make a deduction Rationally, doth suppose his
being Certain, or Knowing, or perceiving that
what he deduces, hath such an agreement or
disagreement, with the Propositions from which
he do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>h deduce it, as his Inference doth express.
If a Man will infer, and make deductions Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
he must antecedently perceive the
agreement, or disagreement, of the Ideas about
which he is concerned, otherwise he can have
no reason to make Deductions: And if he does
make Deductions, and they prove to be Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
it is meerly by chance that they do so; and
he cannot be properly said to have made them
Rationally. If a Man will infer, and make
Deductions at all Adventures, before he can be
certain that his Inferences are true, he must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them, and compare the Ideas in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prositions
from which he hath deduced them.
He cannot be certain that his Inferences, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
barely as Propositions, are true, any other
way, than by perceiving that the Ideas, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the words of which they consist, do so
agree, or disagree, as those Propositions express.
He cannot be certain that they are true, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
as Inferences, any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ions from which they
were deduced. Inferring, and making De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
seems not to me to be the only way
to Certainty, but comparing Ideas, which is
the only way to perceive their agreement or
disagreement. And Self evident Principles, or
Propositions, and the use that can be made of
them to help us to Certainty, are so far from
having any opposition to the way of Ideas, that
neither their Truth can be known, nor any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Use (with respect to Truth) be made of
them, but by the way of Ideas.</p>
            <p>ยง VI. The second Charge produced against
this Proposition, is, That it is of dangerous
consequence to, and inconsistent with <hi>the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Christian Faith.</hi> This Charge seems
to be grounded on the last words of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
Proposition, <hi>viz. As expressed in any Proposition.</hi>
Now some Propositions come to us by Divine
Revelation; and several of these Propositions
are such, we cannot perceive by comparing the
Ideas, signify'd by the words of which they
consist, that they do so agree or disagree, as the
Propositions do express. It follows therefore,
from Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition, that we cannot be
certain of, or know the Truth of those Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions<g ref="char:punc">โช</g>
and this is said to be inconsistent with,
or of dangerous consequence to the Articles of
the Christian Faith, but I cannot understand for
what reason it is said to be so. For as the truth
of all Propositions, come they to us by what
way soever, consists in what hath been before
mentioned, so our being certain of, or knowing
the truth of any Proposition, let it come to us
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57659:7"/>
by what way soever, must consist in that,
wherein our being certain of, or knowing the
truth of any Proposition doth consist: For the
way how a Proposition is brought to us, doth
not alter its nature, consider'd as a Proposition,
nor the nature of Certainty, or Knowledge,
which are fixed, and unchangeable, and always
the same, and therefore cannot make Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Knowledge of its truth, to consist in any
thing, but what Certainty or Knowledge of the
truth of a Proposition, brought to us some other
way, doth consist in. If it shall now be ask'd,
Whether, seeing there are certain Propositions
which come to us by Divine Revelation, and
we cannot perceive that the agreement or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of the Ideas, signify'd by the words
in those Propositions, is such as the Propositions
express, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with, and of dangerous consequence to
those Articles of the Christian Faith? I answer,
That when an account is given of the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Ideas, for which those phrases, <hi>inconsistent
with,</hi> and <hi>of dangerous consequence,</hi> do stand,
whether they are used in different senses, or
both be designed to signify one and the same
thing: And what that, or those precise Ideas
are, which are meant by them, distinct and
proper Answers may be given to the Question,
or Questions propounded. If by inconsistent
with those Articles, is meant inconsistent with
the truth of those Articles; and so the Question
amounts to this, Whether that Proposition of
Mr. <hi>Locks</hi> can be true, and those Articles true
too? The Answer is Yes, very well; for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57659:8"/>
truth of those Propositions doth not depend on
our being certain of, or knowing the truth of
them. If by inconsistent with those Articles be
meant, that we cannot be certain of, or know
the truth of those Articles, then the Question
will be, Whether it will not follow from
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition, that we cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of, or know the truth of those Articles?
To which the Answer is, Yes. But the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
for all that, is inconsistent enough with
those Articles, tho' it cannot con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ist well with
Peoples pretending to know what God hath set
out of their reach, and which they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to know. It is no wrong at all to those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
to say we cannot be certain of, or know
the truth of them; it is a speaking of the truth,
and an attributing unto them the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>eminence
which God hath given them. If Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>sons are
resolv'd they will use this phrase, inconsistent
with Articles of the Christian Faith in this sense,
there is no help for it; yet Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
will continue true, and cannot do any
injury to any <hi>one Article of the Christian Faith.</hi>
But what will become then (may some say) of
those Articles of the Christian Faith, or of
those Propositions which come to us by Divine
Revelation, and the truth of which we cannot
be certain of, or know? Answer: They will
continue just as they are, very great, even Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Incomprehensible Truths; and they
are to have all the Entertainment given them by
us, that Divine Revelation designs they should
have. Whatever Propositions are brought to
us by Divine Revelation, and proposed to us
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57659:8"/>
by it, to be the Objects of our Knowledge,
they are so formed, that we may perceive that
the agreement or disagreement of the Ideas,
signified by the words of which they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
is such as the Propositions express. And
we have no other way to be certain of, or to
know the truth of those Propositions, but by
perceiving that the Ideas do so agree, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree,
as the Propositions express. But as for
those Propositions, which come to us by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations, and are such, that we cannot
perceive that the Ideas, signify'd by the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ds
of which they consist, have such agreement or
disagreement, as the Propositions express, they
are not proposed to us, by Divine Revelation, to
be <hi>Objects of our Knowledge,</hi> but only of <hi>our
Faith.</hi> And tho' we do not, nor can know, or
be certain of the truth of these Propositions,
yet if we do firmly, and with full assurance,
believe them to be true, because we have good
satisfaction that God hath revealed them; and
if our belief of their truth, hath all that effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and influence on us, which Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
requires, we do fully answer the design
of Divine Revelation, with respect to these
Articles of the Christian Faith. But is not
Faith (may some say) a Reasonable Act? Yes:
But all reasonable Assent is not Certainty or
Knowledge. My assent to the truth of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
or my believing it to be true, is a
Reasonable Act, not because I am certain, or
do know that it is true, but because my Assent
is founded on such Evidence that it is true, as
is every way sufficient to justifie my Assenting
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57659:9"/>
to it. There cannot be a more Reasonable Act,
than to believe the truth of that Proposition,
which we are on good grounds satisfied is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be true, by that God who cannot Lye.
Let any Man produce a Proposition, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation hath brought to Light, and
make it appear to me that it came to Men by
Divine Revelation, I shall believe it, or assent
most firmly to the truth of it, tho' I cannot
know the truth of it; and my doing so, will be
a most Reasonable Act, because my assent will
be grounded on Divine Testimony<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> But let that
Person, or any other Persons, frame another
Proposition in Philosophical Terms, concerning
the same matter, and then pretend, that that
Proposition declares something more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that matter, than God hath revealed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, if I cannot perceive that the Ideas,
signify'd by the words of that Proposition, do
agree or disagree as the Proposition expresses, I
cannot be certain, or know that the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is true; nor will my assenting to the truth
of it, upon his or their saying it is true, be a
Reasonable Act. For the Proposition being
about a matter out of his or their reach, I have
not sufficient evidence to assure me that it is
true; yet, notwithstanding the latter Proposition
doth consist of different words from the former,
if it be declared that neither more nor less is
meant by these words, than is signify'd by those
in the other Proposition, I can assent to the
truth of it, and my assent will be a Reasonable
Act, because tho' they are two distinct Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
consider'd as to the words, yet as to sense
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57659:9"/>
they are but one, and exactly the same. Well,
but at this rate, what becomes of the <hi>Certainty
of Faith?</hi> Answer. <hi>Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> are
two words, which stand for, or signifie two
distinct Acts of the Mind; and they can no
more be properly affirmed of one another, than
those distinct Acts can be said to be one and the
same. Indeed, a Person may use the word
<hi>Certainty,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> if he please, for Assent,
grounded upon probable Evidence, or for Assent
founded on Authority, or for any other Idea he
hath a mind to call by that Name; and if he
certifies what the Idea is, he hath a mind to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
by that word, his Discourse may be Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
if he constantly use the word in that
sense. But if he will oppose another Person,
who hath declared that he useth the word <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> strictly taken, in the
same sense, and doth not declare that he takes
the word Certainty in another sense, his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
will unavoidably be very obscure, if not
perfectly unintelligible: For it will be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
he useth the word in that sense, in which
the other Person had declared he did use it,
when all the while he means another thing by
it.</p>
            <p>ยง VII. When it is said that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is of dangerous consequence to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Christian Faith, if something else
is signify'd by it, than what was meant by the
former phrase, a distinct Account should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of what is intended by this phrase. If any
shall pretend that the true and just consequence
of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition is this, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57659:10"/>
of the Christian Faith are not to be believed,
the Proposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ended to be deduced is a
very wicked Proposition. But then it is as
plain, and certain as any thing can be, That it
can no way be drawn from Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
which has no relation at all to any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, or Belief, ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>her Christian, or
other. If Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition can concern,
or affect any <hi>Christian Articles,</hi> they must be
<hi>Articles of Christian Knowledge,</hi> not of <hi>Christian
Faith.</hi> And his Proposition is so far from being
of dangerous consequence to Articles of Christian
Knowledge, that it gives the true Account
wherein the knowledge of those Articles doth
consist, as will most evidently appear, when
any of those Articles shall be instanced in and
considered. If it shall be pretended, that from
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition it may be regularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
That no Man ought to believe, that any
Proposition is true, but what he can attain to
know the truth of, and that he ought not to
assent to the truth of it, till he attains to be
certain of, or to know the truth of it, and
that this is what is meant, when it is said to be
of dangerous consequence to the Articles of the
Christian Faith; then, in the first place it is to
be acknowledged, that the Proposition intended
to be regularly deduced from the other, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
of most dangerous consequence to those
Persons, who shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er themselves to be ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by it, and this with respect to Articles of
the Christian Faith. But then, in the second
place, it is great Injustice to charge Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
Proposition with that, which can only in Justice
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57659:10"/>
be laid to the charge of another Proposition;
especially to do so before it is proved, and
made to appear, that that dangerous Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can regularly be inferred from Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
Proposition, which is a point altogether uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being proved, for there is no possibility
of shewing any connection between them: The
two Propositions are as far distant from one
another, as the East is from the West. From
what hath been already said, I think it may with
reason enough be concluded, that the principal
Accusations, advanced against Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
are altogether groundless.</p>
            <p>ยง VIII. Certainty, or Knowledge did, and
will, always consist, in what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> declares
it doth consist; and the way to attain Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was always by comparing Ideas. What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of knowing soever those have, who speak
most slightingly of the way of Ideas, all their
knowledge is owing to it, how little soever
they are aware of it, or how strongly soever
they are inclined to attribute it to something
else. There were Persons, in all Ages, who
attained to certain measures of knowledge, and
were never able to declare distinctly and fully
how they came by their Knowledge. They
generally stopped in their Accounts, at the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Methods, whereby they were assisted in
comparing of Ideas, (tho' they took no notice
of that) which was the true and natural way
by which they perceived their agreement or
disagreement, and obtained knowledge. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
is the first Person I have heard of, who hath
observed, and acquainted the World, in what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57659:11"/>
Knowledge, or Certainty doth consist. By
which discovery he hath done Mankind so

not to spend their Labours in fruitless Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to know what is out of Humane reach,
and what they can never attain to certainty in,
that Men will never be able to pay him

are, of the cohesion of solid and separable parts,
how minute and invisible soever they be, and
must be dissolved when Life is ended. And it
takes off very much from the evidence of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
if it depend wholly upon God's gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that, which of its own nature it is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Immortality of the Soul
doth not depend on our knowing, or perceiving
by demonstrative proof, in the way of Reason,
that it is Immaterial; nor doth our having a
Rational Perswasion, that the Soul is Immortal,
depend on our knowing that it is Immaterial.</p>
            <p>ยง XI. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> doth not say that the Soul is
Material: He owns that we have the highest
degree of probability that it is Immaterial, but
that we cannot attain to demonstrative Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Knowledge, by comparing the Ideas of
Matter and Thinking, that the Soul is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Substance, tho' we may this way know
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57659:12"/>
that it is a Spiritual Substance. What Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
saith is this, <hi>We cannot, by the contemplation of our
own Ideas, without Revelation, discover whether
Omnipotency has not given to some Systems of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
fitly disposed, a power to perceive and think;</hi> or
that we cannot demonstrativel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap> prove, by meer
Principles of Reason, or Philosophy, either the
Materiality or Immateriality of the Soul, but
that the point is above our Reason, and what
we cannot be fully assured of but by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.
For this his Assertion, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
some Reasons, which hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap> not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be invalid, or weak, by any of those
Authors I have seen, who have declared their
dislike of this Assertion. And if the Reasons
he hath given for his Assertion cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
but are solid and unanswerable, it will
not be easie to prove that his Assertion may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be blamed. To prove Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Proposition
false, either the Materiality, or Immateriality
of the Soul, should be demonstratively proved,
for he denies that either of them can be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
proved. The surest way to prove the
falseness of a Proposition, which denies that a
thing can be demonstrated, is to demonstrate
that thing. I know an Attempt hath been made,
by one who condemns the way of Ideas, as no way
at all to Certainty, to demonstrate <hi>that Matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Think,</hi> or <hi>that God cannot superadd to any System
of Matter a Power of Thinking;</hi> which demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is manag'd in the way of Ideas. But tho'
what is offer'd <hi>there,</hi> for demonstration, would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
prove that <hi>Solidity</hi> is not <hi>a Power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
if that needed proof, yet I think it doth not
afford any sort of evidence that Omnipotency
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57659:12"/>
cannot superadd both <hi>Solidity,</hi> and a <hi>power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
to one and the same Substance, which was the
point to be demonstrated. Besides, the way of Ideas
being condemned, as no way at all to Certainty,
those who are of that mind, cannot with any reason
pretend, that what hath been offered for a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of this point, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>eally a demonstration of it.
For if they can think it to be a Demonstration of
the point, they cannot avoid being obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their <hi>other thought,</hi> and think the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
whether they may judge it proper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to acknowledge the same openly or no.
If what hath been offered for a Demonstration
of this point, be really a Demonstration of it,
the way of Ideas is undoubtedly a way to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
yea, and a way to Certainty about a
point, which I am inclined to think cannot be
demonstrated any other way.</p>
            <p>ยง XII. 3. If the Soul were <hi>nothing but a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Substance,</hi> what follows those words in the
objection might perhaps pass with some for a
plain Truth: but for my part, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
how any thing, that hath life, should
be nothing but a material Substance; for Life
is no part of, nor hath any necessary connection
with the Idea, signified by these words, Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Substance. Nor do I perceive any necessity,
that a Material Substance endued with Life,
must lose its Life, because by some Accident,
or within a certain period, the gross and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts of it must fall off from those more
fine and insensible parts which God hath order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the Seat of Life. And those who think
they can prove demonstratively, that the Soul
is a created Immaterial Substance, must take
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57659:13"/>
heed of affirming that the Soul is <hi>nothing but a
created Immaterial Substance,</hi> lest that Assertion
prove of dangerous consequence to, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Articles of the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>istian Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>h;
for if the Soul be nothing but a created Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance, it is not a Spiritual, or Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Substance; for the power of Thinking, is
a power which God superadds to our Idea,
whether of Material, or created Immaterial
Substance, and which neither the one, nor the
other can have, <hi>but meerly by the good pleasure,
and bounty of the Creator,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> most Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
and Piously observes. But Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
doth not any where say, That the Soul is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Material Substance, or that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know, by contemplating our Ideas, that
the Soul is nothing but a Material Substance.
Indeed, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath these words, <hi>We have
the Ideas of Matter and Thinking, but possibly shall
never be able to know, whether any Material Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thinks or no.</hi> From these words, <hi>Any meer
Material Being,</hi> some may, perhaps, in their
haste, have taken occasion to think, that
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Notion was, that for ought we could
know, the Soul might be nothing but a Material
Substance. To rectifie which mistake, I think
it may be sufficient to note, that <hi>meer Material,</hi>
in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Sense, is not oppos'd to a power
of Thinking, (which we cannot know but God
may supperadd to our Idea of Matter) but to an
Immaterial Substance, considered as joyned to
a Material Being.</p>
            <p>ยง XIII. 4. It is not very easie to comprehend
what is meant by these words, <hi>It takes off very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57659:13"/>
much from the evidence of Immortality, if it depend
wholly upon God's giving that, which of its own
nature it is not capable of.</hi> For no created Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
can have any thing more, than God is
pleased to give it. It is not very intelligible to
me, that God should give to any thing, that
which its nature is not capable of, especially
if by Nature be here meant, what I find some
Persons do sometimes mean by that word, <hi>viz.</hi>
Substance; for what Substance is capable of,
even after that solidity is added to it, is more
than any Man can know. And if Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
can add a power of Thinking to solid
Substance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>itly disposed, no Man can be certain
that solid Thinking Substance is not of its own
nature capable of Immortality; but whether a
created Being shall be Mortal or Immortal, is
not to be determined by our considering its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but by understanding the pleasure of God
concerning it. The Humane Nature is the same
now it was in the first Ages of the World; but
that Men do not now ordinarily live above a
hundred Years, is not to be resolved into this,
that the Humane Nature is not capable of being
continued longer in Life, than that space, but
into the pleasure of God, that now Men shall
not ordinarily live to a greater Age; for Men
did ordinarily, in the first Ages of the World,
live many hundreds of Years; and that they
did so, was purely to be attributed to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Pleasure. And had it been the pleasure of
him, who kept Men then so long in Life, that
Men should not die, they would have been
Immortal. If the evidence of Immortality,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57659:14"/>
consists in Immateriality, the Immateriality of
the Soul must be demonstratively proved, before
Persons can perceive the evidence of the Souls
Immortality. For if any person takes it for
granted, that the Souls Immateriality may be
demonstratively proved from, or by certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reason, and from thence perswades
himself that the Soul is Immortal, and upon
after-trial and examination he shall find that his
Principles he depended on are uncertain, and
cannot afford him such proof as he was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they would yield, his discovering the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his own Principles, which he went
upon in point of Reason, will, according to a
Notion lately advanced, weaken the Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Souls Immortality, when considered
purely as a Matter of Faith. And if this be
true, great and speedy care should be taken to
produce demonstrative proof, that the Soul is an
Immaterial Substance, not only to make Men
certain that their Souls are Immortal, but to
secure the Credibility of Divine Testimony.
But blessed be God, we have a sure Foundation
for our Faith to rest on; for the Testimony of
God will never fail, but always remain firm
and true, how short soever the Principles of
Reason may fall, of bringing us to Certainty
or Knowledge, concerning several Articles of
Faith, or Propositions, which come to us by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation. It may be proved, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree of probability, that the Soul is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material;
but no demonstrative proof being yet
produced in the way of Reason, that the Soul is
Immaterial, I cannot understand why any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57659:14"/>
should pretend it must follow that the Soul
must be Mortal, if it be a Material Substance,
with a superadded power or faculty of Thinking;
and in that respect, or on that account, a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Substance, tho' not Immaterial, for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
and Mortal have no necessary connection.
And therefore we cannot be certain, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the Ideas those words stand for,
that every Material Substance must be Mortal.
And he who shall affirm, that every Material
Substance must necessarily be Mortal, will, if
he adhere to his Assertion, find himself obliged
to deny, at least, two Articles of the Christian
Faith, or two Propositions which come to us
by Divine Revelation, 1. That Man became
Mortal by Sin, or that <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death;</hi>
for it is past doubt, that one part of Man, when
first created, was Material. And if every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance must necessarily die, Man must
have died, tho' he had never sinned. 2. That
after the Resurrection Men will be Immortal;
for, after the Resurrection, one part of Man
will be Material.</p>
            <p>ยง XIV. Secondly, It is pretended that this
passage, in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Essay, which I have
been discoursing of, may from the Nature of
Matter be proved to be false. I will, 1st. Say
something of this point in general; and then,
2dly. Consider particularly what the last Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
I have seen, who finds fault with this passage,
doth say concerning it, who I think takes in
the whole strength of what others have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
who have on this Account formed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
against it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57659:15"/>
ยง XV. First, I will say something concerning
this point in general. Substance, I conceive,
will be acknowledged on all hands to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divided into Material and Immaterial; but
how many various, different Powers, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
these sorts of Substances are capable of
receiving, is what surpasses Man's Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Yet whatever Powers they are capable of
receiving, God can give or superadd unto them
if he pleases; whether he hath given to either
sort all the Powers it is capable of, is more
than we can be certain of, by the bare Exercise
of our Reason<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> He may, for any thing we
know to the contrary, give to certain Material
Systems fitly disposed, some Powers, which he
also gives to Immaterial Substances. Amongst
these we may reckon the power of Thinking,
which neither Material, nor Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
can have, whether God will or no.
And whether it hath been his pleasure to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add
this power only to the Idea we express by
Immaterial Substance, or also to the Idea we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
by Material Substance, is a point we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be fully assured of but by Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The power of Thinking, added to a
Substance, whether Material, or Immaterial,
makes that Substance, Spirit. Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Immaterial Substance, and Spirit, are
terms which stand for three distinct Ideas. And
tho' Spirit, or Spiritual Substance, doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Matter, or Material Substance in its Idea,
yet the power of Thinking being superadded to
Matter, will make it Spirit, or Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Just as Spirit doth not imply Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57659:15"/>
Substance in its Idea, yet the power of
Thinking being superadded to Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
makes it Spirit or Spiritual Substance,
which it could not be, without a power of
Thinking added to it. To ask therefore pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily,
whether Matter can think or not?
is to propose an obscure Question which wants
explaining. If by the Question be meant, Can
God add a power of Thinking to Matter or
no? The Answer will be, We have no demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
proof for either part of the Question;
and therefore cannot be certain concerning the
Matter. But if by the Question be meant, Can
Matter Think without having a power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
superadded to it? The Answer is plainly,
No. But the way of Arguing, that then the
Substance which Thinks must be Immaterial,
is not very clear, for Immaterial Substance can
no more Think, than Matter can, without a
power of Thinking added to it: And whether
it be Material, or Immaterial Substance, to
which the power of Thinking is added, that
Substance thinks, tho' it be by virtue of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
superadded to it, without which it could
not think, or considered barely as Material, or
Immaterial Substance. Solidity, and a power
of Thinking, are perfectly distinct, and quite
different Powers; yet if God can superadd a
power of Thinking to a solid Substance, there
is no necessity that the Substance which Thinks
must be Immaterial, for Substance, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Thinking, are as distinct as Material and
Immaterial. The Material Substance thinks,
tho' not precisely under this consideration, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57659:16"/>
as having another Power added to it, whereby
it is enabled to do that, which it could not do
without it, <hi>viz.</hi> to Think. And tho' the Idea
of Thinking will not prove the substance which
thinks to be immaterial, it will, if superadded
to Matter, prove that the substance which
thinks hath another power than that which
made it Matter, and will as certainly prove it
to be a Spiritual Substance, as Solidity can prove
it to be a Material Substance; Solidity, and a
power of thinking, are very different powers,
but they are not contradictory. And there is
no inconsistency, in supposing that the same
substance may have more distinct modifications
than one, let them be ever so different one
from the other, whilst they are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory.
We cannot attain to Certainty, that
God cannot add a power of Thinking to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
tho' we may that he cannot make the same
substance to be material and immaterial at the
same time, because this latter is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>ยง XVI. Secondly, I will now consider what
the last Author I have seen, who finds fault with
this passage in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Essay, doth say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it. This Author is the Reverend
Mr. <hi>Ienkin,</hi> who having quoted out of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
<hi>Essay of Humane Understanding,</hi> part of what I
have before transcribed out of that Book, hath
(in the 46 and 47 pages of his <hi>Preface</hi> before his
<hi>Reasonableness and Certainty of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>)
the words which shall be marked all along
as I come to them, as these following words
(with which he begins his Reply to what he quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57659:16"/>
out of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>) are, <q>But it seems not
intelligible, how God should superadd to
Matter this faculty, or power, or modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of thinking, unless he change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Matter, and make it quite another
thing than it is, or joyn a substance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature to it.</q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is very common,
even with noted Authors, to express themselves
in such a manner, that tho' at first view their
Sentences seem to have a very plausible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
yet, upon a stricter consideration, their
Sense proves to be so uncertain, and undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that it is very hard to know what they do
mean. I will suppose that here, by, <hi>It seems not
Intelligible that God should,</hi> &amp;c. is meant, That
Men cannot understand, how God should, or
can superadd a Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Thinking to
Matter, but either, by changing the nature of
Matter, or by joyning a Substance of another
nature to it. And I think it not Intelligible,
how this proves any thing against Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
Proposition, to which it is opposed. For tho'
we cannot understand how God should do this,
but by one of the ways before-mentioned, (and
it seems supposed by this Author that we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how God can do it, either of those
ways) yet he may do it some other way, which
is not intelligible to us. And if he can do it,
in a way, which we cannot understand how he
should do it, it is most certain, that we cannot
know, or be certain that he cannot do it. God
hath done, and does do many things, which
we cannot understand the manner how he did,
or does do them. Therefore it is no proof that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57659:17"/>
God cannot do a thing, because we do not, or
cannot understand the manner how he can do
it. But seeing God can do things, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand how he can do them, this is a
very just and good Reason, why we should not
pretend to know he hath not done such a thing,
when we cannot alledge any thing more to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our pretence, but this, that we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how he should do it. If we could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how God might superadd a power of
Thinking to Matter, this would not prove that
he has done it. In like manner, our not being
able to understand how he should do it, can be
no proof that he hath not done it. These words
considered as they are offered for an Answer to
what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath said, seem to carry with
them two suppositions, which should be taken
for true: 1. Here is supposed, that God hath
not done any thing, which we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how he should do; which supposition is
apparently a mistake, and void of Truth.
2. Here is supposed, that it is intelligible how
God should add a Thinking Power to Matter,
either of the ways here assigned, but with this
intimation, That it can be demonstratively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that he hath not done it either of those
ways, and therefore that he hath not done it at
all. Without these suppositions, I think it not
intelligible, how these words can concern what
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath said, who doth not side with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the Question, Whether God has,
or has not, added a Thinking Power to Matter,
but saith, That neither part of the Question
can be demonstratively proved. To prove this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57659:17"/>
way, against Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> That God has not added
a Power of Thinking to any System of Matter,
the truth of both the Suppositions should be
made undeniably plain and clear, and then the
intimated demonstration should be produced.
The demonstration not being laid down, no
Judgment can be made of it, nor by it. But
the two ways assigned, by which it is supposed
intelligible how God should add a Power of
Thinking to Matter, may be a little considered.
The first way by which it is supposed intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
how God might add a power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Matter, is, by changing the nature of
Matter. And by changing the nature of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I conceive, by the words following, we
are to understand, making it quite another
thing than it is. Now, I think it is altogether
unintelligible, how God should superadd to
Matter a Power of Thinking, by making it
quite another thing than it is; for then it must
cease to be Matter. Indeed, it is not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that God should superadd a Thinking Power
to Matter, and not make it another thing, (tho'
not quite another thing) than it was before that
Power of Thinking was superadded to it. But
tho' by superadding that Power to it, it would
be made another thing, yet it would not cease
to be what it was before: It would still be
Matter, tho' nothing but Matter. A new
Power cannot be superadded to any thing, but
that thing must continue what it was before, tho'
by that super-addition it hath what it had not
before. Should Matter cease to be Matter, no
Power or Faculty could be added to it. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57659:18"/>
saith, We cannot be fully assured, any other
way than by Divine Revelation, whether God
has, or has not, super-added a Power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any System of matter fitly disposed. Now
to say in opposition to this, That God cannot
do it, but by making matter quite another thing
than it is, doth carry along with it an unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
Supposition, or rather an express Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<hi>viz.</hi> That God can super-add some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to matter, by making that same matter
cease to be matter. But it is undeniably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that if solid Substance be capable of having
a Thinking Power super-added to it, God can
super-add that Power or Faculty to it, tho' we
cannot understand the way or manner how he
should do it. And we cannot, by comparing
our Ideas, attain to Certainty, or Knowledge,
whether matter is capable, or not, of having a
Power of Thinking super-added to it, because
we cannot this way reach to know the utmost
Capacity of matter. And if matter be capable
of having that Power super-added to it, we
cannot be fully assured any other way than by
Divine Revelation, whether God has super-added
that Power to any Systems of Matter:
For God is not necessarily obliged to super-add
to any thing, every Power it may be capable
of.</p>
            <p>ยง XVII. The second way proposed, how
God might super add a Power of Thinking to
Matter, is, <hi>By joyning a Substance of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to it.</hi> Answ. 1. The joyning of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of another nature to matter, will not
super-add a Power of Thinking, unless that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57659:18"/>
Substance of another nature has the Power of
Thinking joyned to it. The Power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is a Power super-added to Substance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Substance be material, or immaterial,
to which God is pleased to super-add it. 2. The
joyning of an immaterial Thinking Substance
to Matter, is not a super-adding to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ter the
Faculty of Thinking. The Faculty or Power
of Thinking in this Case, is appropriated to the
immaterial Substances, and is not a Power
super-added to matter. 3. It is every jot as
unintelligible to us, <hi>how</hi> an immaterial substance
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>hould be joyned to a material substance, as

                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ow a Power of Thinking should be super-added
to a material substance. And I think it
altogether unintelligible, that God should super-add
a Power of Thinking to Matter, this way.
Tho' we cannot understand how God should
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ยง XVIII. <hi rend="margQuotes">But the Question is, Whether a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

               <hi>Answ.</hi> If this be the Question, it is a very dark
and obscure one. The Question, as here word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
seems to suppose, or grant, that Powers are

Now, as one Power cannot operate on
another Power, so neither can one Power be
produced out of other Powers. To talk of one
Power of Matter being produced out of anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Power of Matter, seems to me altogether unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible;
for I cannot imagine what can be
meant by it, unless it be either that one Power
of Matter contains, in the Bowels of it, another
Power, which may one way or other be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of it, the former still continuing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which I conceive is not consistent with good
sense; or that one Power of Matter doth contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to its having another Power, which is a
little intelligible as the former. And is much
the same thing, as to say, That that Power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which makes it a <hi>Loadstone:</hi> Whereas the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which make Matter to be <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,</hi>
are as perfectly different from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which make Matter to be <hi>Iron,</hi> and <hi>Wax,</hi> as
they are from that Power which makes Matter
to be <hi>Wood,</hi> or from those Powers which make
Matter to be any of those other things to which
we assign other <hi>Specifick Names.</hi> As Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
modified a certain way, has a certain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
super-added to it, which it had not before it
was so modified, so, being modified another
way, it hath another power super-added to it,
different from the former. Now it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
we should know how many powers may be
super-added to Substance, whether having, or
not having, the modification of Solidity, unless
we could accurately understand how many
ways it can be modified. A thousand Questions
may be proposed concerning Powers, whether
they can be super-added to a Substance that has
the modification of Solidity upon its being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
modified, to which no Answer can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which can be demonstratively proved.
And amongst other Reasons, because we cannot
know the precise modifications, on which those
Powers must depend, we are not admitted so
far into the Secrets of Nature, as to be able to
take cognizance of all the various real Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
on which all the Powers, which may be
super-added to our Idea of Matter, may depend.
If before any Man knew any thing of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
this Question had been put, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether
God had super-added to a System of Matter,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57659:20"/>
fitly disposed, a power to draw Iron to it? No
Man then living could have given an Answer to
it, which he could have proved demonstratively.
Had the Question been answer'd negatively, we
are now very well assured, the Answer had been
false. If the Answer had been affirmative, tho'
it had been really true, yet the Answer could
not then have been proved demonstratively.
The Question, with relation to what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
hath said, seems to me to be this, Whether a
demonstrative proof can be produced that it is,
or is not the pleasure of God, that a Power of
Thinking shall be super-added to our Idea of
Matter, upon a System of Matter being modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in a certain manner? And this Question
cannot be satisfactorily resolved any other way,
than by producing a demonstrative proof either
of the one part of the Question, or of the other;
for till the demonstrative proof is produced, we
must continue uncertain, and ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the point surmounts our view, is too
difficult for us to resolve demonstratively, and
that it doth not come within our notice.
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> doth not discourse there, of what may
be produced out of the Powers, and various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications
of Matter, but of what God can su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-add,
if he please, to Matter fitly disposed:
So that, the Question here cannot be, Whether
a Power of Faculty of Thinking will necessarily
result out of the Powers of Matter, upon its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a certain manner modified? But whether
Omnipotency cannot give to a System of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
fitly disposed, a power of Thinking, which
could not be produced out of the Powers and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57659:20"/>
various Modifications of Matter? There is no
reason at all to imagine, that the Power of
Thinking must be produced out of the Powers
and various Modifications of Matter, because a
System of Matter, <hi>fitly disposed,</hi> is taken notice of
as requisite, or necessary, in order to its having
a Power of Thinking super-added to it. For
that the Matter be fitly disposed is necessary,
whether God give the power of Thinking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to it, or mediately, <hi>viz.</hi> By joyning
to it an immaterial Thinking Substance. And
as it doth not follow, that because the System of
Matter must be fitly disposed, to have an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Thinking Substance joyned to it, therefore
this immaterial Thinking Substance can be, or
is produced out of the Powers, and various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications
of Matter; so neither doth it follow,
that because the Matter must be fitly disposed, to
have a Power of Thinking, given or super-added
to it, therefore the Power of Thinking
can be, or is produced out of the Powers and
various Modifications of Matter. Which ever
way it is, that a power of Thinking is lodged in,
or super-added to a System of Matter fitly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
there is something added to the System
of matter so disposed, by the good Pleasure and
Bounty of God, which could not be produced
out of the Powers, and various modifications of
matter. But <hi>how</hi> God does it, which ever way
it is, is alike unintelligible to us; nor can we
demonstrate which way it is.</p>
            <p>ยง XIX. <hi rend="margQuotes">And we can have no more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
how any modification of matter can
produce Thinking, than we can how any
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57659:21"/>
modification of Sound should produce Seeing.</hi>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Allowing all this to be true, it is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of that for which it is brought. If
there is any strength in this Proposition, with
relation to what it should prove, it must lie
either in the term <hi>How,</hi> or in these words, <hi>We
can have no Conception;</hi> or else, <hi>In the comparing
of the Modifications of Matter, with the Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Sound:</hi> And Arguing, or Inferring, that
because, or if no modification of sound can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Seeing, then no modification of matter can
produce Thinking. That which this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should prove is this, That the Power of
Thinking cannot be super-added; or that it is
not the pleasure of God, that the Power of
Thinking shall be super-added to Solid Substance,
let it be modified in what manner soever. Now,
first of all, If the force of the Proposition
brought to prove this, do lie in the term <hi>How,</hi>
it must derive its force from this Supposition,
That no power can be super-added to Solid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
however modified, but what we can
conceive <hi>How</hi> it should be super-added to it.
That is, That no System of Matter, whose real
Constitution we cannot accurately understand,
can have any power; which is, in effect, to
affirm, That solid Substance cannot have any
power super-added to it. For all the Powers
that all Systems of Matter can have, depending
entirely on their real Constitutions, to which
we are perfect Strangers, none of them must
have any powers at all, because we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>how</hi> any powers should be super-added to
solid substance, or cannot conceive their real
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57659:21"/>
Constitutions, or not exactly understand the
precise modifications of Matter, whereby they
are made such Systems. Secondly, If the force
of the Proposition spoken of, consists in these
words, <hi>We can have no Conception,</hi> then it derives
its force from this Supposition, That no power
can be super-added to solid substance, but what
we can conceive can be super-added to it, tho'
we may not be able to conceive how it can be
super-added to it. Now this is a Supposition
that makes all the Powers of all Systems of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to depend not on their real Constitutions,
but on our Ability, to conceive that they can
have them; whereas there are innumerable Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
super-added to solid Substance, which we
cannot conceive can be added to it, because
those Systems of Matter, which have them, come
not under our observation and notice. This
must needs be acknowledged by all, who do not
fancy that all Material Beings fall under their
inspections, and that they can take a Survey of
every one of them. Moreover, we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
certain Powers to be super-added to certain
Systems of matter, which are not super-added
to them; of which, a multitude of Instances
might be given, there being nothing almost
more common, than for Persons to conceive
that certain Systems of matter have such Powers
as they really have not. Thirdly, If the force
of this Proposition doth lie in comparing <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications
of Matter</hi> with <hi>the modifications of Sound,</hi>
and inferring, that if no modification of <hi>Sound</hi>
can produce <hi>Seeing,</hi> that then no modification
of matter can produce Thinking, then the term
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57659:22"/>
               <hi>How,</hi> and these words, <hi>We can have no Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
are super-numerary; for if they cannot
impart any strength to either part of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
considered absolutely, they cannot add
any weight to the comparison. Leaving out
therefore those words, the Proposition is thus,
Any modifications of matter can no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Thinking, than any modifications of sound
can produce Seeing. This Proposition is true,
both the parts of it are so; but then it is not any
thing to the purpose, for which it was intended.
Turn it into an Hypothetical Proposition, that
it may have the form or appearance of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and it must run thus, If no modification
of sound can produce Seeing, then no modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of matter can produce Thinking. Here
both the Antecedent and Consequent are true,
but then the Consequence can never be proved;
there is no connection between the Proposition
inferred, tho' it is true, and the Proposition
from which it is inferred, tho' that also is true.
The reason why both the Antecedent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
are true, is, because no modification
can produce an Act: And therefore, had the
Proposition run thus, If no modification can
produce an Act, then no modification of matter
can produce Thinking, then the consequence
had been unexcep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ionable. But in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ormer
Proposition, the Inference hath no ground at all
to support it, because the deduction is not from
this, That modifications cannot act, but from
such a sort of modifications, as could not produce
the Act specified, supposing that modifications
could produce Acts; for if a modification could
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57659:22"/>
produce an Act, a modification of matter might
produce Thinking, tho' no modification of
Sound could produce Seeing<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> But <hi>Thinking<g ref="char:punc">โช</g>
               </hi> and
<hi>Seeing,</hi> being both Acts, they must suppose Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and the enquiry not being whether modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
can act, for it is past doubt that modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
cannot act: For not modifications, but
substances so and so modified, or having such
and such Powers, are Agents, and do produce
Acts. The Proposition will come nearer to the
subject we are discoursing of, if it<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> be worded
thus, If no modification of sound can produce the
power of seeing, then no modification of matter
can produce the power of thinking. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I do not know what Notions some Persons
may have of modifications producing powers, or
in what sense they may understand those words,
I will state the present Enquiry as plainly as I
can, and then consider this Proposition or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more particularly. We are very sensible
that it is the pleasure of Almighty God, that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
substances being variously modified, should
have several Powers, by which Powers they are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>itted and enabled to do several sorts of Acts, or
produce various Effects. The Enquiry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is, Whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>er it can be demonstratively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that it is, or is not the pleasure of God, that
matter being in a certain manner modified, should
have a power of thinking, whereby it may be
enabled to think? And to demonstrate that it is
not the pleasure of God, that matter, however
modified, should have a power of thinking su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-added
to it, this Argument is proposed, <hi>viz.</hi>
That if no modification of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ound can produce
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57659:23"/>
the power of seeing, then no modification of
matter can produce the power of thinking. The
sense then of this Argument must be this, If it
is not the pleasure of God, that a power of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
should be super-added to sound, what way
soever it can be modified, then it is not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God, that a power of thinking should
be super-added to matter, whatever way it can
be modified. Now, this is apparently so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding
a Proposition, I cannot think any
Man will insist on it, or pretend, that by modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of sound producing a power of seeing,
can be meant producing that power in it self;
but that, because various modifications of sound
do produce variou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap> sensations in other things,
therefore produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ing the power of seeing, must
be understood of producing it in other subjects.
Let the Argument then, to its utmost advantage,
run thus, If it is not the pleasure of God, that a
power of seeing should be super added upon any
modification of sound, to those subjects in which
the various modifications of sound do ordinarily
produce certain sensations, then it is not the
pleasure of God that a power of thinking should
be super-added to solid substance, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
soever it can be modified. That I may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pass over this Argument, without taking
any notice of it, nor yet bear too hard upon it,
I will only offer these three Considerations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> 1. That supposing the Argument to
have any strength in it, it would labour under
this unhappiness. That it would prove a great
deal more than it should. 2. That such a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may be assigned, why no modification of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57659:23"/>
sound can produce Seeing, or why it is not the
pleasure of God that a power of seeing should
be super-added upon any modification of sound,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the like cannot be assigned, that it is not
the pleasure of God, that a power of thinking
should be super-added to matter upon its being
in a certain manner modified. 3. That we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
argue regularly from the modifications of
sounds, to the modifications of matter. First,
That supposing this Argument to have any
strength in it, it hath too much: It would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
under this unhappiness, That it would
prove a great deal more than it should, and
quite over-turn the whole course and order of
Nature, and the ordinary Providence of God
in the material World. For the Argument can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be restrained and limited to the power of
thinking, but must, and will reach, to all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in matter, and so prove that it is not the
pleasure of God, that any power should be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to matter, upon its being any way mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified;
which, to me, has this sound with it,
That tho' it is the pleasure of God, that matter
may be variously modified, yet it is not the
pleasure of God that it should have any power at
all, <hi>i. e.</hi> Be capable of any Action. Place any
other powers in the room of those which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
the Argument will be every jot as good
as it is, and the Propositions, of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
will be every whit as true as they are with
these that are mentioned. And therefore I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to reflect on the fundamental Error that
presseth the Argument, and on that faulty Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
this way of Arguing imports, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57659:24"/>
to determine what is, or is not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God, without any either Real, or Verbal
Discovery from him, concerning it. Secondly,
Such a Reason may be assigned why it is not the
pleasure of God, that a power of Seeing should
be super-added upon any modification of sound,
to those Subjects, in which the various modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of sounds do usually produce certain Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;
the like to which, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ot be assigned,
Why it is not the pleasure of God that a power
of Thinking should be super-added to matter,
upon its being in a certain manner modified, for
Sound, and the various modifications of it, are
only Ideas in our Minds, and are in the Bodies
we denominate from them<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> only powers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
those Sensations in us, to which we give
the Names by which we call them. <hi>Loud,
Shrill,</hi> &amp;c. In Idea, are but the certain Bulk,
Figure and Motion, of the insensible parts in the
Bodies themselves, which ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>se those Sensations
in us. They are but certain Powers, that are
in Bodies, by reason of the particular Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their primary Quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ies, to operate after
a particular manner on one certain Sense, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
of Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ear, by agitating vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
the Animal Spirits, which are in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
when duly disposed to receive their impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
The same modification of matter may
produce in it a power, which will produce in us
different Sensations, but by operating on diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Organs of Sense, fitted to receive its impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
One and the same modification in the
external Object, may produce different Effects
or Sensations in us, because it operateth on diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57659:24"/>
Organs, adapted in us for different purposes.
The various modifications of sound cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in us seeing, because it is the pleasure of
God, that the Ideas those Bodies communicate
to us, which we call in general various modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of sound, should be conveighed to us not
by the <hi>Eye,</hi> but only by the <hi>Ear,</hi> from whence
they are distinguished from those Ideas we are
to receive by our Eyes. We have in this matter
a plain real discovery of the pleasure of God, but
we have not the like in the other case, about
which the Argument I am speaking of is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
But the true reason why no modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sound can produce a power of Seeing, is
because neither sound, nor any modification of
it, can produce any power at all: They can no
more produce a Power of Hearing, than they
can a Power of Seeing. Let the Organ of
Hearing be disordered, and have no Animal
Spirits in it, that can be agitated by external
Objects, no sounds, nor modifications of sound,
can produce a Power of Hearing in it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That we cannot argue regularly from the
modifications of sound, or of any sensible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to the modifications of matter; and the
reason of this is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> Because they do
differ <hi>Toto Coelo.</hi> The modifications of sounds,
are only Ideas in our minds; the modifications
of matter, are the real, but unknown Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of things existing in Nature. If there can
be any room to argue concerning Thinking,
from the modifications of Sound, it cannot be
concerning the Power of Thinking, but only
about the modifications of Thought. Thus, if
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57659:25"/>
any Man should offer any thing concerning the
modifications of Thought, so incoherent as this
is, <hi>viz.</hi> That the modifications of sound can
produce Seeing, this obvious inconsistency may
be made use of regularly enough, to convince
him, and others, of the Absurdity and Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the other Assertion. But to say that a
power of Thinking cannot be super-added to the
substance of matter in any case, because the
Ideas we receive only by one sense, cannot be
got by another sense, hath no connection at all,
and is so far from being a demonstration, it is
not good sense. In short, the whole of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
amounts to no more than this, If secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
qualities cannot produce Powers (which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>
is certain they cannot) then God cannot, by the
modification of its primary qualities, give Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to matter; whereas all the Powers of matter,
so far as we can observe, depend on them, as
their Source, Spring, and Original, by the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Ordination of God, as appears by the
whole Series and Order of Nature and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
These words, <hi>We can have no more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
how any modification of matter can produce
Thinking, than we can, how any modification of
Sound should produce Seeing,</hi> must be understood
concerning the Reality of a Consequent or
Effect, following upon a System of matter being
fitly disposed or modified, either to receive a
Power which it had not before, or to occasion
an Act in a Subject endowed with a certain
Power to Act in a certain manner upon certain
occasions. Now, I conceive, it is past all
doubt, that various modifications of matter are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57659:25"/>
necessary to occasion, if not produce, certain
different Acts in Subjects which are endued with
Powers to exert those different Acts, on different
Occasions, tho' we may not know how those
different modifications of matters do occasion
or produce those different Acts. And tho' no
modifications of matter can produce Thinking
in the System of Matter, which is the Subject of
those modifications, yet a certain modification
of matter, may be requisite and necessary to the
preparing and making a System of Matter meet
to receive a Power of Thinking. And I think
it equally easie to conceive, how any modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sound should produce Seeing in the Bell,
or Harp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that makes the sound, as how it
should produce Hearing in it.</p>

pleasure of God, that a Power of Thinking

of Matter are the same as to that point. And it
is acknowledged very probable, that it is not the

saying, that all modifications are the same as to
that point, is not proving it; and it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable

Matter being variously modified hath different
Powers, the several Objects we converse with do
clearly demonstrate. And we shall hardly be
able to demonstrate, that all modifications of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are the same, as to the power of Thinking,
till we attain to know what are all the Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Powers that Matter is capable of,
unless we can give such true Accounts of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Matter, and the nature of Thought, as
will domonstrate that these two are incompatible;
which we cannot do, without understanding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
in what the nature of each doth consist.
All modifications of Matter are no more the
same, as to Matter having a Power of Thinking
super-added to it, than they are the same as to
Matter having an Immaterial Thinking Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
joyned to it. And I believe all modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Matter are not thought by this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Author, to be the same as to this point;
for if they be, <hi>a Thinking Rock, or a Thinking
Post,</hi> would be every whit as intelligible as a
Thinking Man.</p>
            <p>ยง XXI. <hi rend="margQuotes">And Matter may as well be made
no Matter, by modifying, as be made to
Think by it. Answ.</hi> This is Affirming, but
not Demonstrating. That Matter should be
made no Matter by modifying it, is altogether
unintelligible, and impossible; for let it be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify'd
ever so many ways, it will still be Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It may be proved Demonstratively, that
Matter cannot be made no Matter, by modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
it; and if demonstrative proof were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that Matter, however modify'd, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have a Power of Thinking, the Dispute
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57659:26"/>
would be at an end. But that Matter, under a
certain modification, should think, when a
Power of Thinking is super-added to it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
enough, and as intelligible, as that it
should exert any other Act, when it hath a
Power super-added to it, to exert that Act.
It is not said that Matter is made to think by
any modifications, that are proper to it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
barely as Matter, tho' by some of these
modifications of the Substance, which we know
not, it may, for ought we know, be disposed
and made fit to have a Power of Thinking super-added
to it, by which it shall be enabled to
think. This Power of Thinking is not proper
or peculiar to material Substance; nor can we
prove demonstratively that it is so to Immaterial
Substance; but for any thing we know to the
contrary, it may be super-added both to the
one and to the other. For if the same Substance
may be so modified as to be sometimes material,
and sometimes immaterial, (as is granted in this
very Dispute) it is not impossible to suppose it
may have the Power of Thinking, when it is
material, as when it is immaterial: For as the
Power of Thinking, when super-added to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material

Substance, it doth not make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Our Author is here got as far
from his point as he was before, when upon
the Modifications of Sound; for here he is gone
from the Modifications of Matter, to the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of Substances. That I may do this
Paragraph, and the Point discoursed of, what
Right I can in a few words, I will, 1. Offer one
Consideration concerning the Subject of our
Discourse. 2. Shew what I apprehend is the
great mistake of those who write against what
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath said concerning it. 3. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of some mistakes in this Paragraph. First, I
will propose one Consideration concerning the
Subject of our Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Power
of Thinking being a Power super-added to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and all Substance being either Material
or Immaterial, the Substance to which this
Power of Thinking is super-added must be of
one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap> those sorts. It is not made either the
one or the other, by having that Power super-added
to it; tho' being super-added, it makes
the Substance, to which it is super-added, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Substance. As the Power of producing
in any Sensitive Animal the Idea of Blueness or
Acidity, or any other distinct Power being
super-added to any solid Substance, doth not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57659:27"/>
make that Substance Matter, but only makes it
to be a Substance to which such a Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will belong, as doth arise from its having
such a Power super-added to it, when the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is considered precisely as having that
Power. The precise Denomination to be added
to Substance, upon its having any Power super-added
to it, is to be taken from the Power which
is super-added to it, without considering what
other Power that Substance hath; from which it
will be denominated, when considerd as having
that Power. If it be said, that to be Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and to Think, be the same, that is not true,
for the Negation of one Modification in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>viz.</hi> Solidity, is not the Position of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Modification in Substance, <hi>viz</hi> Thought.
Immaterial Substance is alike capable of having
Solidity, or Thought, or both those Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or any other Modifications super-added to
it, which it shall please God to super-add to it.
Perhaps, it will be said, that the same Substance
has indeed a Power, or is capable of Thought,
or of Solidity, whenever God pleases to bestow
either of them on it, but that God cannot give
Solidity, and Thought, to any Substance both
together. Now, this is the very Question in
Debate, and remains to be demonstrated. If it
be said that Actual Thinking is to Immaterial
Substance as Actual Solidity is to Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
inseparable from it, these two things are
to be demonstrated, 1. That God has crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any Substances that must be always in Action,
or else cease to be Substances, <hi>i. e.</hi> Substances of
such a nature, from which God cannot take
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57659:28"/>
away the Action they have, without destroying
the Substance it self; or that God hath created
a Substance that must always Think, for Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is an Action. 2. That if it be so, how it
will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ollow from thence, that because God has
made some Substances not Solid which Think
always, therefore he cannot give to Substances,
that have the Modification of Solidity, a Power
to Think sometimes. Solidity, and Thinking,
are evidently distinct Ideas, and we not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what Modifications may be super-added to
our Idea of Substance without Solidity, cannot
prove that every Immaterial Substance has the
Modification of Thinking super-added to it;
and therefore we cannot prove that it has the
same proportion to Immaterial Substance, that
Solidity has to Material. If it be said, But we
know that some Immaterial Substances have the
Power of Thinking, I answer, true. But can
we thence demonstratively in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>er, that the Power
of Thinking cannot be super-added to any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substances without making them Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial?
We know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y is super-added to
some Material Systems, can we thence demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
infer, that Mobility cannot be super-added
to Immaterial Substances, without making
them Material?</p>
            <p>ยง XXIII. Secondly, I will mention what I
apprehend is the Grand mistake of those who
argue against what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Point. Their Discourses seem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that they think that there are but two
sorts of Modification which can be super-added
to our General Idea of Substance, <hi>viz.</hi> Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57659:28"/>
and Thinking. Hence I conceive it is, that
they make <hi>Immaterial,</hi> and <hi>the Power of Thinking,</hi>
to stand for the same Idea; and that they are so
positive, that should a Power of Thinking be
super-added to Matter, Matter would be made
no Matter; and that some, with an express re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of the consideration of modified Matter,
do ask, Can Matter Think? Which Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>โขโขโข</desc>
               </gap>on
so put, seems to me, to be in other words, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>is,
is Solidity, Thinking? If Matter can Think,
it is not by virtue of Solidity, but by vir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>โขโข</desc>
               </gap>e of
such a Power super-added to the Substance, under
a certain Modification, that it may Think, tho'
it be Solid. If the Power of Thinking can be
super-added to Matter, it is not the Power or
Modification which can Think, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>o
which the Modification or Power is super-added,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Substance which has the Modification
of Solidity. To ask therefore, whether Matter
can Think, and at the same time expresly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all consideration of the Power of Thinking,
is to ask whether Substance can Think by the
sole virtue of Solidity? Or whether the Power
of Thinking is included in our Idea of Solidity?
Which is much what, as to ask whether Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
can produce that Act by virtue of one
Power, which it cannot produce but by virtue
of another. What occasion can there be to ask
such a question, unless it proceed from an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that Substance, having the Modification
of Solidity, cannot have any other Power super-added
to it, but what must depend upon its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity?
For if it can, and amongst others this of
Thinking, then tho' solid Substance cannot think
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57659:29"/>
meerly as it is Solid, yet having the Power of
Thinking super-add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>d to it, it may think. How
many sorts of mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>fications can be super-added
to our Idea of Substance, surpasse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap> our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
but any modification super-added to it,
will entitle it to a denomination answerable to
that modification; and that denomination, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with another Name, or with words sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
a denial of it, added to substance, will
as perfectly divide substance<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> as the Terms Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
and Immaterial do. Upon another modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
being super-added to either of those kinds
of substances, another denomination will belong
to it, when conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ed meerly with relation to
that modification. Should the modification of
Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>ion be alone super-added to our Idea of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
it would make it Substance with motion.
And Mobile and Immobile Substance, would as
perfectly divide Substance, as solid and unsolid
Substance, <hi>i. e.</hi> Material and Immaterial do.
This Mobile Substance could not certainly be
concluded by us to have ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>her the modification
of Solidity, or of Thinking<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> by reason of its
Mobility. Should Mobility be super-added to
a substance, which hath the modification of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
it would be a substance with Solidity and
Mobility. Should the modification of Thinking
be super-added to a Substance which hath those
other mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>fications, it would be a substance with
Solidity, Mobility, and the Power of Thinking.
That which would move, and think, would be
Matter, or solid Substance; the super-adding of
the modification of Thinking, would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the other modifications; that which would
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57659:29"/>
think would be Matter, as well as that which
would move: For the modification could not
think, but that which had the modification of
Solidity, <hi>viz.</hi> The Substance. We are sensible
that it is the pleasure of God, that various Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
should be super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>added to solid Substance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its being variously disposed or modify'd. How
many the Powers be, which it is the pleasure of
God shall be super-added to our Idea of Matter,
upon its being va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>iously disposed, we cannot tell.
Hereupon this Question is put, whether it is the
pleasure of God, that the modification or power
of Thinking shall be super-added to some Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
of Matter fitly disposed? Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> saith,
The Question is too abstruse and difficult for us
to resolve demonstratively. In opposition to
this, or to prove the contrary, it is ask'd whether
Matter, without any regard to modifications, can
think? Now can this import any thing else, than
either that the super-adding of modifications, to
our Idea of Matter, signifies not any thing to
Matter's producing certain Acts, or that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications
can be super-added to our Idea of
Matter? If modifications can be super-added,
neither this Question, nor the Answer that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to it, can contribute any thing to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that the modification of Thinking cannot
be superadded to our Idea of Matter.</p>
            <p>ยง XXIV. Thirdly, I will mention some of the
mistakes which may be observed in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
before set down. First, It supposes several
things, every one of which is wrong, as 1. The
words referring equally to both the parts of the
sentence which goes immediately before them,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57659:30"/>
and taking them to be the same in sense, tho'
different in words, suppose Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> to say, in
effect, that matter may, by modifying, be made
no matter; for which there is not any
ground, but a mistaken Imagination. 2. It sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
that it hath been demonstratively proved,
that the modification of thinking cannot be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
to a solid substance. 3. That it is as
Intelligible, that Immateriality may be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to our Idea of Matter, as that that modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which makes substance to be matter,
may be super-added to our Idea of substance.
4. That Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> concludes, that the modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Thinking may be super-added to matter,
whereas he saith it cannot be demonstratively
concluded. 5. That Immaterial, in the strictest
sense of that Term, as contradistinguished from
matter, (for so the word is to be understood in
the present Dispute) and the Power of Thinking,
stand for the same Idea. 6. That we can know
all the modifications or powers Matter is capable
of; for without that, we cannot know what
surpasses all the Powers and Capacities of Matter,
except what is a contradiction to our Idea of
Matter, which a Power of Thinking cannot
be proved to be, by bare saying, That Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and a Power of Thinking, are the same.
In short, the point is thus: We have full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
that there is a Power of Thinking in some
Systems of Matter. Hereupon a Question ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Whether this modification of Thinking be
the modification of the same substance that has
the modification of Solidity, or the modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another Substance, which not being so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57659:30"/>
is united to the material substance? Some
answer it is a modification of the substance of
that matter; others answer it is a modification
of an Immaterial substance, joyned to those Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
of Matter. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> saith the Question
cannot be demonstratively determined, but
that the highest degree of probability is on their
side, who say it is a modification of an immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
substance. This displeases: Therefore to
demonstrate that a Power of Thinking cannot
be super-added to our Idea of Matter, or be a
modification of Matter, we are told that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material,
and a Power of Thinking, are the same
Idea; and that a Power of Thinking cannot be
super-added to our Idea of matter, but matter
must be made Immaterial, or no matter. Now,
it is most evident, that <hi>Immaterial,</hi> and <hi>a Power
of Thinking,</hi> are as distinct Ideas, as <hi>Material</hi> and
<hi>Immaterial</hi> be. And that should Matter be made
no Matter, or be changed into Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Substance would only lose that modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which made it matter, and that it could
not think till the modification or power of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
should be superadded to it. Secondly, The
Instance proposed in this Paragraph is not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stated: If we would propose a Case concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Immaterial Substances, that should be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to that which hath been under our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
we should first fix on some positive modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which is as essential to all Substances
which have not the modification of Solidity, as
Solidity is to all those which are material. To
say, the modification of Thinking is so, is <hi>but
saying.</hi> How can we know that every substance
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57659:31"/>
that is not solid, hath the power of thinking su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap>added
to it? Having fixed on this modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we should fix on another modification,
that the Question being proposed, Whether it is
a modification of immaterial substance, or no?
More probable Arguments might be produced
on the one side than on the other, but no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
proof could be brought either way.
If in this case, some should be positive that it
is a modification of Immaterial Substance, and
the highest probability was on their side, others
should be as peremptory on the other side; and
at last, a Person of greater Consideration and
Temper, should s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y the point does not admit of
any demonstrative proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>โข</desc>
               </gap> but probability carries
it for them, who say, it is a modification of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
substance, and that therefore we must
leave the point (till demonstrative proof can be
produced one way or other) as God hath laid
it before us, and follow, and be contented with
probability, whilst God is not pleased to afford
us any greater Light concerning it; what damage
would any way redound from this persons say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus? Would that Wise, Prudent, and Good
Man, and Lover of Truth, deserve to be evilly
reflected on, because he would check Peoples
vain Curiosity, convince the Materialists that
they fight against the highest degrees of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and put others in mind that they should
not give the Adversaries to a good Cause, the
Advantages they do, by presuming to know
more of the point, than it is the pleasure of God
they should know of it in this imperfect Estate?
I speak not this with respect to the Reverend
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57659:31"/>
Mr. <hi>Ienkin,</hi> (who concludes his Discourse with
these words, <hi>But tho' I have, upon this occasion,
mentioned this Gentleman here, yet it would be a
great injury done him, to rank him with the Authors
of the Oracles of Reason</hi>) but some other Writers,
who have on this occasion Indulged a <hi>Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which Moral Heathens would be ashamed
of. Thirdly, There is not any thing in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph,
nor in all that this Learned Author hath
said, with relation to what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
that can any more prove that the modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Thinking cannot be super-added to
our Idea of Matter, than it can that other modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
cannot be super-added to it. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Let a Person, who hath a mind to affirm
that the modification, or power of active mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or motivity, cannot be super-added to our
Idea of Matter, but that it is a modification pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Immaterial Substance, place a power
of moving in this, and the foregoing Sentences,
in the room of a power of Thinking, and those
very words will as fully demonstrate his point,
as they do the other.</p>
            <p>ยง XXV. That which may be regularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the passage in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Essay of
Humane Understanding</hi> before quoted, and on
which so many have thought fit to reflect, is this,
That People should not pretend a demonstrative
certainty concerning Things, which cannot be
demonstratively proved; which is a very great
Truth, and which would be of extraordinary
good use, would People strictly and rigidly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
themselves by it. The greatest Service that
can be done to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Godliness,</hi> is to preserve
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57659:32"/>
our <hi>Reason</hi> within its proper Bounds, and to let
<hi>Faith</hi> have its just scope. I very much question,
whether any thing can give bad Men greater
advantage in their endeavouring to promote
<hi>Scepticism,</hi> and in their opposing and talking
against <hi>the Articles of the Christian Faith,</hi> than
Christians, and especially Divines, or Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
detracting any way from <hi>the Credibility of
Divine Testimony,</hi> and making an Ostentation of
knowing Things which God hath placed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
out of Humane reach; And treating others
scurrilously, who are more modest, and more
inquisitive than themselves, because they will
not acknowledge that the Truth of certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
can be demonstrated, meerly because
they say, They can, tho' they will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with, to be at the pains to demonstrate
their Truth.</p>
