            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer, in juſt vindication of ſome Religious and Worthy Gentlemen of <hi>Pembrokeſhire.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N purſuance of the Relation, as it lies, this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe muſt paſſe through theſe two Stages, <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Impartiall Dealing,</hi> (both which are baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the Relator in every line) ſo that if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pleaſe to caſt his eye upon the Relation firſt, and then peruſe this Vindication, he will finde every thing in charge either convinced of untruth, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, or both. It was long after the beginning of theſe unhappy differences betweene King and Parliament, that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hertford</hi> came to <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> the Battell of <hi>Edghill</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then fought in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1642. at which time the Gentry were by him firſt ſummoned to appeare; nor were the Summons otherwiſe then by particular Letters directed, only to ſome few Gentlemen of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereby it is evident, no generall appearance was intended. The Marqueſſe declared, his Majeſty had received Supplies of Men, Armes, and Money, out of all other Shires of <hi>Wales,</hi> except that County, and therefore required the like Complyance. To which anſwer was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Sheriffe (a diſcreet man, now a Colonell in the Army,) and thoſe few Gentlemen preſent, That the Iriſh Rebels did daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their Coaſt, and therefore neither men nor Armes could be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and to the Money they pleaded loſſes by Sea, and non ability. With which Anſwer, the Marqueſſe not ſatisfied, commands the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe to ſummon the Country to <hi>Haverford,</hi> where Contribution being motioned by the Sheriffe, in purſuance of his Lordſhips Commands, nothing was concluded, all Parties declined, and the Marqueſſe went for <hi>England.</hi> That negotiation thus finiſhed, a calme continued ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall months after; nor was there any ſuch labouring or intreaties for gayning parties to either ſide, as the Relator pretends, nor was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100805:4"/>
there any party at all, or diviſion for a long time after; nor any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Array</hi> publiſhed or executed; nor Maſter <hi>Elliot</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or Maſter <hi>Lort,</hi> Treaſurer of that Committee, there being then no Committee in that County. Neither was there any ſuch thing executed by them, or any ſuch Warrants thundred forth, as is injuriouſly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the ſaid particulars being no other then a fardle of untruths. And here doth the Relator (to ſave his credit) ſlip over a great <hi>hiatus</hi> and intervall of time (almoſt a whole yeare) without mentioning one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of a Treaty, Agreement, and Subſcription to an Aſſociation with <hi>Carmarthen</hi> and <hi>Cardigan</hi> Shires; wherein to prevent the Lord <hi>Herberts</hi> Command over thoſe Counties, (who was a notorious Papiſt, and had Commiſſion from the king to be Lord Lieutenant of <hi>South Wales)</hi> the Earle of Carbery was made Commander in Chiefe by the conſent and Subſcription of all the Juſtices of Peace, and Gentry of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, except only two or three Officers of the Souldiery, who kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtrong Towne and Caſtle of Pembroke. And now ſee how the Deſigne was laid and carried; ſome of theſe Gentlemen who had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Aſſociation, betooke themſelves into <hi>Pembroke</hi> about May<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1643. and (not intending at firſt to be ſeene in the head of any Party themſelves) they ſet up one <hi>Poyer,</hi> a man of meane birth and education, brought up by Maſter <hi>John Mevrick,</hi> Cuſtomer of <hi>Milford,</hi> firſt a boy in his Kitchin, then Groome of his Stable, after in the Trade of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, one of ſuch impudent rudeneſſe, that few Gentlemen (though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirons to have ſerved the Parliament, and have made their abode in that Town) could indure his inſolency. Now was <hi>Poyer</hi> made forthwith Deputy-Mayor of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> (though the Mayor himſelfe reſided in Towne) he commands all, firſt violates the Peace, goes with ſome Horſe to <hi>Tinby,</hi> a Towne then well affected, and (pretending a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſit) ſeizes upon the Ordnance, drives the Towneſmen into the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then departs jeering at their diſtracted feares, without any Guard left for preſerving the Towne for the Parliament. Hence the ſource and fountaine of that Counties calamity, and of <hi>Poyers</hi> riſing. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>Tinby</hi> (thus affrighted) call a Councell, where is reſolved, that two of them, <hi>(viz.) Thomas Wyat</hi> Mayor, and <hi>Evan Longe</hi> Alderman, ſhould ride to the Earle of <hi>Carbery,</hi> who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did the day following, and procured him to ſend down two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Foot, which are received, and <hi>Tinby</hi> Garriſoned for the King. All this was ſo ſuddenly done, in the midſt of Harveſt, 1643. that the whole County ſtood amazed in great perplexity; the occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceeded meerly by that ill carriage of the Deputy Mayor of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100805:4"/>
yet by the Relation injuriouſly caſt upon Maſter <hi>Lort</hi> and Maſter <hi>Elliot,</hi> who were then many miles abſent, and in no wiſe privy to any part of the deſigne. After this, not many daies paſſed before the Earle of <hi>Carbery</hi> and Judge <hi>Jenkins</hi> came with Supplies of Horſe and Foot to <hi>Tinby,</hi> the Judge being ſent (as was conceived by many that knew the Earles carriage and inclination) of purpoſe to obſerve the others acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and demeanor: The Judge frames the Warrants, and the Earle ſubſcribes the Summons, firſt to the Gentry, after to the reſt of the County. Some of the Gentlemen (that had formerly ſubſcribed the Aſſociation) appeare either there or at <hi>Haverford;</hi> ſome few of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers keepe in <hi>Pembroke,</hi> yet with correſpondence, relation of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and preſents to the Earle at <hi>Tinby.</hi> In <hi>October</hi> following, <hi>Poyer</hi> (rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his deputation to be Mayor Paramount) ſubſcribes an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereto he affixes the Towne Seal, <hi>in haec verba. (viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>WE the Mayor, Bayliffs, Burgeſſes and Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> whoſe names are ſubſcribed, do ſincerely, on the faith of loyall Subjects, declare, That we will, with our lives and fortunes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Majeſty, his royall perſon, Crowne and Dignity; and for the Towne and Caſtle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> we do further declare on the like faith, That we ſhall to the utmoſt of our endeavour, preſerve and defend the ſame, againſt all ſuch as ſhall force a Garriſon on the ſaid Towne and Caſtle, and all other Forces under the name of King and Parliament, or any other. And we do further declare, That we will keep the Town and Caſtle for his Majeſty, and no other; And we doe heartily deſire the wonted Trade and Commerce with the County and Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and our neighbouring Counties and Townes, as alſo a free Trade and Commerce by Sea and Land. For aſſurance whereof we have fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Which Inſtrument was by him ſent to the ſaid Earle at <hi>Tinby,</hi> to be preſented his Majeſty, which was done accordingly. Thus was the ſtate and condition of that County in <hi>October,</hi> 1643. before the <hi>Oxford</hi> journey, which is not mentioned in the Relation, till after a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſertion of ſome of the Mayors vaine glorious acts and atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; by which method, as well as by the ſtile of the Relation, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the diſcourſe, and by the diſperſing the Books with his owne hand to his acquaintance in <hi>London,</hi> the reader may perceive, the late Mayor of <hi>Pembroke</hi> doth appeare himſelfe to be the notorious Relator.</p>
            <p>To proceed, therefore to unveile the naked truth, and wipe off the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100805:5"/>
               <hi>fucus</hi> he hath put upon his ſeeming glorious actions. Whatſoever the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator ſaith to the contrary, <hi>Pembroke</hi> had both Walls and Gates repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long before, <hi>Tinby, Haverford Weſt,</hi> and <hi>Carew,</hi> were ſecured; nor were thoſe places ſecured, but by the ſaid Earles and Judge <hi>Jenkins</hi> meanes, and by their Forces, after the taking of <hi>Tinby.</hi> Nor were the ſaid Walls or Gates repaired at the charges of the ſaid late Mayor, the mentioned Ship being not his, but properly belonging to one <hi>Jenkins</hi> of <hi>Cowbridge,</hi> and the decayed Walls were repaired by the Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, as every part fronted their Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Swanley,</hi> at his firſt comming, paid for what Victuall he had of the Country, and was forced to depart for want of more. The Ship ſo much diſcourſt of in the Relation, for the rare manner of ſurpriſall, was indeed no prize at all, but the Veſſell afterwards reſtored (by Order) to the owners, and the valiant ſurprize was in truth by drinking the Captaine drunke, which the Relation attributes to Gods bleſſing and the Mayors vertue. Then followes the ſecond adventure upon another ſmall Ship without Guns, related to be taken by Vollyes of two ſmall Peeces of Ordnance and Musketeers in two Boats, which indeed was a remarkable piece of gallant ſervice: This Veſſell (now furniſhed with men and Arms, having none before) takes another, laden with Salt; and all this his owne every groat, no part accounted for to the State, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ship or Goods, yet hath he the face now to petition the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for no leſſe then foure thouſand pound disburſments, which is deſired may appear in particulars, that the State be not cozened; as alſo what Receipts in ballance. But to proceed, The Relation ſets forth theſe gallant actions, done before the going of Sir <hi>Richard Philips,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Lort,</hi> Maſter <hi>Elliot,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Bowen,</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> which is as true, as that they had preſented the King with great ſummes of money, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Commander in chiefe, &amp;c. then which never was printed Story of leſſe truth; for theſe Gentlemen, with Sir <hi>Hugh Owen,</hi> Burgeſſe of the Parliament for <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Lewis Barlow,</hi> (whom the Relator partially mentions not) were compelled much againſt their frequent and earneſt deſires, with threats of preſent impriſonment, and loſſe of their Eſtates (then in the Enemies power) to go with the Earle in nature of diſaffected perſons to his Majeſty, as appeared by the Kings confinement of them at firſt ſight, and their great expence and long continuance at <hi>Oxford,</hi> before they could be diſcharged, having not carried with them ſo much money as did defray their eating charges. Where, during their abode, they were all frequently reviled openly, called Traytors and Roundheads, and otherwiſe abuſed; and yet they would not pay any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100805:5"/>
Fines, nor take pardons as ſome others of that County did, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned them to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>And touching a Commander in chief, the Aſſociation long before Subſcribed, had determined that, and the Earl of <hi>Carbery</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned accordingly, and did execute the place ſome Months before the <hi>Oxford</hi> journey; but the ſending of Shipping with Ordnance and Ammunition from <hi>Bristoll</hi> to ſecure the Harbour of <hi>Milford,</hi> was done by Sir <hi>John Pennington,</hi> one whom they never knew, nor had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, nor action in, that deſigne, as the Relator falſly and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſuggeſteth. And now the Relator mentions Mr. <hi>Lorts</hi> Houſe garriſoned, which in truth was no other then by his own Servants, not a Souldier of the Kings party there; and this defence made for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Goods, occaſioned by the Mayor of <hi>Pembrooks</hi> threats of plundering and actuall taking away of his Cattell.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Bowens</hi> Houſe was not garriſon'd by him, but by the Earl of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> yet charged upon Mr <hi>Bowen</hi> in the relation: which is as true as that five hundred pound was proffered for the Mayor of <hi>Pembrooks</hi> head: <hi>Credat Judaeus Apella:</hi> for thoſe that knew the Mayor can aſſure the Reader, the Enemy might have had him theirs ſoul and body bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cheap. Now comes Captain <hi>Swanley</hi> into the relation and Harbour the ſecond time, at whoſe arrivall (and not before) the Relator begins to mention Major Generall <hi>Laugharns</hi> firſt motion in the Parliaments ſervice, and his Commiſſion of Collonel from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who joyning with the Relator (mark the arrogance) and ſome few Seamen, ſtormed the Houſes of <hi>Stackepool</hi> and <hi>Trelloyne.</hi> Thus the Relation. But the truth is, Admirall <hi>Swanleys</hi> arrivall (whom the Relator ſlightly mentions here, and diſgracefully elſewhere) was the prime inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Succeſſes in thoſe parts. And his Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under the Command of Captain <hi>Whitty</hi> had the mannagery of the active part of the Service in taking of the two mentioned Houſes, and <hi>Pill,</hi> and <hi>Tinby.</hi> Nor was there any atchievement in thoſe times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Seamen had not at leaſt their equall ſhare of Honour: witneſſe the Relations in Print. As for the Author of this new Relation, he was not at the taking either of the Houſes, or the <hi>Pill</hi> Fort, as is untruly by him alledged, but was then ſafe within the walls of <hi>Pembrook</hi> Town and Caſtle: indeed at <hi>Tinby</hi> Siege he at laſt appeared, where when he ſaw the Enemy give fire, he was obſerved to duck his head. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation proceeds to <hi>Trelloyne</hi> Houſe, wh<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch was taken not by Storme, as is related, but by Compoſition; nor was the Houſe of Mr <hi>Lort</hi> Stormed; but taken by a wyle, and plundered while Mr <hi>Lort</hi> was in <hi>Tinby</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100805:6"/>
and confined within that Town by the then Governor thereof; becauſe he would not declare himſelf for the King againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and admit a Garriſon of the Kings Souldiers into his Houſe of <hi>Stackepool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after the advance to <hi>Carmarthenſheire, Laugharn</hi> Caſtle taken by the Mayor of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> is related as a ſpeciall note of his Service done in abſence of the Generall (a moſt valiant piece) there being then neither Enemy nor reſiſtance. And now from <hi>Laugharn</hi> at the March to <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> he wonders where the <hi>Pembrookſheire</hi> Gentlemen are, when ſurely he cannot, without malicious blindneſſe, but ſee all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that were able to march. And Sir <hi>Richard Phillips</hi> with his two ſons: and Mr <hi>Elliot</hi> in the head of a Reſerve of Horſe at the conflict, before the Town was gained: onely Mr <hi>Lort</hi> being extreamly plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Horſe, and Arms, &amp;c. was before the advance bound for <hi>London,</hi> with Admirall <hi>Swanley,</hi> who was then ſent for home by the State. Here the Relator maliciouſly upbraids Captain <hi>Swanley</hi> for feaſting and entertaining Mr. <hi>Lort</hi> a Shipboard after his voluntarie coming in, according to the Declaration of both Kingdoms, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Nationall Covenant, who ſince that time hath ſerved the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> with all faithfulneſſe and integrity, and in conformity to their Ordinances and Commands: Whereas the Mayor of <hi>Pembrook</hi> in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember laſt did feaſt the Cavaliers upon a Faſt-day, and drink himſelf and them drunk in a beaſtly manner, but muſt be paſt by in filence. He proceeds to relate the coming down of <hi>Gerrard,</hi> where he inſerts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well in the defenſive as the active part of that War, whereas in truth he ſeldom ſtirred out of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> (where the Enemy came not all that Summer) nor did ever charge any Enemy in his own perſon. He talks of buying Arms at unreaſonable rates out of the Ships for the men he entertained, which Arms he afterwards compelled the poor Countrey Neighbours to pay for, at more unreaſonable rates then he bought them. A little after he fals upon Captain <hi>Swanley</hi> again, and Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> enviouſly jeering at their Gold-chains, falſly and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly terming himſelf the Actor, them but Aſſiſtants to the ſervice of thoſe parts. All which, how varying from truth, let the reducing of <hi>Pill-Fort,</hi> and <hi>Tinby</hi> demonſtrate, with the Action wherein Captain <hi>Smith</hi> was ſlain.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page with the like impudence, he charges Mr <hi>Elliot,</hi> Mr <hi>Lort,</hi> and Mr <hi>Bowen,</hi> with the chiefeſt delinquency in that County. And firſt ſaies they were ſworn to the Kings party; whereas in truth they never took any Oath at all but the Nationall Covenant, and as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100805:6"/>
Committees of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſince theſe Wars began. Secondly, that they were the cauſers of all the bloodſhed of thoſe parts; which is a thing ſo notoriouſly falſe, that an invention purely hatcht in Hell cannot adde to the forgery; nor can any inſtance be given, wherein any of them were at any time the cauſe of ſhedding blood. The ſucceeding Narration is hammered in the ſame forge; he tels the Reader that (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Captain <hi>Swanleys</hi> laſt arrivall) the new Committee queſtions him at <hi>Haverford,</hi> by what Authority he raiſed the Forces in <hi>Pembrook:</hi> Whereas this Queſtion was never raiſed by the new Committee at <hi>Haverford</hi> or elſewhere; but by the old Committee at <hi>Pembrook</hi> (long before Captain <hi>Swanleys</hi> laſt return) upon the motion and deſire of the Generall there in perſon. To which the Mayor replyed, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee had no power to examine him, or to ſit in that Town; and though the Ordinance of <hi>Parliament</hi> was then read, and ſhewed unto him, he would not obey. Whereby the Committee were compelled to depart, and to keep their reſidence at <hi>Haverford,</hi> within three miles of <hi>Gerrards</hi> head-quarter. Whereupon the Major Generall collecting the Relators ayme to be independent to his Commiſſion, makes Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Jones</hi> Captain of the Troop which formerly went under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators Command.</p>
            <p>And now he ſets forth in his Relation that the troops of Horſe and Dragoons, with the Arms, were his own proper Goods; whereas the contrary is a known truth, that both Horſes and Arms were taken up by him out of that County without any conſideration given (to this day) by him or any other. And for the payment of theſe men, their proportion did many times exceed the other Souldiers pay, even to the hazard of mutiny. As for the Committees carriage in that County, it hath been without ſelf-ends, their attendance in the Service being hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto wholly upon their own private purſe, and not upon the publick Charge. They have not been backward in laying ſummes upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves particularly for the publick uſe, beſides the payments of their proportion reſpectively in every Generall rate with the Countrey. Nor hath any Committee in <hi>England</hi> more willingly engaged their eſtates for the maintenance of this Cauſe; as appears by ſeverall great ſums borrowed by them of ſeverall perſons in <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, for the ſervice of the State. For which alreadie ſome of them have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned here, and others (if not prevented by the State) like to ſuffer. What Committee of other Counties have willingly given ſo much free quarter in their own Houſes as they have done to the Souldier in that County? This and much more will be made appear, to the ſhame of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100805:7"/>
the falſe and ſcandalous aſperſions of the impudent Relator.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſecond advance to <hi>Laugharn</hi> it is alſo moſt untrue, that the proviſions ſent from <hi>Pembrook</hi> to the Army were any other then the Countrey Store. The Ammunition likewiſe related to be purchaſed by the Mayors purſe, was of Captain <hi>Swanleys</hi> Ship proviſion, and the States goods; whereof the Relator hath yet great quantities left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent, and none hitherto accounted for; and though he hath been by Warrant ſent for to that end by the Committee of Accounts, yet hath he contemptuouſly diſobeyed, run out of Town, and made no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>In the next place, one falſhood again appears in the neck of another: Firſt, he ſaies <hi>Laugharn</hi> Caſtle was taken by Storme: how was it then, that the Governour and Souldiers departed upon quarter? Secondly, the Relator ſaies he marched to <hi>Cardigan</hi> with the Army, and there took both Town and Caſtle by Storme; How came it then to paſſe that he did not come within twenty miles of the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Cardigan</hi> from the firſt to the laſt of that Seige? but perfideouſly attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to draw the Souldiers home to <hi>Pembrook</hi> from the Major Generals Army, becauſe he was not permitted by the Souldier to carry away the plunder he had ingroſſed at <hi>Laugharn.</hi> As touching the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees ſending to the Relator to deliver up <hi>Carew</hi> Caſtle to Sir <hi>Richard Phillips,</hi> it is anſwered, they did it upon good grounds, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Major Generall; but that Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had formerly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up to the Enemy is moſt abuſively falſe.</p>
            <p>In the next Section he acquaints you, that he had exhauſted his own Stock by clothing, paying, and maintaining his men. His own ſtock before theſe Wars could not be exhauſted, being no viſible thing, either in Land or Goods; and the truth is, the clothes his men had, were received by him of the Committee, and the money which he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them (if any) was out of Rents belonging to the State collected by him, and refuſed to be accounted for; which was the cauſe that (by generall Vote of the Committee) he was ſtayed by Captain <hi>Swanley:</hi> yet to this day hath he obſtinately refuſed to account. Concerning the ſtopping of his man and Letters to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> there was no ſuch ſtop or directions from the Committee, but both man and Letters did paſſe without contradiction; Nor had Captain <hi>Swanley</hi> reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him clothes and Salt, or what elſe of the States Goods by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, without Order of the Committee, which was by the Relator ſcorned and deſpiſed: yet now the Relator deſireth, whatſoever hath been acted by him without order (though maliciouſly, and of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100805:7"/>
may not be interpreted by the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be done in contempt of their power; but rather to impute it to his want of knowledge and neceſſity: and then appeals to his Actions (which if you will beleeve him) were chiefly for the publick good; when in truth his endeavours were for ſelf-ends meerly, and to colour rapine.</p>
            <p>Thus hath he brought the Story down to <hi>Gerrards</hi> return in April laſt, and skipping over his loſſe of <hi>Carew</hi> Caſtle, fals upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee (his old friends) who inſtead of aſſiſting him (he tels you) ſome ran to the Enemy (theſe would be known) others ran a ſhipboord (theſe could do no leſſe) the Relators abuſing of them a little before, and the drunken rule he kept in <hi>Pembrook,</hi> was motive ſufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void coming thither: but more of that anon. The correſpondence with <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and the Committees leaving word at their Houſes, that they were priſoners aboord the Ships, with Captain <hi>Swanleys</hi> not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foording Ammunition, while to be ſpared, is the Relators own fiction. But that ſome of the Committees aboord betook themſelves to <hi>London,</hi> ſeeing the Countrey fired by the Enemy, is confeſt, yet not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged an offence, becauſe they had the conſent of moſt of the reſt of their fellows to go thither, and to repreſent the ſad condition of the County to the State, who did accordingly ſolicite for relief and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd it. Good reaſon had they (at their coming to <hi>London)</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Relator for beating, and thereby expelling their Miniſters out of the Countrey, and for other publick and perſonall abuſes; his tyranny over the well affected being not inferiour to <hi>Gerrards</hi> cruelty.</p>
            <p>Now follows in the Relation the Seige and defence of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> where aſſuming all to himſelf, he mentions not the Major Generall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Colby-moore</hi> Victory, and there would ſhare in the honour of that Action too, although many miles abſent from the place. After this he tels you of the reducing of ſome places, and leaving his men with the Major Generall (no ſmall favour you'l ſay) paſſing many dangers in his journey, he at laſt arrives in <hi>London;</hi> where no ſooner come, but he preſently boggles at the Committee of <hi>Pembrookeſheire.</hi> Then he talks of (he knows not whom) but ſtill they are of the Committee, that ſure, 'twas they that called him out of his name at the <hi>Parliament-</hi>doore, though none of them there: yet reſolved it is, it muſt be they or no body. And the Lord <hi>Mountnorris,</hi> a perſon of known eminent integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and impartialitie in the wayes of publick Juſtice, and oppoſition of tyranny and oppreſſion (becauſe father in law to Mr <hi>Lort)</hi> is brought in by the Relator in a parentheſis ſtuft with untruth; wherein he falſly ſets down that Mr <hi>Lort</hi> was forced by him to a compliance with the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100805:8"/>
               <hi>Parliament;</hi> whereas the Relator appeared not in any Service out of the Town of <hi>Pembrook</hi> untill after Mr <hi>Lort</hi> took the Nationall Covenant, who came in voluntarily to Captain <hi>Swanley,</hi> and was received by the Admirall and Committee, according to the Declaration of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in <hi>Febr.</hi> 1643. But the Relation ſets forth that the thing object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Committee, and their friends here againſt the Relator, is, that he is a mean man, and hath acted without Commiſſion, not fit to be truſted; which whether true or falſe, let the impartiall Reader paſſe ſentence upon peruſall of this vindication. And now for a farewell, he bids defiance to his accuſers in proving any diſſervice to the publick, though he confeſſes ſome faults, but in implicite terms. Here ſhall iſſue be joyned with the Relator, and now having run through the ſubſtance of the whole Relation, the Reader is deſired to peruſe the Epitome of the Relators behaviour in that County laid down briefly thus.</p>
            <p>The manner of his Riſe is already ſet forth; his indeavour ſince hath alwayes been to ingroſſe plunder in all places to the advance of his private intereſt, whereof nothing hath come amiſſe of what kind ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though contrary to Order, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Arms, Iron, Lead, &amp;c. in <hi>August</hi> 1644. great ſtore of Wheat, Mault, and other proviſion brought into the Garriſon of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> he converts it into Bisket and drink, ſels it to his own uſe. The like he did with Corn brought in by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for proviſion of <hi>Carew</hi> Garriſon, and when he had ſold it, billetted the Souldiers of that Garriſon abroad on the poore adjacent Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants upon free Quarter. If at any time he heard the Committee had ſequeſtred (according to Ordinance of <hi>Parliament)</hi> any Malignants eſtate neer <hi>Pembrook,</hi> thither would he go with Armed men, carrie away, and ſell the wood, corn, cattell, &amp;c. in meer contempt of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and for his own private unjuſt gain. If he could learn where any Money was to be had in the neighbourhood, he commands the party, though well affected, into <hi>Pembrook,</hi> impriſons him untill he payes what ſumme he impoſes. This hath he done ſince a Committee ſettled there by Ordinance, and thereby hath gotten great ſummes of money. At other times he playes the Freebooter, takes away all he can lay hands upon, makes men buy their Freedom, then takes them the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, terms them Bumkins, and puts them to ranſome as often as he pleaſes. Abuſes the Committee of <hi>Parliament,</hi> cals them Common theeves, impriſons five of them at once, one at another time, runs at them with his Sword, ſtrikes Admirall <hi>Swanley</hi> to the effuſion of his Blood, while he was in Command there by Ordinance of <hi>Parliament;</hi> ſhamefully beats two Orthodox godly Miniſters preſerred to two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100805:8"/>
in that County by this <hi>Parliament;</hi> ſtirs up the Souldiers to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny againſt the Committee, for Money, who with Piſtols, Spans, and Matches lighted, threaten to have their hearts blood, and after abuſes their perſons in ſeverall places of the Countrey; He feaſts the Cavaliers priſoners in <hi>Pembrook</hi> upon the Faſt-day in <hi>September</hi> laſt, receives the Sacrament, and drinks himſelf drunk with the priſoners the ſame day. Another time rides up and down the Countrey between <hi>Haverfordwest</hi> and <hi>Pembrook,</hi> and preſents his Piſtols at all the poore people he meets in his way, compels them to fall down upon their knees and beg their lives of him, then rides on in triumph; Theſe are ſome of the Relators Services, who before theſe Wars began had neither Lands nor Goods of value, now hath neer 400 head of Cattell, and is grown rich; yet demands foure thouſand pound more of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſo would injure and deceive the <hi>Parliament</hi> as he hath done the Countrey. All which particulars are truths that will be manifeſted by clear and apparent proofs upon oath, and have been with many more miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours preſented in Articles by the publick Agent of that County to the Honourable Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>July</hi> laſt, and ſhortly after to the Honorable Committee of both Kingdoms. Now let the Reader judge whether this man hath made good his defiance of any diſſervice done by him to the State.</p>
            <p>In the concluſion of his Pamphlet the Relator bluſhes not to term himſelf the mouth of that County to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and deſires if he hath done amiſſe, the Countrey may not be blamed, who have hoped they have ſerved the Publick in ſerving him, <hi>Os durum,</hi> A mouth indeed! who can read this without bluſhing or indignation that knows the perſon or qualities of the man? There is a Gentleman (whom he pleaſes to traduce in his Relation) Mr <hi>Elliot</hi> by name, who is by generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Committee of that County choſen Agent for thoſe parts (whoſe merit tranſcends the Relators obloquy) having loſt his whole Eſtate in Service of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> his houſe (a fair manſion) with his houſhold-ſtuffe, together with eight houſes of his Tenants burnt to aſhes in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1644. At <hi>Gerrards</hi> firſt coming with his Army into <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brookeſheire,</hi> himſelf and his two ſons taken priſoners by the Enemy, and (himſelf being afterwards exchanged) his eldeſt Son was indited of Treaſon for bearing Arms againſt His Majeſtie, and adjudged at <hi>Carmarthen</hi> by <hi>David Jenkins</hi> to be hanged. This Gentleman ſerved the <hi>Parliament</hi> faithfully, and hath been one of the Committee of the three Counties of <hi>Pembrook, Carmarthen,</hi> and <hi>Cardigan-ſhiers</hi> for almoſt three yeers, and hath had two Sons conſtantly in the Service of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100805:9"/>
               <hi>Parliament,</hi> under Command of Major Generall <hi>Laugharn.</hi> The Baronet (whom the Relator traduces) gave ſufficient teſtimony of his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and good affection to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> at the time the Earl of <hi>Carbery</hi> with his Forces was poſſeſt of the whole County of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> except <hi>Caſtlematen Hundred</hi> and <hi>Pembrook</hi> Town, by ſending a private Meſſage to the prime Gentlemen then in <hi>Pembrook,</hi> to deſire them ſpeedily to ſend ſome Foot to garriſon his Caſtle of <hi>Pictown,</hi> intimating his Gates ſhould be open to receive them, and that they might with conveniency come up by water. Which being neglected, ſhortly after the Enemy took poſſeſſion thereof for the King without his privity or conſent. To conclude, this Noble Barronett, with Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> and the other two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Lort,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bowen,</hi> ſo often mentioned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, did joyntly lay hold of the Declaration of both Kingdoms in <hi>February</hi> 1643. and took the Nationall Covenant, contributed to the ſervice of the <hi>Parliament</hi> proportionally to their abilities, and were made of the Committee for that and other Counties; wherein they have ſerved the <hi>Parliament</hi> with all integritie, and for that Service have had their Houſes burnt by <hi>Gerrards</hi> Forces, and loſt their perſonall eſtates to a greater value then any ten of the Gentrie in thoſe parts. Now let the world judge whether in theſe times of profeſſed and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted Reformation, this Relator, <hi>quondam</hi> Mayor of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> be a man fit to have any truſt, power, or authority over any who deſire to be called Chriſtians; and let them who have countenanced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him peruſe this following Scripture:</p>

            <p>MOſt humbly ſhewing, that your Petitioner having for above twentie yeares continued a conſtant Preacher of Gods word, in the pariſh of Egloyskimmin in Countie of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marthen in South-Wales, upon the lands of the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Lord Viſcount <hi>Valentia;</hi> in which place the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner did according to his poore abilities, faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his dutie, to the good contentment of all his Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and adjoyning neighbours, as he hopeth, untill hee was by the cruell Enemy plundred of his books, and all his other goods, and forced to flie (for ſafe-guard of his life) into Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke-ſhire, where this Honourable Committee taking notice of his diſtreſſed condition, were pleaſed by their Order dated the 29 of November 1644, to appoint him to preach twice everie Lords day in the Pariſh Church of Pembroke, and to have foureſcore pounds <hi>per annum</hi> out of the profits and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Biſhop of St. Davids, to be quarterly paid unto him, as by a Copie of the ſaid Order hereunto annexed may appeare: and this Petitioner making his repaire the 24 of April 1645, to Mr. <hi>Iohn Poyer</hi> then Mayor of Pembroke, and in all reſpectfull manner acquainting him with the Parliaments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning him to be Lecturer there, deſiring his countenance and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100805:10"/>
protection of him, the rather (with which I acquainted him) in that the day before I riding thorow the Towne, had a great ſtone of about three pound weight purpoſely throwne at mee, which ſtriking my horſe, I narrowly eſcaped: Hee at the verie firſt charged mee to bee a miſchievous worker in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, revileth me, calling mee ſtinking Raſcall, and ſtinking Scab, uſing many other reproachfull and menacing ſpeeches, pulleth me from off my horſe, not only trampling my hat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his horſes feet, but uſed his uttermoſt endeavour to ride over me; not herewith contented, he draweth his ſword, and with his whole might ſmiteth me on the head, and then over the ſhoulders, and held the point of his naked ſword for ſome while to my throat, ſwearing and threatening to kill mee, if I would not go along with him; by which meanes, being in feare of my life, he enforced me againe to take horſe, and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, rageing, and reviling of me, he laboureth my horſe with his naked ſword, and thus driveth mee as faſt as my horſe was able to go before him, inſcornfull and reproachfull manner to Pembroke. Being thither come, I took Sanctuarie in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe, for ſafetie of my life, from his furie; from thence, notwithſtanding all poſſible mediation of friends, that hee would forbeare mee till the next day, being then verie faint, ſore, and feeble by his evill uſage, hee ſends, and fetcheth mee to his houſe with his Souldiers in moſt diſgracefull manner: Being come before him, and giving him all due reſpects, and ſtanding in humble wiſe uncovered before him, hee threw my hat twice at ſeverall times about the Houſe, calling me againe ſtinking Scab, with a furious and wrathfull countenance, uſing many other ignominious and threatening ſpeeches, to my great terrour and publike diſgrace; and at laſt by mediation I was diſmiſſed, and being forced for ſome time after, to keep my bed, and not able to write, I uſed the hand of another, to ſhew my ſufferings to the Parliament-Committee of that Countie, praying releefe, but could get none there; but was neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100805:10"/>
to depart thence by ſhipping to London, where your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner hath, and doth ſtill continue in a diſtreſſed and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, being by the cruell beating and barbarous uſage of the ſaid <hi>Iohn Poyer,</hi> ever ſince verie greatly diſabled in body and mind, not only unto the publike Miniſterie, but likewiſe unto his private ſtudies, and thereby unfitting for publike em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, becoming thereby (unto his more than ordinarie griefe) verie little uſefull for the preſent in the Church of God; and however your Petitioner, moſt innocent of the leaſt offence, ſuffered all theſe injuries, and many more too tedious and irkſome to relate; yet the authoritie of Parliament was herein moſt affronted, in as much as the only cauſe of all his being thus cruelly uſed, was his ſignifying unto the ſaid then Mayor of Pembroke, the Order of Parliament for his being Lecturer there.</p>
            <p>Wherefore hee holds himſelfe bound in dutie, to make knowne to this Honourable Committee, theſe both ſo great contempts of ſo high Authoritie, and ſo violent outrages and diſgraces cauſeleſly offered to him, Gods poore and perſecuted Miniſter, to the great ſcandall of Religion and publike Juſtice, ſo much wanting in thoſe parts; and humbly beſeecheth, that in Gods holy Name, feare and way, there may be ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt ſo notorious a Delinquent, and for vindication and reparation of your poore Petitioner, as you in your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Juſtice ſhall think fit.</p>

            <p>WOrthy Sir, I ſalute you in the Lord, I hope of your kind acceptance of theſe my rude lines, though you might marvell, having no acquaintance with you, yet your goodneſſe being ſuch, as will not refuſe any friend, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the furtherance and enlargement of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and the ſuppreſſing the Enemies thereof: you were of late gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us for our Paſtour by that pious Houſe of Parliament, but oppoſed by that vitious man who hates all goodneſſe, and good men, that hee feares will reprove his wicked courſes, which is abhominable, and rather growes worſe then any way mends; for he that hates to obey God and his Word, will ſurely hate Gods Servants, and Miniſters, he hath manie times
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100805:11"/>
rejected the good admonitions of our reverent late deceaſed M. <hi>Jeſop,</hi> he ſhewed his wickedneſſe towards him to the end. I need not repeat it, for you know it, and for your abuſes, it was not onely to you, but to us who have had a great loſſe by his wickedneſſe (I meane <hi>John Poyer)</hi> he is the ſubject of my diſcourſe, who drove you from us, and now we are left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Teacher, and have not had a Sermon in foure or five weekes, but one the laſt Wedneſday in September, which was uſed to bee our Faſt-day, according to the command of Parliament, but was left quite by <hi>Poyer</hi> long ſince; but as I ſaid before, on the laſt Wedneſday in September, hee going out of his Office ſhortly, would leave ſome ſhew of piety, he thought, cauſed warning thereof the Lords day before, of the Faſt, and a Sacrament on that Wedneſday, and brought Mr. <hi>Rud</hi> a notable Cavalier, to preach, who commended them for keeping the Book of Common Prayer, and not uſing the Directory that was out, and wiſht them to hold faſt that Booke: So Sermon being ended, and the Sacrament, hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his humiliation and feaſted his Preacher, but eſpecially ſome Cavalier Captaines, and Commanders, that are priſoners here, them he kept untill it was verie neere night, drinking Sack and ſtrong Beer, (as they themſelves reported) but were ſo drunken, that they could ſcarce go, but did reel in the ſtreet and ready to fall, ſcarce able to get to their lodging from <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> houſe: It was a great grief to me, and ſome of my friends that ſaw it, how Gods Word and Ordinance, is made a cloak for his villany, and now he is going for London to get to be Governour of this Towne, which if he gaines, not any that beares the name of an honeſt Chriſtian ſhall be able to live heere. Therefore I beſeech you in the name and for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Jeſus Chriſt, withſtand it as much as you may, and acquaint the Parliament of his unjuſt carriages, and wee ſhall not faile in our prayers for you, and that you may be given us to the building of us in Chriſt, which the Lord of mercy,

for his Son Jeſus Chriſts ſake grant us, and keep you and us, to whoſe almighty tuition I leave you, and reſt,</p>
