            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>YOu will admire perhaps at first the Confidence of this Person, who never was of the Council, be sure, nor is of the Parliament, that he should make so bold as to endeavour to shew the Interests of All Parties, and ev'n those of the King and of the Country. But you will have cause to cease your Admiration, if you consider, that the <hi>Interests</hi> of the Parties do not lie so deep under ground as is thought; and that if Men do not see <hi>them,</hi> it is not because they Cannot, but because they Will not; not because the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is Hid, but because their Eyes (with which they must see it) are mop't in Passions and Prejudices. The <hi>Author</hi> pretends to see no more, than every body else may,
<pb facs="tcp:101281:3"/>
provided, that he will wipe his Eyes, and be as impartial and as unprejudic'd as <hi>He.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the King, whom God long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; Thanks be to God, he has a clearer Prospect of His own and of His Kingdoms Interest, in the Matters debated, than Any His Royal Predecessors had; and He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues it too with that Conduct and that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor which corresponds with the Miracles that preserv'd the <hi>Crown</hi> for Him, and also <hi>Him,</hi> both for the Crown, and for a Glory greater than that of wearing Crowns, to wit, to be the Restorer of Religion to <hi>Liberty</hi> and Freedom of Exercise.</p>

            <head>Prudential Reasons for Repealing the Penal Laws against All Recusants, and for a General Toleration.</head>
            <p n="1">1. CHristian <hi>Religion</hi> and Civil <hi>Government</hi> are things <hi>so</hi> different, as in their Originals, so in their Natures; and ordain'd for Ends so different, (the Former being Divine and Spiritual, and ordain'd to be a Means to Mens Eternal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; the Latter, Human and Secular, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Temporal Welfare) <hi>that</hi> in themselves, and absolutely taken, they are nothing a Kin, and of no Relation <hi>one</hi> to <hi>another.</hi> Wherefore Civil Government (as such) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be oblig'd to concern it self in the Business of Religion, or to Incorporate Any, any further than as Politic and Secular Respects do ingage it, that is, any further than as a Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion may become a matter of State, and be for the Quiet, Safety, Strength and Support, and so do's make for the Ends and the Interest of the Government.</p>
            <p>Now it is for the Interest, Quiet, Strength and Safety of every Government to give as much Contentment, and to make it self as <hi>easie</hi> as is possible unto all its Subjects, but especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conscience; which, as they have the greatest Ascendent over the Minds of Men, so the Gratifications and Displeasures that have reference to <hi>these,</hi> of all others do most deeply affect them. And therefore it is against the Interest, the Quiet, the Strength and the Safety of Government to espouse Religion (in any Mode thereof) so as to establish it by Law any further, or in any other manner than as may consist with the general li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and give Content unto all in Reason; for Reason at last will Rule, and over-rule both Passions and Prejudices. State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bigottry (in any Religion) cannot be for the Interest of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101281:4"/>2. But to circumscribe my self within a nearer compass. All the Sanguinary and Burthensome Laws relating to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that from time to time have been enacted by our English Parliaments, against either Popish or other Recusants; <hi>They</hi> were <hi>all</hi> made in a <hi>Passion</hi> of State, and only to humour the Times, as might be prov'd by Induction of all the Particulars. And therefore as things of <hi>that</hi> Production always have, so even these have something in them of Violent, Inequitable and Extravagant, and of unfit and inconvenient at least for times of Peace and Tranquility: So that to repeal them, must needs be an Act of Moderation, Clemency and Justice, and of Politic Prudence and Wisdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Besides, the Penal Laws did never answer the Ends and Designs for which they were intended; but instead of securing good Order, Quiet, Peace and Tranquility to the Government, they too often prov'd a matter of Embroylment and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance unto it; and have been the Handles which upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, Ambitious, Factious, Discontented Men have taken hold of, and have <hi>used</hi> to wind about the People, and make a Property of them to serve their <hi>ill</hi> Designs and Intentions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Penal Laws never answered or effected their Ends.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on several Occasions, in several Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, gave Life and Birth to Laws of extream severity, not only against the Roman Catholic, but also the Puritan Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; but against both to little effect; for notwithstanding all that severity, Popery was not extirpated, and Nonconformity grew and spread; it is true, the less observedly, but not the less dangerously for that it grew in secret, and that it was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> succeeding Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would needs be her Successor as to her Methods of Prudence as well as to her Crown, and in the same Method was met with the same suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: Papists were more sharpned, and Puritans spred more; the Severities of the Law increasing only the number of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, without establishing the Quiet, Repose and Peace of the Government. When Laws are Enemies to any Men, to be sure, say they what they will, and swear what they will, those Men will be Enemies to the Laws. Ay! the very Being of the Penal Laws without a perpetual Execution of them do's make Enemies. For Men will always hate what they always fear; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101281:4"/>
the Laws (if in Being) are always feared, because if they <hi>do</hi> not strike always, yet they <hi>may</hi> strike, and no body knows how soon <hi>they will:</hi> Which minds me of the second Point.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Penal Laws have often ministred matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance and Imbroylment to the Government; to evidence which we need not to go back to far remote and distant times, but may keep within our own Horizon and Ken, and yet have Examples enough, and plain enough.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Charles the First,</hi> for certain Reasons of State, had remitted the execution of the severity of the Laws against Roman Catholics, and for other Reasons permitted some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities to be used by the Clergy for the suppressing of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; occasion is taken hence for making Complaints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both Hands; to wit, of the Non-execution of the Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Roman-Catholics, and of a too severe Execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Puritans. Popery (the Cry is) is favored, and True-Protestant Religion, under pretence of Puritanism and Non-Conformity, (is) discouraged and even undermin'd: At last out comes the <hi>Popish Royal Favorite,</hi> and on comes War and Confusion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To come nearer yet; When <hi>Charles the Second</hi> after a long experience of the Unfitness and Inefficacy of forcible Courses for setling the Repose of State, (the which he had wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed) found Cause to emit his Gracious Declaration of Liberty and Indulgence, to quiet the Minds of his Subjects, that he might have Peace at home, while he was making War abroad: Presently the Alarm is sounded, the Church is in danger, an Inundation of <hi>Fanatics</hi> worse than that of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> is like to run over all, and <hi>Currat Lex</hi> is the word, and this too, by Men that would be thought to valew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the Doctrin of Non-resistance.</p>
            <p>Again, when by Intercession of Parliament and from other Considerations, he was induc'd to Revoke his Declaration (from which moment he might have dated the beginning of all the Stirs, and all the Imbroylments that followed) in a little Time, the Fanatics being sufficiently mortify'd, up goes another Cry (God wot) of the <hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> in which (without doubt) the Fanatics did heartily joyn, both out of a sense of Revenge, and from that of their Interest. After this came Plots upon Plots, and Difficulty upon Difficulty, to the certain Danger,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101281:5"/>
and almost as certain Ruin and Destruction of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of such advantage are the Penal Laws to the Safety, Quiet, and Repose of the State! Indeed while these are in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there can never want Pretexts, upon one hand or the other, <hi>Quiet a movendi,</hi> to make Complaints of; as, either of too much severity, if they are executed, or else of too much remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if they are not. Away then with these two-handed Tools of Contention and Faction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I may add, That Severities, especially in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are so contrary to the Complexion and Temper of our Nation, which both by Nature and by the Frame of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the Fundamental Constitutions of it, are much more mild and gentle than most others, <hi>That</hi> the very Authors and Promoters of the sanguinary and burthensom Laws, in a little time, and when the Heat was over, grew weary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss themselves in executing of them. <hi>Fuller</hi> tells us, in his <hi>Ecclesiastical History, cent.</hi> 16. <q>That when these Statutes (he speaks particularly of that in the Twenty third of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> against Jesuits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) were first in the State and Magisteriality thereof, they were severely put in practise on such Offenders as they first lighted on. But some years after, the Queen and her Judges grew <hi>Remiss</hi> in the Execution thereof; witness the only confining of many of 'them to <hi>Wisbich</hi> Castle. And in King <hi>James</hi>'s Days, this Dormant Law against Jesuits only awaked some once in four or five years (to shew the World that it was not dead) and then fairly fell asleep again, being very sparingly put in execution, against some Notorious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</q> Thus he.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And if we consider this Subject in a larger Circle, and speculate upon it exactly, the Prudentialness of what I have propos'd, and have hitherto argued, will appear the brighter.</p>
            <p>Opinions then, and Practices in matters of Religion are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plausible and Popular, or of a nature not so apt to take with the People. If Opinions and Practices are not plausible and popular, but of a Nature unapt to take with the People, in that case there is no need of Laws to suppress them, because no danger of them, they will expire of themselves; Laws against them, will but give them Credit and Reputation, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their Memory; to despise and neglect is to extinguish and stifle them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101281:5"/>It is true, when Opinions and Practices are plausible and popular, are well nick'd, and are apt to infect, and take with the People, but yet have not as yet infected them and spread among them, all things being as yet still and quiet, in that Case the Quickest and Severest Remedies seem the <hi>Best,</hi> because they eradicate. And thus while the <hi>Reformation</hi> was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Breast of one only <hi>Luther,</hi> if Friar <hi>Hogostrate</hi>'s Counsel (indeed an <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s) of applying Chains, and Fire, and Flame, as the only proper Remedy, had been follow'd, That Course ('tis very probable) would have for ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>it.</hi> But God had better things in Reserve. And this Method even Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> follow'd as to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists that came over hither: She Burnt two, and Banish'd all the rest that would not Recant: Which Proceeding, according to the Rules of Policy, was certainly good; but how Equitable it was, and how Christian, I leave to others to judge.</p>
            <p>But after that Opinions and Practices have gotten Roots in the Minds of Men, that they have spread among the People, and are entertain'd with Applause, so that there are some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who think it to be a Concern of Salvation to them to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate, and others that think it no less a Concern of theirs to Receive them; in this Case (and this is Ours) the Severity of Laws, if executed, (and Laws without Execution are Scare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crows, seen and despised) do's only hinder the Open Profession, but not the Belief and Secret Practice: may Repel the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and make them eager and virulent, and consequently encrease the Danger; but do's not Expel or Alter them. Thus the Body Politic becomes replenish'd with Malignities, and then any jogging and stirring of State endangers it; whereof one day our neighbour Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> may have a dangerous Experience. And certainly even at this time some of our <hi>own Church,</hi> who lately proceeded to so great Extremities against Dissenters, and thought by that Proceeding to have got an absolute Victory, begin to <hi>fear</hi> it; and should His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty please to grant His Indulgence by Proclamation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Seal, I believe they would <hi>Find</hi> it a great Truth, That Severity and Persecution may make Conformists, but not Converts: However the Observation is not new.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101281:6"/>The burning of Men and Women like Torches in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, tho' it had this Effect, that it produc'd an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal external Conformity to the Roman-Catholic Rites, yet seeing those Fires did only heat the Humors of the Men, they did not burn without Illuminating their Minds; no sooner was Occasion presented, as, by the Descent of the Crown on Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was not long after, but the Ineffectualness, Folly, and Weakness of that Proceeding appeared; for the People, no more than the Clergy (generally speaking) were now no longer what they seem'd before. Again, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Udal,</hi> and Execution of <hi>Barrow</hi> and others, (who were hang'd as Felons) for Non-conformity in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Time, had no better Effect, as the Consequence shew'd; for notwithstanding that Severity, Puritanism grew in Her Time as Protestantism did in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, and possibly the faster for that Severity.</p>
            <p>Of this King <hi>James the First</hi> was fully convinc'd (at last) by the burning of <hi>Legate</hi> and <hi>Weightman</hi> (for the Writ <hi>de Haeretico comburendo</hi> has done jobs for others, more than once, as well as for Roman-Catholics) he finding by that experiment of Fire Ordeal, the truth of this Observation, That severe Executions in matters of Religion, even when the Opinions are but specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and not apt to take, do ordinarily more hurt than good. The Observation <hi>Fuller</hi> has made of the success of those Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, deserves that we should put our Finger upon it. <q>God may seem (says he in his <bibl>
                     <hi>Ecclesiast. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story Cent. 17. Sect.</hi> 4.</bibl>) well pleas'd with this seasonable se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, for the Fire thus kindled, quickly went out for want of Fewel, I mean, there was none ever after that avowed these Heretical Doctrines, only a Spanish <hi>Arian,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to die, was notwithstanding suffered to linger out his life in <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he ended the same. Indeed <hi>such burning of Heretics much startled common People, pitying all in pain,</hi> and prone to asperse Iustice it self with Cruelty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the novelty and hideousness of the Punishment. And the Purblind Eyes of Vulgar Judgments looked only on what was next to them (the Suffering it self) which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with compassion, not minding the demerit of the guilt which deserved the same. Besides such being unable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betwixt Constancy and Obstinacy, were ready to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101281:6"/>
entertain good thoughts even of the Opinions of those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, who sealed them so manfully with their Blood. Wherefore <hi>King</hi> James <hi>politicly preferr'd,</hi> that Heretics here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, tho' condemn'd, should silently and privately waste themselves away in the Prison, rather than to grace them and amuse others with the solemnity of a public Execution, which in Popular Judgment usurped the Honor of a Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</q> Thus he. But to return.</p>
            <p>The only proper Method then, in <hi>case</hi> Religious Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have taken Root, and are so largely diffus'd among the People that they cannot be eradicated but by Barbarous Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with extream scandal, as by Massacres and Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates; I say, the only proper Method in this <hi>Case</hi> is that which is <hi>Lenitive,</hi> the method of Toleration and Indulgence, but with due Regulations. For in this Method, altho' Recusants are permitted to continue such still as to the Church, yet they cannot but become entirely the Friends of the State, which by giving them such Reasonable Satisfaction, do's as well deprive them of just occasions of complaint, as take away from the Multitude all occasions of Compassion and Pity. And in this state of things should any Recusants be still contriving and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing it will be manifest (to all) that it is not Conscience, but a Lust of Power and Rule that Acts them, the very sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of which will lose them the People; so that they may be punish'd by the Hand of Justice, not only without Murmur, but even with general Applause. Tho' many will hear them that say, <hi>We preach our selves your Servants for Christs sake,</hi> but few will indure such as shall say (but in effect) <hi>We Preach our selves your Lords, and you our Servants, for our own sakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be added, that Restraint doth whet the Appetite, and therefore that Indulgence and Liberty will abate it: Men will not care so much to hear Recusants, when they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd from hearing them.</p>

               <head>Prudential Reasons for Repealing the Penal Laws against the Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics particularly.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIRST, that his Majesty having profess'd himself of the Roman-Catholic Perswasion, it is but a just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, not only in those of his own Profession, but in all the World, that he should procure a Legal Freedom of Exercise for that Religion; which should he be unable to effect with the Consent of his People in Parliament, it would much obscure and eclipse the Glory of his Character abroad, it being impossible that he should appear as a King of Great Figure to the World abroad, if he shall appear to make (as then he will) but a little one at home: Whereas it is for the Interest and Safety, as well as for the Honor of the Kingdom, that the King should make as Great, and as Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Figure abroad as is possible, seeing the Strength and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Kingdom (the Reputation of which is its Safety) appears not to the World but in the Greatness of the King, and in His Power with His People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Continuation of the Penal Laws against Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, when the King professes Himself to be One, must needs have a particular Ill Reflection upon Him even in other Respects. For who can think or say of Catholics, that they are so Criminal and Ill a sort of Men, and of Principles so very Bad, that the utmost Severity against them is but little enough; but withal he must abate of Regard and Veneration for the King, who acknowledges Himself a Roman-Catholic? which how it can consist with that Proportion of Duty, Love, and Allegiance that we owe unto Him as our Sovereign Lord, is too hard a Point for me to conceive.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I am very confident, that many Examples (if any) can't be given in All History, of Governments in which the Prince was of a Religion, the Exercise whereof Himself did punish in His Subjects, by His Laws and Judges; and indeed it cannot be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101281:7"/>
but a Solecism in State to admit it. For, that a King should punish in others, what yet He publicly avows and owns and approves in Himself, is very odd, and a Self-condemnation. I know the Case of <hi>Sigismond</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Poland</hi> and King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> but I suppose it will not be urg'd as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance against me.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Prudential Reasons for Tolerating other Recusants, as well as, and together with, the Roman-Catholics.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOt to give a Toleration and Indulgence unto Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Recusants, when it is given to <hi>Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics</hi> (if at any time it shall be given), would make the Toleration of These, how Just soever, to become Invidious, and a Subject of Clamor and general Scandal, and so a Matter of Disquiet and Trouble to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ay! And the Roman-Catholics cannot hope to hold and enjoy a Toleration that should be giv'n them by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, if other Recusants be not also joyn'd with them therein, longer than they may be sure of a Toleration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such an Act, only by the Royal Prerogative and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency: Whereas if the Toleration is General, and All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants, as well the Protestant as Roman-Catholic, <hi>equally</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Grant thereof, in one Act, and upon one Bottom, a Consideration of the Quality, the Number, and the Interests of the Parties so joyn'd together in the Liberty, will secure the Possession of it in Future: For, then, it will not be Wisdom to go about to disturb <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Trade is the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> and Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Interest of Trade; it being beyond Dispute to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering Men, that the Body of the Industrious Trading Part of the Nation are either themselves Dissenters, or Favourers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101281:8"/>
of those that are (such.) And it is as evident, that Trade, which, <hi>before,</hi> lay ev'n gasping for Life, since His Majesties Gracious Intentions are known to lean towards Liberty of Conscience, and that He has <hi>Extended</hi> His Dispensations from the Penal Laws in Matters of Religion, is Recover'd to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and grown Brisk and Quick, and that too so much to <hi>general</hi> satisfaction, that we hear no more Now, as Before, the Idle Stories of Prophecies, Prodigies, Complaints, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs, (those certain Symptoms of a Diseas'd and Crazy State) but All is Quiet and Still.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is for the Interest of those that do Profess themselves the true Sons of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as by Law establish'd, if really they are Lovers of the Reformation, more than of their Passions and Humors, that All Recusants, as well the Protestant as the Roman-Catholic, should be <hi>Equal</hi> Sharers in the Grant of Liberty, if any is made. For seeing it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that these two should agree but in things in which their Interest joyns them, and as impossible that it should be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of either one of these (any more than it can be the Kingdoms) to suffer the other to get uppermost, one of them will always Ballance the other, and consequently both must be contented with Liberty, without aspiring to Power and Rule. And thus the Church will always remain undisturbed as well as the State.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if the <hi>Church of England</hi> will have security in the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Establishment they have, or may have, by Law, upon their own Bottom, without the Assistance of <hi>Ballancing</hi> and Policy to support <hi>it,</hi> they must resolve to <hi>enlarge</hi> that Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, (which indeed is their true Interest) by parting with things to them indifferent, but not indifferent to others. For if some Men resolve to be always stiff and inflexible, and not to condescend in the least to any Abatements, for the Love of Peace and of Unity, one may adventure to foretel, without pretending to Prophecy, that <hi>sooner</hi> or later, they will find themselves in his Folly, who rather than cast the worst of the Loading Over-board to save the Ship, will sink with it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To conclude, It is certainly for the Interest of the Royal Family, as well as for the Kingdoms Interest, that such a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement should be well deliberated, and be surely establish'd, as to the Business of Religion; that whether the Crown here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101281:8"/>
shall descend on the Head of a Roman-Catholic, or of a Protestant, (for it may again (as has already) sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend upon the one, and sometimes upon the other) that That Descent should make no Change and Alteration in the Law, or the State of Things in the Government. Preventive Wisdom is the best Wisdom; and such a Settlement will Prevent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions and Difficulties, which (else) on every Demise of the Crown, the State will be subject unto.</p>
               <p>But such a Settlement, I doubt, can never be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Resolving that the Religion already Establish'd, shall be the Religion of the State; and that those who dissent from it, shall yet have Toleration and Indulgence, but under due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations and Qualifications. For my own part, I admire the World is so fond of <hi>Uniformity</hi> in the Externals of Religion, that in most things else prefers <hi>Convenience</hi> before <hi>It.</hi> The World it self is Elemented of Contraries, diversly proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and the Variety in it, is, of the Being, and for the Beauty and the Ornament of it.</p>
