            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Essay upon the Advancement of Trade in IRELAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know not what it was that fell into discourse
t'other day, and gave your Excellency the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of desiring me to digest into some Method
and upon Paper, the means and ways I esteemed
most proper for the advancing of Trade in <hi>Ireland:</hi>
This I know very well, that you did it in a manner,
and with Expressions too obliging to be refused, and
out of a design so publick and generous as ought not
to be discouraged. I had therefore much rather obey
your Lordship in this point, how ill soever I do it, than
excuse my self, though never so well, which were
much easier than the other. For I might alledg that
neither my Birth nor my Breeding has been at all in
this Country: That I have passed only one short pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of my life here, and the greatest part thereof
wholly out of business, and publick thoughts; That
I have since been Ten years absent from it; and am
now here upon no other occasion than of a short Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
to some of my Friends: Which are all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that make me a very improper subject for
such a command. But I suppose the vein I have had of
running into speculations of this kind upon a greater
scene of Trade, and in a Country where I was more a
stranger; and the too partial favour your Lordship
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102555:2"/>
has exprest to another Discourse of this nature, have
cost me this present service; and you have thought
fit to punish me for one folly, by engaging me to
commit another; like the Confessor, that prescribed a
Drunkard the penance of being drunk again. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, your Lordship shall be obeyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I hope to be enough excused; which is all I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the considerations of Trade
which are more general, and may be more lasting in
this Kingdom; I will observe to your Lordship some
particular Circumstances in the Constitution and
Government, which have been hitherto, and may be
long, the great discouragers of Trade and Riches here;
And some others in the present Conjuncture, which
are absolutely mortal to it; that so you may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to find remedies where indeed there is none; nor
suffer men, like busie ignorant Physicians, to apply
such as are contrary to the disease, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find such as are proper for it.</p>
            <p>The true and natural ground of Trade and Riches,
is Number of People, in proportion to the compass of
Ground they inhabit. This makes all things necessary
to life dear, and that forces men to industry and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simony.
These Customs which grow first from neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
come with time to be habitual in a Country. And
where-ever they are so, that place must grow great
in Traffick and Riches, if not disturbed by some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
or revolutions, as of Wars, of Plagues, or
Famines, by which the People come to be either
scattered or destroyed.</p>
            <p>People are multiplied in a Country by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Climate favourable to Generation, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102555:2"/>
Health, and long life. Or else by the Circumstances
of safety and ease under the Government, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
whereof invites men over to it, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be either safe or easie at home. When things
are once in motion, Trade begets Trade, as fire does
fire, and People go much where much People are
already gone. So men run still to a crowd where
they see it in the streets, or the fields, though it
be only to do as others do, to see or to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>The want of Trade in <hi>Ireland</hi> proceeds from the
want of People, and this is not grown from any ill
qualities of the Climate or Air, but chiefly from
the frequent Revolutions of so many Wars and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
so great Slaughters and Calamities of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
as have at several Intervals of time succeeded
the first Conquest of this Kingdom in <hi>Henry</hi> the
Seconds time, until the year 1653; Two very great
Plagues followed the two great Wars, those of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and the last; which helped
to drain the current stream of Generation in the
Country.</p>
            <p>The discredit which is grown upon the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
or Settlements of this Kingdom, by so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and unhappy Revolutions that for many ages
have infested it, has been the great discouragement
to other Nations to transplant themselves hither,
and prevailed further than all the invitations which
the cheapness and plenty of the Country has made
them. So that had it not been for the numbers of
the <hi>British,</hi> which the necessity of the late Wars at
first drew over, and of such who either as Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
or Soldiers seated themselves here upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102555:3"/>
of the satisfaction made to them in Land, the
Country had by the last War and Plague been left in
a manner desolate.</p>
            <p>Besides, the subordinacy of the Government chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
hands so often, makes an unsteddiness in the
pursuit of the publick Interests of the Kingdom, gives
way to the emulations of the different Factions, and
draws the favour or countenance of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sometimes to one party or interest, sometimes
to another; this makes different motions in mens
minds, raising hopes and fears, and opinions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
in their possessions; and thereby in the
peace of the Country.</p>
            <p>This subordinacy in the Government, and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of parties, with the want sometimes of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Governour (by the weakness of his credit
and support at Court) occasions the perpetual agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or journeys into <hi>England</hi> of all persons that have
any considerable pretences in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and money to
pursue them; which end many times in long abodes,
and frequent habituating of Families there, though
they have no money to support them but what is
drawn out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Besides, the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
go of course for their breeding there, some
seek their health, and others their entertainment in
a better Climate or Scene; By these means the
Country loses the expence of many of the richest
persons or families at home, and mighty sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
must needs go over from hence into <hi>England,</hi>
which the great stock of rich native Commodities
here can make the only amends for.</p>
            <p>These Circumstances so prejudicial to the encrease
of Trade and Riches in a Country, seem natural or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102555:3"/>
at least have ever been incident to the Government
here, and without them the native fertility of the
Soil and Seas in so many rich Commodities impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by multitude of People and industry, with the
advantage of so many excellent Havens, and a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
so commodious for all sorts of foreign Trade,
must needs have rendred this Kingdom one of the
richest in <hi>Europe,</hi> and made a mighty encrease both
of strength and revenue to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi>
whereas it has hitherto been rather esteemed and
found to be our weak side, and to have cost us
more blood and treasure than 'tis worth.</p>
            <p>Since my late arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I have found a
very unusual, but I doubt very just complaint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the scarcity of Money, which occasioned
many airy Propositions for the remedy of it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest that of raising some, or all of the
Coyns here. This was chiefly grounded upon the
experience made as they say about the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi>
coming first over hither in 1663, when the
Plate-pieces of Eight were raised three pence in the
piece, and a mighty plenty of money was observed
to grow in <hi>Ireland</hi> for a year or two after. But this
seems to me a very mistaken account, and to have
depended wholly upon other circumstances little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, and not at all upon the raising of the
Money to which it is by some great men attributed.
For first, there was about that time a general peace
and serenity which had newly succeeded a general
trouble and cloud throughout all his Majesties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
then after two years attendance in <hi>England</hi>
upon the settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> (there on the forge)
by all persons and parties here that were consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102555:4"/>
interested in it, the Parliament being called
here, and the main settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> wound up
in <hi>England,</hi> and put into the Duke of <hi>Ormonds</hi> hands
to pass here into an Act; all persons came over in
a shoal either to attend their own concernments in
the main, or more particularly to make their Courte
to the Lord Lieutenant upon whom his Majesty had
at that time in a manner wholly devolved the care
and disposition of all affairs in this Kingdom: This
made a sudden and mighty stop of that issue of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
which had for two years run perpetually out
of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and kept it all at home. Nor
is the very expence of the Duke of <hi>Ormonds</hi> own
great Patrimonial estate with that of several other
Families that came over at that time, of small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
in the stock of this Kingdom. Besides,
there was a great sum of Money in ready Coyn
brought over out of <hi>England</hi> at the same time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the arrears of the Army: Which are all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that must needs have made a mighty change
in the course of ready money here. All the effect
that I conceive was made by crying up the pieces of
Eight, was to bring in much more of that Species in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of others current here (as indeed all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
brought from <hi>England</hi> was of that sort, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of in Parliament to be of a worse allay), and
to carry away much <hi>English</hi> Money in exchange for
Plate-pieces, by which a Trade was driven very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to the Traders, but of mighty loss to the
Kingdom in the intrinsick value of their Money.</p>
            <p>The Circumstances at this time seem to be just
the reverse of what they were then; The Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a War the most fatal to trade of any that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102555:4"/>
could arise; The settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> shaken at the
Court, and falling into new disquisitions (whether
in truth or in common opinion, is all a case): This
draws continual Agencies and Journeys of People
concerned into <hi>England,</hi> to watch the motions of the
main wheel there. Besides, the Lieutenants of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
since the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s time, have had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in their disposition here, and only executed the
resolutions daily taken at Court in particular as well
as general affairs, which has drawn thither the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of all private pretenders. The great Estates
of this Kingdom have been four or five years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
spent in <hi>England.</hi> Money, instead of coming
over hither for pay of the Army, has since the War
began, been transmitted thither for pay of those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that were called from hence. And lastly, This
War has had a more particular and mortal influence
upon the Trade of this Country, than upon any other
of his Majesties Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>For by the Act against Transportation of Cattel
into <hi>England,</hi> the Trade of this Country which run
wholly thither before, was turned very much into
foreign parts; but by this War the last is stopped,
and the other not being open'd, there is in a manner
no vent for any Commodity but of Wool. This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
has forced the Kingdom to go on still with
their foreign Trade, but that has been with such
mighty losses, by the great number of <hi>Dutch</hi> Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
plying about the Coasts, and the want of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Fregats to secure them, that the stock of the
Kingdom must be extreamly diminished. Yet by the
continuance of the same expence and luxury in point
of living, Money goes over into <hi>England</hi> to fetch what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102555:5"/>
must supply it, though little Commodities goes either
there or abroad to make any considerable ballance;
By all which it must happen, that with another years
continuance of the War, there will not be Money left
in this Kingdom to turn the common Markets, or pay
any rents, or leave any circulation further than the
receipts of the Customs and Quit-rents, and the pays
of the Army, which in both kinds must be the last
that fail.</p>
            <p>In such a conjuncture, the crying up of any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of money will but encrease the want of it in
general; for while there goes not out commodity
to ballance that which is brought in, and no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of gains by exportation will make amends for
the venture; what should money come in for, unless
it be to carry out other money as it did before,
and leave the stock that remains equal indeed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
but lower in the intrinsique value than
it was before? In short, while this War lasts, and our
Seas are ill guarded, all that can be done towards
preserving the small remainder of Money in this
Kingdom, is, First, to introduce as far as can be, a
vein of Parsimony throughout the Country in all things
that are not perfectly the native growths and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures:
Then by severity and steediness of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(as far as will be permitted) to keep up in
some credit the present peace and settlement. And
lastly, To force men to a degree of industry, by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
none to hope that they shall be able to live by
rapine or fraud. For in some diseases of a Civil as
well as Natural body, all that can be done is to
fast and to rest, to watch and to prevent accidents, to
trust to methods rather than Medicines or remedies;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102555:5"/>
and with patience to expect till the humours being
spent, and the <hi>Crisis</hi> past, way may be made for
the natural returns of health and of strength.</p>
            <p>This being premised as peculiar either to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in general, or to the present conjuncture;
I shall proceed to such Observations as occur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ways of advancing the common and
standing Trade of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Trade of a Country arises from the native
growths of the Soil, or Seas, the Manufactures, the
commodiousness of Ports, and the store of Shipping
which belong to it. The improvement therefore of
Trade in <hi>Ireland,</hi> must be considered in the survey
of all these Particulars, the defects to which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they are subject, and the encreases they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving either from the course of time,
the change of customs, or the conduct and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government.</p>
            <p>The native Commodities or common easie Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
which make up the Exportation of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and consequently furnish both the stock of
foreign Commodities consumed in the Country, and
that likewise of current Money, by which all Trade
is turned; are Wool, Butter, Beef, Cattel, Fish,
Iron; and by the improvement of these, either in
the quantity, the credit, or the further Manufacture,
the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> seems chiefly to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>In this Survey one thing must be taken notice of
as peculiar to this Country, which is, That as in the
nature of its Government, so in the very improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its Trade and Riches, it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102555:6"/>
not only in its own proper interest, but
likewise in its relation to <hi>England,</hi> to which it is
subordinate, and upon whose weal in the main, that
of this Kingdom depends; and therefore a regard
must be had of those points wherein the Trade of
<hi>Ireland</hi> comes to interfere with any main branches of
the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> in which cases the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such Trade ought to be either declined or
moderated, and so give way to the interest of Trade
in <hi>England,</hi> upon the health and vigor whereof, the
strength, riches, and glory of his Majesties Crowns
seem chiefly to depend. But on the other side, some
such branches of Trade ought not wholly to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
but rather so far admitted as may serve the
general consumption of this Kingdom, left by too
great an importation of Commodities, though out
of <hi>England</hi> it self, the Money of this Kingdom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be drawn away in such a degree as not to
leave a stock sufficient for turning the Trade at
home; the effect hereof would be general discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
among the People, complaints, or at least ill
impressions of the Government, which in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
composed of three several Nations different to
a great degree in Language, Customs, and Religion,
as well as Interest (both of property and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances)
may prove not only dangerous to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but to <hi>England</hi> it self. Since a sore in the leg
may affect the whole body, and in time grow as
difficult a cure as if it were in the head; especially
where humours abound.</p>
            <p>The Wool of <hi>Ireland</hi> seems not to be capable of
any encrease, nor to suffer under any defect, the
Country being generally full stockt with sheep, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102555:6"/>
of Wolves, the Soil little subject to other rotts
than of hunger; and all the considerable flocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>English</hi> breed, and the staple of Wool gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
equal with that of <hi>Northampton</hi> or <hi>Leicester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
the improvement of this Commodity by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
in this Kingdom would give so great a
damp to the Trade of <hi>England</hi> (of which Cloths,
Stuffs, and Stockins, make so mighty a part) that
it seems not fit to be encouraged here, at least no
further than to such a quantity of one or two Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-stuffs,
<hi>Irish</hi>-freeze, and Cloth from Six shillings
to Fourteen, as may supply in some measure the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
consumption of the Kingdom. That which
seems most necessary in this branch is the careful
and severe execution of the Statutes provided to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the Exportation of Wool to any other parts but
to <hi>England,</hi> which is the more to be watched and
feared, since thereby the present Riches of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would be mightily encreased, and great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
might be made by the connivance of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
whereas on the other side this would prove
a most sensible decay, if not destruction of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
both here and in <hi>England</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>Yarn is a Commodity very proper to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but made in no great quantities in any parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the North, nor any where into Linnen to any
great degree, or of sorts fit for the better uses at
home, or exportation abroad; though of all others
this ought most to be encouraged, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
chiefly designed by the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> The
Soil produces Flax kindly and well, and fine too,
answerable to the care used in choice of seed and
exercise of Husbandry; and much Land is fit for it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102555:7"/>
here, which is not so for Corn. The Manufacture
of it in gathering or beating is of little toyl or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
and so the fitter for the Natives of the
Country. Besides, no Women are apter to spin it
well than the <hi>Irish,</hi> who labouring little in any kind
with their hands, have their fingers more supple and
soft than other Women of the poorer condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us. And this may certainly be advanced and
improved into a great Manufacture of Linnen, so as
to beat down the Trade both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
and draw much of the Money which goes from
<hi>England</hi> to those parts upon this occasion into the
hands of his Majesties Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi> without
crossing any interest of Trade in <hi>England.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what has been said of Flax and Spinning, the
Soil and Climate are proper for whitening both by
the frequency of Brooks, and also of Winds in the
Country.</p>
            <p>Much care was spent upon this design in an Act
of Parliament past the last Session, and something
may have been advanced by it; but the too great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
imposed upon the sowing of certain quantities
of Flax, has caused (and perhaps justly) a general
neglect in the execution; and common guilt has
made the penalties impracticable; so as the main ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
has been spoiled by too much diligence, and the
Child killed with kindness. For the Money apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that Act to the encouragement of making
fine Linnen, and broad (which I think is twenty
pounds every year in each County), though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
was good, yet it has not reached the end,
by encouraging any considerable application that
way; so that sometimes one share of that Money is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102555:7"/>
paid to a single pretender at the Sizes, or Sessions,
and sometimes a share is saved for want of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
at all.</p>
            <p>This Trade may be advanced by some amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the last Act in another Session, whereby
the necessity of sowing Flax may be so limited as to
be made easily practicable, and so may be forced
by the severity of levying the penalties Enacted.
And for the Money allotted in the Counties, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ought to carry the first, second or third prize,
without producing two pieces of Linnen of each
sort (whereas one only now is necessary.) And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
defences may be made against weaving any
Linnen under a certain breadth, such as may be of
better use to the poorest People, and in the coarsest
Linnen than the narrow <hi>Irish</hi> Cloth; and may bear
some price abroad when ever more comes to be
made than is consumed at home. But after all these
or such like provisions, there are but two things
which can make any extraordinary advance in this
branch of Trade, and those are: First, An encrease
of People in the Country to such a degree as may
make things necessary to life dear, and thereby
force general industry from each member of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
(Women as well as Men), and in as many
sorts as they can well turn to, which among others
may in time come to run the vein this way. The
second is a particular application in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And this must be made either by some Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
upon his own private account, who has a
great stock that he is content to turn that way, and
is invited by the gains, or else by the honour of
bringing to pass a work of so much publick utility
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102555:8"/>
both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (which circumstances
I suppose concur'd both in the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s
design; and when ever they meet again, can have no
better copy to follow in all particulars) than that
begun at the <hi>Naas</hi> in his time. Or else by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
sum of Money being laid aside either out
of his Majesties present Revenue, or some future
Subsidy to be granted for this occasion: And this
either to be imployed in setting up of some great
Linnen Manufacture in some certain place, and to
be managed by some certain hands both for making
all sorts of fine Clothes, and of those for Sails too.
The benefit or loss of such a Trade accuring to the
Government until it comes to take root in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Or else if this seem too great an undertaking
for the humour of our age, then such a sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to lie ready in hands appointed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
for taking off at common moderate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
all such pieces of Cloth as shall be brought in
by any persons at certain times to the chief Town
of each County; and all such pieces of Cloth as
are fit for Sails, to be carried into the stores of the
Navy. All that are fit for the use of the Army, to
be given the Soldiers (as Clothes are) in part of
their pay: And all finer pieces to be sold, and the
Money still applied to the increase or constant sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of the main stock. The effect hereof would be,
That People finding a certain Market for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
and that of others so uncertain as it is in this
Kingdom, would turn so much of their industry this
way, as would serve to furnish a great part of that
Money which is most absolutely necessary for payment
of Taxes, Rents, or subsistence of Families.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102555:8"/>
Hide, Tallow, Butter, Beef, arise all from one
sort of Cattel, and are subject to the same general
defects, and capable of the same common improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The three first are certain Commodities, and yield
the readiest Money of any that are turned in this
Kingdom, because they never fail of a price abroad.
Beef is a drug, finding no constant vent abroad, and
therefore yielding no rate at home: for the consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kingdom holds no proportion with the
product that is usually made of Cattel in it; so that
in many parts at this time an Ox may be bought in
the Country-markets, and the Hide and Tallow sold
at the next Trading-Town for as much as it cost. The
defects of these Commodities lie either in the age
and feeding of the Cattel that are killed, or in the
Manufacture and making them up for exportation
abroad.</p>
            <p>Until the Transportation of Cattel into <hi>England</hi>
was forbidden by the late Act of Parliament, the
quickest Trade of ready Money here was driven by
the sale of young Bullocks, which for four or five
Summer-months of the year were carried over in
very great numbers, and this made all the breeders
in the Kingdom turn their lands and stocks chiefly
to that sort of Cattel. Few Cows were bred up for
the Dairy, more than served the consumption within;
and few Oxen for draught, which was all performed
by rascally small Horses; so as the Cattel generally
sold either for slaughter within, or Exportation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
were of two, three, or at best four years old,
and those such as had never been either handled or
wintered at hand-meat, but bred wholly upon the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102555:9"/>
Mountains in Summer, and upon the withered long
grass of the lower lands in the Winter. The effect
hereof was very pernicious to this Kingdom in what
concerned all these Commodities: The Hides were
small, thin, and lank: The Tallow much less in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and of quicker consumption. Little Butter was
exported abroad, and that discredited by the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery
of the <hi>Irish</hi> in making it up; most of what
was sent coming from their hands, who alone kept
up the Trade of Dairies, because the breed of their
Cattel was not fit for the <hi>English</hi>-Markets. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, the Trade of Beef for foreign Exportation
was prejudiced and almost sunk, for the flesh being
young, and only grass-fed (and that on a sudden by
the sweetness of the Summers pasture, after the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
being almost starv'd in the Winter) was thin,
light, and moist, and not of a substance to endure
the salt, or be preserved by it, for long Voyages, or
a slow consumption. Besides, either the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or carlesness, or Knavery of the Traders, added
much to the undervalue and discredit of these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
abroad; for the Hides were often made
up very dirty, which increased the weight by which
that Commodity is sold when it comes in quantities
abroad. The Butter would be better on the top and
bottom of the Barrels, than in the middle, which
would be sometimes filled up, or mingled with Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
nay, sometimes with stones. The Beef would
be so ill chosen, or so ill cured, as to stink many times
before it came so far as <hi>Holland,</hi> or at least not prove
a Commodity that would defray the first charge of
the Merchant before it was shipt. Nay, I have known
Merchants there, fain to throw away great quantities
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102555:9"/>
after having layn long in their hands without any
Market at all.</p>
            <p>After the Act in <hi>England</hi> had wholly stopt the
Transportation of Cattel, the Trade of this Kingdom
was forced to find out a new Channel, a great deal
of Land was turned to Sheep, because Wool gave
ready Money for the <hi>English</hi> Markets, and by stealth
for those abroad. The breeders of <hi>English</hi> Cattel turn'd
much to Dairy, or else by keeping their Cattel to
six and seven year old, and wintering them dry,
made them fit for the Beef-trade abroad; and some
of the Merchants fell into care and exactness in
Barrelling them up; and hereby the improvements
of this Trade were grown so sensible in the course
of a few years, that in the year 1669, some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in <hi>Holland</hi> assured me, that they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
parcels of Beef out of <hi>Ireland</hi> which sold cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and very near the <hi>English;</hi> and of Butter
which sold beyond it; and that they had observed
it spent as if it came from the richer soil of the
two. 'Tis most evident that if the <hi>Dutch</hi> War had
not broken out so soon after the improvements of all
these Trades (forced at first by necessity, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards habitual by use) would in a few years
have very much advanced the Trade and Riches of
this Kingdom, and made it a great gainer instead of
losing by the Act against Transportation of their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel:
But the War gave a sudden damp to this and
all other Trade, which is sunk to nothing by the
continuance of it.</p>
            <p>However having marked the defects that were
even in time of peace, it may not be useless to set
down the Remedies, though little practicable while
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102555:10"/>
the War lasts. For that great one of killing Cattel
young, and only grass-fed, I know none so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
as introducing a general custom of using Oxen
for all sorts of draught, which would be perhaps
the greatest improvement that could be made in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kinds throughout the Kingdom. By this means
the great slaughter would be made of full-grown,
large, and well-wintered Cattel, which would dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the income made by Hide, Tallow and Beef, and
raise their credit in all foreign Markets, every man
would be forced to provide Winter-fodder for his
Teem (whereas common Garrans shift upon grass
the year round); and this would force men to the
enclosing of Grounds, and improving bog into Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows;
the race of Garrans would decrease, and so
make room for the Countrys maintaining the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
number of Cattel, which makes a foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
though they die by accident or age, whereas
the other makes none at all.</p>
            <p>No great or useful thing is to be atchieved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulties, and therefore what may be raised
against this Proposal ought not to discourage the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
it. First, the Statutes against that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
custom of Plowing by the tayl, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and upon absolute forfeitures instead of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties;
the constant and easie compositions whereof
have proved rather an allowing than forbidding it.
Now if this were wholly disused, the Harness for
Horses being dearer than for Oxen, the <hi>Irish</hi> would
turn their draught to the last, where-ever they have
hitherto used the Plowing by the Tayl. Next a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
might be made, under which no Horse should
be used for draught; this would not only enlarge
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102555:10"/>
the breed of Horses, but make way for the use of
Oxen, because they would be cheaper kept than large
good Horses, which could not be wintered like
Garrans without housing or fodder. And lastly, a
Tax might be laid upon every Horse of draught
throughout the Kingdom, which besides the main
use here intended, would encrease the Kings Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
by one of the easiest ways that is any where in
use.</p>
            <p>For the miscarriages mentioned in the making up
of those several Commodities for foreign Markets,
they must likewise be remedied by severe Laws, or
else the improvements of the Commodities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
will not serve to bring them in credit, upon
which all Trade turns. First, the Ports out of which
such Commodities shall be shipt, may be restrained
to a certain number, such as lie most convenient for
the vent of the Inland Provinces, and such as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are already or are capable of being made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Corporations. Whatever of them shall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of any other Port, shall be penal both to
the Merchant that delivers, and to the Master that
receives them. In the Ports allowed shall be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
rules agreed on by the skilfullest Merchants in
those Wares, to be observed in the making up of all
such as are intended for foreign Transportation, and
declaring that what is not found agreeable to those
rules shall not be suffered to go out. Two Officers
may be appointed to be chosen every three years
by the body of the Corporation, whose business
shall be to inspect all Barrels of Beef, Tallow, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and all Packs of Hides, and put to them the
seal or mark of the Corporation, without which none
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102555:11"/>
shall be suffer'd to go abroad; Nor shall this mark
be affixed to any parcels by those Officers, but such
as they have viewed and found agreeable to the
rules set forth for that purpose. Whereof one ought
to be certain, That every Barrel be of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
weight, or something over. If this were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for a small course of time, under any certain
marks, the credit of them both as to quality and
weight would rise to that degree, that the Barrels or
Packs would go off in the Markets they used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
upon sight of the mark, like silver-plate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sight of the Cities mark where 'tis made.</p>
            <p>The great difficulty will lie in the good executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Offices; But the interest of such Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
lying so deep in the credit of their mark,
will make emulation among them, every one vying
to raise their own as high as they can; and this will
make them careful in the choice of men fit for that
turn. Besides, the Offices ought to be made beneficial
to a good degree by a certain fee upon every seal;
and yet the Office to be forfeited upon every mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of the Officer, which shall be judged so by
the chief Magistrates of the Town, and thereupon a
new Election be made by the body of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Cattel for Exportation, are Sheep, Bullocks, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and of one or other of these kinds the Country
seems to be full stockt, no ground that I hear of
being untenanted; the two first seem sufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in the kinds as well as the number, most of
both being of the <hi>English</hi> breed. And though it
were better for the Country if the number of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
being lessened made room for that of encreasing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102555:11"/>
Sheep, and great Cattel; yet it seems indifferent
which of these two were most turn'd to, and that
will be regulated by the liberty or restraint of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
live Cattel into <hi>England.</hi> When the passage is
open, Land will be turned most to great Cattel; when
shut, to Sheep, as it is at present, though I am not of
opinion it can last, because that Act seems to have
been carried on rather by the interest of particular
Counties in <hi>England</hi> than by that of the whole,
which in my opinion must be evidently a loser by
it. For first, the fraight of all Cattel that were
brought over being in <hi>English</hi> Vessels, was so much
clear gain to <hi>England,</hi> and this was one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
near a third, or at least a fourth part of the
price. Then their coming over young and very
cheap to the first Market, made them double their
price by one years feeding, which was the greatest
improvement to be made of our dry Pasture-land in
<hi>England.</hi> The Trade of Hides, and Tallow, or else
of Leather, was mightily advanced in <hi>England,</hi> which
will be beaten down in foreign Markets by <hi>Ireland,</hi>
if they come to kill all their Cattel at home. The
young <hi>Irish</hi> Cattel served for the common consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>England,</hi> while their own large old fat Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
went into the Barrel for the foreign Trade, in
which <hi>Irish</hi> Beef had in a manner no part, though
by the continuance of this restraint it will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon improvement, and come to share with
<hi>England</hi> in the Beef-Trade abroad. Grounds were
turned much in <hi>England</hi> from breeding, either to fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or Dairy, and this advanced the Trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Butter, which will be extreamly beaten down
when <hi>Ireland</hi> turns to it too (and in the way of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102555:12"/>
               <hi>English</hi> Huswifry, as it has done a great deal since the
restraint upon Cattle.) And lastly, whereas <hi>Ireland</hi>
had before very little Trade but with <hi>England,</hi> and
with the Money for their Cattel bought all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
there which they wanted: By this restraint
they are forced to seek a foreign Market, and where
they sell, they will be sure to buy too; and all the foreign
Merchandize which they had before from <hi>Bristow,
Chester,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> they will have in time from
<hi>Roan, Amsterdam, Lisbon,</hi> and the <hi>Streights.</hi> As for
the true causes of the decay of Rents in <hi>England,</hi>
which made the occasion of that Act, they were to
be found in the want of People, in the mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of foreign Commodities among the better
sort, and in a higher way of living among all, and
not in this Transportation of <hi>Irish</hi> Cattel, which
would have been complained of in former times if
it had been found a prejudice to <hi>England.</hi> Besides,
the Rents have been far from encreasing since; and
though that may be by other accidents, yet as to
what concerns <hi>Ireland,</hi> it comes all to one, unless
Wool be forbidden as well as Cattel; for the less
Cattel comes over from thence, there comes the
more Wool, which goes as far as t'other towards
beating down the price of Pasture-lands in <hi>England,</hi>
and yet the Transportation of Wool cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
since that would force the <hi>Irish</hi> Wool either
by stealth into foreign Markets, or else in Cloth by
the advance of that Manufacture; either of which
would bring a sudden decay upon the principal
branch of the <hi>English</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>Horses in <hi>Ireland</hi> are a drug, but might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to a Commodity, not only of greater use at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102555:12"/>
home, but also fit for Exportation into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys.
The Soil is of a sweet and plentiful grass, which
will raise a large breed; and the Hills, especially near
the Sea-coasts, are hard and rough, and so fit to give
them shape and breath, and sound feet. The present
defects in them are breeding without choice of Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
either in shape or size, and trusting so far to
the gentleness of the Climate as to winter them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
without ever handling Colts till they are
four year old: This both checks the growth of
the common breeds, and gives them an incurable
shyness, which is the general vice of <hi>Irish</hi> Horses,
and is hardly ever seen in <hi>Flanders,</hi> because the
hardness of the Winters in those parts forces the
breeders there to house and handle their Colts for
at least six months every year. In the Studds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of quality in <hi>Ireland</hi> where care is taken, and
cost is not spared, we see Horses bred of excellent
shape and vigor, and size, so as to reach great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at home, and encourage strangers to find the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
here; among whom I met with one this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that came over on that errand, and bought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty Horses to carry over into the <hi>French</hi>
Army from twenty to threescore pounds price at the
first hand.</p>
            <p>The improvement of Horses here may be made
by a standard prescribed to all Stallions, and all
Horses that shall be used for draught, the main point
being to make the common breed large, for then
whether they have shape or no, they have ever some
reasonable price both at home and abroad. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
being not to be raised without wintering, they
will help to force men into improvement of Land
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102555:13"/>
by a necessity of fodder. But for encouragement of
finer breed, and in the better hands, some other
institutions may be invented by which emulation
may be raised among the Breeders by a prospect
both of particular honour and profit to those who
succeed best, and of good ordinary gains and ready
vent to such as by aiming at the best though they
fail, yet go beyond the common sorts. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there may be set up both a Horse-Fair, and
Races to be held at a certain time every year for
the space of a week; the first in the fairest Green
near the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the latter in that place
designed by your Lordship in the Park for some
such purpose. During this Week, the Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, may be the Races; the
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, the Fairs may be
held. At each Race may be two Plates given by
the King, one of thirty pounds, and the other of
twenty (besides the fashion,) as the Prizes for the
first and second Horse; the first Engraven with a
Horse Crowned with a Crown; the second with a
Coronet, and under it the day of the Month, and
the Year. Besides these Plates, the Wagers may be
as the persons please among themselves, but the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
must be evidenced by good Testimonies to have
been bred in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For honour, the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
may ever be present himself, or at least name
a Deputy in his room, and two Judges of the field,
who shall decide all Controversies, and with sound
of Trumpet declare the two Victors. The Masters
of these two Horses may be admitted to ride from
the Field to the Castle with the Lord Lieutenant,
or his Deputy, and to dine with him that day, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102555:13"/>
there receive all the honour of the Table. This to
be done, what quality soever the persons are of; for
the lower that is, the more will be the honour; and
perhaps the more the sport: and the encouragement
of breeding will by that means extend to all sorts
of men.</p>
            <p>For the Fairs, the Lord Lieutenant may likewise
be present every day in the heighth of them, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
or Deputy, and may with the advice of the two
chief Officers of the Army then present, chuse out one
of the best Horses, and two of the best Geldings that
appear in the Fair, not under four, nor above seven
years old. For which shall be paid to the owners of
them, after sufficient Testimony of their being bred in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> One hundred pounds for the Horse, and Fifty
pounds a piece for the Geldings. These Sums, as that
for the Plates, to issue out of the Revenue of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and without trouble or fee; and the three Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be sent over every year to the Kings Stables.
Both those that won the Plate, and those which are
thus fold ought immediately to be marked so as they
may never return a second time, either to the Race
or to the Sale.</p>
            <p>The benefit by such an institution as this, will be
very great and various: For besides the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to breed the best Horses, from the honour and
gain already mentioned; there will be a sort of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
entertainment for one whole week, during which
the Lord Lieutenant, the Lord Mayor of the City, and
the great Officers both Civil and Military, ought to
keep open Tables for all strangers. This will draw
a confluence of People from all parts of the Country.
Many perhaps from the nearer parts of <hi>England</hi> may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102555:14"/>
come, not only as to a publick kind of solemnity,
but as to a great Mart of the best Horses. This will
enrich the City by the expence of such a Concourse,
and the Country by the Sale of many Horses into
<hi>England,</hi> and in time (or from thence) into foreign
parts. This will make general acquaintances among
the Gentry of the Kingdom, and bring the Lord
Lieutenant to be more personally known, and more
honoured by his appearing in more greatness, and with
more solemnity than usual upon these occasions. And
all this with expence only of Three hundred and fifty
pounds a year to the Crown, for which the King shall
have three the best Horses bred that year in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fishing of <hi>Ireland</hi> might prove a Mine under
water, as rich as any under ground, if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to those vast advantages it is capable of, and
that we see it raised to in other Countrys. But this is
impossible under so great a want of People, and
cheapness of all things necessary to life throughout
the Country, which are in all places invincible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of industry and improvements. While these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
I know no way of advancing this Trade to any
considerable degree, unless it be the erecting four
Companies of Fishery, one in each Province of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
into which every man that enters shall bring
a certain Capital, and receive a proportionable share
of the gain or loss, and have a proportional voice in
the Election of a President and Council, by whom the
whole business in each Province shall be managed. If
into each of these Companies the King or Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
would enter for a considerable share at the
first, towards building such a number of Boats and
Busses as each Company could easily manage, it would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102555:14"/>
be an encouragement both of honour and advantage.
Certain Priviledges likewise, or Immunities, might be
granted from charges of trouble or expence, nay
from Taxes, and all unusual payments to the publick,
in favour of such as brought in a proportion to a
certain heighth into the stock of the Fishery. Nay,
it seems a matter of so great importance to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Crowns, both as to the improving the Riches
of this Kingdom, and impairing the mighty gains of
his Neighbours by this Trade; that perhaps there
were no hurt if an Act were made, by which none
should be capable of being either chosen into a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or the Commission of the Peace, who had not
manifested his desires of advancing the publick good
by entring in some certain proportion into the stock
and Companies of the Fishery, since the greatness of
one, and application of the other, seem the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
means of improving so rich and so important a
Trade. It will afterwards be the business of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
themselves, or their directors, to fall into the
best methods and rules for the curing and barrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up all their Fish, and to see them so exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
as may bring all those quantities of them that
shall be sent abroad, or spent at home, into the
highest and most general credit; which with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Seasons, all that can be so as to find the
first foreign Markets, will be a way to the greatest
and surest gains. In <hi>Holland</hi> there have been above
thirty Placaerts or Acts of State concerning the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
salting, and barrelling of Herrings alone, with
such severity in the Imposition and execution of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
that the business is now grown to an habitual
skill, and care, and honesty, so as hardly any example
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102555:15"/>
is seen of failing in that matter, or thereby impairing
the general credit of that Commodity among them,
or in the foreign Markets they use.</p>
            <p>Iron seems to me the Manufacture that of all others
ought the least to be encouraged in <hi>Ireland;</hi> or if it
be, which requires the most restriction to certain
places and rules. For I do not remember to have heard
that there is any Oare in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at least I am sure
the greatest part is fetched from <hi>England;</hi> so that
all this Country affords of its own growth towards
this Manufacture, is but the Wood, which has met
but with too great consumptions already, in most
parts of this Kingdom, and needs not this to destroy
what is left. So that Iron-works ought to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to certain places, where either the Woods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
vast, and make the Country savage, or where
they are not at all fit for Timber, or likely to grow
to it, or where there is no conveyance for Timber to
places of vent so as to quit the cost of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>Having run through the Commodities of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
with their defects and improvements, I will only
touch the other two Points mentioned at first, as
the grounds likewise of Trade in a Country; those are
the Commodiousness of Ports, and the store of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
in one of which this Kingdom as much abounds,
as it fails in the other. The Haven of <hi>Dublin</hi> is barr'd
to that degree, as very much to obstruct the Trade of
the City; the clearing or opening of it were a great
work, and proper either for the City, or the whole
Province of <hi>Lemster</hi> to undertake. But whether it be
feasible, or at such charges as will quit cost, I will not
judg, especially considering the many good Havens
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102555:15"/>
that are scattered upon that whole Eastern Coast of
<hi>Ireland.</hi> Besides this, I know not what to propose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this head, unless it be the making of two free
Ports, one in <hi>Kerry,</hi> and t'other upon the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
Coast, which may thereby grow to be Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
for the <hi>West-Indy</hi> Trade, and from thence
those Commodities may be dispersed into all other
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> after having paid the Customs which
they ought to pay in <hi>England,</hi> where this must be
concerted.</p>
            <p>For the last Point, I doubt there is hardly any other
Country lying upon the Sea-coast, and not wholly out
of the way of Trade, which has so little Shipping of
its own as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and which might be capable of
imploying more. The reason of this must be in part
the scarcity of Timber proper for this built; but
more, the want of Merchants, and uncertainty of
Trade in the Country. For preventing the further
destruction of Timber, a Law may be made, forbidding
any man to cut down any Oak that is of a certain
heighth, unless it be of a certain scantling, as twelve
inches diameter, or some such measure as usually
makes a Tree useful Timber. And further, the severest
Penalties ought to be put upon Barking any Tree
that is not felled; a custom barbarous and peculiar to
this Country, and by which infinite quantities of
Timber have been destroyed.</p>
            <p>All Traders in these parts, at least of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are
but Factors; nor do I hear of any number of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in the Kingdom. The cause of this must be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an ill opinion of security, than of gain; for those
are the two baits which draw Merchants to a place:
the last intices the poorer Traders, or the young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102555:16"/>
or those of passage; but without the first, the
substantial and the rich will never settle in a Country.
This opinion can be attained only by a course of time,
of good conduct, and good government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
of justice, and of peace, which lye out of the
compass of this Discourse. But to make some amends
for this want at present, encouragement may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any Merchants that shall come over and turn
a certain stock of their own here, as Naturallizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon any terms; Freedom from Customs the two
first years, and from any Offices of trouble or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the first seven years. I see no hurt if the
King should give leave to the Merchants in eight or
ten of the chief Trading Ports of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to name
for each Town one of their number, out of which the
Lord Lieutenant should chuse two to be of the Privy
Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a certain Salary from the
King to defray their attendance: This would be an
honour and encouragement to so worthy a Calling,
and would introduce an interest of Trade into the
Council, which being now composed wholly of the
Nobility or Gentry, the Civil or Military Officers;
the Traders seem to be lest without Patrons in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and thereby without favour to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
concernments of a chief member in the Politick
body; and upon whose prospering, the wealth of the
whole Kingdom seems chiefly to depend.</p>
            <p>But this is enough for your Excellencies trouble,
and for the discharge of my promise, and too much I
doubt for the humour of our age to bring into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
or so much as to admit into consideration. Your
Lordship I know has generous thoughts, and turned
to such disinteressed Speculations as these, and a mind
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102555:16"/>
framed for the exercise of those Virtues which can
most advance the publick Weal of the Country where
your Station is. But that is not enough towards the
raising such buildings as I have drawn you here the
lines of, unless the direction of all affairs here were
wholly in your hands, or at least the opinion lost of
other mens being able to contest with you those
points of publick utility which you ought best to
know and most to be believ'd in, while you deserve
or discharge so great a trust as the Government of
this Kingdom. For I think a Prince cannot too much
consider whom to chuse for such imployments; but
when he has chosen, cannot trust them too far, or
thereby give them too much Authority; no more
than end it too soon, when ever he finds it abused.
In short, 'tis left only to Princes to mend the World,
whose Commands find general obedience; and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
imitation. For all other men, they must take it
as they find it; and good men enter into commerce
with it, rather upon cautions of not being spoiled
themselves, than upon hopes of mending the World.
At least, this opinion becomes men of my level,
amongst whom I have observed all set quarrels with
the age, and pretences of reforming it by their own
models, to end commonly like the pains of a man in a
little Boat, who tugs at a rope that's fast to a Ship,
it looks as if he resolved to draw the Ship to him,
but the truth and his meaning is, to draw himself to
the Ship, where he gets in when he can, and does
like the rest of the Crew when he is there. When I
have such designs, I will begin such contentions; in
the mean time the bent of my thoughts shall be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to mend my self than the World, which I reckon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102555:17"/>
upon leaving much what I found it. Nor should I
have reason in complaining too far of an age, which
does your Lordship so much justice by the honour
of so great an Imployment, and so universal an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem;
In both which, as I know no man deserves
greater successes and encreases than you do, so I am
sure no man wishes you greater than I do.</p>
