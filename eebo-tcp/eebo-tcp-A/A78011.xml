            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now all unrighteouſneſs, lying and partiality is diabolical, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-chriſtian, and a tranſgreſſion both of the law of God, and man: for if ye fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf: But if you have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, and are convinced of the Law as tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.8.9.</p>
            <p>Now when the Lawyers, (for the Law which is good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable to all without reſpect of perſons, rendering to every one their due) ſhall delude the Courts by falſe ſuggeſtions, not render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe right in their motions, on purpoſe to take advantage againſt the other party, by informing the Judges in Court with a lye; by which means both Juſtice and Law is perverted, and the Judges abuſed, who are ſworn to do true judgment when they come to their places; according as God commanded <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 16. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Judges and Officers ſhall thou make thee, &amp;c. and they ſhall judg the people with righteous judgment.</hi>

But I am afraid, they being ſet ſo high, have followed that corrupt Aſſembly lately called a Parliament ſo cloſe at the heels, that if they ſtep not ſpeedily backward by repentance, they having made crooked paths as well as the Parliament: ſo that they have no conſcience, no equity in their doings, as you may read in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

            <p>Wherefore Judges and Lawyers, be adviſed by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chapter 7. truſt not in lying words, but amend and redreſs your wayes; and your works, and execute judgement between a man and his neighbour; left you alſo and your complices be compared as they were of old, to a den of Thieves, and are ſuddenly diſſolved as the Parliament was: For as <hi>David</hi> faith, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>94. <hi>Hath the throne of iniquity fellowſhip with thoſe which forgeth wrong for a Law, or frameth miſchiefe for a Law, and gather themſelves againſt the ſoul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent?

            <p>Now you cannot be ignorant being Lawyers, and in place, that juſtice is a conſtant and perpetual will of rendering unto every one their due, and that the knowledge of the Law is both divine and humane, and a ſcience diſtinguiſhing what is juſt, what unjuſt and the precepts of the Law teacheth to live honeſtly, to do no injury to any one, and to render every one their due.

That Lawyers, called Secular Judges, proceeded from Romiſh Clergie-men, yea all Lawyers were anciently of the Clergie; no Clerk but he was a Lawyer, faith <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> in <hi>William</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's time; they were the firſt Lawyers in <hi>England,</hi> or amongſt them, for time and for their knowledge and manners ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome of them being then Councellors to Abbots, had ſhaven crowns, were Arch-deacons; and moſt of the Lawyers then held Church-livings.</p>
            <p>Now, my brethren, ye may ſee how Tythes (the great Robbery) hath come to be maintained. And a Monk in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time is called the Kings ſpecial Counſellor and Clerk, faith the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, as much as the Atturney-General ſince.</p>
            <p>But I admire how <hi>Edmund Prideaux,</hi> formerly the great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118446:13"/>
convoyer, to rook the people of 6 d. in the ſhilling, as their quarrelling printed Papers make it appear, doth call himſelf Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General, and comes to the Bar, and moveth as Atturney-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for the people, and yet ſtands charged with Articles of High Treaſon, and hath done above a yeer, which is filed in the Capital Office againſt him, and others, for acting traitorouſly againſt the Commonwealths peace, which is the peace of the people, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Engliſh Law, and that he is not by the people called to the Bar to be convicted thereof as our enemy, and ought to be, or elſe by Law acquitted, and his complices: for as M. <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the late Kings tryal, <hi>That mercy to the wicked is cruelty to the good,</hi> and he was a Counſellor of <hi>Grays-Inne,</hi> employed by the State, which could not be unknown to M. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> but ſince gone for <hi>Ireland.</hi> But fellow-ſouldiers, as you have promiſed us in your Letter, and in the Declarations, you muſt help us againſt theſe deſtroyers of us and ours, and you alſo, if they can. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (by the conſent of moſt) were voted out, for that they were Antichriſtian, and alſo deſtructive to the Engliſh Liberty, peace, utility, and freedom, and all their Pontifical Robes, Orders, and Garbs: yet ſee, the Secular Judges wear the ancient habit of the Eccleſiaſticks, becauſe firſt it was uſed by the Eccleſiaſticks, who have been Clerks, Juſtices, Keepers of the Great Seal, Wardens of the Kingdom, Treaſurers of <hi>England,</hi> Maſters of the Rolls, yea Juſtices of <hi>Eyre</hi> and of Aſſize; yea ſome of theſe, as <hi>Hugh</hi> of <hi>Paſhtul</hi> Clerk, made Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee Popiſh Tythes, and Popiſh Holy-days, and Popiſh Habits or Veſtures ſtill maintained in all Courts, in ſight of the Scotiſh Banners, where you may finde Popiſh Antichriſtian cuſtoms and manners. The Clerks who ſuch Writs dictate, write, ſigne, and give counſel, they were reſtrained by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth his Decretals to aſſume Church-dignities: ſince then the multitude of Clerks ran to the hearing of the Secular Laws. Hence it is that the ancient Habit of the Secular Judges was the ſame (and yet is) with that of the Eccleſiaſticks; as <hi>Francis White,</hi> who printed a book for the ſacred Law of the Land, expreſſeth, in the 291, 292, 293. for which he cites D. <hi>Wats gloſſ. ad Pariſ.</hi> faith <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Buſſey,</hi> Seneſchal and chief Councellor to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Valentia,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118446:14"/>
would have looſed (ſays the ſame Monk, meaning <hi>John Manſel,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time) the ſtays of his Coyf to ſhew his Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tonſure, his ſhaven crown.</p>
            <p>Therefore as in <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s time when the Law of truth was found in the Prieſts mouth, and no iniquity in his lips, in peace and equity he walked to God, and turned many from iniquity; but ſince went out of the way, and cauſed many to fall by the Law, and kept not Gods ways, but became partial in the Law; therefore God made them to be deſpiſed and vile before all the people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6,7,8,9. ſince the Prieſts lips ſhould have preſerved knowledge. And hath not our Clergy (in our remembrance) been in as great places, and honour, and have come to be deſpiſed, for being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and cauſing many to fall by the Law; and are they not gone and deſpiſed, and ſince that the King gone and deſpiſed for being partial in the Law? and cauſing many to fall by the ſword, whom the Law would have preſerved? And ſince is not the Parliament not onely purged but diſſolved? for that if ever any had known the Law, or if ever any walked in the truth before God in peace and equity, they ſhould, and not corruptly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially gone contrary to truth, peace, and law, and equity; and by their evil example encouraged others ſo to do, to provoke <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> miſery, and cauſe themſelves to become deſpiſed and vile in the eyes of all the people, and their fellow Committee-men and their Children to be deſpiſed; which they have and will finde, as ſure as we have ſeen the Scripture mentioned fulfilled. Wherefore <hi>London,</hi> let the propheſie of <hi>Ninevehs</hi> fall or ruine be thy warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Nahum.</hi>3.1,9. <hi>Wo to the bloody City, which is full of lies and Robery</hi>; and know, as Solomon faith, <hi>Prov.</hi>21.3,7. <hi>To do juſtice and judgement is more acceptable to the Lord then ſacrifice, and that the robbery of the wicked ſhall deſtroy them; for that they have refuſed to execute judgement.</hi> And all you corporated Companies, know that you are exhorted to accept of this warning, as you are Citizens concerned with your Maſters and Officers, left you come alſo to be diſſolved and deſpiſed; but eſpecially you of the Sadlers, who have been ſought by Petitions and Letters for peace ſake, but made ſtiffe your necks againſt it; take you among the reſt notice, that this Babylon of covetouſneſs,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118446:14"/>
oppreſſion, defraude, and partiality, and hypocriſie is not falling, but fallen, for becauſe of the multitude of the fornications, of the harlots as the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> expreſſeth it, who is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and a miſtreſs of witchcraft, and ſelleth the people through her whoredoms, and the Nations through her witchcrafts, which <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. to the 19 verſe, may fitly be applied, cried by the Angel: <hi>And he cried out mightily, ſaying, It is fallen, it is fallen. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon that great city, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of all ſoul ſpirits, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication with her; and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich of the abundance of her pleaſures. And the kings of the earth ſhall bewail her, and lament for her, which have committed fornication, and lived in pleaſure with her, when they ſhall ſee the ſmoke of that her burning; and ſhall ſtand afar off, for fear of her torments, ſaying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city: for in one hour is thy judgement come. And the merchants of the earth ſhall weep and wail over her: for no man buyeth their ware any more. The merchants of theſe things which were waxed rich, ſhall ſtand afar from her, for fear of her torment, weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaying, Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, and purple and ſcarlet and gilded with gold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, and pearls. And every ſhip-maſter, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that occupie ſhips, and ſhip-men, &amp; whoſoever traffick on the ſea, when they ſee the ſmoke of that her burning, ſhall ſay, What city was like unto this great city! And ſhall caſt duſt on their heads, and cry, weeping and wailing, and ſay, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ſhips on the ſea, by her coſtlineſs: for in one hour is ſhe made deſolate. Who is wife, and he ſhall underſtand theſe things; prudent, and he ſhall know them; as was ſaid concerning the deſtruction of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> Hoſ. 14,10. for, <hi>the ways of the Lord are righteous, and the juſt ſhall walk in them; but the wicked ſhall fall therein.</hi> And ſince you Secular Judges retain not only the Habit of that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh Strumpet, but much of her Popiſh impudence of cuſtoms and manners; I will choſe up this appeal, &amp; proteſt againſt Anichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Babyloniſh Eccleſiaſtick brats &amp; merchants of <hi>England,</hi> who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118446:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are rich made through the abundance of her delicacies, and that are clothed in fine linen and purple, and ſcarlet, and decked with gold, precious ſtones, and pearls, with <hi>Pſal,</hi>2. <hi>Let not the heathen rage, or the people murmure: Be wiſe now therefore, ye kings; be learned, ye judges of the earth; ſerve the Lord in fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in trembling.

               <p>SHould I have further ſtirred in this puddle of iniquity, and have ſet downe the partial report made for <hi>Hurſt</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> and the Affidavit recorded by <hi>Edw.
