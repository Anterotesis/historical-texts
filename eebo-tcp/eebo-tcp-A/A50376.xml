            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THat what <hi>Salemon</hi> ſaid to the young man may be ſpoke to you, that though you abound with this worlds good and have your hearts deſire, through the expence of our Blood, and the Treaſure we lent you on the <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> which ſo long you have detained from us (to the breach of many a promiſe extant to the World) that above five years time, fruitleſs to many of your Petitioners, they have ſpent in ſeeking thereafter, while ſome of your Creditors have been ſtarved to death, and many more like to be; yet you ſay, Go your ways home, and tarry a while, <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 27. 28.</note> when it is in the power of your hands to help them; as the giving of great gifts to perſons of ability, and dividing large porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Commonwealths</hi> Treaſure among your ſelves will witneſs; ſurely this anſwers not the Truſt repoſed in you, or your many vowes to God in your low condition; therefore how may the love of God be ſaid to dwell in you <note n="b" place="margin">1<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 17</note> that thus ſhut up your bowells of compaſſion from your needy Brethren? Did God exalt you to ſeek great things for your Selves, or to do Juſtice and Judgment? For when the Judgments of the Lord are abroad in the earth <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 9.</note> ſhall not the Inhabitants of the world learn Righteouſneſs? Yet what ſpeaks your actions leſs then who is the Lord <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exo.</hi> 5. 2.</note> that we ſhould obey him? Hath he not looked for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but behold Oppreſſion, <note n="e" place="margin">

Therefore ſhall many houſes be deſolate, even great and faire, without inhabitants. O read the five firſt verſes of the fifth of <hi>James</hi> and tremble; ſurely for theſe things among others you muſt come to Judgment.</p>
            <p>Parted we from our Money and our Relations, to indure heats and colds, &amp;c. that you and our bloody minded Enemies; and thoſe many Newters among us might be Free-men and advanced; and our ſelves (for requitall) live in Slavery; You and they live in Honor and Plenty, we in Reproach and Penury; you and they to feed deliciouſly, us and ours die with hunger? So that it is time to ceaſe from Man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils; <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 12. 22.</note> for wherin is he to be accompted of, who hath loſt ſo many opportunities of relieving the oppreſſed, that they fear God will never honor you with ſo great a work of Juſtice, but will do by you as by them of <hi>Sodem,</hi> for not ſtrengthening of the hand of the poor and needy <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. 50.</note> but carried themſelves haughty, &amp;c. the Lord took them away as he ſaw good, for before deſtruction <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 12.</note> the heart of Man is haughty. Now to conclude, if by your tedious delayes you break your Petitioners hearts, and they in ſorrow go down to the Grave, know, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their Blood at your hands. Oh conſider what the unrighteous Judge did <note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 4, 5.</note> upon importunity, for we come not as Beggers to ſeek Yours, that we ſhould be thus put off, but as Creditors to you that are Stewards, that ſhould pay us our due, and take away that reproach which lyeth on the Publique Faith. If after all this you will not hear, but ſtop your ears at the cry of the poor <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 13.</note> you alſo ſhall cry and not be heard, and the Lord will ſpoyle your Souls <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 23.</note> that ſpoyle the poor. Now if the Lord ſhall lay you aſide as uſeleſs veſſells, we are aſſured he is able to raiſe us up helpers ſome other way.</p>
