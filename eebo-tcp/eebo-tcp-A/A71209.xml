            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yeares he hath already continued by <hi>Nauclerus,</hi>
and the Magdeburg Centurists: then <hi>Constans</hi>
the Emperour gave to Pope <hi>Vitalian, Imperium

persecution of all the former, because the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
are incorporated into a body, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
force is stronger. The reason of my large
Preface is this, because my Text falls under the
second persecution: for <hi>Festus</hi> was Deputy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
bloudy <hi>Nero,</hi> who wished that Rome had
onely one head, that hee might cut it off at one
blow, who clothed Christians in beasts skins, and

truth: <hi>But when we speake for peace, they are for

them? they are Mesech and Kedar.</p>
            <p>To the third he confesseth, that <hi>according to
the way that they call Heresie, so he worshipped the
God of his Fathers:</hi> Here we learne three things,
Faith, Hope, and Charity.</p>
            <p>1. Faith, to beleeve the Law and Prophets
as he did, <hi>to worship the God of our Fathers,</hi> not
new Gods, and in a new way; enquire for the
old way and walke therin, that is, the way of the
Law, not in the way of our Fathers, against the
Law, Prophets and Apostles before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<hi>To the Law and the Testimony, if they
walke not by this rule there is no light in them, with
the heart man beleeveth, and with the tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is made to salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Wee learne Hope, for if we beleeve wee
shall have hope towards God, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15. no
hope in our selves, but in him.</p>
            <p>3. Wee learne Charity, the third Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
vertue, v. 16. <hi>for this cause I labour,</hi> this is
the labour of love, love to all, as in <hi>Rom. 13. 8.
Owe nothing to any man but love,</hi> pay to every
man his due, <hi>Custome to whom custome, tribute to
whom tribute, feare to whom feare, honour to whom
honour;</hi> custome is ordinary, tribute extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
both due to the Roman Caesars, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Christians, <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54778:7"/>
in their Apologetikes prove this duty
from thence, and that Tribute they payed, was
imployed for the eradication of the Christians,
but they suffered, and the blood of Martyrs was
the seed of the Church, the armes whereof were
prayers and teares, so then <hi>feare God, and honour
the King, and meddle not with them that are given
to change;</hi> Againe, love worketh no ill, shall I
say that he who kills and robbs his brother loves
him? seeing love fulfills the law, and if a man
<hi>have this worlds good, and see his brother in want,
and shut up his bowels of compassion, how dwells the
love of God in that man?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah. 6.</note> Three things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a man, 1. <hi>to doe justly, 2. to love mercy,
3. and to walke humbly with God,</hi> Love is above all,
above Tongues, faith of Miracles, Prophecy,
Knowledge, Almes, Burning, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 1, 2.
It beareth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
things;</hi> embrace this charity with peace, and
the peace of God be with you.</p>
            <p>To the fourth he answereth and denyeth, that
he was a prophaner of the Temple, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
it by raising a tumult in it, as is shewed
before, a thing abhorred of Heathens, I read in
<hi>Herodotus,</hi> that certaine profane Atheists robbed

Now I proceed to shew how Antichrist is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
in every particular, and his persecution
worse then the Pagans, out of three prophecyes
of <hi>Dan. 7. 25. he shall speake words on the side
of the most high,</hi> this I take for granted, by the
best expositors, that it is meant literally of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi>
mystically of Antichrist, that is, <hi>pro &amp;

his beginning, but hath eyes and pollicy, and
a mouth, speaking great things, <hi>he shall weare out

enemies he hath, &amp;c. The Romane deputy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
appeale to Caesar,<note place="margin">In utroque jure sunt tituli de appellatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</note> but the Conclave and
their adherents deny all appeales, and trample
upon Princes, and depose Kings upon suspition
of another Religion: The Romans after a small
time called the Apostle to his answer, and not
before ignoble, but honourable persons; but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists

them by meane persons, of no birth, education,
or religion: The Romans thought it reasonable
to signifie the crimes, but these imprison with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any crime, except bare affirmation without

crimes forenamed</hi> against Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> but he saith,

            <p>Thus I have done with the first thing imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>Secondly, his humanity, <hi>In sending a Prisoner,</hi>

teaching with all liberty, no man forbidding him;</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, observe the justice of the Romans,
<hi>Acts 25. 16. It was not the manner of the Romans to

defence, but he must answer <hi>Oretenus &amp; ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi>
according to their <hi>ex temporary</hi> prayers and

stood much for the Liberty of the Subject, <hi>Acts

               <hi>Juliopolis,</hi> howsoever

by violence, and himselfe imprisoned,
where is the Roman Liberty? Pagans shall rise
up in judgment against Antichristians: Yet
more, the Romans rescued from violence such
as were Freemen, <hi>Acts 23. 10. The chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, they opposed all private ordinances,
and inventions of men, therefore <hi>Festus</hi> saith of
<hi>Paul, his accusers stood up against him,</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Syr.</note>

            <p>Now briefly I come to the other three which
are to be avoyded. First, Popularity. Secondly,
Bribery. Thirdly, Obloquy.</p>
            <p>1. Popularity, <hi>Acts 25. 2. Festus would
doe the Iews a pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Felix Acts 24. 27. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would doe the Iewes a pleasure he left</hi> Paul
<hi>bound,</hi> but this popular Aire is but a staffe of
reed bruised, and shaken with the winde, <hi>Gaius
Marius,</hi> who was seven times Consul, and the
third<note n="u" place="margin">Nobilium turba, Quiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Odi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanum vulgus &amp; atceo. Malignum spernere vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus. Horat. <gap reason="foreign">

so <hi>Coriolanus</hi> and <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> that wonne
his name<note n="x" place="margin">Ejus qui domita nomen ab Africa, Lucratus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diit. Incendia Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piae. Rejectaeque retrorsum Hannibalis minae.</note> from the subduing of <hi>Afrike,</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

had marble inscriptions to his honour, yet loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the popular respect, was banished for ever,
<hi>de repetundis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people almost in one breath cryed <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna,</hi>
and crucify him:<note n="*" place="margin">Syr. Inscriproque notis marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra publicis.</note> 
               <hi>Herod Agrippa, Acts
12. 2. Killed Iames, and because it pleased the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people
imprisoned Peter,</hi> under the custody of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54778:10"/>

cryed, The voice of a God not of a man, and
he became wormes meat. How can you please
God that seek honour one of another?</p>
            <p>The second blemish in the Roman is bribery,
not expressed in the text, but implyed, <hi>he desired
to doe the Iewes a pleasure,</hi> it was hot for nothing.
And of <hi>Felix</hi> his predecessour it is said, <hi>he hoped
that money should have been given to him,</hi> by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 24. 26. The Romans were covetous, &amp;
therefore bitter was the <hi>Sarcasme</hi> of <hi>Methridate</hi>
upon them, that the Founders of Rome, <hi>Romulus</hi>
and <hi>Remus,</hi> were nursed by<note n="z" place="margin">Some say <hi>Lupa</hi> was a Woman.</note> a hungry wolfe,
and therefore the posterity were so greedy of
wealth, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, he not<note n="a" place="margin">Non solum spcrabat, sed clam tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note> onely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
but privately dealt for bribes.</p>
            <p>The third fault in this Romane was obloquy,
<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 24.<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Oecumen.</note> out of wrath and fury, when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Paul</hi> made his Apology, <hi>Festus</hi> exclaimed, <hi>Thou
art mad, much learning hath made thee mad;</hi> so the
limbes of Antichrist, <hi>Ieroboams,</hi> and <hi>Micah's</hi>
Priests, cry out, of learned men that they are
mad, because themselves cannot understand
them: If they be mad, it is for Christ; and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
oft times makes a wise man mad: but indeed
<hi>they are not mad, but speak forth the words of truth
and sobernesse,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 2 Tim. 1.</note> They have not the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
or feare, but of a sound mind.</p>
            <p>Let us eschew bribery, popularity, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquv,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54778:11"/>
loquy, for who shall dwell in Gods Tabernacle?
First, <hi>He that backbitoth not with his tongue,</hi> that
makes not his tongue,<note n="z" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> his foot to trample the
reputation of his neighbour in the mire. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>In whose eyes a vile person is contemned,</hi>
therefore he is no man-pleaser. Thirdly, <hi>That
takes no reward against the Innocent,</hi> yea saith
<hi>Solomo Jarchi,</hi> that takes no reward to do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
therefore he is no briber, <hi>He that doth these
things shall never fall, Psal. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have described a Roman spirit, and
compared the Romans and Antichristians to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
who are the greater persecutors; which
may be, first a premonition to us in these last
dayes, to expect perilous times for three yeares
and a halfe, <hi>Revel</hi> 11. 7. worse then those of
Jewes, Turkes, and Infidels; even the times of
Hypocriticall Antichristian Heretickes, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. 1. Secondly, an exhortation to patience, for
he that kills with the sword, shall be killed with
the sword; he that now leads into captivity,
shall be led; he that robbs, shall be robbed;
here is the patience<note n="g" place="margin">Revel. 13.</note> of the Saints,<note n="h" place="margin">Zach. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Returne
to the strong hold, yee prisoners of Hope, this day I
declare unto you, that I will restore double to
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I have preached for Love and Peace,
so let us conclude with a Prayer, for the peace
of God that passeth all understanding, to guide
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54778:11"/>
our hearts and mindes in the knowledge and
love of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
with the Father and Holy spirit,
be honour and glory
throughout all
ages. Amen.</p>

believe O Lord, the way of man is not in himselfe, neither
is it in man to guide his steps, it is not in him that willeth,
nor that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy, who hath
mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he
