         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> our great Maſter commands me to ſpeak to thee O <hi>King</hi> after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>KING,</hi> thou haſt taken upon thee to Rule part of the King of Kings great houſhold, and if thou art his Steward, they that Rule our men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of the Lord, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3. And they that are ruled muſt fear God and the King, by whom Kings reign, which is Gods Order onely; therefore care is to be taken for the Poor and Deſpiſed and Oppreſſed, as well as for the Rich and Mighty of this world; for our great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath put a Law in every thing he maketh, to guide it according to its kind; without Counſel the People periſh, and his Counſellors are the aged in Chriſt, for not many Wiſe men after the fleſh, nor many Mighty, nor many Noble are called, but God hath choſen the Fooliſh things of the world to confound the Wiſe, and God hath choſen the Weak things to confound the Mighty and Baſe things of the world, and things that are Deſpiſed hath God choſen, and things which are not to bring to nought things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence; and as our great Maſter is good to all, ſo muſt his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Counſel and Servants be, for Chriſt will not be made a Slave and a Vagabond to <hi>Dag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From a Beggar in bonds, who craves neither honour nor wealth, but a waiter upon our great Maſter, and a Beggar to him for thee and the Nations with tears and groans, that they may be ſaved from the Judgments which are ſealed for the Rebellious, and I am directed in thy behalf to the 12th Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> for thee to read, and conſider of alone by thy ſelf, and if thou be broken off from the wild Olive Tree, and art engrafted into the good Olive Tree, and made partaker of the fatneſs thereof, then thou wilt grow in the Spirit of Knowledge, and the ſecrets of the Lord will be with thee, and ſhalt ſee his wonderous works; for which wo is me, that I cry, Wilt thou hear his voice? Which if obeyed, I and others ſhall hear the Eccho, and there will be coverings to thee and them, which hear and believe; but if laught at and rejected, Oh! my bones ſhall be broken, and I tremble before our great Maſter, under whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry I am, the end whereof is known to him, and ſhall be known to them to whom by Viſion, Revelation or Inſpiration, or any other way he ſhall reveal himſelf; which in us, if it be obſerved and obeyed, is our glory, and will yield all glory to our great Maſter <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King, I am under great trouble of mind concerning thee and the Nations, and being commanded further to ſpeak unto thee, truth maketh me bold, wo is me for fear I grieve thee, I am full of love to thee, and to the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, under whoſe Miniſtry I am.</p>
            <p>Thou art to take heed of the Crown of Gold, which is of mens making, for a Crown of glory is offered to thee, that thou mayeſt wear for ever, and if thou imbrace the ſame, the worldly Crowns will well fit thee.</p>
            <p>Thou art to take heed of making Contracts with theſe people, for they are out of order, and God hath a controverſie with theſe Nations.</p>
            <p>Thou art to take heed of the Oath they will put upon thee, for fear of being ſnared, for there are many things to be done, and many things to be undone, which muſt be according to the Word of our greateſt King and Law-giver.</p>
            <p>Thou art to take heed of the Phyloſophers, and ſuch as will ſlatter thee for their own ends, minding more the commands of man, and love to man more than the Command of God our greateſt Maſter.</p>
            <p>Thou art to open the Priſon Doors for Debtors, and appoint Commiſſioners in all thy Counties, to examine every mans cauſe, there will appear great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to thee, to remit thy ſelf in the People hearts, for none can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our great Maſters Sword which is within every man, and thy Sword which is without, let be one proceedings in all Courts, as in the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>Thou art to take heed of all thy Officers in all places in the Nations, for if that they through corruptions ſhall any way abuſe the People, it will all reflect on thee, and make thee little; and although the world, fleſh and ſin be thy enemy, God will be thy friend, and thou ſhalt never want Counſel, nor miſs at laſt the eternal Crown of glory.</p>
            <p>Thou art to hold the Ballance equal to all ſorts of People, and to Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Impriſonments of People for Conſcience, thou art to forbear and hinder thoſe fiery Angels in the world, that would burn up all with a fiery zeal, which is not true, having no wiſdom but in their Lips.</p>
            <p>Thou art to be like our great Maſter, good to all, for he hath created a full creation, that ſhews his Love (there is no want) of his works, but there is a want of inlarged hearts, univerſal men, for narrow covetous ſpirits will never do good, but to themſelves; our great Maſters Houſe muſt be built by ſteps, by thoſe which have skill (even a <hi>Solomons</hi> Houſe) for the delivering of the Poor, Oppreſſed, Deſpiſed Bodies, that wants Food and Cloaths.</p>
