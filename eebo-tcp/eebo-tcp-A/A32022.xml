         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This, <hi>Sir,</hi> hath been <hi>your Portion,</hi> And I doubt not but you have <hi>learned,</hi> and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed <hi>by God</hi> in <hi>whatsoever state you are, therewith to be contented,</hi> and are made able to say with <hi>David, It is good for you that you have been afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97111:3"/>This last Trial was one of the sorest that ever yet betided you, being the loss of so <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Lady,</hi> so <hi>sutable a Wife,</hi> full of so much Goodness and Prudence. But when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that your <hi>Losse</hi> is her <hi>Gain,</hi> that she is taken away from <hi>the evil to come,</hi> that she is not lost, but gone before to her <hi>Father,</hi> and your <hi>Father,</hi> to her <hi>God,</hi> and your <hi>God</hi>; that her Soul is at rest in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom, and her body, even while in the grave, asleep in Iesus, and who it is that hath taken her from you; this doth much allay the immoderateness of your sorrow, &amp; enables you to say with holy <hi>Iob,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Name of the Lord</hi>; and with holy <hi>David,</hi>

            <p>There are three great Truthes, which if well digested, will prove heart-quieting, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Spirits of Gods people, and make them calm and satisfied in the worst of daies and dangers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the <hi>Providences of God,</hi> though never so <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <pb facs="tcp:97111:3"/>
For <hi>we know that all things shall work together for good to those who love God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>sanctified Afflictions are great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,</hi> and that <hi>Correction,</hi> when joyned with <hi>Instruction,</hi> is a certain Character of <hi>Election.</hi> That God had one <hi>Son</hi> without <hi>sin,</hi> but no <hi>Son</hi> without <hi>Sorrow;</hi> That Afflictions are <hi>Divine Touchstones,</hi> to try the truth and strength of our Graces, <hi>Divine Furnaces,</hi> to purge out the Drosse of our sins; <hi>Divine Files</hi> to pare off our spiritual Rust, and <hi>Divine fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Houses,</hi> to dress us, and make us fit for Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath altered the <hi>Nature of Death,</hi> and made it a <hi>Gate</hi> to everlasting Life. That Christ hath <hi>sanctified, sweetned, purchased, conquered,</hi> and <hi>disarmed Death,</hi> so as it is now become the best <hi>Friend</hi> we have next to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For we shall never be free from sin, nor <hi>perfected</hi> in Grace, nor see God <hi>Face to Face,</hi> till we die.</p>
            <p>This last grand Truth is made out fully in the ensuing Sermon, wherein also is shewed the Benefit that the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the Saints ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain while in the Grave, by sleeping in Iesus. Many Sermons tell us the Advantage that the
<pb facs="tcp:97111:4"/>
               <hi>Soul</hi> reaps by death, but this will discover what our <hi>vile Bodies</hi> gain even while they are <hi>rotting</hi> in the Grave.</p>
            <p>Sir, It was your desire it should be made publick, and out of pure obedience so it now is. For there is nothing in it that is elaborate, and more then ordinary, or that renders it worthy the perusal of a judicious Eye. But the Testimony given of your <hi>Noble Lady,</hi> as it is true, so (I conceive) it is worth reading and imitating, and may well be called a <hi>Looking-Glasse for Ladies</hi> to dress themselves by every Morning. It will teach them to make <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> their Business, and to spend more time in decking their Souls with Grace, then their Bodies with vain Attire, that a <hi>Neck-lace</hi> of Graces, is more worth then a <hi>Neck-lace</hi> of Pearles.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> writes much in commendation of many <hi>Holy and Religious</hi> Ladies, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Paula, Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Euslochium, &amp;c.</hi>

In like manner, I thought meet to propound the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of your most <hi>Excellent Lady,</hi> which if well followed in those things wherein she was praise-worthy, will without doubt bring us to everlasting Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97111:4"/>The Lord give a Blessing to what is said in the following Discourse, and make up to you in <hi>himself,</hi> what you have lost in the want of your <hi>Dear Consort,</hi> and be your <hi>Comforter</hi> and <hi>Counsellour</hi> in all Conditions.</p>

                  <hi>That the death of a Child of God is nothing else but a quiet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and happy sleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the understanding of this I shall answer to three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. What part of a Child of God is it that sleepeth when he dieth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There are some who say, That the soul sleepeth as well as the body, and that when a man dies both Body and Soul lye asleep till the Resurrection. And this they prove from the example of <hi>Stephen,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 7 57</note> because it is said of him, <hi>That he fell asleep.</hi> But still the question is, What part of <hi>Stephen</hi> fell asleep? Not his <hi>Soul</hi>: For he commends that into the hands of Christ; <hi>Lord Iesus receive my Spirit.</hi> And he <hi>saw the heavens opened, and the Son of Man stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the right hand of God</hi> ready to receive his Soul immediatly. It was the <hi>Body of Stephen</hi> fell asleep, but his <hi>Soul</hi> was presently received by the Lord Jesus into heaven. When a man dies, <hi>his body returns to dust from whence it came, but the soul returns to God who gave it,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.7</note> 
                  <hi>either to be judged to everlasting happiness, or everlasting misery.</hi> Indeed, In one sence the soul may be said at death to fall asleep, that is, It is <hi>at rest in Abrahams bosome</hi>: But it is not asleep in the <hi>Anabaptistical</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> sence, so as to lie in a dead <hi>Apoplexy</hi> or <hi>Lethargy</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither capable of <hi>joy</hi> or <hi>sorrow,</hi> of <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>misery</hi> till the Resurrection. This is a most <hi>uncomfortable</hi> and <hi>unscriptural</hi> opinion.</p>
               <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> desires to be <hi>dissolved and to be with Christ,</hi> he doth not desire to lye asleep till the Resurrection, and neither to see, know, or enjoy Christ, but to be made happy with him, and by him.</p>
               <p>When Christ promised to the penitent Thief, <note place="margin">

               <p>The Souls under the Altar, of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the Testimony which they held, are not in a dull Lethargy without sence or understanding, but <hi>cry with a loud voice,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Souls of just men made perfect in heaven</hi> are not asleep, <note place="margin">Heb. 12.23</note> but enjoy Coelestial felicity. And the soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon his death received into <hi>Abrahams bosome,</hi> and filled full of consolation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The truth is, This opinion of the <hi>Soul-sleepers</hi> is as pernicious as the opinion of those who say, That the Soul <hi>dies</hi> with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and riseth with the Body.

               <p>Quest. 2. Is not the death of a wicked man called a sleep as well as the death of a Saint?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This cannot be denied. It is said of <hi>Baasha, Omri,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who were three wicked Kings, that they <hi>slept with their Fathers.</hi> But then I answer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is but very seldome used.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

As <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was much troubled in his sleep, and, as many sick men have very unquiet sleeps, so as they are more sick when they awake than before they slept, so is it with a wicked man. <hi>Both good and bad</hi> (saith St. <hi>Austin</hi>) <hi>sleep at death;

But how? Even as a <hi>Malefactor</hi> that sleeps in Prison the night before he is executed, but when he awakes he is hurried and dragged to execution. So the wicked man falls asleep at death, but when he <hi>awakes,</hi> he <hi>awakes</hi> to everlasting damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I have already in a Sermon printed (without my knowledge) given thirteen resemblances between <hi>death</hi> and <hi>sleep,</hi> and therefore must of necessity here omit them lest I should seem <hi>actum agere.</hi> At the present I shall only mention these two.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>because he is thereby layed to rest.</hi> The Scripture calls their <hi>graves,</hi> their <hi>beds of rest.</hi> And the Apostle tells us, <hi>That they which dye in the Lord rest from all their labours.</hi> They are at rest from all <hi>corporal</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> evills.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. From all the wrongs, injuries, and persecutions of the wicked world. In this life they are mocked, scoffed, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but when death comes, they are like a man above in the upper Region, where no winds nor storms can come.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From the evils to come upon the wicked world. Thus St. <hi>Austin</hi> was layed to rest immediately before <hi>Hippo</hi> was taken by the <hi>Vandals.

               <p>Secondly, From all spiritual evils.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the hurt of the Devil and his temptations. Death puts them above his reach, so as he shall not be able to hurle one fiery dart any longer at them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From evil company, and evil examples. In this life the Wheat are mingled with Chaff and Tares, and cannot but hear the name of the <hi>Great God</hi> blasphemed and dishonoured, which is a great vexation to them, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.7, 8</note> as it was to <hi>Lot in Sodom.</hi> But at death they shall be separated from all chaff and tares, and shall never hear God dishonoured any more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From Divine desertions. In this life God many times withdraweth the light of his countenance from his sinning Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is more terrible to them than death it self: For if his <hi>loving kindness is better than life,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal 63.3</note> then his frowns are worse than death. But after death the light of Gods countenance shall shine perpetually upon them, and never admit either of a <hi>cloud,</hi> or <hi>Eclipse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. From the very being and existence of sin. The <hi>death of the body</hi> frees them perfectly from the <hi>body of death.</hi> Death drieth up the bloudy issue of sin, <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This is a very excellent and singularly comfortable expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, worthy to be seriously weighed and considered. For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of it I will shew,</p>
               <p>First, What it is to <hi>sleep in Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What glorious benefits and advantages come to the bodies of the Saints by this priviledge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is to <hi>sleep in Iesus.</hi> This expression signifieth two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a true Saint dieth a Member of <hi>Christ,</hi> united to him by a lively saith. <note place="margin">Rev. 14.13. <gap reason="foreign">

is, engraffed into the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That he doth not only <hi>die</hi> in Christ, but <hi>continueth</hi> a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Christ,</hi> and united to him even while he is in the grave. For this Text speaks of all Saints departed from the beginning of the World — <hi>So also they that sleep in Iesus</hi>; that is, They that are now in their graves, and are there asleep in Jesus. The like phrase is used, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of such who had been long in their graves, and yet all that while were asleep in Christ. The bodies of the Saints in the grave, though turned to dust, are yet notwithstanding united to Christ, and Members of his Body; and though separated from their <hi>Souls,</hi> yet are not separated from <hi>Christ:</hi> Even as the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> while in the grave, was even then united to his <hi>Divine Person.</hi> Though soul and body were separated one from the other, yet neither of them were separated from the <hi>Divine Person.</hi> So the <hi>Body</hi> of a man in <hi>Christ,</hi> though separated by death from his <hi>Soul,</hi> yet it is not separated from <hi>Christ.</hi> Though it say to <hi>Corruption, Thou art my Father, and to the VVorms, Thou art my Mother, and my Sister,</hi> yet it may say also to <hi>Christ,</hi> Thou art my <hi>Brother,</hi> and to <hi>God,</hi> Thou art my <hi>Father.</hi> And therefore the Saints, even while they are in their graves, are said to be <hi>Christs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. — <hi>Afterwards they that are Christs at his coming.</hi> And are said to be <hi>dead in Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16. Not only to <hi>die</hi> in Christ, but to be <hi>dead</hi> in Christ; that is, to continue in <hi>Christ</hi> even while dead. And that they do so, appears fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by these two Reasons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the Union between Christ and a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>everlasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>spiritual,</hi> and therefore needs no vicinity of place to preserve it. A Husband and Wife, a Father and his Child are really united together, though a thousand miles distant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>everlasting,</hi> Hos. 2.19. <hi>I will besroath thee unto me for ever,</hi> &amp;c. Herein it exceeds the Union between a Man and his Wife, which is only till death them do part. But the Union between <hi>Christ</hi> and a true <hi>Christian</hi> is not separated by death: Once in <hi>Christ,</hi> ever in <hi>Christ,</hi> Joh. 8.35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because Death is <hi>Christs purchase,</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97111:9"/>
are yours, whether Paul, or Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or life or death,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>ye are Christs,</hi> &amp;c. These words teach us these two lessons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Death</hi> is part of the Saints <hi>Magna Charta</hi> as well as <hi>Life.</hi> Death is the Believers <hi>rich Portion,</hi> and <hi>peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Christ hath purchased <hi>death</hi> for his children, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as <hi>life.</hi> He hath made over death for their <hi>joynture,</hi> and <hi>rich portion,</hi> as much as <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> nay, as much as <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> it self. <hi>Christ</hi> hath altered the nature of death, insomuch as that now it is become our best friend next to <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> For we shall never be rid of sin, nor perfected in grace, nor see God face to face till we dye. It is become a <hi>gate</hi> to heaven, an <hi>outlet</hi> to all misery, and an <hi>inlet</hi> to everlasting happiness. Now then if Death be <hi>Christs purchase,</hi> and a part of the <hi>Saints Ioynture,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, it doth not separate us from <hi>Christ,</hi> for then it would be but an ill purchase, and joynture, obtained not for our good, but our great hurt, contrary to the express words of the Apostle, and also contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for the good of those that love God. Et mors praecipue,</hi> and especially Death, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith.</p>
               <p>The second thing propounded, is, To shew what those glorious benefits and advantages are, which the bodies of the Saints enjoy while they are in their graves asleep in Jesus.</p>
               <p>For answer to this, you must know, That as soon as ever the soul departs out of the body, the body presently loseth all its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and comliness, and becomes a rotten and stinking carkass; It goeth down to the house of rottenness, to the dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and is layed in the cold earth, dust to dust, ashes to ashes. And yet even then it hath a six-fold benefit, by being asleep in Jesus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though the body be turned to dust, yet that <hi>very dust is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in Gods sight.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 116.15.</note> As the <hi>death of the Saints,</hi> so also <hi>their dust is precious to God.</hi> There is a twofold dust that God loves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>dust of Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>dust of his Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The <hi>dust of Sion,</hi> Psal. 102.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The dust of the Saints.</hi> The golden Ore in the Mine is not so pretious to us, as this <hi>golden dust</hi> is to <hi>God. Iob</hi> tells us, <hi>That out of the earth comes the dust of gold</hi>; <note place="margin">Job 28.6.</note> but I may truly say,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97111:10"/>
That in the earth there is <hi>golden dust,</hi> even the <hi>dust of Gods Saints.</hi> As <hi>Balaam</hi> saith concerning the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Num 23, 10,</note> 
                  <hi>Who can count the dust of Iacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel</hi>? So may I say, Who can sufficiently express the <hi>love that God bears to the dust of Iacob,</hi> and to the <hi>bodies of his people, while in their graves?</hi> The Apostle tells us, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.</note> 
                  <hi>That neither life nor death is able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi> God loves the bodies of his Saints as well as their souls, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies when turned to dust. That very dust is <hi>part of Gods election,</hi> (for God hath elected the bodies of his Saints unto eternal life, as well as their souls) and it is <hi>part of Christs Redemption,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits Sanctification.</hi> O what a comfort is this to a dying Child of God! Though all his friends will forsake him when brought to the grave (the Husband will leave his dear Wife, and the Children their dear Father) yet God will not forsake him, but go down to the grave with him, and the watchful eye of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will be over his dust and ashes. And as <hi>Rispah</hi> kept the dead bodies of <hi>Sauls</hi> seven Sons, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.10.</note> 
                  <hi>and spread a Tent over them, so as the birds of the air could not hurt them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</hi> So will <hi>God</hi> keep the dead bodies of his Saints, and spread the <hi>Curtain</hi> of his <hi>protection</hi> over them, and as he took care of them while they were in the <hi>sepulchre</hi> of their <hi>Mothers wombe,</hi> so he will also take care of them while they are in the <hi>sepulchre of their Mother earth.</hi> He that loved them in <hi>Sepulchro uteri,</hi> will love them in <hi>utero Sepulchri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They that <hi>sleep in Iesus</hi> have this benefit by it, That <hi>Christ</hi> by his burial hath <hi>sanctified</hi> the grave, and <hi>sweetned</hi> it, and <hi>perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> it, insomuch, that though in its own nature, it be as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some prison, a house of rottenness, and a place of terrour; yet to a man <hi>dead in Christ,</hi> the nature of it is altered, and to him it is as a <hi>soft bed,</hi> wherein he is laid down quietly to take his rest, and there to remain asleep, free from all cares, fears, and troubles till the Resurrection of the dead. Though the grave in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be a dreadful place, a stinking charnel-house, and a rotten prison to the wicked and ungodly, where they lye waiting for the <hi>Great Assizes</hi>; yet to the Children of God, Christ hath made it a <hi>Magazin</hi> and <hi>Store-house</hi> to keep their bodies safe till the great Resurrection. And he hath also made it a beaten and plain way to heaven. Christ Jesus himself went to heaven thorough the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97111:10"/>
grave, and so must we and all the Godly. We must first put off the <hi>rags of Mortality,</hi> before we can put on the <hi>robes of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> To a wicked man, the grave is a <hi>thorough-fare to hell,</hi> but to a man asleep in Jesus it is a <hi>passage to heaven,</hi> where Christ is. And if St. <hi>Austin</hi> was willing to go even <hi>thorough hell</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, much more may we be willing to go <hi>thorough the grave</hi> to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that <hi>sleep in Iesus</hi> have this benefit also, That by their Union with <hi>Christ,</hi> and by the watchful <hi>Providence of God,</hi> there is a substance preserved, so as they are not utterly extinct, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated by death, but something of their bodies remain unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. There is nothing utterly, totally, and finally destroyed in a Child of God by death, but sin and misery. The <hi>rotting</hi> of the body in the grave is but as the <hi>rotting</hi> of the Corn in the earth, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36. The Seed is cast into the earth, and there it dieth, and rotteth, but is not utterly extinct, but rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the ground, that it may be quickned again: So the bodies of the Saints rot in their graves that they may be raised again, and <hi>made like unto the glorious body of Iesus Christ.</hi> And this is another reason why the death of a Child of God is called a sleep, because as a man asleep is not extinct, no more is he in the grave. There is a substance preserved, and as <hi>David</hi> saith of an afflicted righteous man, <note place="margin">Psal. 34.20.</note> that <hi>God keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken:</hi> So God keepeth the dust and ashes of his Children, so as they shall not be utterly and totally consumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But is there not a substance preserved also in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the wicked?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, Their bodies are not utterly destroyed, but remain, not by vertue of their Union with Christ, but <hi>preserved</hi> by the <hi>Almighty power of God</hi> as a <hi>terrible Lord, and severe Iudge,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, as in a prison, till the great day of Judgment, in which they shall appear before Christ, and then be condemned to hell. Happy were it for a wicked man if his body were annihilated by death, (as it were happy for a Traytor if he died in Prison, and escaped hanging.) But herein consisteth the difference between him and a man asleep in Jesus, A man out of Christ is not properly <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> in the grave, but rather <hi>reserved</hi> by the power of Christ to be afterwards tormented in hell: But a man in Christ is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>reserved,</hi> but by vertue of his Union with Christ,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97111:11"/>
and <hi>preserved</hi> to enjoy Eternal glory with their souls at the Great Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that sleepeth in Jesus hath this benefit also, That though his <hi>body</hi> lieth rotting in the grave, yet his <hi>soul</hi> is all the while <hi>in heaven,</hi> where it enjoyeth the glorious presence of God, and of his Saints and Angels: I say, <hi>his soul,</hi> which is his best half, which is the <hi>Man of man,</hi> is in heaven. Indeed, his body, which is but as the <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>Carkass,</hi> is in the grave; but the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>Iewel</hi> is in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> What benefit doth the body in the grave gain by his souls being in heaven?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I gains this double benefit:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If his <hi>Soul</hi> be in heaven, it is certain the <hi>Body will come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at last:</hi> For it is but as the <hi>shadow</hi> to the <hi>substance,</hi> and if the <hi>substance</hi> be in heaven, the <hi>shadow</hi> will undoubtedly follow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the <hi>Soul</hi> be in heaven, yet it can never be <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>compleatly happy</hi> till it be reunited to the <hi>Body.</hi> For God made the soul to be the <hi>form</hi> of the body, and to dwell for ever in it: And if it had not been for <hi>Adams</hi> transgression, the body and soul should never have been separated. This separation is the fruit of sin, and therefore the <hi>soul in heaven</hi> hath <hi>appetitum unionis,</hi> a desire to have this <hi>breach made up,</hi> and to be united again to his body, because he shall have a more perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat being with it than without it. The Scripture tells us, That it <hi>waits for the redemption of his body,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.23. Rev. 6.10.</note> and that it prayeth that <hi>God</hi> would <hi>accomplish the number of his Elect,</hi> that so they may again be joyned to their bodies, and have <hi>Coronam perfectam &amp; publicam, a publick</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Crown of glory. The souls in heaven (saith <hi>Bernard</hi>) pray for their bodies in the grave; They are not like the <hi>chief Butler,</hi> who forgat <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his former dignity. They remember they have bodies still in the grave, which were <hi>companions</hi> with them in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>God,</hi> in Prayer, and Fasting, and suffering afflictions for <hi>Christ.</hi> And they know, that by reunion with them their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness will be much increased; and therefore they cannot cease pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing for them, and Christ will in due time come in glory to raise them up unto everlasting life.</p>
               <p>A fifth benefit that accrueth to the body that is asleep in Jesus, is, That <hi>Christ himself cannot be perfect</hi> till it be raised from the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97111:11"/>
dead. As a <hi>natural body</hi> cannot be perfect without all its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, no more can <hi>Christ mystical,</hi> as head of his Church, be perfect till every member of his body be glorified. Therefore it is said, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.23. That <hi>the Church is the fulness of him who filleth all in all,</hi> which is to be understood of that voluntary condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Christ</hi> hath subjected himself in being the <hi>Head</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that is, his Church. So that as a natural body is maimed and imperfect if the least member be wanting: So is Christ, <hi>as Head of his Church, maimed and imperfect</hi> till all the bodies that are asleep in <hi>Iesus</hi> be reunited to their souls, and received into glory for ever with Christ.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The body by being <hi>asleep in Iesus,</hi> hath this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, That though it <hi>lieth rotting</hi> in the grave, yet it <hi>resteth in hope.</hi> This was <hi>Davids</hi> comfort, <hi>Psalm</hi> 16.9. <hi>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth, my flesh also shall rest in hope.</hi> There is not a member of Christ, but when he is breathing out his last breath, may use <hi>Davids</hi> words with <hi>Davids</hi> comfort — My heart is glad, my glory rejoyceth, and my flesh also (which is shortly to be put into the grave) shall rest in hope, in a forefold hope:

               </p>
               <p>All these particulars are comprehended in the words of the Text — <hi>God will bring with him.</hi> But before he brings them, <hi>he must first raise them.</hi> The bodies of the Saints shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies dwell in the dust; <note place="margin">Isa. 26.19.</note> therefore the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> calls upon them to awake and sing, <hi>Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.</hi> A strange expression!

                  <note place="margin">Joh. 5.28.29.</note> Christ tells us, <hi>That all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.</hi> The Apostle tells us, <hi>That this mortall body shall put on immortality,</hi>

                  <hi>That with these very eyes he shoould see his Redeemeer.</hi> And it cannot stand with Gods Justice, that one body should <hi>sin,</hi> and another be <hi>condemned,</hi> and one body <hi>serve him,</hi> and another be <hi>crowned.</hi> The same body then shall rise.</p>
               <p>And rise by <hi>vertue of its union with Christ.</hi> This is hinted in the Text — <hi>For if we believe that Iesus died, and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Iesus will God bring with him.</hi> By the same power by which Christ raised up himself, by the same power he will raise all that are by the Spirit united to him: For he is the <hi>Husband</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Husband</hi> will raise his <hi>Spouse.</hi> He is the <hi>Shepheard and King</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Shepheard</hi> will raise his <hi>Sheep,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Subjects</hi>; and therefore he is called the <hi>first fruits of them that sleep.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.2.</note> As the first fruits did sanctifie the whole lump: So by Christ's Resurrection all that die in the Lord are sanctified unto him, and assured of their resurrection by him. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.20.</note> And it is said, <hi>As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive</hi>; that is, all that are in Christ shall

be raised by the power of <hi>Christ,</hi> as their <hi>Head,</hi> and as their <hi>Merciful Saviour and Redeemer.</hi> If the <hi>Head</hi> be above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>Body</hi> cannot be drowned, but will rise after it. And let me add.</p>
               <p>It shall <hi>rise</hi> after a <hi>most Glorious manner</hi>; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.42, 43, 44.</note> 
                  <hi>It is sown in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but it shall be raised in Incorruption. It is sown in dishonour, but it shall be raised in Glory. It is sown in weakness, but it shall be raised in power. It is sown a natural Body, but it shall be raised a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual body.</hi> For Jesus Christ in his Incarnation assumed our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as well as our souls, and at his Death, suffered for us, in his Body, as well as in his Soul. Our Bodies are united to him, and Members of him, Temples of the Holy Ghost, and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Service, as well as our Souls. And therefore he will glorifie our Bodies, as well as our souls, and make them like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Glorious Body. It is impossible to set out all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that God will bestow upon the bodies of his Saints, at the great Resurrection. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man to conceive</hi> what God hath prepared, even for the bodies of those that love him. Some part of this Glory I have discovered already in a Funeral Sermon in Print, and therefore shall now forbear to mention it.</p>
               <p>The Bodies of the wicked shall come out of their <hi>Graves,</hi> as out of their <hi>Prisons,</hi> as so many <hi>Malefactors,</hi> to appear before an <hi>Angry Iudge.</hi> They shall come out of their <hi>Graves,</hi> as the <hi>chief Baker</hi> did out of Prison, to be executed in Hell for ever. They shall rise with great Fear and Trembling, and shall call to the <hi>Rockes and Mountains, to hide and cover them from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> But the Bodies of those who sleep in Jesus, shall rise out of their <hi>Graves,</hi> as out of their <hi>Beds,</hi> with great <hi>Ioy and Rejoycing.</hi> They shall come out of their Graves, as <hi>Ionah</hi> out of the <hi>Whales Belly,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the <hi>Lions Den,</hi> as the <hi>Chief Butler,</hi> who came out of Prison, to be restored to all his former Dignities, and as <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who after his Release out of the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let us not look upon Death, as presented unto us in <hi>Natures Looking-Glass,</hi> but as it is set down in a <hi>Scripture-dress.</hi> Nature presents Death in a terrible manner: The Philosopher cals it, <hi>of all terrible things,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job 18, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>most terrible. Iob</hi> cals it the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> It is terrible three manner of waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it is a <hi>Separation</hi> between <hi>two dear and ancient Friends, the Soul and the Body,</hi> who having lived long together,

are very loath to part asunder. There is nothing more contrary to Flesh and Bloud, then the separation of the one from the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because it is the Fruit of sin. <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> For the <hi>wages of sin is death.</hi> Had <hi>Adam</hi> never sinned, we never should have died; <hi>By one man sin entred into the world,</hi>

                  </note> Death to a Child of God is the <hi>Birth-day of Heavens Eternity,</hi> a putting off of its <hi>Earthly Tabernacle,</hi> and a going to <hi>a House made without hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> It is an <hi>uncloathing of himself, that he may be cloathed upon with his House which is in Heaven.</hi> It is a going to his <hi>Fathers House,</hi> where he shall enjoy perfect and perpetual Happiness.</p>
               <p>There are 10 Springs and Fountains of Consolation to a true Saint against the fear of Death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When he dieth, though his <hi>Body</hi> be laid in the Grave, yet his <hi>Soul</hi> is immediatly received up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> his <hi>best part</hi> is at the Instant of Death blessed and happy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Body at death doth not die, but only <hi>sleepeth</hi> (as Christ said of dead <hi>Lazarus</hi>) and is at rest, and is <hi>asleep in Iesus,</hi> even while it is in the Grave, and is part of that man who is a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ,</hi> and under the <hi>Care and Love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Soul,</hi> though it be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> can never be <hi>perfectly</hi> and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97111:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>compleatly happy,</hi> till his Body be joyned to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Christ himself,</hi> as he is the <hi>Head of his Church,</hi> can never be perfect till his Body be raised from the dead, and crowned with a Crown of Glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Christ hath conquered Death for him, he hath not only sweetned and sanctified it, but conquered it, according as it was fore prophesied, — <hi>I will ransom them from the Power of the Grave,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 13.14.</note> 
                  <hi>I will redeem them from Death; O Death I will be thy Plagues; O Grave I will be thy Destruction.</hi> He hath <hi>led Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity Captive,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 48.</note> and death is one of those Captives, as well as the Devil. He hath <hi>disarmed</hi> Death, and taken away the <hi>Sting</hi> of it, so as to a man in Christ, death is a <hi>Serpent</hi> without a <hi>Sting.</hi> It is like the <hi>Viper</hi> which skipt upon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Hand, <note place="margin">Acts 28.</note> which did not at all hurt him. It is like the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> which though it had the shape of a Serpent, yet it hadnot the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, but was a <hi>healing,</hi> not a <hi>stinging</hi> Serpent. So is death to a Child of God. It is so far from hurting of him, that it is now by <hi>Christs</hi> death, become his greatest Advantage, and he may triumph over it, and say with the Ap. <hi>O Death,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57,</note> 
                  <hi>where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. There is this Spring also of Consolation against the Fear of death, because he that hath an Interest in Christ, cannot <hi>die sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, though he die never so suddenly,</hi> that is, though he die ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so <hi>suddenly</hi> in regard of <hi>time,</hi> yet he can never die <hi>suddenly</hi> in regard of <hi>Preparation.</hi> For he is alwaies <hi>habitually fitted,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Death, he is justified by Faith, and sanctified by the Spirit, and is above the hurt of damnation: <hi>For there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to those that are in Christ.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> He hath not his Graces to seek, when he comes to die, which is no little Happiness.</p>

He can never <hi>die miserable, though he die never so miserably.</hi> Though he die upon a Dunghil, or in a Goal, or upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or at a stake, wheresoever, and howsoever he dies, he dies happily. <note place="margin">Rom. 12.13.</note> For so saith the Apostle, <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.</hi> They are blessed, though they die upon a dunghil. Though <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned to death, yet he died happily; for while he was stoning, he saw the <hi>Heavens opened, and Christ rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive him.</hi> Though <hi>Lazarus</hi> was starved to death, yet he died <hi>blessedly,</hi> because the <hi>Angels carried his Soul into Abrahams

                  </note> he said to him, <hi>What do you mean to make your Prison so strong?</hi> The Soul is in the Body as in a Prison, in 3 Respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Because the Soul is hidden in the Body, as a man is hidden in a Prison.</hi> As <hi>Plato</hi> saith of Vertue, <hi>That if a man could see it with corporal eyes, he could not but love it.</hi> So may I say of the Soul; <hi>If a man could see the Beauty, Glory and Excellency of it, he could not but admire it, and highly value it.</hi> But it is hidden in the Body as in a Prison.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Because the Soul is hindred by the Body,</hi> and that Three waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>hindred from Heaven.</hi> For whilst we are in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97111:15"/>
body, <hi>we are absent from the Lord,</hi> and we cannot be with Christ, till we be dissolved. And this is truly a Prison where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man is absent from his best Friends and Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>hindred from Heavenly Operations.</hi> For the Body takes up all the time from the Soul; as the <hi>Lean Kine of Pharaoh devoured the fat,</hi> so the Provision for the Feeding and Cloathing of the Body, eats up the time that should be spent about the Soul. It is with the Soul and Body, as it was with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot. Abraham</hi> had his Cattel and his Servants, and <hi>Lot</hi> his, so that the Country was too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them. So the <hi>Soul</hi> hath her work, and the <hi>Body</hi> his, and there is hardly time enough for both; so as the one must needs hinder the other, and they never will be well till separated. The Cloath is too short to cover them both. And this must needs be a great Bondage when the <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi> shall be preferred before her <hi>Mistress, Hagar</hi> before <hi>Sarah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>hindred in all its Heavenly Operations.</hi> For the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy weigheth down the Soul. As a <hi>Bird that hath a stone ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its Leg, is weighed down that it cannot fly aloft.</hi> So is the Heavenly Soul in the best Christian depressed by the Body, that it cannot mount aloft in Prayer and other Holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises. The Soul and Body are like a <hi>pair of Scales,</hi> the more the one is up, the more the other goeth down. As <hi>Sauls Armour was a Burden to David,</hi> so is the Body to the Soul. The Body is quickly tired in the Service of God. <hi>The Spirit is willing, but the Flesh is weak,</hi> like a strong man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Jadish Horse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Because <hi>the Soul is defiled by the Body, as a man in a Nasty Prison.</hi> God gave man a <hi>Heavenly Soul,</hi> and an <hi>Earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> that the <hi>Heavenly Soul</hi> might lift up the <hi>Earthly Body</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven: But now it fares quite contrary. <hi>Our earthly Bodies</hi> have weighed down our <hi>heavenly Souls,</hi> and made them earthly and sensual. <hi>Tamdiu versata est Anima in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernaculo, ut ipsa versa est in Tabernaculum.</hi> The Soul hath lived so long in a Body of flesh, that it is (as it were) fleshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and bodified. The Soul looks through an <hi>eye of flesh,</hi> and every thing seems fleshly to it. It is diverted by the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97111:16"/>
Body <hi>from its true End.</hi> The true End of the Soul is to know God, to love, fear and serve him. But the body diverts the Stream, and turns the Soul to serve men, and to provide for back and belly. And therefore it may fitly be called the Souls Prison.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It holds forth this Lesson also, <hi>That Death is the Souls Goal-delivery.</hi> It is the <hi>letting of it loose from its Bonds and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Its is setting it at Liberty, like a <hi>Bird</hi> escaped out of a <hi>Cage.</hi> Now <hi>Lord let thy Servant depart</hi>; that is, be <hi>set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> from the prison of my body.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is this Comfort also against the fear of death, That <hi>Iesus Christ is gone to heaven on purpose to prepare a place for the dead bodies of his Saints, and he will come again, and raise them up, and take them to himself, that where he is, there they may be also,</hi> John 14.2, 3. Therefore he is said to go into Heaven as a Forerunner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Whither the forerunner is for us entred.</hi> Now a <hi>forerunner</hi> supposeth some that are to follow. Christ is entred before, to take up <hi>Lodgings</hi> for all that are <hi>asleep in him,</hi> and hath (as it were) written their several Names upon their several Lodgings, as is intimated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>To the Church of the first-born, which are written in heaven</hi>; and keeps them empty till they come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to fill them, as is hinted, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. — <hi>Reserved for you in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Therefore we are said <hi>to fit with him in heavenly places,</hi> because he went up to take possession of it for our use, and benefit, and fits there in <hi>our Nature,</hi> and as <hi>our Head,</hi> not as a <hi>private Citizen of Heaven,</hi> but as a <hi>Representative</hi> of all the <hi>Elect of God,</hi> and will ere long come down, and take them up to himself, and so they shall <hi>ever be with the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The last Spring of Consolation against the fear of death is, That <hi>Death will put a perfect and perpetual end to all his Miseries, whether spiritual or corporal</hi> (as I have shewed) <hi>and open a door to infinite and unexpressible happiness for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let these ten Considerations be made use of, as <hi>precious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes</hi> against the flavish fear of death.</p>

                  <hi>not asleep in Iesus,</hi> but <hi>asleep in sin</hi>; to these men death is of all formidable things most formidable. It is a most <hi>cruel, biting, and devouring Serpent</hi> with eight <hi>Stings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To a man out of Christ, <hi>death puts an end to all his outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,</hi> to all his riches, honours, and pleasures, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever a wicked man accounts his <hi>Heaven, and his happiness</hi>; and this must needs be as a <hi>stinging Serpent</hi> to him. <note place="margin">Judg. 18.23, 24.</note> We read of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> that when the men of <hi>Dan</hi> stole away his Gods, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them crying, and they turned back, and asked him <hi>what aileth thee?</hi> he answered, <hi>ye have taken away my gods,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>do you say to me, what aileth thee?</hi> When a wicked man dies he looseth all his <hi>Gods,</hi> For he maketh his riches, honours and pleasures <hi>his gods,</hi> and no wonder the memory of death is so bitter to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It <hi>deprives him of all his hopes.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job 11.7.</note> For when a <hi>wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of unjust men perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> The righteous hath hope in death.

His Motto is <hi>Dum expiro, despero</hi> Death puts an end both to his</p>
               <p>Hopes.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To his <hi>earthly hopes</hi> A wicked man builds Castles in the air, and promiseth great matters to himself, and saith, as the Rich man, <note place="margin">Luke 12.19.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi> But God saith to him. <hi>Thou fool, this night thy Soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided.</hi> Death dasheth all his earthly hopes; and that which is worse,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Death <hi>dasheth all his Spiritual and supernatural hopes.</hi> A wicked man is ready to nourish in himself a presumptuous hope of Heaven, and doubts not but that he shall be saved; but when he comes to die, all his <hi>hopes of Heaven perish,</hi> and are as a <hi>Spiders web,</hi> easily swept away, <hi>Iob</hi> 8.14. The <hi>Lord rejecteth his vain confidence,</hi> Jer. 2.37. Now this is a misery above expression, for a man to be <hi>disappointed of his eternal hopes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Death puts an end to all the sweetness, pleasure and profit that is in sin.</hi> There are two things in the Serpent, sin. The <hi>speckled
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97111:17"/>
black,</hi> and the <hi>sting in the tail of it.</hi> The <hi>pleasures of sin for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and the <hi>eternal pains attending it.</hi> A man out of Christ while he is alive and in health, sucks out the carnal sweetness that is in sin, it is as honey to his mouth. But when death comes, the sweetness of sin vanisheth, and nothing remains but the sting and torment of it. Even as a Thief, as long as he is unfound out, lives merrily upon what he hath stolen, but when he is found, and cast into Prison and condemned to be hanged, then he feels nothing but bitterness and sorrow. So it is with a wicked man; As long as he is in health and in prosperity, he takes great delight and content in sinning, but when he comes to be attached and arrested with Death, then the misery and cursedness of sin appears before him. Then he begins to say, <hi>Where is all the carnal pleasure I once took in my sinfull courses?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remains but the <hi>Sting. Momentaneum quod delectat, aternum quod cruciat.</hi> That which <hi>delighted</hi> me was but <hi>momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> but that which will <hi>torment</hi> me, is <hi>eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Death must needs be a stinging Serpent to a man out of Christ, because <hi>it puts Conscience into office to wound and torture him.</hi> The great design of a wicked man in health is to blind, or bribe his Conscience; but death puts it into office, and sets it on his proper Throne; and Conscience once awakened becomes a <hi>biting Serpent,</hi> and a <hi>gnawing worm,</hi> never suffering him to be at rest night nor day. Sin is like a <hi>piece of wood,</hi> which while it is in the water seems very <hi>light,</hi> floating on the top of it, but when it comes to the <hi>shoar,</hi> ten men can hardly stir that, which one man before might have carried which way he lifted. While a <hi>wicked</hi> man is in <hi>health</hi> and in <hi>prosperity,</hi> his sins seem <hi>light</hi> to him, but when he comes to the <hi>shoar of Death,</hi> then they begin to be heavy, then <hi>Conscience,</hi> like a <hi>Mastive Dog,</hi> flies in his face, and his <hi>sins</hi> appear in their <hi>ugly colours,</hi> with all the aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and <hi>sting</hi> him exceedingly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Death puts an end to Gods patience, to the day of grace and mercy, and to all the means of Salvation.</hi> For there is no repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the grave whither we are going. This life is a day of grace and Salvation. Now <hi>Ahashuerosh holds forth his golden Scepter.</hi> Now the <hi>Hour-glass of patience is running,</hi> the <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge is let down,</hi> and the <hi>white Flag</hi> of mercy is hanged out; but when Death comes, the <hi>white Flag</hi> is taken down, the <hi>Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:97111:17"/>
run out, the <hi>Draw-bridge</hi> taken up, the day of grace and patience at an end. <hi>Et qui fluvios sanguinis nunc dabit guttam aqua in Inferno negabit.</hi> And he that will now give us <hi>rivers of his blood</hi> to wash away our sins, will not in Hell give us a <hi>drop of water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A man out of Christ hath also this unhappiness, that <hi>whensoever he dieth, he dieth suddenly, though he die never so leasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; Suddenly in regard of <hi>preparation,</hi> though not in regard of <hi>time,</hi> For he dieth like the <hi>Foolish Virgins,</hi> having his <hi>Oyl</hi> to buy, his <hi>graces and evidences</hi> for Heaven to get, which is no little misery. For Death is a time of <hi>spending,</hi> not <hi>geting,</hi> whether you consider the Soul, or the Body. And as that man is in a sad condition, as to his outward estate, that hath laid up nothing in health to maintain him in sickness; So he is in a sadder, as to his eternal estate, that is unprovided at Death of a <hi>Stock of Grace,</hi> and <hi>Scripture Cordials.</hi> This man dieth suddenly though he die never so leasurely.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He dieth <hi>miserably, though he die never so happily</hi>; though in his bed, and in his old age; though buried in great pomp, yet dying in his sins he is cursed at death, and cursed after death.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Lastly, and especially, because <hi>Death opens a Door to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and easeless miseries.</hi> It is <hi>gaudiorum finis &amp; malorum omnium principium,</hi> The end of all his joy, and the beginning of all his misery. If Death were an utter extinction, and annihilation it were not so terrible; but herein is the terrour of it, because it lets the <hi>Soul</hi> out of the <hi>Prison</hi> of the body, to go to the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Prison of Hell.</hi> Death is <hi>Gods Sergeant</hi> to <hi>arrest</hi> a wicked man, and after <hi>arrest</hi> to <hi>carry</hi> him to the <hi>Iudge,</hi> there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the sentence of Condemnation, and after that to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> to be <hi>carried to the fiery Prison of Hell, there to remain for ever.</hi> It deals with every wicked man as it did with <hi>Dives,</hi> it carrieth him a <hi>Tenebris ad Tenebras,</hi> from the darkness of sin, to the darkness of Hell. All these particulars shew unto us the woful and miserable condition of those who die out of Christ.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as <hi>Chrys.</hi> saith) to bring us into the possession of Jesus Christ.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We must labour to get a <hi>Death-enduring assurance of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ.</hi> The reason why many of Gods children are so unwilling to die, is, because they do not know their title to Christ, and the happiness of those that die in him.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Old Iacob</hi> knew his Son <hi>Ioseph</hi> to be alive, he received no comfort by his being alive. Before <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> knew the person with whom she discoursed to be Christ, she was not revived by discoursing with him. Before a child of God knows that Christ is his, and hath purchased Death for his great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it is impossible for him to embrace it with comfort. This then is the second work of every good Christian, and the work of his whole life to get a <hi>Tribunal proof assurance of his being in Christ.</hi>

               <p>Quest. <hi>How may a man know that he hath an interest in Christ?</hi>

               <p>Towards the end of her Sickness, she took occasion to speak to some Friends that were about her Bed, touching an <hi>unhappy difference</hi> between her <hi>Husband,</hi> and one of his <hi>Sons</hi> (wherein she had been most injuriously defamed, as a person that had done ill Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and contributed Fuel to that Flame) professing in the <hi>presence</hi> of that <hi>God</hi> before whom she was to make her Account, that she was <hi>innocent</hi> from the thought of such an <hi>Offence,</hi> and that no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his, had ever so far transported her, as to make her to <hi>desire,</hi> much less to <hi>endeavour</hi> any thing that might be to his prejudice. And that she desired his good and welfare, with the same heart, as if both he, and the rest of the Children had been all her own. (I give you her own words.) The day before her death, she <hi>challenged her Husband to speak,</hi> whether she had ever instigated him against his Son, or done any thing to keep up that difference. And he did then (as in the presence of God) clear her, and avow this Truth, <hi>That she had many times made his peace, and brought him to a reconciliation with him (once with Tears) but never had done him any ill Office.</hi>

               <p>One thing I must add of mine own knowledge; That this <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lady</hi> was much troubled in her life time with the <hi>slavish fear of death.</hi> I told her then out of mine own frequent experience, that they that were so much afraid of <hi>death,</hi> while living, and thereupon, were <hi>careful to prepare for it,</hi> would be <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>fear of it</hi> when they came to die. And it happened accordingly: For though she had not those <hi>ravishing Ioyes</hi> which some somtimes have, yet she had such a <hi>Calmness</hi> and <hi>quietness of mind, and peace of Conscience,</hi> that she <hi>could chearfully and most willingly surrender up her s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

allay the extremity of her Pains, and to afflict her only with <hi>short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Breath</hi> (which increased upon her to her last) but her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was clear, and her Speech free a few moments before her Departu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A Reverend Minister coming to visit her, she entertained him with a chearful Aspect, and desired him, to <hi>search and examine her heart, what way of wickedness he could find in it, and pressed him to deal freely and plainly with her, and not to spare her.</hi> (I deliver her own expressions) His discourse was comfortable to her. She complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of her <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>wickedness</hi> of her <hi>heart,</hi> but still with a <hi>Confidence in the Merits of her Saviour, upon whom alone she rolled her self.</hi> After that, she desired him to <hi>pray</hi> by her; which he did, and she heard him with an <hi>unmoveable stilness</hi> and <hi>Attention,</hi> giving him thanks when he had done. She continued in the same <hi>Heavenly Temper</hi> with many <hi>Gracious Expressions,</hi> until about eight of the Clock that night, and then finding (as we had reason since to suppose, though she made no shew of it) that her death was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, she requested the <hi>minister to pray by her again</hi>; he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be somthing long (though contrary to his Intention) when towards the latter end, she made a sign unto him, which he taking notice of, and thereupon concluding, she said, <hi>I thank you Sir, and forthwith bowing down her head, within a few Minutes delivered her bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Soul into the hands of her heavenly Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus she <hi>lived,</hi> and thus she <hi>died,</hi> and thus being <hi>dead, she yet speaketh</hi>; and now is gone to that place where she hath no more need of <hi>Prayers,</hi> but all her Prayers are turned into <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> The Lord give us Grace so to imitate her holy Life, that when we come to die, we may <hi>die in Christ,</hi> and when layed in the Grave, may <hi>sleep in Iesus,</hi> and in the Great Resurrection, may both in Body and Soul be taken up into Heaven, to be for ever with the Lord in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Happiness, <hi>Amen.</hi>
