         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I ≈øuppo≈øe there is ≈øomething particular in my

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>So men do when they ≈øay in the Indictment, Labourer,
plead to it in that qualification, but if a man plead by the name of
Gent. the Que≈øtion is not whether he be a Gent. or no, but whether
he be Guilty of the Fact he is indicted for; and the Que≈øtion in
your ca≈øe was not whether you were Clerk or were not Clerk, but
whether you had a hand in the Plot or no.</p>

in the year 71.) They Ordered Mr. <hi>Peter Wel≈øh,</hi> and my ≈øelf,
and ≈øome more to ≈øtay, for Writing again≈øt the Temporal Power of
the Pope, for the Power of the King of <hi>England</hi> again≈øt the Court
of <hi>Rome.</hi> After this Plot was Di≈øcovered, I came to the King, being
afraid of being involved in the general Calamity. So I came to the
King, and ≈øaid, Sir, I de≈øire to know what I may do.</p>

               <p>May it plea≈øe your Lord≈øhip and you Gentlemen
of the Jury, <hi>Lionel Ander≈øon</hi> otherwi≈øe <hi>Mun≈øon</hi> the Pri≈øoner at the
Bar, ≈øtands indicted here, for that he being a Subject Born within the
Dominions of the King, hath taken Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and hath contrary to the Law come into <hi>England,</hi> and ≈øtayed here as
a Traytor; for this Trea≈øon he is indicted, and the Indictment is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Statute of the <hi>27th. Eliz.</hi> a Statute made almo≈øt a hundred
years ≈øince, and it was upon great occa≈øion; for it tells you plainly, That
the≈øe Prie≈øts that had taken Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not only
bu≈øie in ≈øeducing and perverting the Kings Subjects to the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtition,
but they had made many attempts upon the Government,
rai≈øing Sedition and, Rebellion and levying of War again≈øt their Soveraign,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51360:5"/>
which is evident from the Preamble of the Statute it ≈øelf. And it
is true, the lenity and mildne≈øs of our Princes hath in a great mea≈øure
let this Statute lye a≈øleep: they have not been willing to execute the
≈øeverity of the Law upon all occa≈øions at all times; but the occa≈øion
being renewed at this time, for the remedying of which, this Statute
was principally made, (that is to ≈øay, rai≈øing Seditions, and Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Rebellion again≈øt the King, the particulars of which I ≈øhall
not inlarge upon it hath been notorious in this place) that is the
rea≈øon of the pre≈øent pro≈øecution of the≈øe Per≈øons. Who have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to enjoy the indulgence of our Princes, (which hath been extended
to them, notwith≈øtanding all their former numerous affronts that they
have given) but have rais'd new Commotions, and made attempts
upon the Per≈øon of our King, and of our Government, and that is the
occa≈øion upon which the≈øe Per≈øons come to be Tryed. It is not purely
(tho' that is a main ingredient) that they are tryed <hi>quatenus</hi> Prie≈øts,
but as Ordained by the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and coming into <hi>England</hi> and
abiding here. For a Prie≈øt, if he be Ordained by the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
if he comes not here, can do no hurt; but it is his coming and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here, that makes him the Subject of this Puni≈øhment, and hath
occa≈øioned this mans Pro≈øecution. Now my Lord, we ≈øhall prove that
this <hi>Ander≈øon</hi> alias <hi>Mun≈øon</hi> hath taken Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who≈øe authority con≈øtituted him a Prie≈øt, and this we ≈øhall prove by
≈øeveral in≈øtances and ≈øteps; and then we doubt not but you will take
that care for the pre≈øervation of the Government, and for the Peace
and Quiet of the Nation, which becomes you, and give a Verdict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as your Evidence ≈øhall lead you.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then Sir <hi>George Strode,</hi> the Kings Serjeant at Law,

               <speaker>Mr. Ser. Strode.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we ≈øhall call our Evidence. The Fact
is this, That this Per≈øon being a Subject of the Kings, and having
received Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, being a <hi>Romi≈øh</hi>
Prie≈øt, did come and abide here contrary to the Statute; not that his
Prie≈øthood is the Crime, no tis his being a Subject of the Kings, and
owning an Authority from abroad, and thereby denying the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his own Soveraign. To prove this, we ≈øhall call Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance, (who were all
Sworn.</hi>) <hi>Set up Mr.</hi> Dangerfield <hi>fir≈øt. Mr.</hi> Dangerfield, <hi>tell my

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dangerfield.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>June,</hi> when I was a Pri≈øoner for Debt in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
this per≈øon took occa≈øion to ≈øpeak privately to me, and de≈øired me
to go into his Room: he told me he had received a Letter from my
Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and that Letter was burnt. But the next Letter that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51360:6"/>
came from my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> he would ≈øhew it me. And he did ≈øo;
and the Contents of the Letter was, as near as I can remember, ju≈øt
thus: Sir, You mu≈øt de≈øire <hi>Willoughby</hi> to ≈øcour his Kettle; which
was, to Confe≈øs and receive the Sacrament, to be true to the Cau≈øe.
A little after, that was Saturday, and I think it was the next day,
being Sunday, I went into Mr. <hi>Ander≈øons, ali√†s Mun≈øon</hi>'s Chamber,
and there I went to Confe≈ø≈øion, and received Ab≈øolution. And he
≈øent me to another per≈øon to receive the Sacrament, who was ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ma≈øs at that time. And when I had received the Sacrament and
returned to him again, he did tell me, That he, as a Prie≈øt, did give
me free toleration to go and be drunk, and drink with one <hi>Stroude;</hi>
and I asked him, being ≈øomething ≈øcrupulous in the matter, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I might lawfully do it, having but ju≈øt received the Sacrament?
he told me, Yes, he gave me authority ≈øo to do, being for the good
of the Cau≈øe.</p>

               <p>But, my Lord, this one thing I have to ≈øay again≈øt this

enumerating Trea≈øons, which ≈øays, That all Trea≈øons ≈øhall
be as in that Act: And further adds, That none ≈øhall be Convicted of
Trea≈øon, but by two lawful and credible Witne≈ø≈øes. Now the wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Legi≈ølators, having an Eye to future Safety and pa≈øt Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
does provide, That no one ≈øhall ≈øuffer as a Traytor, but

Legal, it does judge that both would be very nece≈ø≈øary. Now that

three things again≈øt me. I am tryed upon a Penal Statute, which

               <p>Look you, we mu≈øt do with you as we have done with
others, and will do with the re≈øt. If you mean that this Statute
≈øhould never have any Effect, that is, that the Prie≈øts ≈øhall not be
convicted as ≈øuch, unle≈øs we can produce Witne≈ø≈øes, that ≈øaw them
take Orders, then you have avoided all the Statute; but if ≈øo be it be
plainly proved, That you have done the Acts of a Prie≈øt, tho≈øe that
none are allow'd of to do, or undertake to do, but a Prie≈øt, is not this
a ≈øatisfaction, and a plain one too, to your ≈øelf and all the World, that
this I≈ø≈øue, whether you are a Prie≈øt, or not a Prie≈øt, is well proved
in the Affirmative.</p>

               <p>Is that any argument, or any thing to the

               <p>There is nothing now in que≈øtion, but whether you
be an Engli≈øhman and a Prie≈øt; and if you can prove that you are
not ≈øo, you ≈øay well. But I think you deny not now but that you
are a Prie≈øt, only you would have us prove that you are an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhman.
Your Speech betrays you, and there is ≈øo much Evidence
again≈øt you, that I have not heard in any Ca≈øe as I know of. And
all your Witne≈ø≈øes will be to little purpo≈øe.</p>

               <p>Only this I de≈øire to ob≈øerve, That I have been a
man always countenanced by the be≈øt of Kings, and His Privy
Council; and if the Parliament had not been di≈ø≈øolved, I had
been protected by the Parliament: Now I ≈øay, if your Lord≈øhips
think me worthy of any con≈øideration (as I have been a man that
have given ≈øeveral te≈øtimonies of my Loyalty, and Obedience to
the Government) I de≈øire your Lord≈øhips would plea≈øe to ≈øtay

               <p>You know where you mu≈øt apply your ≈øelf for that,
we are barely upon our Oaths, and ≈øo is the Jury too, to try
the Fact, whether you be a Prie≈øt; and this I will tell you, and I
mu≈øt ≈øay to you, I dare appeal to your own Con≈øcience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this I≈ø≈øue, your being a Romi≈øh Prie≈øt, is not as plainly and
evidently proved, to the ≈øatisfaction of all mankind, as any thing
can be?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ander≈øon.</speaker>
               <p>But 'tis all by pre≈øumption ≈øtill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Gentlemen of the Jury, the matter that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts
upon, are Two things; Fir≈øt, ≈øays he, You have not proved
me to be an Engli≈øhman, and yet at the ≈øame time he appeals
to ≈øuch as knew his Father, to be an Engli≈øh Gentleman; and his
Language, his Tongue betrays him. 'Tis true, ≈øome kind of
Evidence is to be given, that he is an Engli≈øhman, he him≈øelf
tels you, that he is born of Engli≈øh Parents; but 'tis a forreign
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51360:10"/>
matter, that he ≈øhould be born beyond Sea. And if it were ≈øo
really, then it comes on his ≈øide, if he can produce any witne≈øs
he ≈øays ≈øomething, otherwi≈øe we leave it to you, whether you
are not ≈øatisfied in your Con≈øciences, by hearing him ≈øpeak, and
under≈øtanding who his Father was, that he is an Engli≈øhman.
The next thing is for his being a Prie≈øt: I do not know, nor can
there be expected a plainer proof than this that hath been given,
becau≈øe he doth tho≈øe Acts which none but a Prie≈øt among≈øt them
does; he ≈øays Ma≈øs, he Con≈øecrates the Sacrament, he takes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion,
he gives Ab≈øolution, and all this proved by Four Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the Clerk, he that ≈øerves at Ma≈øs at that
time, gives <hi>pro forma</hi> Ab≈øolution to the Prie≈øt, without which,
the Prie≈øt cannot approach to the Altar, after he hath made

whom you admitted to ≈øee you in the Exerci≈øe of what you call
your Religion; becau≈øe the Execution of the Law was not ≈øo ≈øtrict,

               <p>I do believe I ≈øhall receive all Ju≈øtice from the Court.
And I have experienced it ≈øo already. Now as to the pre≈øent
Te≈øtimony again≈øt me, I conceive that only Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is a material
Witne≈øs; no one el≈øe ≈øwears that they ever ≈øaw me Officiate or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Duty of a Prie≈øt. As for Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> he ≈øays he heard me
≈øay Ma≈øs ≈øeveral times the la≈øt Summer before the Plot. And Mr.
<hi>Oates</hi> did ≈øay he was pre≈øent in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi> Sir <hi>William

that, and did Te≈øtifie that he ≈øaw me in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi>
Now then I humbly conceive, if he heard me ≈øay Ma≈øs at any time
in that Summer, it mu≈øt be in one of tho≈øe three Months. Was it in
any one of them?</p>

                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Oates.</speaker>
               <p>In the <hi>Savoy,</hi> at that time before I went into <hi>Spain.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>Do you pretend to have known the <hi>Savoy</hi> ever before

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I do.</p>

               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>So he does, but he can't prove it. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> came
over in the Company, as he ≈øays, of Mr. <hi>Thimbleby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hitchcock,</hi>
and by his means he did get to be commended to be received into the
Order of the Benedictines, and he was then ≈øent to Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi>
in order to it; Now, my Lord, is it credible that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> having
no acquaintance with the <hi>Savoy</hi> before he had acquaintance with
Mr. <hi>Hitchock,</hi> which was when he came from <hi>Spain,</hi> ≈øhould hear me
≈øay Ma≈øs before he went thither?</p>

               <p>He hath gone as near it as is nece≈ø≈øary; he

               <p>But I ≈øay, he could not be at the <hi>Savoy</hi> before he was

               <p>That all the Summer, from the beginning of <hi>April</hi> to

                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I am not ≈øo po≈øitive in that, my Lord, but as near as
I remember, before I went into <hi>Spain</hi> again. Your Lord≈øhips all
know that I was not ≈øo po≈øitive as to any one time; but the Summer
before the Plot broke out, I heard him ≈øay Ma≈øs ≈øeveral times in the

               <p>Now he is po≈øitive that he ≈øaw you ≈øay Ma≈øs in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

               <p>If he names times, then am I able to di≈øprove him: and

That I was not then in Town, he goes off from it.</p>

give Evidence about it afterwards. Now, I believe, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> at
that time had no thoughts of giving Evidence as to any ≈øuch matter;

               <p>I can prove that I was out of Town the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> will not ≈øtand to any time, I cannot be able to di≈øprove

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>When did you come to <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>Augu≈øt?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you as near as I can to a day. I came in the
middle of <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, which begins the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Well, if you have any Witne≈ø≈øes, call them,
and do not ≈øpend the Courts time in vain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have ≈øomething very material, I think, to
offer. The only material Witne≈øs that is now again≈øt me, was a
Witne≈øs again≈øt me in my la≈øt Tryal; now I do conceive that I being
found, Not Guilty at the la≈øt Tryal, that Witne≈øs ought to be look'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51360:16"/>
upon as Perjured. And I appeal to the Court, whether it were ≈øo or
no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ju≈øt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>That's a fal≈øe Collection, Mr. <hi>Mar≈øhall.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a ≈øtrange inference you make, Do you think, that
every Witne≈øs is Perjured, becau≈øe the Jury don't find according to
what he ≈øays? He is not Perjured, for he may Swear true, and the
Jury not believe him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>I ground it my Lord, upon what my Lord <hi>Jones</hi> ≈øaid to
the Jury that Sate upon <hi>Coleman,</hi> who at their going out told them,
Either they were to find him Guilty, or bring in two men Perjured.
Thus it was his opinion, that the finding of the Jury contrary to the
Evidence, did make them perjured; and there was none of the Court
did oppo≈øe him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ju≈øt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>What then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>And if this were the ≈øen≈øe of the whole Court, That
a man mu≈øt either be found Guilty, or the Witne≈ø≈øes Perjured, that
is my Ca≈øe, and he is not to be believed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>See how uncon≈øequently do you talk. The Court might
≈øay, That you mu≈øt believe the≈øe men Perjured, if they Swear a
po≈øitive thing, and you find it not; but if you make u≈øe of it thus,
that therefore they are Perjured, 'tis fal≈øe, for they are not ≈øo, till
they be Convicted upon Record. And though the Jury do not believe
them, yet they may Swear true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then you make no inference from it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am before the ≈øame Court that I was tryed
by before, and before the ≈øelf-≈øame Judges, who know that upon
my Tryal he was not believed, and therefore is perjured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ju≈øt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>You mu≈øt con≈øider, that ≈øometimes the
Jury will go again≈øt the direction of the Court; but if the Witne≈øs
be not believed by them, that does not argue that he does not Swear
truth, or is perjured. I tell you, My Brother <hi>Jones</hi> might ≈øay, You
mu≈øt find this man Guilty, or think the≈øe men Perjured: many times
a Judge will ≈øay ≈øo, but the Jury often find again≈øt the direction of
the Court; Shall the≈øe men be perjured then pre≈øently?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ju≈øt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>There was two po≈øitive Witne≈ø≈øes, as po≈øitive as
could be in the world, and nothing at all to contradict them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Will you give the Jury leave to believe you Mr.
<hi>Mar≈øhall?</hi> for you your ≈øelf ≈øaid, you were a Prie≈øt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, if I ≈øaid ≈øo. I humbly de≈øire the Jury to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, that they are the ≈øelf ≈øame Witne≈ø≈øes that brought ≈øuch a
po≈øitive Te≈øtimony the la≈øt time, which if the Jury had believed,
they mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity have brought me in Guilty; I would not ≈øpend
the time of the Court, but I would ob≈øerve this, It was all Sworn
po≈øitively, That I did con≈øent to the Kings Death, and other things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You had the better luck.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>Then they are not to be believed now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>This is to no purpo≈øe, neither is it to be ≈øuffered: For
you break in contrary to all the Laws of Practice, if we ≈øuffer this
as an Argument, That becau≈øe an Evidence was not believed in one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51360:16"/>
Ca≈øe, therefore he is Perjured: And the Jury gave in a Verdict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Witne≈ø≈øes Te≈øtimony, that therefore he is Perjured in
another Ca≈øe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>This does invalidate the Te≈øtimony ≈øure of ≈øuch a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You have ≈øaid it often enough, come pray conclude.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ju≈øt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>No, Mr. <hi>Mar≈øhall,</hi> you mu≈øt not be ≈øuffered
in the≈øe Harangues to impeach the Witne≈ø≈øes; if you have any thing
material again≈øt Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> or if you can ≈øhew any Record of his
Conviction of Perjury, it may be ≈øomething.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it is for my Life, and 'tis the ≈øecond time that
I plead for my Life, much beyond my expectation; and therefore I
hope I may have the freedom to ≈øpeak. And though I confe≈øs this
Jury is not obliged to proceed according to the Verdict of the former
Jury, yet this Jury, as well as that, is obliged to proceed according to
the appearance of truth. And his being found fal≈øe in his Te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the la≈øt time, ≈øhould make him of no Credit here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ju≈øt. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>It is not ≈øo, they are not to take notice of it,
unle≈øs you bring them a Record of Conviction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ju≈øt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>He gave a good Evidence then no doubt of
it, though they would not believe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ju≈øt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>Upon what grounds that Jury went, is unknown
to us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>Then, my Lord, another thing is this. The Law does
except again≈øt all Witne≈ø≈øes who are ≈øtrongly or rationally ≈øuppo≈øed
to have a Spight or Malice again≈øt the Pri≈øoner, much more where
there is a manife≈øt ≈øign that he hath a Malice. Now I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ≈øhew how it comes to my Ca≈øe: Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> accu≈øed me
la≈øt time of Trea≈øon, and that in the highe≈øt nature; if this had been
true, he had ≈øhewed him≈øelf a good Subject, and me Di≈øloyal. And
the Jury not believing him, I was found the good Subject. Now he
pur≈øues his Malice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You ≈øhall not go on in this manner, and make ≈øuch noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
fal≈øe inferences, that becau≈øe it was not found according to his
Te≈øtimony, therefore he is Perjured. The Jury did not beleive it,
might not he ≈øpeak true for all that? Hath not many a Witne≈øs Sworn
true, yet the Verdict gone again≈øt their Evidence? and therefore you
don't mind, Ye are all guiddy-headed, if you once get a thing into
your heads, you can't get it out again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ju≈øt. Atkins.</speaker>

               <p>All you build upon is but a fal≈øe Conclu≈øion; becau≈øe
the Jury found you not Guilty, therefore they found him Perjured.</p>

               <p>Pray Sir, if you will ≈øpeak any thing that

would never repeat it over and over again. That becau≈øe the Jury did
not believe his Evidence, therefore he is Perjured. Do you ≈øuppo≈øe
then that any other Jury ≈øhould never believe him?</p>

               <p>My Lord, I reckon his Evidence is not ≈øo good, and
if I am found Not Guilty, there mu≈øt be malice in him to accu≈øe
me.</p>

               <p>Look you Gentlemen, The ≈øingle Que≈øtion is, Whether he
be a <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Prie≈øt or no? it is proved by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> that he hath ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times heard him ≈øay Ma≈øs, that he hath ≈øeen him deliver the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ≈øeen him Con≈øecrate the Ho≈øt. He in≈øi≈øted upon it how often,
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ≈øays, Ten or a Dozen times, in what time he cannot charge
him≈øelf particularly with a Month or two; but at la≈øt he did tell him
po≈øitively, becau≈øe <hi>Mar≈øhall</hi> ≈øaid, how is it po≈ø≈øible I can make my defence
to generals unle≈øs you fix ≈øometime? therefore ≈øays he, I was Reconciled
to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on <hi>A≈øh-Wedne≈øday,</hi> and afterwards between that
and <hi>April,</hi> when I went into <hi>Spain,</hi> I heard him ≈øay Ma≈øs, that was
once. But I heard him ≈øay in the Summer ≈øeveral times. Being asked
what part, he ≈øays, I cannot ≈øay exactly, but I think in the Month of
<hi>Augu≈øt;</hi> If he had ≈øaid any thing as to the particular time, between
<hi>A≈øh-Wedne≈øday</hi> and his going into <hi>Spain</hi> it had been ≈øomething, but
again≈øt that he makes no pretence, as to his ≈øaying Ma≈øs in the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
that can contradict it. If he can ≈øtill, he ≈øhall call his Witne≈ø≈øes that
can prove he did not ≈øay Ma≈øs between the <hi>A≈øh-Wedne≈øday,</hi> and the
<hi>April</hi> he went into <hi>Spain.</hi> He does indeed ≈øay, that he was a great
part of the Summer in the Countrey, in <hi>June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> to <hi>Bartholomew
Fair,</hi> Three≈øcore Miles off, but to that, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ≈øays it was ≈øometime
in <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> and ≈øo he might be in the Countrey till then, and yet ≈øay
Ma≈øs after, he might come to Town the <hi>6th,</hi> or <hi>7th,</hi> or Eight and
Twentieth, and he might be here in <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi> So you hear no Evidence
that contradicts ≈øuppo≈øing it proved true, what he imagines his Witne≈ø≈øes
can ≈øay. The la≈øt time that he charges him to have ≈øaid it in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
may be true according to his own word and Confe≈ø≈øion when he
came to Town. Then there is Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he only tells you he ≈øaw him
in a Prie≈øts habit, but he did not ≈øee him Execute the Office of a Prie≈øt,
but he looked upon him as a Prie≈øt, called him Father; and that is all
that he Charges him with, that is concurring Evidence, and backs Mr.
<hi>Oates;</hi> but alone perhaps it would be very weak. But they ≈øet up here
<hi>Prance,</hi> and he ≈øays directly, that at the Tryal, he did confe≈øs him≈øelf
to be a Prie≈øt; and he ≈øeems to deny it, and would appeal to the Court;
but his appealing to the Court would not help him in that Ca≈øe. So I
leave this to you upon this Evidence, if you believe Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> that
Swears he ≈øaw him before he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and after ≈øay Ma≈øs with
the concurring Evidence of Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> that ≈øaw him in his Habit,
and with the ≈øub≈øequent Evidence of tho≈øe two more that do Swear
that he did ≈øay ≈øo, you mu≈øt find him Guilty. And a mans own
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51360:17"/>
Confe≈ø≈øion is Evidence again≈øt him≈øelf. And if Mr. <hi>Mar≈øhall</hi> will recollect
him≈øelf, he would not be too po≈øitive in that point. If all the≈øe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
≈øatisfie your Con≈øcience, I ≈øay, that he is a <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Prie≈øt,
you mu≈øt find him Guilty, if you are un≈øatisfied you mu≈øt acquit
him.</p>

               <p>And how did you know that I ≈øaid Ma≈øs? Did you know
that I took Orders? for if I took no Orders, it was no Ma≈øs; for it
is the Prie≈øt makes the Ma≈øs, and not the Ma≈øs the Prie≈øt; and then if
I was no Prie≈øt, it could be no Ma≈øs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard him ≈øay, he ≈øaid Ma≈øs in the Kings Army.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>

               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>You never heard me ≈øay ≈øo in your life, for I never did.
But pray my Lord give me leave to ≈øpeak: I appeared for the King,
when he had but 500 men in appearance for him. I am but a younger
Brother, an E≈øquires 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Brother; I ≈øpent in the King's ≈øervice above
<hi>5000l.</hi> which I got my ≈øelf, and bled for it before I had it. I ≈øpent
my Annuity of Seven≈øcore pound a year for the King, I lo≈øt my Leg
for him, and ≈øpent my E≈øtate to that Degree, that that day when I
receiv'd the ≈øentence of Bani≈øhment, I had but Two half Crowns left.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> You may urge this to the King, for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Clemency, 'tis nothing to the point here before the Jury to be
Tryed. What≈øoever you have merited by your ≈øervices, you mu≈øt
apply your ≈øelf to the King for his mercy, it is nothing here.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, give me leave to add one thing more, I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51360:22"/>
did di≈øcover to the King a Plot de≈øigned again≈øt His Per≈øon, State,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>But my Lord, by the Civil Law it is a conclu≈øion, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

               <p>No, they need not; it is ≈øufficient if they prove it by

               <p>But if there were any need of it, and you would
have any more, he hath confe≈ø≈øed upon the que≈øtion asked him,
whether he was a Franci≈øcan, no, he was a Dominican.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>Have you done? Then Gentlemen of the Jury, you
mu≈øt not at this time of the day be in≈ønared by that Argument, that
there mu≈øt be a po≈øitive proof of this Reception of Orders from the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becau≈øe it hath been all along accounted, and is
an undoubted proof for your ≈øatisfaction, if it appear he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed
the Offices of the Function; tho≈øe Offices that are not done
but by Prie≈øts. Now this hath been proved by two witne≈ø≈øes, and by
the confe≈ø≈øion of the Prie≈øt him≈øelf to <hi>Dr. Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi> So
I mu≈øt leave it upon the point of Fact to you, whether it be not ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proof. But this Ca≈øe will differ from all the re≈øt, and the Court
is very tender in the ca≈øe of Life, that it ≈øhould be without all que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what is determined; therefore as to your enquiry for him, it mu≈øt
go only whether he be a Prie≈øt or no, for the others, you mu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider
them as Engli≈øhmen, and enquire of them as ≈øuch; he is a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as he ≈øays, and they ≈øay ≈øo too. Now then there are ≈øome words
in this Statute, whereupon the Court hath conceived a doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Ca≈øe comes within them, which are the words about the
Kings Dominions, which now are far more enlarged than were tho≈øe
of the Queen when the Statute was made: If then you find him a
Prie≈øt, you mu≈øt find the other matter ≈øpecially.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. J. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Gentlemen, we are to be of Coun≈øel for
the Pri≈øoner, and it being matter of Law, we ≈øhall take time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øe
upon it before we give our opinions in it; but for the matter of
Fact, I doubt not but you will find that he is a Prie≈øt; and then the
other matters, that he was born at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the
other matters you may find ≈øpecially, there needs no more.</p>

               <p>Sir, I had no notice of my Tryal, but this morning. I
≈øent to my Lord <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> to know when I ≈øhould be Tryed,
he told me, I ≈øhould have Ten dayes notice of it. Now I have
Witne≈ø≈øes to di≈øprove Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Te≈øtimony: for Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> I own
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51360:24"/>
he hath heard me ≈øay <hi>Ma≈øs;</hi> but for <hi>Mr. Bedloes</hi> Te≈øtimony, as I
hope to ≈øee the face of Almighty God, I know him not. When I
was taken, ≈øaid he to me, Mr. <hi>Ander≈øon,</hi> Let me ≈øee your Protection,
and I ≈øhewed it him; You have two Names, ≈øaid he, I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be you or no. And then be≈øides, the≈øe are not legal Witne≈ø≈øes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, that mu≈øt not be allowed you to ≈øay. You
have been fairly heard, and tryed. They were upon their Oaths,
and the Jury, Twelve Men, upon their Oaths, without any Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made to them; they have Convicted you; therefore this is to
Calumniate the Proceedings of the Court.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ander≈øon.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you this more; they are not the Kings Evidence

if any Prie≈øt be Convicted, they are to have ≈øo much Mony.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>I have very little more to ≈øay, then what I have ≈øaid
already. I thought the Law had not allowed any Man to have
been Condemned upon the Te≈øtimony of one Witne≈øs, but required
two. Now there was but one po≈øitive Witne≈øs again≈øt me, the re≈øt
only ≈øaid, I had confe≈ø≈øed my ≈øelf to be a Prie≈øt. Two of them did
Swear, they heard me confe≈øs it at my other Tryal: If it had been
at this Tryal, it had been another thing, and there had been ≈øome
validity in the proof; but, to ≈øay, they heard me Confe≈øs it at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, I humbly conceive, according to the <hi>Law,</hi> bears no force.
I have this further to add, His Maje≈øty, ≈øome years ago, put forth a
Declaration under the Broad-Seal, for a To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>leration of Religion,
and <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience,</hi> whereby the Roman Catholicks had the
u≈øe of their Religion in their private Hou≈øes. Now, I have been
informed, that according to <hi>Law,</hi> what≈øoever is put forth under
the Broad-Seal, mu≈øt be recalled by ≈øomething under the Broad-Seal,
or it remains in force, which was never done as to this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and then I lye under the Protection of that Declaration.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>As for the fir≈øt part, 'tis plain, to the ≈øatisfaction
of every body, that there hath been two Sufficient Witne≈ø≈øes, upon
who≈øe Te≈øtimony you are Convicted. For whether you were ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Que≈øtion or not, yet if you will ≈øay you are a Prie≈øt, that
Confe≈ø≈øion of yours is Evidence again≈øt you, though you might
po≈ø≈øibly ≈øay ≈øo without being Asked the Que≈øtion.</p>

               <p>Is it credible I ≈øhould do ≈øo?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, the Jury believed it ≈øo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>One of the Jury ≈øtood by and heard the Words.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51360:25"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>And now, becau≈øe I will put it out of all doubt,
'tis not the bu≈øine≈øs, nor the Duty of the Court to give any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of any Fact that they know of their own knowledge, unle≈øs
they will be Sworn for that purpo≈øe: for though they do know it in
their own private Con≈øciences to be true, yet they are obliged to
conceal their own knowledge, unle≈øs they will be Sworn as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes.
But now you are Convicted, I mu≈øt take the liberty to
tell you, that at your la≈øt Tryal you did own your ≈øelf to be a Prie≈øt.
And I mu≈øt put you in mind further of ≈øomething which you may
very well remember, when I detained you after your Acquittal, and
Recommitted you when Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was di≈øcharged; I did
then tell you, you having owned your ≈øelves to be Prie≈øts, I was
bound to take notice of that Confe≈ø≈øion of yours, and therefore
obliged to detain you. Such a Token as that is, may perhaps bring
it to your Memory: but as it was hinted to you before, you are a
Voluminous Talker, and abundance of things may drop out of
your Mouth, that you don't con≈øider before they are pa≈øt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis for my life, and therefore I may be permitted to

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>That is as to the fir≈øt point. And then as to the
Kings Declaration, which was the other matter you in≈øi≈øted upon,
I pre≈øume it does not ≈øtick with any body that knows the matter;
but lea≈øt it ≈øhould, I would ≈øay this to it. 'Tis very well known
in the fir≈øt place (I do not go now to determine the <hi>Law</hi> upon it,
becau≈øe you know what Opinions and Judgment it received after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
yet this I will adventure to ≈øay, That it was never the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of that Declaration that ever Prie≈øts ≈øhould come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide
here, but it was only intended for tender Con≈øciences, as the
very Letter of the Declaration it ≈øelf does ≈øhew, not to Countenance
Prie≈øts and Je≈øuits, that have ca≈øt off all their Allegiance to the
King, and endeavour both to de≈øtroy Him and His Government.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir, Will you give me leave to ≈øpeak as to that.
If ≈øo be the u≈øe of their Religion were permitted to Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
that Religion not being to be practi≈øed without Prie≈øts, it is
to be ≈øuppo≈øed, that the Prie≈øts are permitted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>But if a Man were to Argue with you now, in your
own way, Pray are there not Prie≈øts in <hi>England,</hi> be≈øides tho≈øe Prie≈øts
that were born here? You know, of your own Acquaintance, there
are ≈øeveral Roman Catholick Prie≈øts, not Engli≈øhmen born, that are

               <p>Pray Sir give me leave a little, I have one word more.
For all matters of Trea≈øon, and Treacherous Con≈øpiracy, I was
freed before in this Court; now I would ob≈øerve, what the be≈øt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51360:25"/>
Lawyers that ever were in <hi>England</hi> have ob≈øerved for me, That
there is no Crime in Prie≈øthood it ≈øelf: for my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Fifth
Report 39. leaf, commenting largely upon the Statute of the twenty
≈øeventh of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and inlarging upon the ≈øence and meaning of that
Statute, and calling to mind, who the men were that were formerly
Executed by force of that Statute, and why, concludes thus. Hence
it appears, that no man yet hath or can be Executed for his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Prie≈øthood, but becau≈øe there was annexed to the Prie≈øthood
treacherous De≈øigns and treacherous Attempts. And the ≈øame
Lawyer in the 3<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> In≈øtitutes, <hi>22th.</hi> leaf, ≈øays, That in this Statute of
the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 'twas very wi≈øely and ju≈øtly done by the
Statute-Makers, to provide that the Judges ≈øhould proceed in their
Judgments upon that matter, only according to what is expre≈ø≈øed
and ≈øpecified in that Statute. And tho≈øe words were a Sanctuary to
the Judges, and put in to prevent the ≈øhedding of guiltle≈øs blood.
Now if ≈øo be that ≈øo great a Lawyer, in a di≈øcour≈øe about Prie≈øthood
and Treachery, does thence conclude, That Prie≈øthood as Prie≈øthood
is no Crime, nor no Function belonging to it hath any Crime in it,
well may I conclude ≈øo too. And indeed if it had, then a great part
of the World would be Traitors, nay, it would bring in Chri≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf
who was a Prie≈øt, to be a Traytor too. Therefore Prie≈øthood
as Prie≈øthood hath no Trea≈øon e≈ø≈øentially linkt to it. And when he
≈øays, that they mu≈øt proceed according to what is ≈øpecified, he does
in the forementioned place ≈øhew, that it was not ≈øpecified at all, that
any that were Executed, were for Prie≈øthood Executed. And I am
accu≈øed of nothing el≈øe in the World, but bare Prie≈øthood as Prie≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
without any De≈øign or Treachery joyned to it. And if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Law Prie≈øthood be not liable to Condemnation, then I am not
to be Condemned.</p>

               <p>This long Speech of yours will ≈øignifie but little,
when you con≈øider the Act of Parliament, upon which you are
Indicted, ('tis true, ≈øet that Act of Parliament out of the Ca≈øe, and
then to be a Prie≈øt is not High-Trea≈øon; nay, in ca≈øe a man be born
out of the Kings Dominions, and be a Prie≈øt, and remain here, that
is not High-Trea≈øon within this Statute, becau≈øe Prie≈øthood it ≈øelf
does not make the Crime; (God forbid any one ≈øhould affirm it) but
when all that is granted, when an Act of Parliament hath taken
particularly notice of the great mi≈øchiefs and inconveniencies that
have attended the Government, and the continual danger that the
Supream head hath been in, by having Per≈øons which were born
within the Kings Dominions, (as you were) to wave their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and to acknowledge a Supremacy in any Foraign Prince
or Prelate, as you all do, when you take Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of
<hi>Rome;</hi> the Wi≈ødom of the Nation hath thought rea≈øonable that ≈øuch
≈øhould be adjudged Traitors. And this Act of Parliament upon
which you ≈øtand Convicted, does plainly ≈øay, If any one born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Kings Dominions will take Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and ≈øhall after re≈øide here, he is guilty of High Trea≈øon. And this is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51360:26"/>
not only thought ≈øo by us that are here, but by all my Lords the
Judges that were pre≈øent at your Tryal; for God forbid we ≈øhould
Condemn you for any thing as High Trea≈øon, if you had not been
within the Compa≈øs of the Act of Parliament. And what is Trea≈øon,
the Act of Parliament particularly De≈øcribes, which all hath been
proved upon you. And becau≈øe you are plea≈øed to ≈øpeak it to the
Court, and lay it on the Con≈øciences of the Court, I Di≈øcharge my
Con≈øcience, the Jury having Convicted you for High Trea≈øon, I am
very ready to pa≈øs Judgment upon you according to the Law, and I
will clear my Con≈øcience of that pre≈øently. Tie him up.</p>

               <p>What have I to ≈øay for my ≈øelf? I have this to ≈øay, That
tho≈øe that did depo≈øe again≈øt me, did not ≈øay one word of Truth, I
take God to witne≈øs for it. I am a Dead man by the Law, and I
can Suffer, and I can prai≈øe God for his Holy will in that. I am
as ready to Suffer the Law, as the Law is to inflict Suffering upon me,
for it is for Gods glory; but I may pretend, and will pretend to,
that I am not ≈øubject to the Law, in a≈ømuch as I have declared, that
I am a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and they are to prove that I am not. I was
threatned by Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> when I was under the protection
of an Emba≈ø≈øador; and notwith≈øtanding his protection, which was a
violation of the Law of Nations, that one under his protection ≈øhould
be ≈øo u≈øed, and that ≈ølighted as if it were nothing. But becau≈øe they
did not regard it, I ≈øhewed it under his Hand and Seal; I alledged
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51360:26"/>
in the next place, that I was a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> but becau≈øe I would not take
my Oath that I was born a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Waller</hi> did threaten me
with Irons; and therefore all that I ≈øaid was compelled and forced from
me; then I ≈øaid I was a <hi>Monmouth-≈øhire</hi> man, becau≈øe my Father and
my Mother were ≈øo, they are of that Countrey; but however it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to them to prove whether I was a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or no.</p>

come to this, as I told you before, I had di≈øcovered a Plot to the King
that was de≈øigned again≈øt his Per≈øon, State, and Government, and did
deliver into his hands Eleven Articles of Trea≈øon, which I had Writ
with my own hands; and this he hath owned, and will<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> own So Mr.

                  <hi>Recorder,</hi> upon this, I was Threatned by tho≈øe that were parties to the
Trea≈øon, That the King ≈øhould not be gone twenty four hours, but I
≈øhould be impri≈øoned. When the King went, what mu≈øt I do? Mu≈øt
I ≈øtay there and hazard my life, or tru≈øt to the Kings Mercy? I was
forced to come along with the King for Protection. I came to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
and the King ro≈øe up and gave me his hand to ki≈øs, and ≈øo did
the Duke of York, and told me I was Welcome. I went to my
Lord Chancellor <hi>Hyde,</hi> who, when he ≈øaw me, Embraced me in his
Arms, and ≈øaid, Thou art welcome, I am glad to ≈øee thee in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
I had occa≈øion to ≈øpeak with the Bi≈øhop of <hi>London,</hi> Dr. <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>

What is your Name? My Lord, ≈øaid I, my name is <hi>Starkey,</hi> with

you faithfully, as I promi≈øed the other Gentleman that went

give an accompt of it, and is the fitte≈øt Judge of his own Mercy.
But I could recommend to you, Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> a thing that would be
very acceptable, and then as far forth as tis mode≈øt for me to ≈øpeak,
I am pretty well a≈ø≈øured, I might ≈øay, I could prevail for Mercy

and that is the Kings General and free Act of Pardon, made in the
Twenty fifth year of his Reign, wherein he pardons all Trea≈øons,
mispri≈øions of Trea≈øons, Felonies, and mispri≈øions of Felony, except
what is excepted thereafter, and Prie≈øthood is not there excepted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>You know very well, that the proof of your Trea≈øon
hath been ≈øince the twenty fifth of this King, and within three years
pa≈øt. I pre≈øume you do not think that the Kings Act of Pardon
pardons all Trea≈øons pa≈øt and to come, as the Popes Bull does Sins.
Tye him up then.</p>

               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>But how ≈øhall I do then, when I am Lame? I want a
Leg, and I mu≈øt u≈øe my Stick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Then let him alone.</p>

               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>But I pray, good Mr. Recorder, will you be plea≈øed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you give Sentence upon me, to acquaint the King with what I
have to ≈øay for my ≈øelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>No, I cannot do that, the Kings plea≈øure is to be
known afterwards. Set <hi>Lum≈øden</hi> a≈øide, and ≈øet all the re≈øt to the

               <speaker>Mr. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder.</speaker>
               <p>YOU the Pri≈øoners at the Bar; You have been ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> May I ≈øpeak one word? I have pre≈øented
this year, wherein at the <hi>26th.</hi> of this Month I have been a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner,
≈øeveral Petitions by my Friends to the King, and de≈øired to be
Tran≈øported; for my Age and infirmities and want of a Leg did not
≈øtand well with my being in <hi>England</hi> the≈øe trouble≈øom times. The
King, I am told, hath promi≈øed I ≈øhould, but I ≈øee no fruits of
tho≈øe Petitions. And pray con≈øider this, That I ≈øhould have been
impri≈øoned if I ≈øtayed out of <hi>England,</hi> and now to be pro≈øecuted
in <hi>England</hi> in this manner, and to be Drawn, Hang'd, and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is very hard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Whether it be true or not, God knows, I ≈øhall
acquaint the King with it. It only remains with me to take notice
of it for that purpo≈øe. And for my part I am ≈øorry with all my
heart to ≈øee ≈øo many per≈øons brought to receive the Sentence of
Death by my Mouth. But I mu≈øt ≈øay this, You your ≈øelves have
been the occa≈øion of it, and therefore mu≈øt blame your ≈øelves for it.
You have had the benefit of the be≈øt Laws, the Law of <hi>England,</hi>
which gives every Subject the liberty to make a defence for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf,
when ever he is accu≈øed of any Crime; He hath the liberty to
hear the Witne≈ø≈øes what they ≈øay again≈øt him; to call any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes
for him, and to make defence for him≈øelf. And not only ≈øo,
but he hath likewi≈øe Twelve Men upon their Oaths, that are his
Peers, again≈øt whom he hath the liberty to make a Challenge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
≈øhewing any rea≈øon, to a certain number; and if it ≈øhall appear
that any of them have the lea≈øt prejudice or malice again≈øt any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons
that are to be Tried for their Lives, to a greater number. Such
and ≈øo great is the benefit of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> beyond all the
Laws of any other Nation in the world. But all the≈øe forms having
been pa≈ø≈øed, and a Jury of men, again≈øt whom you made no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
having found you Guilty of the Offences for which you
were Indicted, there remains now nothing more with the Court,
but to pa≈øs that Judgment of Death upon you, which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and which is the bu≈øine≈øs that lies upon me now. But before
I do that, for I know you may think it a pre≈øumption, or at lea≈øt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51360:28"/>
a needle≈øs and unnece≈ø≈øary thing for me to take upon me, and
give any directions to you, the bu≈øine≈øs of who≈øe profe≈ø≈øion it
hath been to give Precepts. However I think it is nece≈ø≈øary for the
Satisfaction of ≈øome per≈øons that are here pre≈øent, that I ≈øhould give
them ≈øome accompt, why I think this Law, and the putting it in
execution at this time is not unrea≈øonable. For it is to be known, that
every Subject of this Realm by his being born within the Dominions of
the King, does owe an immediate Allegiance to the King, and is to take
notice by the Law, that there is not any per≈øon hath any Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
over him; for under God he is the Supream Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
And if any per≈øon born within the Dominions of the King
≈øhall ≈øo far forget him≈øelf, and what he ows to the King by his Birth,
and that Supremacy which he ≈øhould maintain with his Life and
Fortune, as to acknowledge any other Forreign per≈øon to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
and to have a power to Depo≈øe the King, and di≈øpo≈øe of his
Dominions (as every one does, that takes Orders from the See of
<hi>Rome</hi>) he cannot but be thought de≈øerving of the greate≈øt puni≈øhment.
Wherefore the Wi≈ødom of our Nation, the Parliament, at the
time when they made the Law, found that the Religion E≈øtabli≈øhed
(that Religion which I hope in God will remain notwith≈øtanding
all the Enemies it ever had or ≈øhall have) was invaded by ≈øuch Prie≈øts
as you: they found the Life of the Queen at that time in great
danger, by the attempts of tho≈øe Per≈øons whom they had made
their Pro≈øelytes, into whom they had infu≈øed Principles, That it was
no Crime for them to depo≈øe their Queen, ≈øince they had the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of their Pope to ju≈øtifie the Fact. And if once men can
Preach ≈øuch Doctrine, and al≈øo but prevail with their Hearers to be
of ≈øuch a Per≈øwa≈øion; if care were not taken, we ≈øhall ≈øoon ≈øee
an end of all ≈øort of Government, and of our Religion too. But
in as much as the≈øe Principles were not ≈øo vi≈øibly endeavoured to be
put in practice till of late times, though you were not permitted, but
connived at, yet that is no Rea≈øon but the occa≈øion of making the
Law being revived, the Execution of the Law ≈øhould revive with it. I
≈øuppo≈øe it is not unknown to any of us, that there hath been an
Helli≈øh Plot again≈øt the life of the King, and to de≈øtroy our Religion,
I would to God I could ≈øay the Plot was at an end. For I mu≈øt ≈øay,
Some of you, I fear, had too great a hand in it: and what a ≈øort of
Mon≈øters were prevailed upon to compa≈øs the ≈øame, by you that are
Prie≈øts and Je≈øuits, who have wrought them up to ≈øuch a belief,
that Murther in this World is a certain way to Saint≈øhip in that
which is to come. And though you ≈øeem to deny it, your
practices are a proof of it beyond all contradiction, which is the
rea≈øon that this Law, which was a good Law at the time of the
making, and thought fit to be put in Execution then, though it hath
≈ølept ≈øome time ≈øince, ≈øhould now be put in Execution again≈øt you,
who have occa≈øioned all tho≈øe mi≈øchiefs to this Nation in the≈øe
latter times, which occa≈øioned the making of the Law. And one
thing more I ≈øhould ≈øay to that man, who pretends to merit by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51360:28"/>
good Services he hath done for the publick, that he ≈øhould injoin a
man to ≈øcour his Kettle, as he calls it, to receive the Sacrament,
and then give him a Di≈øpen≈øation to be Drunk, and make another
≈øo; to promote a damnable De≈øign, is ≈øuch a power of Prie≈øthood,
fit only for the Pope and his Imps to put in practice.</p>
               <p>But to ≈øay no more; in Charity I am bound to Compa≈ø≈øionate your
Condition, which with all my Soul I do, and heartily can ≈øay
to you, I am ≈øorry to ≈øee you in that mi≈øery; it was in your own
power to have prevented it; but ≈øeeing you have made your
≈øelves Obnoxious to the Law, the only thing required of me,
is to pronounce the Sentence that that Law hath Decreed. And
therefore in the Name of the Court, I do pronounce this to be
your Judgment.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar≈øhall.</speaker>
               <p>May I ask one Que≈øtion, Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> before you
pronounce Sentence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>No, Mr. <hi>Mar≈øhall,</hi> you can't ≈øpeak now; but this
is your Judgment, and the Court does award it, That you the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Pri≈øoners now at the Bar, be conveyed from hence to the
place from whence you came; and that you and every of you be
conveyed from thence on Hurdles to the place of Execution, where
every of you are to be ≈øeverally Hang'd by the Neck; That you be
≈øeverally cut down alive; That your Privy Members be cut off, your
Bowels taken out and be burnt in your view; That your Heads be
≈øevered from your Bodies; That your Bodies be divided into four
Quarters, which are to be di≈øpo≈øed at the Kings plea≈øure. And the
God of infinite Mercy, have mercy upon your Souls.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Pri≈øoners were carried away, and the Court Adjourned
the Se≈ø≈øions.</p>
