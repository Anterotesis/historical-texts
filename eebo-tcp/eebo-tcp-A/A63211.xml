         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I do find by this Indictment, that I am Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned

deſire to know, Whether, according to Law, I can be tryed twice

               <speaker>Lord Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, according to the Law you cannot be tryed twice
for the ſame Fact, nor are you; for before you were Indicted for
having an hand in the great Conſpiracy, for being a Conſpirator in
the Plot, and now you are Tryed for being a Prieſt, and abiding
in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>If I am tryed for a Prieſt, I conceive I cannot be

               <speaker>Lord Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, you miſtake there; There may be Prieſts

            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I humbly conceive, that Prieſthood as

               <speaker>Corker.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſuppoſe there is ſomething particular in my

from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>So men do when they ſay in the Indictment, Labourer,
plead to it in that qualification, but if a man plead by the name of
Gent. the Queſtion is not whether he be a Gent. or no, but whether
he be Guilty of the Fact he is indicted for; and the Queſtion in
your caſe was not whether you were Clerk or were not Clerk, but
whether you had a hand in the Plot or no.</p>

               <speaker>Sir <hi>John</hi> Keiling.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip and you Gentlemen
of the Jury, <hi>Lionel Anderſon</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Munſon</hi> the Priſoner at the
Bar, ſtands indicted here, for that he being a Subject Born within the
Dominions of the King, hath taken Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and hath contrary to the Law come into <hi>England,</hi> and ſtayed here as
a Traytor; for this Treaſon he is indicted, and the Indictment is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Statute of the <hi>27th. Eliz.</hi> a Statute made almoſt a hundred
years ſince, and it was upon great occaſion; for it tells you plainly, That
theſe Prieſts that had taken Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not only
buſie in ſeducing and perverting the Kings Subjects to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
but they had made many attempts upon the Government,
raiſing Sedition and, Rebellion and levying of War againſt their Soveraign,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51360:5"/>
which is evident from the Preamble of the Statute it ſelf. And it
is true, the lenity and mildneſs of our Princes hath in a great meaſure
let this Statute lye aſleep: they have not been willing to execute the
ſeverity of the Law upon all occaſions at all times; but the occaſion
being renewed at this time, for the remedying of which, this Statute
was principally made, (that is to ſay, raiſing Seditions, and Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Rebellion againſt the King, the particulars of which I ſhall
not inlarge upon it hath been notorious in this place) that is the
reaſon of the preſent proſecution of theſe Perſons. Who have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to enjoy the indulgence of our Princes, (which hath been extended
to them, notwithſtanding all their former numerous affronts that they
have given) but have rais'd new Commotions, and made attempts
upon the Perſon of our King, and of our Government, and that is the
occaſion upon which theſe Perſons come to be Tryed. It is not purely
(tho' that is a main ingredient) that they are tryed <hi>quatenus</hi> Prieſts,
but as Ordained by the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and coming into <hi>England</hi> and
abiding here. For a Prieſt, if he be Ordained by the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
if he comes not here, can do no hurt; but it is his coming and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here, that makes him the Subject of this Puniſhment, and hath
occaſioned this mans Proſecution. Now my Lord, we ſhall prove that
this <hi>Anderſon</hi> alias <hi>Munſon</hi> hath taken Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
whoſe authority conſtituted him a Prieſt, and this we ſhall prove by
ſeveral inſtances and ſteps; and then we doubt not but you will take
that care for the preſervation of the Government, and for the Peace
and Quiet of the Nation, which becomes you, and give a Verdict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as your Evidence ſhall lead you.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Ser. Strode.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we ſhall call our Evidence. The Fact
is this, That this Perſon being a Subject of the Kings, and having
received Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, being a <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Prieſt, did come and abide here contrary to the Statute; not that his
Prieſthood is the Crime, no tis his being a Subject of the Kings, and
owning an Authority from abroad, and thereby denying the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his own Soveraign. To prove this, we ſhall call Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance, (who were all

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dangerfield.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>June,</hi> when I was a Priſoner for Debt in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
this perſon took occaſion to ſpeak privately to me, and deſired me
to go into his Room: he told me he had received a Letter from my
Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and that Letter was burnt. But the next Letter that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51360:6"/>
came from my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> he would ſhew it me. And he did ſo;
and the Contents of the Letter was, as near as I can remember, juſt
thus: Sir, You muſt deſire <hi>Willoughby</hi> to ſcour his Kettle; which
was, to Confeſs and receive the Sacrament, to be true to the Cauſe.
A little after, that was Saturday, and I think it was the next day,
being Sunday, I went into Mr. <hi>Anderſons, aliàs Munſon</hi>'s Chamber,
and there I went to Confeſſion, and received Abſolution. And he
ſent me to another perſon to receive the Sacrament, who was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Maſs at that time. And when I had received the Sacrament and
returned to him again, he did tell me, That he, as a Prieſt, did give
me free toleration to go and be drunk, and drink with one <hi>Stroude;</hi>
and I asked him, being ſomething ſcrupulous in the matter, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I might lawfully do it, having but juſt received the Sacrament?
he told me, Yes, he gave me authority ſo to do, being for the good
of the Cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Were you a <hi>Papiſt</hi> then?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dangerfield.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I was.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>You went to Confeſſion to him, and received

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Belwood.</speaker>
               <p>What was the good of the Cauſe that he meant?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dangerfield.</speaker>
               <p>That was, as I was employed in a general Affair

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dangerfield.</speaker>

               <p>No, my Lord, he was not in the Chamber, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>Surely, Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> you and I could not be ſo
well acquainted, but ſomebody or other muſt take notice, that we
ſpoke together ſometimes. Now if you can produce any one body
that will teſtifie it, I will be bound to be hang'd, and ſay no more.</p>
            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dangerfield.</speaker>
               <p>This <hi>Hill,</hi> my Lord, that is in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
hath made Oath of it before Mr. Juſtice <hi>Foſter.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, this one thing I have to ſay againſt this
man. There is a Statute made ſince the King's moſt happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
enumerating Treaſons, which ſays, That all Treaſons ſhall
be as in that Act: And further adds, That none ſhall be Convicted of
Treaſon, but by two lawful and credible Witneſſes. Now the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Legiſlators, having an Eye to future Safety and paſt Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
does provide, That no one ſhall ſuffer as a Traytor, but
one that is by good and credible teſtimony convicted of Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Pray ſpeak out, Sir, for I cannot hear you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I underſtand the meaning applicable to me
thus, That ſince the Statute does uſe the word (Credible) as well as
Legal, it does judge that both would be very neceſſary. Now that
he is not a credible Witneſs I can prove—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Why is he not credible? certainly if he be legal he is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Belwood.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, are you ſure you ſaw his Orders as a
Prieſt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Did he ſhew you the Letters of his Orders?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Of what Order is he?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Dominican</hi>-Fryer he is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>What can you ſay to that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>I can ſay enough; but what can I ſay againſt the King's
Evidence? Your Lordſhip ſees this makes a very fine Jingle, but there
is no proof of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>We can go no further than the Evidence. He ſays, You
are a <hi>Dominican</hi>-Fryer: That he heard you ſay Maſs: That he ſaw
you Conſecrate the Sacrament. And I am ſure you allow none but a
Prieſt to do that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>I underſtand by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> that I am tryed
upon a Statute which makes Prieſthood a Crime. Now I will ask
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> a Queſtion: Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Can you prove, That I received
Orders from the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> You are to prove by this Statute
three things againſt me. I am tryed upon a Penal Statute, which
ought to be conſtrued moſt in favour of the Priſoner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton,</speaker>
               <p>Ask him any Queſtions, if you will, but this is
not your time for arguing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, we muſt do with you as we have done with
others, and will do with the reſt. If you mean that this Statute
ſhould never have any Effect, that is, that the Prieſts ſhall not be
convicted as ſuch, unleſs we can produce Witneſſes, that ſaw them
take Orders, then you have avoided all the Statute; but if ſo be it be
plainly proved, That you have done the Acts of a Prieſt, thoſe that
none are allow'd of to do, or undertake to do, but a Prieſt, is not this
a ſatisfaction, and a plain one too, to your ſelf and all the World, that
this Iſſue, whether you are a Prieſt, or not a Prieſt, is well proved
in the Affirmative.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſaw his Letters of Orders.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord Chief Juſtice, I would ſpeak a little to what
you ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Sir, you muſt not have ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51360:7"/>
as this granted to you. You may, if you will, ask Queſtions,
but it is not your time to diſpute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt not invert the Order of Tryals. When
a Witneſs is called, he muſt give his Evidence. If you will ask him any
Queſtions you may do it. But if you will obſerve any thing, you have
time to do it when the Kings Witneſſes are all heard.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> the Priſoner did not underſtand
ſure what you ſaid. Did not he confeſs to you he had Orders from
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Oates.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, how comes it to paſs, that I did not come
here in a Yellow Coat, and was not arraigned for a Fool? If
I am a Prieſt, that I ſhould tell him I was ſuch an one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I can't tell, becauſe you did not put it on. If
you would ask him any Queſtions, do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Whether you do know me to be an <hi>Engliſhman?</hi>
And whether you ſaw me take Orders from the See of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Oates.</speaker>
               <p>You ſaid you were an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and a Gentleman,
and the ſon of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Do you deny you are an <hi>Engliſhman?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>I am not, nor no man is to be Tryed upon a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
'tis but a conceit in Law, and penal Laws are to be taken

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Belwood.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we call now Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi> You know
the Queſtion, what it is Sir, concerning the Priſoners being a
Prieſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bedloe.</speaker>
               <p>He is a Prieſt, and an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> if his Mother was
honeſt, and he honeſtly born; for he is Mr. <hi>Anderſons</hi> ſon of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi>
as I was told.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But what ſay you to him, as to his being a Prieſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Bedloe.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard him ſay Maſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Did you ever receive the Sacrament from him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Bedloe.</speaker>
               <p>Never. But I have ſeen him Adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and he was in a Prieſts habit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Where?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bedloe.</speaker>
               <p>I think it was at the <hi>Venetian</hi> Reſidents; I am

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>This matter is ſo unlikely, I know not what to

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Will you ask him any Queſtions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my Salvation I never ſaw him before.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>It is a ſtrange thing, that you ſhould
take upon you to ſay upon your Salvation you never ſaw him.
How many might come into a Room, and you not ſee them while

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>He might ſee you, tho' you did not ſee him. He might

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>Is that any argument, or any thing to the
purpoſe, or does that contradict the Evidence? Does the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
or ought he to know all his Congregation whileſt he is in
Preaching?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>I never ſaw him, I ſay. My Lord, I'le give you
but one Argument, which is called <hi>Argumentum Congruentiae.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Will you ask him any Queſtions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>To what purpoſe will it be for me to ask him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bedloe.</speaker>
               <p>When he was firſt taken I was not ſtirring, but while
I was making ready, they told me, There was one ſuſpected to be a
Prieſt. I heard him ſpeak in the next Room, and I knew his voice,
and ſaid, That is Mr. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> I preſently knew his tongue before
I ſaw him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You knew him very well then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bedloe.</speaker>
               <p>I never had any great converſe with the man: when
he was taken, they asked me, If I knew any thing of this man about
the Plot? I told them, No; but he was in Orders from the Church
of <hi>Rome:</hi> for I heard him ſay Maſs at ſuch a place. He told me,
ſaid he, I have been in Orders, but I revok'd them, and turned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</p>

to moſt of the Dignified Clergy in <hi>England:</hi> My Lord Biſhop of
<hi>London,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> ſent to me to
tell me, that if they knew of my Tryal they would be here. My
Lord, I have lain under an ill Cenſure for ſcribing and writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Temporal power of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I never ſaid
Maſs in any <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, I am confident, theſe ten Years: that I
have ſaid Maſs, I won't deny. I would not tell a lye to ſave
my own life, nay, nor would I tell a lye to take away the life of
the greateſt Villain upon Earth. But, my Lord, I proteſt there
is not one word true that hath been Sworn againſt me, but
what Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath ſaid concerning my ſaying Maſs. Oh! my
Lord, I would not deny it if I were to be Hang'd preſently,
and is not that a great evidence of my innocence and ſincerity. But
this does not prove that I am guilty of what I am accuſed for;
for I am indicted upon a Penal Statute, and three things muſt
be proved ſtrictly to bring me within that Law; Firſt, that I am
an <hi>Engliſhman</hi>—</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you then, How vain would you make a Statute
of <hi>England,</hi> the Laws of your Countrey? How idle a thing were
it to expect any poſſibility of proof, ſuch as to convict a Prieſt, if
this be the interpretation of the Law, That no man ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed

               <p>Admit that this Law were thus evaded, yet there would

It was the opinon of all the Judges, delivered about nine years

unto Rigor, till you your ſelves occaſioned it: but ſtill the

neceſſary as the preſervation of the Queens life, and the quiet of
her Dominions; and now 'tis become as neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>Do you think that you ſhall be heard here to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
againſt the Law, and ſay it was no matter for the Law, it is a

               <p>There is nothing now in queſtion, but whether you

not ſo, you ſay well. But I think you deny not now but that you
are a Prieſt, only you would have us prove that you are an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman.
Your Speech betrays you, and there is ſo much Evidence

been protected by the Parliament: Now I ſay, if your Lordſhips
think me worthy of any conſideration (as I have been a man that

the Government) I deſire your Lordſhips would pleaſe to ſtay

the Fact, whether you be a Prieſt; and this I will tell you, and I
muſt ſay to you, I dare appeal to your own Conſcience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Iſſue, your being a Romiſh Prieſt, is not as plainly and
evidently proved, to the ſatisfaction of all mankind, as any thing

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Gentlemen of the Jury, the matter that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
upon, are Two things; Firſt, ſays he, You have not proved
me to be an Engliſhman, and yet at the ſame time he appeals
to ſuch as knew his Father, to be an Engliſh Gentleman; and his
Language, his Tongue betrays him. 'Tis true, ſome kind of
Evidence is to be given, that he is an Engliſhman, he himſelf
tels you, that he is born of Engliſh Parents; but 'tis a forreign
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51360:10"/>
matter, that he ſhould be born beyond Sea. And if it were ſo
really, then it comes on his ſide, if he can produce any witneſs
he ſays ſomething, otherwiſe we leave it to you, whether you
are not ſatisfied in your Conſciences, by hearing him ſpeak, and
underſtanding who his Father was, that he is an Engliſhman.
The next thing is for his being a Prieſt: I do not know, nor can
there be expected a plainer proof than this that hath been given,
becauſe he doth thoſe Acts which none but a Prieſt amongſt them
does; he ſays Maſs, he Conſecrates the Sacrament, he takes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
he gives Abſolution, and all this proved by Four Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>

the Prieſt cannot approach to the Altar, after he hath made

the Prieſt, that he may Abſolve the Congregation.</p>

me. They ſay that I ſaid ſo; if I did ſay ſo, I muſt ſay it to the
Court, and if it was to the Court, it muſt be upon ſome Queſtion
asked me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt not ſay ſo; I am afraid if you appeal to the

            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>It is plain that you are ſo free of your diſcourſe,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not proper for the Court to give Evidence; if we

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>I do believe I ſhall receive all Juſtice from the Court.
And I have experienced it ſo already. Now as to the preſent
Teſtimony againſt me, I conceive that only Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is a material
Witneſs; no one elſe ſwears that they ever ſaw me Officiate or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Duty of a Prieſt. As for Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> he ſays he heard me
ſay Maſs ſeveral times the laſt Summer before the Plot. And Mr.
<hi>Oates</hi> did ſay he was preſent in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Sir <hi>William
Waller,</hi> though he was pleaſed to forget other things, yet did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that, and did Teſtifie that he ſaw me in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
Now then I humbly conceive, if he heard me ſay Maſs at any time
in that Summer, it muſt be in one of thoſe three Months. Was it in
any one of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I came over in <hi>April</hi> from Saint <hi>Omers,</hi>
and I did, as I remember, hear him ſay Maſs one time before I went
again, and heard him ſay it ſeveral times after, which was about
the middle of <hi>June,</hi> I think.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Now I ſay, if this Honourable Court will but pleaſe
to promiſe, that the Witneſſes that come hither ſhall come and go
ſafe, I believe there are Witneſſes that may contradict Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>

over in the Company, as he ſays, of Mr. <hi>Thimbleby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hitchcock,</hi>
and by his means he did get to be commended to be received into the
Order of the Benedictines, and he was then ſent to Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi>

Mr. <hi>Hitchock,</hi> which was when he came from <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould hear me

               <p>He hath gone as near it as is neceſſary; he
tells you, after his Reconciliation, before he went over into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>But I ſay, he could not be at the <hi>Savoy</hi> before he was
acquainted there, and I can bring Witneſſes to prove, that I was not
then at the <hi>Savoy;</hi> but I pray, my Lord, will theſe Witneſſes do me
any good?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>What will they prove?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>That all the Summer, from the beginning of <hi>April</hi> to
the end of the Summer, I was in the Countrey, threeſcore Miles
from <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I am not ſo poſitive in that, my Lord, but as near as
I remember, before I went into <hi>Spain</hi> again. Your Lordſhips all
know that I was not ſo poſitive as to any one time; but the Summer
before the Plot broke out, I heard him ſay Maſs ſeveral times in the
Summer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Now he is poſitive that he ſaw you ſay Maſs in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
before the Plot was diſcovered. The ſubſtance of his Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was your ſaying Maſs, the time is not material: he tells of a
many times within that compaſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>How ſhall I diſprove that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>He hath given you one particular time from <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wedneſday,</hi>
when he was reconciled to <hi>Rome,</hi> till he went to <hi>Spain</hi>
in <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>If he names times, then am I able to diſprove him: and
he did name one, but when he ſaw me offer to prove by Witneſſes,
That I was not then in Town, he goes off from it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible for Witneſſes to be poſitive to
a day, a week, or ſuch a thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>How is it poſſible to be ſo, unleſs it be a thing that
he had taken ſuch particular notice of, as to intend to Swear to it, and
give Evidence about it afterwards. Now, I believe, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> at
that time had no thoughts of giving Evidence as to any ſuch matter;
but this he is poſitive in, That he did hear you ſay Maſs at the
<hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſaid he had ſeen me Officiate
at <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> or <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> it might have been ſomething like;
but at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> it is known, That none are let in but Friends, nor
could Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> come in, but upon a particular acquaintance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>How does that appear ſo?</p>

            <sp>

and do not ſpend the Courts time in vain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have ſomething very material, I think, to
offer. The only material Witneſs that is now againſt me, was a
Witneſs againſt me in my laſt Tryal; now I do conceive that I being
found, Not Guilty at the laſt Tryal, that Witneſs ought to be look'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51360:16"/>
upon as Perjured. And I appeal to the Court, whether it were ſo or
no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>That's a falſe Collection, Mr. <hi>Marſhall.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a ſtrange inference you make, Do you think, that
every Witneſs is Perjured, becauſe the Jury don't find according to
what he ſays? He is not Perjured, for he may Swear true, and the
Jury not believe him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>I ground it my Lord, upon what my Lord <hi>Jones</hi> ſaid to
the Jury that Sate upon <hi>Coleman,</hi> who at their going out told them,
Either they were to find him Guilty, or bring in two men Perjured.
Thus it was his opinion, that the finding of the Jury contrary to the
Evidence, did make them perjured; and there was none of the Court
did oppoſe him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>What then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>And if this were the ſenſe of the whole Court, That
a man muſt either be found Guilty, or the Witneſſes Perjured, that
is my Caſe, and he is not to be believed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>See how unconſequently do you talk. The Court might
ſay, That you muſt believe theſe men Perjured, if they Swear a
poſitive thing, and you find it not; but if you make uſe of it thus,
that therefore they are Perjured, 'tis falſe, for they are not ſo, till
they be Convicted upon Record. And though the Jury do not believe
them, yet they may Swear true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then you make no inference from it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am before the ſame Court that I was tryed
by before, and before the ſelf-ſame Judges, who know that upon
my Tryal he was not believed, and therefore is perjured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt conſider, that ſometimes the
Jury will go againſt the direction of the Court; but if the Witneſs
be not believed by them, that does not argue that he does not Swear
truth, or is perjured. I tell you, My Brother <hi>Jones</hi> might ſay, You
muſt find this man Guilty, or think theſe men Perjured: many times
a Judge will ſay ſo, but the Jury often find againſt the direction of
the Court; Shall theſe men be perjured then preſently?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>There was two poſitive Witneſſes, as poſitive as
could be in the world, and nothing at all to contradict them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Will you give the Jury leave to believe you Mr.
<hi>Marſhall?</hi> for you your ſelf ſaid, you were a Prieſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, if I ſaid ſo. I humbly deſire the Jury to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, that they are the ſelf ſame Witneſſes that brought ſuch a
poſitive Teſtimony the laſt time, which if the Jury had believed,
they muſt of neceſſity have brought me in Guilty; I would not ſpend
the time of the Court, but I would obſerve this, It was all Sworn
poſitively, That I did conſent to the Kings Death, and other things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You had the better luck.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Then they are not to be believed now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>This is to no purpoſe, neither is it to be ſuffered: For
you break in contrary to all the Laws of Practice, if we ſuffer this
as an Argument, That becauſe an Evidence was not believed in one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51360:16"/>
Caſe, therefore he is Perjured: And the Jury gave in a Verdict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Witneſſes Teſtimony, that therefore he is Perjured in
another Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>This does invalidate the Teſtimony ſure of ſuch a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You have ſaid it often enough, come pray conclude.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>No, Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> you muſt not be ſuffered
in theſe Harangues to impeach the Witneſſes; if you have any thing
material againſt Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> or if you can ſhew any Record of his
Conviction of Perjury, it may be ſomething.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it is for my Life, and 'tis the ſecond time that
I plead for my Life, much beyond my expectation; and therefore I
hope I may have the freedom to ſpeak. And though I confeſs this
Jury is not obliged to proceed according to the Verdict of the former
Jury, yet this Jury, as well as that, is obliged to proceed according to
the appearance of truth. And his being found falſe in his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the laſt time, ſhould make him of no Credit here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>It is not ſo, they are not to take notice of it,
unleſs you bring them a Record of Conviction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>He gave a good Evidence then no doubt of
it, though they would not believe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>Upon what grounds that Jury went, is unknown
to us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Then, my Lord, another thing is this. The Law does
except againſt all Witneſſes who are ſtrongly or rationally ſuppoſed
to have a Spight or Malice againſt the Priſoner, much more where
there is a manifeſt ſign that he hath a Malice. Now I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſhew how it comes to my Caſe: Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> accuſed me
laſt time of Treaſon, and that in the higheſt nature; if this had been
true, he had ſhewed himſelf a good Subject, and me Diſloyal. And
the Jury not believing him, I was found the good Subject. Now he
purſues his Malice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You ſhall not go on in this manner, and make ſuch noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
falſe inferences, that becauſe it was not found according to his
Teſtimony, therefore he is Perjured. The Jury did not beleive it,
might not he ſpeak true for all that? Hath not many a Witneſs Sworn
true, yet the Verdict gone againſt their Evidence? and therefore you
don't mind, Ye are all guiddy-headed, if you once get a thing into
your heads, you can't get it out again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>If the Jury did not believe it, a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>All you build upon is but a falſe Concluſion; becauſe
the Jury found you not Guilty, therefore they found him Perjured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord,—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir, if you will ſpeak any thing that
is material and modeſt, the Court will admit you to it; but if you
only go to throw dirt upon the Kings Witneſſes, men of good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and men that have ſhewed themſelves honeſt, and that have
ſpoke truth all along, ne're a one of their Teſtimonies but what is
confirmed by anothers, ſo that not one of them ſtands ſingle, and
for you to ſay they are ill men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51360:17"/>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do not ſay they are ill men, I ſpeak of
matter of Fact.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You conclude falſly, and if you did but mind it, you
would never repeat it over and over again. That becauſe the Jury did
not believe his Evidence, therefore he is Perjured. Do you ſuppoſe
then that any other Jury ſhould never believe him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I reckon his Evidence is not ſo good, and
if I am found Not Guilty, there muſt be malice in him to accuſe
me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Gentlemen, The ſingle Queſtion is, Whether he
be a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt or no? it is proved by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> that he hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times heard him ſay Maſs, that he hath ſeen him deliver the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſeen him Conſecrate the Hoſt. He inſiſted upon it how often,
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, Ten or a Dozen times, in what time he cannot charge
himſelf particularly with a Month or two; but at laſt he did tell him
poſitively, becauſe <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaid, how is it poſſible I can make my defence
to generals unleſs you fix ſometime? therefore ſays he, I was Reconciled
to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> and afterwards between that
and <hi>April,</hi> when I went into <hi>Spain,</hi> I heard him ſay Maſs, that was
once. But I heard him ſay in the Summer ſeveral times. Being asked
what part, he ſays, I cannot ſay exactly, but I think in the Month of
<hi>Auguſt;</hi> If he had ſaid any thing as to the particular time, between
<hi>Aſh-Wedneſday</hi> and his going into <hi>Spain</hi> it had been ſomething, but
againſt that he makes no pretence, as to his ſaying Maſs in the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
that can contradict it. If he can ſtill, he ſhall call his Witneſſes that
can prove he did not ſay Maſs between the <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> and the
<hi>April</hi> he went into <hi>Spain.</hi> He does indeed ſay, that he was a great
part of the Summer in the Countrey, in <hi>June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> to <hi>Bartholomew
Fair,</hi> Threeſcore Miles off, but to that, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays it was ſometime
in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and ſo he might be in the Countrey till then, and yet ſay
Maſs after, he might come to Town the <hi>6th,</hi> or <hi>7th,</hi> or Eight and
Twentieth, and he might be here in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> So you hear no Evidence
that contradicts ſuppoſing it proved true, what he imagines his Witneſſes
can ſay. The laſt time that he charges him to have ſaid it in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
may be true according to his own word and Confeſſion when he
came to Town. Then there is Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he only tells you he ſaw him
in a Prieſts habit, but he did not ſee him Execute the Office of a Prieſt,
but he looked upon him as a Prieſt, called him Father; and that is all
that he Charges him with, that is concurring Evidence, and backs Mr.
<hi>Oates;</hi> but alone perhaps it would be very weak. But they ſet up here
<hi>Prance,</hi> and he ſays directly, that at the Tryal, he did confeſs himſelf
to be a Prieſt; and he ſeems to deny it, and would appeal to the Court;
but his appealing to the Court would not help him in that Caſe. So I
leave this to you upon this Evidence, if you believe Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> that
Swears he ſaw him before he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and after ſay Maſs with
the concurring Evidence of Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> that ſaw him in his Habit,
and with the ſubſequent Evidence of thoſe two more that do Swear
that he did ſay ſo, you muſt find him Guilty. And a mans own
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51360:17"/>
Confeſſion is Evidence againſt himſelf. And if Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> will recollect
himſelf, he would not be too poſitive in that point. If all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
ſatisfie your Conſcience, I ſay, that he is a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt,
you muſt find him Guilty, if you are unſatisfied you muſt acquit
him.</p>

               <p>I believe it might be half a year before the Plot.
And I know you by another Circumſtance. You brought a Chalice
to my Houſe, and it was whole, and you broke it, and told me, I
muſt not touch it till it was broke, and ſo you defaced it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Prance.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and he told me I muſt not touch it till it was
broken in pieces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If you had not been a Prieſt, he had been as holy as you,

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Baron.</speaker>
               <p>His breaking was to deſecrate it.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parry.</speaker>
               <p>I have no reaſon to forget my ſelf, for I never did any ſuch

               <p>Nay, there is no great ſtreſs laid upon that, but to ſhew
you, that he knows you, he did not miſtake the man. The ſtreſs
of the Evidence lies, that he heard you ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> at the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Embaſſadors, and at <hi>Paſtons.</hi> And then Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Wilde-houſe.</hi>

               <p>I have this to ſay, and can ſhew it evidently, that is, I have
Witneſſes to prove, that I never was at <hi>Wildhouſe</hi> to Officiate in the

               <p>He did not confine himſelf preciſely to any Six or Seven

               <p>My Lord, I am not certain what time it was, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two, or two years and an half ago, I am not certain, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible

               <p>You muſt take him in what he ſays, this he

to the time, he believes it to be about this time, but he is not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parry.</speaker>
               <p>He only believes it now, becauſe he knows I have Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
for that time. He hath Sworn it poſitively, it was ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>Come, when matters are plain 'tis in vain to contend;
here is the buſineſs Gentlemen, here are Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi>
two witneſſes againſt Mr. <hi>Parry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, he hath heard him
ſay Maſs one time at one place, and twice or thrice at another. Mr.
<hi>Prance</hi> hath heard him often, and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> does tell you plainly,
that he cannot err, that he is not miſtaken in the man, for he came to
his houſe with a Chalice, and broke it there, and he knew him ſo
well, that meeting him by chance, he took him up in the ſtreets; ſo
if you believe them, they ſwear it poſitively, and you muſt find it ſo.</p>

the other priſoners; that he having received Orders from the See
of <hi>Rome,</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and this is High Treaſon; to this he

               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Starkey</hi> is a Prieſt, and I once heard him

               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>

               <p>Did he give the Sacrament then, or at any other time?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>Did he receive the Sacrament, and conſecrate the Hoſt?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, in both kinds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Baron.</speaker>
               <p>Will you ask him any queſtions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>He tells me of the Prieſts Habits, What are they Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>Under it he was in a Secular Habit, but firſt he had a
thing about his Neck, a piece of Linnen, I have forgot what they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51360:22"/>
call it, and over that he had a Surplice girt about him, and a Stole
about his Neck over that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Oates,</hi> if you be ſo, for I do not know you, a Prieſts
Habit is a Caſſock and a Cloak, the Ornaments of a Prieſt are not a
Surplice, but an—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>You are well skill'd in it I ſee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>And how did you know that I ſaid Maſs? Did you know
that I took Orders? for if I took no Orders, it was no Maſs; for it
is the Prieſt makes the Maſs, and not the Maſs the Prieſt; and then if
I was no Prieſt, it could be no Maſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>That is a pretty Argument indeed; Do any but
Prieſts ſay Maſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>I can bring inſtance of a Gentleman in this Town, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Lay-man, who did ſay Maſs about this Town, and he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
and at laſt he ſtole the Chalice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>He did well, did he not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a great Evidence this arguing of yours, if he did not
ſwear it, that you are a Prieſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder that this Gentleman ſhould ſo well remember

               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think you know every one that hath ſeen

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Prance.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I heard him ſay Maſs at my Lady <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi>
and at Mr. <hi>Paſtons.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>As I hope for mercy from Almighty God, I was never

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Prance.</speaker>
               <p>More than that, I heard him confeſs himſelf a Prieſt

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Prance.</speaker>
               <p>Did you know one Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi> that is dead?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he was a Schoolmaſter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Prance.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I heard you ſay Maſs at his Houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell you what then, it was with a Pot of Ale, and at 3
or 4 a clock in the afternoon, for that was the only time I was there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard him ſay, he ſaid Maſs in the Kings Army.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>He tels you, he heard you ſay, that you did often in

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>You never heard me ſay ſo in your life, for I never did.
But pray my Lord give me leave to ſpeak: I appeared for the King,
when he had but 500 men in appearance for him. I am but a younger
Brother, an Eſquires 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Brother; I ſpent in the King's ſervice above
<hi>5000l.</hi> which I got my ſelf, and bled for it before I had it. I ſpent
my Annuity of Sevenſcore pound a year for the King, I loſt my Leg
for him, and ſpent my Eſtate to that Degree, that that day when I
receiv'd the ſentence of Baniſhment, I had but Two half Crowns left.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> You may urge this to the King, for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Clemency, 'tis nothing to the point here before the Jury to be
Tryed. Whatſoever you have merited by your ſervices, you muſt
apply your ſelf to the King for his mercy, it is nothing here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, give me leave to add one thing more, I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51360:22"/>
did diſcover to the King a Plot deſigned againſt His Perſon, State,
and Government, and I ſuffer to this day for it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>But my Lord, by the Civil Law it is a concluſion, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man be a Traitor, and in the ſame Plot, he is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified
for diſcovering the Conſpiracy againſt his Prince, much
more for diſcovering another.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>

               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, I'll tell you Gentlemen, this perſon is Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for being a Prieſt and coming into <hi>England.</hi> For the point of his
being a Prieſt you have heard two witneſſes depoſe; and they both
tell you, that they have heard him ſay Maſs, as great an evidence of
it as can be, for none ſay Maſs but Prieſts. <hi>Dr. Oates</hi> tels you at Mr.

               <p>My Lord, I am not here I think, to be my own Accuſer, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive ſo, and whatſoever is againſt me, muſt be proved, not
ſimply aſſerted. They ought to give Proofs and Reaſons; but ſo it
is, it is but a ſimple aſſertion what they ſay. I deſire they may prove it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>No, they need not; it is ſufficient if they prove it by
ſuch Circumſtances that the Jury are ſatisfied and convinced that it
is true. But it is not to be looked for, that no proof ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt the Prieſt, but by them that ſaw him receive Orders.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Atkins.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible almoſt to prove that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>But if they prove the Circumſtances, that you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
the Office of a Prieſt by ſaying Maſs, which none does but
a Prieſt, 'tis enough to guide them in their Verdict.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>And they have proved that which is next to a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Aſſertion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>That need not be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>But let us not leſſen our proof neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt conſider that the proof is certain, for they
have ſworn an aſſertive poſitive thing, which thing is enough to a
Jury to prove you a Prieſt, becauſe none others but Prieſts may
do ſuch things in your Church as you have done. Therefore it is a
good Argument and Evidence, to conclude you a Prieſt, from this
Evidence that hath been given.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard him own himſelf a Prieſt 20 times.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lumſden.</speaker>
               <p>The exerciſe of the Prieſtly Function is but a penalty
of 200 Marks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, that is, if the King will go no higher. But you are
proſecuted upon another Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis Evidence, and a great Evidence, that which hath
been given, for we muſt go according to the nature of the thing.
'Tis impoſſible the Act of Parliament ſhould be put in execution, if
they muſt prove they received Orders from the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But
when they have proved thoſe things done by any man, which none
ought to do but a Prieſt; it hath been in all times allowed to be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Evidence.</p>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:51360:23"/>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a plain and ſufficient Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>But if there were any need of it, and you would
have any more, he hath confeſſed upon the queſtion asked him,
whether he was a Franciſcan, no, he was a Dominican.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
               <p>Have you done? Then Gentlemen of the Jury, you
muſt not at this time of the day be inſnared by that Argument, that
there muſt be a poſitive proof of this Reception of Orders from the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it hath been all along accounted, and is
an undoubted proof for your ſatisfaction, if it appear he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
the Offices of the Function; thoſe Offices that are not done
but by Prieſts. Now this hath been proved by two witneſſes, and by
the confeſſion of the Prieſt himſelf to <hi>Dr. Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi> So
I muſt leave it upon the point of Fact to you, whether it be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proof. But this Caſe will differ from all the reſt, and the Court
is very tender in the caſe of Life, that it ſhould be without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what is determined; therefore as to your enquiry for him, it muſt
go only whether he be a Prieſt or no, for the others, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
them as Engliſhmen, and enquire of them as ſuch; he is a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as he ſays, and they ſay ſo too. Now then there are ſome words
in this Statute, whereupon the Court hath conceived a doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Caſe comes within them, which are the words about the
Kings Dominions, which now are far more enlarged than were thoſe
of the Queen when the Statute was made: If then you find him a
Prieſt, you muſt find the other matter ſpecially.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Ellis.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Gentlemen, we are to be of Counſel for
the Priſoner, and it being matter of Law, we ſhall take time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
upon it before we give our opinions in it; but for the matter of
Fact, I doubt not but you will find that he is a Prieſt; and then the
other matters, that he was born at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the
other matters you may find ſpecially, there needs no more.</p>

but the King kept me here, telling me, He had need of my
Service; and, I had a Protection from the Council-Board. The
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> when I was taken firſt, ſent a Letter to Sir <hi>Clement
Armiger,</hi> that neither I, nor my Books, ſhould be medled with; that
I had written for the King and the Government, for which I was
Excommunicated at <hi>Rome.</hi> And when I was taken, and in Cuſtody
of ſome of the Horſe-Guard, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſent to have
me freed again. I beg'd of the King, that I might go; ſaid I, I

               <p>Sir, I had no notice of my Tryal, but this morning. I
ſent to my Lord <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> to know when I ſhould be Tryed,
he told me, I ſhould have Ten dayes notice of it. Now I have
Witneſſes to diſprove Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Teſtimony: for Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> I own
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51360:24"/>
he hath heard me ſay <hi>Maſs;</hi> but for <hi>Mr. Bedloes</hi> Teſtimony, as I
hope to ſee the face of Almighty God, I know him not. When I
was taken, ſaid he to me, Mr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> Let me ſee your Protection,
and I ſhewed it him; You have two Names, ſaid he, I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be you or no. And then beſides, theſe are not legal Witneſſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, that muſt not be allowed you to ſay. You
have been fairly heard, and tryed. They were upon their Oaths,
and the Jury, Twelve Men, upon their Oaths, without any Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made to them; they have Convicted you; therefore this is to
Calumniate the Proceedings of the Court.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Anderſon.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you this more; they are not the Kings Evidence

            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>I have very little more to ſay, then what I have ſaid
already. I thought the Law had not allowed any Man to have
been Condemned upon the Teſtimony of one Witneſs, but required
two. Now there was but one poſitive Witneſs againſt me, the reſt
only ſaid, I had confeſſed my ſelf to be a Prieſt. Two of them did
Swear, they heard me confeſs it at my other Tryal: If it had been
at this Tryal, it had been another thing, and there had been ſome
validity in the proof; but, to ſay, they heard me Confeſs it at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, I humbly conceive, according to the <hi>Law,</hi> bears no force.
I have this further to add, His Majeſty, ſome years ago, put forth a
Declaration under the Broad-Seal, for a To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leration of Religion,
and <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> whereby the Roman Catholicks had the
uſe of their Religion in their private Houſes. Now, I have been
informed, that according to <hi>Law,</hi> whatſoever is put forth under
the Broad-Seal, muſt be recalled by ſomething under the Broad-Seal,
or it remains in force, which was never done as to this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and then I lye under the Protection of that Declaration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>As for the firſt part, 'tis plain, to the ſatisfaction
of every body, that there hath been two Sufficient Witneſſes, upon
whoſe Teſtimony you are Convicted. For whether you were ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Queſtion or not, yet if you will ſay you are a Prieſt, that
Confeſſion of yours is Evidence againſt you, though you might
poſſibly ſay ſo without being Asked the Queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Is it credible I ſhould do ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, the Jury believed it ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Oates.</speaker>
               <p>One of the Jury ſtood by and heard the Words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51360:25"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>And now, becauſe I will put it out of all doubt,
'tis not the buſineſs, nor the Duty of the Court to give any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of any Fact that they know of their own knowledge, unleſs
they will be Sworn for that purpoſe: for though they do know it in
their own private Conſciences to be true, yet they are obliged to
conceal their own knowledge, unleſs they will be Sworn as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
But now you are Convicted, I muſt take the liberty to
tell you, that at your laſt Tryal you did own your ſelf to be a Prieſt.
And I muſt put you in mind further of ſomething which you may
very well remember, when I detained you after your Acquittal, and
Recommitted you when Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was diſcharged; I did
then tell you, you having owned your ſelves to be Prieſts, I was
bound to take notice of that Confeſſion of yours, and therefore
obliged to detain you. Such a Token as that is, may perhaps bring
it to your Memory: but as it was hinted to you before, you are a
Voluminous Talker, and abundance of things may drop out of
your Mouth, that you don't conſider before they are paſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis for my life, and therefore I may be permitted to
ſpeak ſure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>That is as to the firſt point. And then as to the
Kings Declaration, which was the other matter you inſiſted upon,
I preſume it does not ſtick with any body that knows the matter;
but leaſt it ſhould, I would ſay this to it. 'Tis very well known
in the firſt place (I do not go now to determine the <hi>Law</hi> upon it,
becauſe you know what Opinions and Judgment it received after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
yet this I will adventure to ſay, That it was never the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of that Declaration that ever Prieſts ſhould come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
here, but it was only intended for tender Conſciences, as the
very Letter of the Declaration it ſelf does ſhew, not to Countenance
Prieſts and Jeſuits, that have caſt off all their Allegiance to the
King, and endeavour both to deſtroy Him and His Government.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir, Will you give me leave to ſpeak as to that.
If ſo be the uſe of their Religion were permitted to Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
that Religion not being to be practiſed without Prieſts, it is
to be ſuppoſed, that the Prieſts are permitted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>But if a Man were to Argue with you now, in your
own way, Pray are there not Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> beſides thoſe Prieſts
that were born here? You know, of your own Acquaintance, there
are ſeveral Roman Catholick Prieſts, not Engliſhmen born, that are
conſtantly here, who can perform the Offices.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I don't know that: But this I know, if they
be not born in <hi>England,</hi> or have lived in <hi>England,</hi> ſo as to know
the Tongue, Roman Catholicks will be little the better for them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I don't ſay much the better, but much the
worſe for their coming at them. And in caſe they would only uſe
the Engliſh truth, I preſume they would not have ſo many Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,
but you Gull them with ſtuff they underſtand not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir give me leave a little, I have one word more.
For all matters of Treaſon, and Treacherous Conſpiracy, I was
freed before in this Court; now I would obſerve, what the beſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51360:25"/>
Lawyers that ever were in <hi>England</hi> have obſerved for me, That
there is no Crime in Prieſthood it ſelf: for my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Fifth
Report 39. leaf, commenting largely upon the Statute of the twenty
ſeventh of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and inlarging upon the ſence and meaning of that
Statute, and calling to mind, who the men were that were formerly
Executed by force of that Statute, and why, concludes thus. Hence
it appears, that no man yet hath or can be Executed for his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Prieſthood, but becauſe there was annexed to the Prieſthood
treacherous Deſigns and treacherous Attempts. And the ſame
Lawyer in the 3<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> Inſtitutes, <hi>22th.</hi> leaf, ſays, That in this Statute of
the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 'twas very wiſely and juſtly done by the
Statute-Makers, to provide that the Judges ſhould proceed in their
Judgments upon that matter, only according to what is expreſſed
and ſpecified in that Statute. And thoſe words were a Sanctuary to
the Judges, and put in to prevent the ſhedding of guiltleſs blood.
Now if ſo be that ſo great a Lawyer, in a diſcourſe about Prieſthood
and Treachery, does thence conclude, That Prieſthood as Prieſthood
is no Crime, nor no Function belonging to it hath any Crime in it,
well may I conclude ſo too. And indeed if it had, then a great part
of the World would be Traitors, nay, it would bring in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
who was a Prieſt, to be a Traytor too. Therefore Prieſthood
as Prieſthood hath no Treaſon eſſentially linkt to it. And when he
ſays, that they muſt proceed according to what is ſpecified, he does
in the forementioned place ſhew, that it was not ſpecified at all, that
any that were Executed, were for Prieſthood Executed. And I am
accuſed of nothing elſe in the World, but bare Prieſthood as Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
without any Deſign or Treachery joyned to it. And if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Law Prieſthood be not liable to Condemnation, then I am not
to be Condemned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Now you have been heard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, and I thank you for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>This long Speech of yours will ſignifie but little,
when you conſider the Act of Parliament, upon which you are
Indicted, ('tis true, ſet that Act of Parliament out of the Caſe, and
then to be a Prieſt is not High-Treaſon; nay, in caſe a man be born
out of the Kings Dominions, and be a Prieſt, and remain here, that
is not High-Treaſon within this Statute, becauſe Prieſthood it ſelf
does not make the Crime; (God forbid any one ſhould affirm it) but
when all that is granted, when an Act of Parliament hath taken
particularly notice of the great miſchiefs and inconveniencies that
have attended the Government, and the continual danger that the
Supream head hath been in, by having Perſons which were born
within the Kings Dominions, (as you were) to wave their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and to acknowledge a Supremacy in any Foraign Prince
or Prelate, as you all do, when you take Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of
<hi>Rome;</hi> the Wiſdom of the Nation hath thought reaſonable that ſuch
ſhould be adjudged Traitors. And this Act of Parliament upon
which you ſtand Convicted, does plainly ſay, If any one born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Kings Dominions will take Orders from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and ſhall after reſide here, he is guilty of High Treaſon. And this is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51360:26"/>
not only thought ſo by us that are here, but by all my Lords the
Judges that were preſent at your Tryal; for God forbid we ſhould
Condemn you for any thing as High Treaſon, if you had not been
within the Compaſs of the Act of Parliament. And what is Treaſon,
the Act of Parliament particularly Deſcribes, which all hath been
proved upon you. And becauſe you are pleaſed to ſpeak it to the
Court, and lay it on the Conſciences of the Court, I Diſcharge my
Conſcience, the Jury having Convicted you for High Treaſon, I am
very ready to paſs Judgment upon you according to the Law, and I
will clear my Conſcience of that preſently. Tie him up.</p>

               <p>What have I to ſay for my ſelf? I have this to ſay, That
thoſe that did depoſe againſt me, did not ſay one word of Truth, I
take God to witneſs for it. I am a Dead man by the Law, and I
can Suffer, and I can praiſe God for his Holy will in that. I am
as ready to Suffer the Law, as the Law is to inflict Suffering upon me,
for it is for Gods glory; but I may pretend, and will pretend to,
that I am not ſubject to the Law, in aſmuch as I have declared, that
I am a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and they are to prove that I am not. I was
threatned by Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> when I was under the protection
of an Embaſſador; and notwithſtanding his protection, which was a
violation of the Law of Nations, that one under his protection ſhould
be ſo uſed, and that ſlighted as if it were nothing. But becauſe they
did not regard it, I ſhewed it under his Hand and Seal; I alledged
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51360:26"/>
in the next place, that I was a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> but becauſe I would not take
my Oath that I was born a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Waller</hi> did threaten me
with Irons; and therefore all that I ſaid was compelled and forced from
me; then I ſaid I was a <hi>Monmouth-ſhire</hi> man, becauſe my Father and
my Mother were ſo, they are of that Countrey; but however it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to them to prove whether I was a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or no.</p>

               <p>And the Jury hath found you a Tranſgreſſour of
the Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Letter of the Law is this.</hi> That if any one of the
Queens Subjects, ſhall Tranſport himſelf beyond the Sea, and ſhall in
a Seminary take Orders, by Authority derived from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and ſhall return into <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall not preſent himſelf here to
the Ordinary, or elſe to ſuch a certain number of Juſtices of the Peace
within ſuch a Term, but ſhall Seduce the Kings Leige <hi>people</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>No that is another Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he ſhall be adjudged a Traitour.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> I
come to this, as I told you before, I had diſcovered a Plot to the King
that was deſigned againſt his Perſon, State, and Government, and did
deliver into his hands Eleven Articles of Treaſon, which I had Writ
with my own hands; and this he hath owned, and will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own So Mr.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51360:27"/>
                  <hi>Recorder,</hi> upon this, I was Threatned by thoſe that were parties to the
Treaſon, That the King ſhould not be gone twenty four hours, but I
ſhould be impriſoned. When the King went, what muſt I do? Muſt
I ſtay there and hazard my life, or truſt to the Kings Mercy? I was
forced to come along with the King for Protection. I came to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
and the King roſe up and gave me his hand to kiſs, and ſo did
the Duke of York, and told me I was Welcome. I went to my
Lord Chancellor <hi>Hyde,</hi> who, when he ſaw me, Embraced me in his
Arms, and ſaid, Thou art welcome, I am glad to ſee thee in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
I had occaſion to ſpeak with the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Dr. <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
about another Perſon, and when I came to him, he asked me,
What is your Name? My Lord, ſaid I, my name is <hi>Starkey,</hi> with
that he catches me faſt by the hand, and when he had done that, he
took me in his Arms, and told me, I am glad with all my heart to
ſee you ſafe here in <hi>England.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> I do ſuffer to this
day for the Service I have done the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> I can only ſay this to you, I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you faithfully, as I promiſed the other Gentleman that went
before, I'le tell the King what you alledge. He is the beſt able to
give an accompt of it, and is the fitteſt Judge of his own Mercy.
But I could recommend to you, Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> a thing that would be
very acceptable, and then as far forth as tis modeſt for me to ſpeak,
I am pretty well aſſured, I might ſay, I could prevail for Mercy
to you, That is, as you did Diſcover one Plot before, ſo you would
Diſcover this Helliſh Plot that is now on foot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> I have wiſhed many times that one of the
Commiſſions that are ſaid to be delivered out, had been brought to
me; for he that had delivered me a Commiſſion, ſhould never have
delivered a ſecond to any one elſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Well, the King is the Fountain of Mercy, and he is
the beſt Judge of the fit Objects of it. I will, as I ſaid, tell him
what you ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>If the King does not own what I told you, then count me
the greateſt Knave that ever was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>You remain now under the Conviction of the
Law, what Mercy the King, who is the Fountain of Mercy as well
as of Juſtice, will extend to you, is in his own power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> I have another thing to offer to you,
and that is the Kings General and free Act of Pardon, made in the
Twenty fifth year of his Reign, wherein he pardons all Treaſons,
mispriſions of Treaſons, Felonies, and mispriſions of Felony, except
what is excepted thereafter, and Prieſthood is not there excepted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>You know very well, that the proof of your Treaſon
hath been ſince the twenty fifth of this King, and within three years
paſt. I preſume you do not think that the Kings Act of Pardon
pardons all Treaſons paſt and to come, as the Popes Bull does Sins.
Tye him up then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>But how ſhall I do then, when I am Lame? I want a
Leg, and I muſt uſe my Stick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Then let him alone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:51360:27"/>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>But I pray, good Mr. Recorder, will you be pleaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you give Sentence upon me, to acquaint the King with what I
have to ſay for my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>No, I cannot do that, the Kings pleaſure is to be
known afterwards. Set <hi>Lumſden</hi> aſide, and ſet all the reſt to the
Bar.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Proclamation was made for Silence, Whilſt Judgment
was a giving.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder.</speaker>
               <p>YOU the Priſoners at the Bar; You have been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Accuſed, Arraigned—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Starkey.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> May I ſpeak one word? I have preſented
this year, wherein at the <hi>26th.</hi> of this Month I have been a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
ſeveral Petitions by my Friends to the King, and deſired to be
Tranſported; for my Age and infirmities and want of a Leg did not
ſtand well with my being in <hi>England</hi> theſe troubleſom times. The
King, I am told, hath promiſed I ſhould, but I ſee no fruits of
thoſe Petitions. And pray conſider this, That I ſhould have been
impriſoned if I ſtayed out of <hi>England,</hi> and now to be proſecuted
in <hi>England</hi> in this manner, and to be Drawn, Hang'd, and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is very hard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Whether it be true or not, God knows, I ſhall
acquaint the King with it. It only remains with me to take notice
of it for that purpoſe. And for my part I am ſorry with all my
heart to ſee ſo many perſons brought to receive the Sentence of
Death by my Mouth. But I muſt ſay this, You your ſelves have
been the occaſion of it, and therefore muſt blame your ſelves for it.
You have had the benefit of the beſt Laws, the Law of <hi>England,</hi>
which gives every Subject the liberty to make a defence for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
when ever he is accuſed of any Crime; He hath the liberty to
hear the Witneſſes what they ſay againſt him; to call any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
for him, and to make defence for himſelf. And not only ſo,
but he hath likewiſe Twelve Men upon their Oaths, that are his
Peers, againſt whom he hath the liberty to make a Challenge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing any reaſon, to a certain number; and if it ſhall appear
that any of them have the leaſt prejudice or malice againſt any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are to be Tried for their Lives, to a greater number. Such
and ſo great is the benefit of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> beyond all the
Laws of any other Nation in the world. But all theſe forms having
been paſſed, and a Jury of men, againſt whom you made no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
having found you Guilty of the Offences for which you
were Indicted, there remains now nothing more with the Court,
but to paſs that Judgment of Death upon you, which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and which is the buſineſs that lies upon me now. But before
I do that, for I know you may think it a preſumption, or at leaſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51360:28"/>
a needleſs and unneceſſary thing for me to take upon me, and
give any directions to you, the buſineſs of whoſe profeſſion it
hath been to give Precepts. However I think it is neceſſary for the
Satisfaction of ſome perſons that are here preſent, that I ſhould give
them ſome accompt, why I think this Law, and the putting it in
execution at this time is not unreaſonable. For it is to be known, that
every Subject of this Realm by his being born within the Dominions of
the King, does owe an immediate Allegiance to the King, and is to take
notice by the Law, that there is not any perſon hath any Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
over him; for under God he is the Supream Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
And if any perſon born within the Dominions of the King
ſhall ſo far forget himſelf, and what he ows to the King by his Birth,
and that Supremacy which he ſhould maintain with his Life and
Fortune, as to acknowledge any other Forreign perſon to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
and to have a power to Depoſe the King, and diſpoſe of his
Dominions (as every one does, that takes Orders from the See of
<hi>Rome</hi>) he cannot but be thought deſerving of the greateſt puniſhment.
Wherefore the Wiſdom of our Nation, the Parliament, at the
time when they made the Law, found that the Religion Eſtabliſhed
(that Religion which I hope in God will remain notwithſtanding
all the Enemies it ever had or ſhall have) was invaded by ſuch Prieſts
as you: they found the Life of the Queen at that time in great
danger, by the attempts of thoſe Perſons whom they had made
their Proſelytes, into whom they had infuſed Principles, That it was
no Crime for them to depoſe their Queen, ſince they had the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of their Pope to juſtifie the Fact. And if once men can
Preach ſuch Doctrine, and alſo but prevail with their Hearers to be
of ſuch a Perſwaſion; if care were not taken, we ſhall ſoon ſee
an end of all ſort of Government, and of our Religion too. But
in as much as theſe Principles were not ſo viſibly endeavoured to be
put in practice till of late times, though you were not permitted, but
connived at, yet that is no Reaſon but the occaſion of making the
Law being revived, the Execution of the Law ſhould revive with it. I
ſuppoſe it is not unknown to any of us, that there hath been an
Helliſh Plot againſt the life of the King, and to deſtroy our Religion,
I would to God I could ſay the Plot was at an end. For I muſt ſay,
Some of you, I fear, had too great a hand in it: and what a ſort of
Monſters were prevailed upon to compaſs the ſame, by you that are
Prieſts and Jeſuits, who have wrought them up to ſuch a belief,
that Murther in this World is a certain way to Saintſhip in that
which is to come. And though you ſeem to deny it, your
practices are a proof of it beyond all contradiction, which is the
reaſon that this Law, which was a good Law at the time of the
making, and thought fit to be put in Execution then, though it hath
ſlept ſome time ſince, ſhould now be put in Execution againſt you,
who have occaſioned all thoſe miſchiefs to this Nation in theſe
latter times, which occaſioned the making of the Law. And one
thing more I ſhould ſay to that man, who pretends to merit by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51360:28"/>
good Services he hath done for the publick, that he ſhould injoin a
man to ſcour his Kettle, as he calls it, to receive the Sacrament,
and then give him a Diſpenſation to be Drunk, and make another
ſo; to promote a damnable Deſign, is ſuch a power of Prieſthood,
fit only for the Pope and his Imps to put in practice.</p>
               <p>But to ſay no more; in Charity I am bound to Compaſſionate your
Condition, which with all my Soul I do, and heartily can ſay
to you, I am ſorry to ſee you in that miſery; it was in your own
power to have prevented it; but ſeeing you have made your
ſelves Obnoxious to the Law, the only thing required of me,
is to pronounce the Sentence that that Law hath Decreed. And
therefore in the Name of the Court, I do pronounce this to be
your Judgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhall.</speaker>
               <p>May I ask one Queſtion, Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> before you
pronounce Sentence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>No, Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> you can't ſpeak now; but this
is your Judgment, and the Court does award it, That you the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Priſoners now at the Bar, be conveyed from hence to the
place from whence you came; and that you and every of you be
conveyed from thence on Hurdles to the place of Execution, where
every of you are to be ſeverally Hang'd by the Neck; That you be
ſeverally cut down alive; That your Privy Members be cut off, your
Bowels taken out and be burnt in your view; That your Heads be
ſevered from your Bodies; That your Bodies be divided into four
Quarters, which are to be diſpoſed at the Kings pleaſure. And the
God of infinite Mercy, have mercy upon your Souls.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Priſoners were carried away, and the Court Adjourned
the Seſſions.</p>
