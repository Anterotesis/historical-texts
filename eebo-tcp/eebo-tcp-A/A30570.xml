            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The care of a Chriſtian ought to be to do his duty, rather than to avoid danger, which may fal out in his duty. 3. When God brings his people into danger, he intends more to exerciſe their graces, then to try their diſcretion. 4. Though danger may be avoided, yet it is more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable for a Chriſtian to be called to exerciſe Faith Courage, Patience, and in away of ſuffering, then his prudence in avoiding it. 5. Take care of miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcretion, which is not wont to abate the vigor of Gods Graces, but to improve and increaſe them. <hi>6. A</hi> Chriſtians greateſt endeavor ſhould be to get his will to ſubmit to God.</label>

Such avoiding of Danger (if rightly qualified) argues neither diſtruſt of God, nor defect of Courage. 3. In ſome caſes, Chriſtians not only permitted, but commanded to flee, as 1. When no extraordinary thing depends upon him in that ſtation in which God hath ſet him. 2. When the hand of God looſeth thoſe relations, which would otherwiſe be obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:42455:5"/>
to him. 3. When God gives him an opportunity elſe where, to bring greater revenues of glory to him. 4. When a Chriſtian is doubtful about his call to ſuffer at the preſent. 4. There are ſome caſes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is utterly unlawful to flee, <hi>viz.</hi> The contrary to thoſe above named. 5. Miſtakes in flying. 1. To flee upon every ſlight and trival thing. 2. When it tends to their ſpiritual diſadvantage. 3. When having ſecretly denied the Faith, Men flee to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſhame of Apoſtacie. 4. When they look at their own ſafety alone, without care to fit themſelves for further ſervice of God. 6. How to know when avoiding dangers proceeds from Faith, or Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. 1. That which is by Faith is not in a Violent, Raſh, Heady manner. 2. When it proceeds from Faith, it is joined with a reſolution to return and bear wittneſs to the truth, when God cals. 3. When we uſe the liberty we have to get hearts to return. 7 The caſe of publique Officers, Magiſtrates, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, eſpecially the latter.</label>

I now proceed to ſpeak of another excellent fruit of the

faith of this Worthy of the Lord, as it is ſet forth in verſ. 27. and here we are to obſerve two things.</p>

            <p>Firſt, In the act we are to obſerve, two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That notable work of his going from <hi>Egypt</hi> notwithſtanding the wrath of the <hi>King.</hi>

               <item>2. His conſtancy, he <hi>endured</hi> in all that he did.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Secondly, The argument by which his faith was ſtrengthened, was that ſight he had of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The opening of the words with the ſeveral Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By faith he forſook Egypt</hi>] By this forſaking of <hi>Egypt</hi> the faith of <hi>Moſes</hi> was much ſet out: for him to undertake ſuch a work as that was, to carry ſo many <hi>thouſands</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into a wilderneſs, not knowing what might become of them, they being unable to reſiſt their enemies, and not knowing what proviſion they ſhould have, this was very much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not fearing the wrath of the King</hi>] He could not but think he was in danger of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his company to bee purſued by them: for howſoever <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſeemed willing at laſt to give them leave to be gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſuch was the diſpoſition of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (which <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ignorant of) that he might quickly change his mind, and follow them with all his power to cut them off, as it appeares he did. Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> feared no ſuch matter, but he went on his way <hi>for he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42455:9"/>Object. <hi>But it ſeems</hi> Moſes <hi>did forſake</hi> Egypt for fear of the wrath of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, Time was that in forſaking <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> he did fear the wrath of the King. in <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.14. it is ſaid, Moſes <hi>ſeeing two</hi> Hebrews <hi>ſmiting one another, he ſaid to him that did the wrong, Why ſmiteſt thou thy fellow? And he ſaid, Who made thee a Prince and a Judge over us, Intendeſt thou to kil me as thou didſt the Egyptian?</hi> And then <hi>Moſes</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and upon that he fled.</p>
            <p>And if we underſtand the Text of this his firſt forſaking <hi>Egypt,</hi> we may thus reconcile the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> with that place. Firſt he fled not fearing ſo much the <hi>King</hi> as that he ſhould offend God; if he offered himſelf to the danger, and did not make an eſcape, he ſhould have tempted God by preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: Thus <hi>Oſiander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus, He fled not for fear in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but leaſt his calling ſhould be hindred if he ſtaied: So <hi>Simler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe words are rather to be underſtood of his ſecond forſaking of <hi>Egypt. The firſt time</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook <hi>Egypt</hi> out of fear; but <hi>the ſecond time</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook <hi>Egypt</hi> out of Faith, and he did not fear: after he had ſlain the <hi>Egyptian</hi> he was afaid, but when he came to take al the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him, then he forſook <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>did not fear the wrath of the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we have theſe Obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> Firſt, That wicked men (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they have power) are very fierce and outragious in their wrath when any thing croſſeth them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42455:10"/>Certainly, <hi>Moſes</hi> apprehended this wrath of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> great, in that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> makes it a notable fruit of his Faith not to fear the wrath of the King. It appeared his wrath was great, in regard of the power he raiſed againſt them, had it not been for <hi>Moſes.</hi> Faith he would have feared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2. Secondly,</hi> Faith wil keep a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart from immoderate fear of all the men in the world, let them be never ſo great, and have never ſo much power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 3. Thirdly,</hi> There is a great deal of difference between the ſpirits of Gods People at ſomtimes and other times.</p>
            <p>There was a time when <hi>Moſes</hi> was afraid, now he goes on and is not afraid</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 4. Fourthly,</hi> Faith wil carry a man through very hard ſervices, and difficult works that God cals him unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct 5. Fifthly,</hi> That it is the honor of the People of God to endure in the waies of God, notwithſtanding all the hardſhips they meet withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 6. Sixthly,</hi> The ſight of an inviſible God is a ſtrong means to carry one on in the waies of God, notwithſtanding al oppoſitions and difficulties they meet withall.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Doctrinal Concluſions we have in verſe 27.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Handling the firſt Doctrine.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That the wrath of wicked men, eſpecially when they have power, uſually is very fierce and outragious.</p>
            <p>FOr the proof of this Point. It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that ſomtimes God indeed reſtrains it, but uſually it is ſo. There is in every one a great deal of diſtempered wrath that doth break forth and vent it ſelf when occaſion ſerves and when temptation comes, in moſt vile and fearful effects and fruits. <hi>A furious man</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.22) <hi>aboundeth in tranſgreſſion:</hi> Thoſe that have hearts diſtempered with Paſſion, Anger, and Wrath: they are ſuch as abound in tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there breaks moſt horrible things from them, when they are in the heat of their paſſion and anger, not caring almoſt what they ſay or do, all the Commands of God are broken then.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he came down from the <hi>Mount, Exod.</hi> 32.19. and ſaw the people in their ſin, his anger was ſtirred, and he broke both the <hi>Tables:</hi> but there his anger was good, for though both the <hi>Tables</hi> were broke, yet not one <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was broke: But uſually our wrath and anger is not good, and in our paſſion all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in both Tables are broke.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew word that ſignifieth to <hi>tranſgreſs,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42455:11"/>
doth ſignifie <hi>Anger,</hi> becauſe it is ſeldom that any in their paſſion do not tranſgreſs. It is the ſpeech of one, that if there were two principles of things (as the Heathens are conceited there is, one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from whence comes all good, and another principle from whence comes all evil) then <hi>Anger</hi> ſhould be the principle of all <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> the principle of all <hi>Good:</hi> much evil and very fearfull things come from wrath when it is diſtempered and let out.</p>
            <p>Firſt: Becauſe it doth wonderfully blind the Judgment of men. Anger hinders the mind that it cannot ſee that which is true. And therefore in <hi>Job.</hi> 5.13. it is ſaid, <hi>The counſell of the froward is carried headlong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a notable paſſage that I read of a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that had her Cauſe pleaded before <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who paſſed ſentence in his <hi>paſſion,</hi> and ſhee apprehending her ſelf wronged, ſaith ſhee I appeal, he ſmiled at that, being Soveraign, and ſaid, To whom wilt thou appeal? ſaies ſhee, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from thee when thou art angry, to thee when thou art not angry: noting that <hi>Anger</hi> blinds the judgment.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Paſſion and Wrath is compared to <hi>Fire,</hi> and fire is <hi>active,</hi> and quickly goes beyond its bounds, and then there is no hold of it, but much evill may come of it, and ſo it is with Wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Much evill comes of <hi>Paſſion</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, becauſe, being as diſtempered <hi>Fire</hi> that comes from a <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> it eats out the natural <hi>heat</hi>: as in the Body, the heat of the <hi>Feaver</hi> that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, it conſumes the true natural heat. And ſo, though there be ſome natural heat, or ſome kind of goodneſs, and kindneſs naturally in a man, that heat and goodneſs is taken away if he be in any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; And therefore one brings in this compariſon.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42455:11"/>
               <hi>Kindneſs is as one that is very hot naturally, when paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion comes, it doth conſume and take away the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, and he is altogether carried on in a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered heat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly: Wrathful paſſion doth warm all the Luſts that lodg in the heart, and put an activeneſs into them, whereas before they were cold, and like <hi>Snakes,</hi> being cold do not ſtir, but if they come to be warm, then they craule about and ſting: And ſo many corruptions lie in the hearts of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are congealed with cold, and like Snakes lie and do not ſtir; but when the heat of paſſion comes, it puts a heat into all thoſe corruptions, and then they craul forth and make <hi>wofull work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in all men there is a diſtempered Wrath, and fearful fruits come from it, if it be not mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but when there is power joyned with paſſion then it is outragious indeed. As we ſee here, How violent in wrath was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> commends <hi>Moſes</hi> that he was not afraid of the paſſion that was joyned with power. So <hi>Saul.</hi> How violent was his paſſion when once he had power? He ſeemed to be a man of a very quiet ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whileſt he was in a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and withall at his firſt coming to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (as you may read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 10.) but when he was warm in the Throne, and had power more ſettled in his hand, then you may read how outragious his paſſion was, as in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22 18.19. he cauſed <hi>Doeg</hi> to ſlay at one time <hi>fourſcore and five Prieſts of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Nob</hi> to be ſmitten with the edge of the ſword and all this becauſe <hi>David</hi> his ſuppoſed enemy had been there, and as <hi>Doeg</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, <hi>Abimelech the Prieſt had enquired of the Lord for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may obſerve here how outragious men will

be in their wrath, when it is for themſelves, when in the mean time in the cauſe of God they can be quiet enough.</p>
            <p>As when God commanded Saul <hi>to ſlay</hi> Agag <hi>and the Amalekites, and all their Cattel,</hi> then he was loth to be ſo outragious, but out of compaſſion he ſpared ſome for Sacrifice, but then the Cauſe was Gods: now when it was his own Cauſe, then <hi>ſlay all, Prieſts and Men, and Women, and Sucklings,</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> and all: Thus many in the Cauſe of God are content to forbear and paſs by many things.</p>
            <p>Many that have but power in Families, Parents or Maſters: if their Children, or Servants ſin againſt God, they can put up that, but let their Children or Servants offend them, and then they are outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in a fearful manner. Thus violent and fierce is wrath where it hath power.</p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> when he had power he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the People rigidly, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.14. <hi>My little Finger ſhall be thicker than my Fathers Loyns, my Father hath chaſtized you with Whips, but I will chaſtize you with Scorpions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you know likewiſe the example of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> having power in his hand, when the <hi>Prophet</hi> came from God, and propheſied againſt the <hi>Altar. Lay hold of him ſaies he,</hi> as it is in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.4. And ſo <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> when the <hi>Will</hi> was read, he bad them cut it with a <hi>Penknife</hi> and <hi>throw</hi> it into the <hi>Fire.</hi> As you may read in <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.23. Even graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men having power in their hands in their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wil do many evil things. As <hi>Aſa</hi> the King a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, when the Preacher angred him he ſtrook him, See it in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10. But where there is no grace, there it is outragious beyond meaſure. As <hi>Zerxes</hi> a great Captain being angry, he ſhewed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginſt the water, for he cut a great River, and made it run another way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42455:12"/>The Reaſons why wrath and anger are ſo outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious where there is power withal, are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe power doth puff up the heart with pride and pride is the ground of paſſion: So much as men are paſſionate ſo much pride is not morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them. But as one man through the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his body, may be more ſubject to paſſion than another, So ſome by the diſpoſition of the body may be more ſubject to pride alſo: Power and ſtrength do much puff up the hearts of men and therefore in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 90.10. It is ſaid, <hi>Their ſtrength is Labor and Sorrow.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eorum certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> A. Mont. Interli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The word tranſlated <hi>ſtrength</hi> ſignifies pride, for they are ready to think the ſtrength and power they have, is given them for ſome excellency and worth that is in them above others, whereas it may be far otherwiſe. It may bee God raiſeth them above others, not out of eſteem to them but out of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to others, that he means to ſcourge by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anaſtatius Arenus,</hi> tells us of a <hi>Monk</hi> who was raiſed to be a <hi>Biſhop</hi> over a place, which was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill place, and he began to bee puffed up in pride that he was raiſed to honour above others: there was a voyce heard, <hi>Not becauſe you are worthy, but becauſe they have deſerved ſuch an ill man.</hi> So God raiſeth ſome to honor, not for any excellency in them, but out of indignation unto others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Men that have power are mighty fierce in their wrath, becauſe when any thing croſs them it comes mighty unexpectedly, they cannot think any dare croſs them. And therefore when the <hi>three Children</hi> would not ſubmit to that which <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42455:13"/>
commanded, <hi>hee was full of fury, and his countenance was Changed</hi>: what dare you reſiſt me? do you know who I am?</p>
            <p>It is reported of one <hi>Canutus</hi> that was a King, being puffed up with flatterers, thought that all creatures muſt ſubmit to him, and therefore he cauſed his Chaire to bee ſet by the Sea, and gave his command that they ſhould not preſume to come neare his Seat, becauſe (ſaith he) you and the earth I ſit upon is mine. So men that are in power think all is theirs, and therefore if any thing come croſs unto them it is unexpected, and that cauſeth them to be ſo outragious.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is naturally a revengful Spirit in men, and where there is power men do run upon it, and think it their only glory to revenge: it is the glory of God to be mercyfull, and yet men think it a glory to revenge,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Where men have power they look u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon every offence through their own greatneſs. God may juſtly look at every ſin againſt him as very great, becauſe he looks through his own greatneſs; and men that have power will be like God. Men that have any greatneſs and above others, they are ready to look at all offences committed againſt them as through their owne greatneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it unſufferable.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Beſides, Men that are above others look upon all under them as meane and contemptible, as if it were better for them to periſh as filth and droſs then for them to be croſſed, and prize the content of their humors more then the life and welfare of al under them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42455:13"/>Sixthly, Further, Thoſe that are above others have nothing to keep in their wrath, as meaner men, though their anger be up yet it is kept in by higher power: but where there is nothing to keep it in, it will break over bounds.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Again they have many flatterers that ſtir up their wrath, and put oyl into the fire, as the young men did <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, They think there is no way to maintaine their authority but their wrath, when as nothing doth more hinder the authority of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour then diſtempered paſſion, nothing doth more hinder the reverence that Governours ſhould have then paſſion.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Again, They think it beſeemes their greatneſs for them to have more wrath, and more diſpleaſure then others. It is a notable expreſſion that <hi>Seneca</hi> hath <hi>It is not the greatneſs of the mind that cauſeth wrathful anger, but the ſwelling of the mind.</hi> A leg that hath the gout, is bigger than the other, but it is not the commendation of the Leg, but the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Leg. So <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was called by ſo me <hi>Deifical Epiphanes,</hi> yet the Holy Ghoſt calls him a vile perſon. And ſo <hi>Rehoboams</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors might tell him, this becomes thy great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but the Scripture calls him a child.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Again, They have nothing elſe to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, nothing to make up any thing that croſſeth them, therefore when they are croſſed they are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious in their wrath.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42455:14"/>
and therefore conſider with your ſelves:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who is it hath given me this power, Is it not the Lord?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, Conſider how have I provoked the wrath of God againſt my ſelf, and yet God doth not uſe his power a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ainſt me? thoſe that are over others and are given to anger ſhould think, How is God provoked and croſſed? and if I do think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am croſſed to put forth all my power againſt them that croſs me, how is it that God is ſo patient, and that he doth not put forth his power againſt me? Though I am over them, I am under God, and God might juſtly put forth all his power in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his wrath againſt me, becauſe I that have but little power when I am croſſed, I put forth all my power againſt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then in the third place: Conſider the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that you have over others, when it is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of authority, it is a very glorious thing, it is that which hath a part of the Image of God in it: Wil you now then take your Authority, and Power to ſubject it to your luſts &amp; make that an Inſtrument of the Devil which is a part of the Image of God? it muſt needs be a great evil, and the more authority &amp; power any have, to uſe it in the Devils ſervice, the more evil it is. <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſpeech to his Brethren is very obſervable in <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.19. when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid leaſt he ſhould at laſt revenge himſelf upon them, he anſwers them, <hi>Fear not, for am</hi> I <hi>in the place of God?</hi> There are many interpretations given of this, but it may wel carry this ſenſe with it. That power I have is from God and under God, yea it puts me into the place of God, therefore I dare not abuſe it to make it ſerviceable to revenge. The Lord is to have the Glory, is to have the Glory of our ſtrength, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion. Hath God given you ſtrength &amp; power over others? let God have the glory of your ſtrength and do not abuſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42455:15"/>Many think it is a diſparagement to yeild to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when they croſs them, but they do not think it much to yeild to the Devil. Saith the Scripture <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26.27. <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the Devil</hi>: Rather give way to any Creature than to the Devil: if any croſs you, and you let your wrath go on againſt them, you give way to the Devil, but rather give way to any Creature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, It is a moſt peſtiferous force not to be reſiſted: the greater a man is above others, the leſs paſſion he ſhould have.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, Conſider God may give you power ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in wrath than in mercy. A <hi>learned Man</hi> ſaid. You muſt diſtinguiſh between that which God gives in good pleaſure, and that which he gives when he is angry: Whatſoever we have from God in a way of favor, or in a way of anger: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God gives me in love, I muſt uſe it in fear, leaſt God ſhould not have honor from it: and if God give it me in his anger, I muſt take heed I do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it to my perdition.</p>
               <p>Many times God permits ſome to be above others nor only in his wrath to them that are under them, but in wrath to themſelves, that they being above others might fal and break their necks: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that have place above others had need take heed they do not abuſe it: Conſider, have you uſed it for God? When you had power for God you were content then to forbear, and ſhall you now uſe your power for the maintenance of your Luſts?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> That Faith helps againſt the immoderate fear of men of Authority, of any Creature.</p>
            <p>FIrſt: Thoſe that are Godly ought to have, and have due &amp; reverend reſpect unto all thoſe that are in Authority: though they be not afraid of the diſpleaſure of the <hi>King,</hi> or of any in Authority, in the Cauſe of God, yet thoſe that are truly gracious and Godly, do give due reverence to them, in their perſons and in their Authority and power. Though they are not ſo baſely afraid as others are, to yeild to any thing againſt God, or Conſcience, yet ſo far as they may, no people in the world give that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpect unto Authority, as Gods people do.</p>
            <p>Secondly: None do it up on ſuch good grounds: becauſe they do it for Conſcience ſake, and ſubmit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42455:16"/>
to authority, further than others do: they dare not in their ſecret thoughts have any ill mind againſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and they do it, becauſe they ſee the image of God upon them, not to ſave themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And Thirdly. None do feare authority in ſo good a manner; they do it willingly and cheerefully, not by force, but as being the will of God they ſhould do it; it is agreeable to the diſpoſition of their ſouls for to do it. Naturally, no man would be under another, but it is agreeable to grace to be ſo, and therefore no ſuch ſubjects, as thoſe that are Godly, if it be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>It hath been a ſcandal caſt upon Religion in all ages that they did contemne authority, and did not give that feare that was due to authority. As <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaid, <hi>they would rebell againſt him</hi>; and ſo they ſaid in Nehemiahs time <hi>Juſt in Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> were fain to make apologies for the Chriſtians in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to convince them, that none were more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to authority then they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath a notable expreſſion in his apology. <hi>What is the reaſon you do not count us obedient to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? becauſe we will not worſhip Idolls, and pray to the Idols for your Governors? yet we pray to the True God for your Governors.</hi> Like men in theſe days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wil not yeild their Conſciences proſtrate to authority, and ſeek the honor of it in an unlawful way, therefore they are not ſubject to them, when as, none are ſo truly ſubject unto men, as thoſe that are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto God.</p>
            <p>And therefore we read of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> he took this courſe to know his true ſubjects: he proclaimed, that <hi>whoſoever would not worſhip Idols muſt be baniſhed the Court, and thoſe that would, ſhould ſtay</hi>: now ſome rather than they would leave the <hi>Court,</hi> and be baniſhed, they would ſacrifice to <hi>Idols</hi>: others left
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42455:17"/>
the <hi>Court</hi>: upon this he choſe thoſe that left the <hi>Court,</hi> and baniſhed the others: ſayes he <hi>If you be not faithful to God, you wil not be faithful to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can any man ſubmit truly upon right grounds to a <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> that wil not yeild to the <hi>King</hi>? if he ſubmit to the inferior, he wil ſubmit to the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. And ſo thoſe that upon right grounds wil ſubmit to authority, it is upon this ground, becauſe they are ſubject to the authority of God: and indeed there can be no truſt to any to be faithful to authority, but thoſe that are Godly. As that notable example of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizda,</hi> that was a great man in the <hi>King of Perſi's</hi> court, and the <hi>King</hi> would fain have perſwaded him from <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by all the flattering argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he could, and to get him to ſacrifice to Idols: ſayth he <hi>O King be not ſo eloquent to thy deſtruction: who ſhal think him to be faithful to man, that is not faithufl unto God? if ſo be we do not obey the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, how can we be obedient unto you.</hi> And therefore thoſe that are Godly do give a due, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpect unto authority though they do not fear any authority in the cauſe of God, yet ſo far as God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, their hearts do fear, and they do reverence them.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the point, to ſhew how faith doth help againſt the feare of men, I will give ſome helps for the ordering your ſelves in the right feare of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of men; though we muſt not feare it in any way againſt God, yet we muſt feare it: Faith wil teach us not to feare it one way, and yet it wil teach us to fear it another way. As the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Give feare to whom fear belongs.</hi> It is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans duty to give feare to whom feare is due. <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaking of obedience to authority.

            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>It is neceſſary for us to know the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al callings that men have to their places of authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, <hi>It is neceſſary to know the limits of authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Fiftly, <hi>It is necceſſary to know what we ſhould do in caſe authority is abated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, We ſhal give ſome rules of direction to order our ſelves in our paſſive obedience to authority when it is abuſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſix things containe this part of handling the point, and I wil be breife in them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This muſt be laid as a Ground. <hi>No authority is to be feared and obeyed but in order to a higher.</hi> I remember their uſual expreſſion that was wont to be in England in their way of Jubilies and commiſſions was this. <hi>In all things be ſure there be no prejudice to the right of the King.</hi> And ſo among the <hi>Turks</hi> when any were in the place of Judgment or authority, one goes and proclaimes before him; <hi>Let nothing be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Frederick</hi> the <hi>Third</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42455:18"/>
being asked who were thoſe that were moſt deare to him he gave them this anſwer. <hi>Thoſe that feare God more than me.</hi> And likewiſe it is an expreſſion of <hi>Auguſtine He doth not contemne power That doth chooſe to ſerve a higher power. O Emperor,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>give us leave not to ſerve thee in ſuch and ſuch things, for you threaten priſon, and God he threatens judgment and hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, Man in <hi>Authority</hi> is Gods <hi>vicegerent,</hi> but not only God is to be feared above his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> but in every man there is a vicegerent that is to be obeyed rather than any other vicegerent, as the Conſcience of man; ſo that man comes to be obeyed in the third ranke Firſt, <hi>God is the higheſt.</hi> Then there is a <hi>Second,</hi> that is Gods immediate Vicegerent, that is <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And then there is a third, that is, the authority of man: He is a Vicegerent that is under theſe two. Nothing therefore is to be done againſt the higheſt authority, no nor againſt the authority of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Secondly. For our direction in our ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that are above us, and our right feare of them: <hi>wee muſt diſtinguiſh between authority and men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> That is authority that is enjoyned by vertue of a law-ful power that is given to any man in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but if ſo be any man in authority ſhal enjoine any thing that is not by vertue of that authority that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, though it be good, then it is not authority, but his own mind, and his own will. As <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſaid, If I do thus and thus I <hi>am as another man.</hi> So a man in authority may be as another, becauſe he doth only enjoine his own wil and therefore to diſobey the mind and wil of men in authority, is not alwaies to diſobey authority, if the thing be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by vertue of authority.</p>
            <p>In the Third place. It is needfull for us in ordering our ſelves in our feare, <hi>to know the ſeveral calls that men have to the place of authority.</hi> This muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42455:18"/>
for granted. <hi>All lawful authority is from God</hi> yea the power of Heathens is from God.</p>
            <p>But there is a two fold call to the place of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authority.</p>
            <p>Firſt, An immediate call; as God called <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> to the place of Government.</p>
            <p>Secondly. A mediate call: and that is when God by men doth put, either a particular perſon, or ſuch a family into a place of government or authority.</p>
            <p>Now when any ſhal be brought into government by thoſe that have lawful power, though it be of man, yet they are in their place as by God, and are to be obeyed not only for feare, but for Conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>It is very needful for to know what it is that firſt ties a mans conſcience to be in ſubjection unto an other man: there was a time when ſuch men or ſuch families had not the power of authority; now there muſt be ſomthing that muſt give them power, it is not his ſtrength that can do it, nor conqueſt, becauſe my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not tied to ſubmit to one that hath more ſtrength than I, as my governor, but only to regard my own ſafety; and then if another come and get the victory, am I to leave my former Sovereign and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him? That will not be granted, that wee may upon any terms relinquiſh our Sovereign to goe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe he hath more ſtrength; but what then muſt tie my conſcience? it muſt be ſome ſignification of Gods mind that this is my Governor, and this muſt be either immediately from Heaven, by the Prophets, or it muſt be by inclining the hearts of thoſe that have power to put one in authority, to put this man, or this family into authority, and ſo far as Gods mind is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me, ſo far I am bound in conſcience to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And from hence follows a fourth thing, and therein you muſt conſider, <hi>how farr this authority is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42455:19"/>
limited.</hi> If no particular man hath no authority, any further than God reveals his mind; and God now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales his mind, either immediately from Heaven, or by inclining the hearts of thoſe that have power to give au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to give it to ſuch an one; then the limitations muſt be according to that power that conferts authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If God doth immediatly confer authority, then it is to be limited by that, but if God doth confer power by man, then it is to be limited by that.</p>
            <p>In ſeveral Kingdoms and Countries there are ſeveral Governments: one Country is governed by States: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Country a government of <hi>Monarchy</hi>; and other Countries other kinds of Governments: what is it that makes this difference of governments? of neceſſity the difference muſt be made by that power that doth firſt confer this authority, and ſo it is to be limited by that authority.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſe Thoſe that are limitted: <hi>ſhall abuſe their authority and go beyond it</hi>?</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer. The perſons that are in authority are to be reverenced, but their abuſe may be two fold. When they command a thing that is unlawful: or when they do command a thing that is beyond their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As ſuppoſe a <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould command a thing that is beyond his Lordly power and belongs to a <hi>Prince</hi>; if he doth command any thing that is beyond thoſe limits where with he hath been limited from God by man, then it is not diſobedience to authority to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, becauſe authority doth not enjoine it: If it be beleeved, there muſt be power to confer authority, and this power muſt be from God, or man, and if God or man do not confer it, then they have no authority.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe. That any that are in authority do command a thing that is <hi>unlawful to be done and yet they do not go beyond the limits of authority?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can that be? It is true, God gives commiſſion only to command things lawful, yet man may confer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42455:19"/>
ſo much power upon others, as they ſhal by vertue of that power is given to them by man, command that which is unlawful: I do not ſay rightly, but their power wil work to it: Now if any by the power which is given to them by man, ſhal command that which is unlawful, though we ſhould not actively obey, yet we muſt obey paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, or ſlie: we muſt not right our ſelves by way of mutiny, or rebellion. And my ground is this, becauſe it is between governor and Subject, as it is between man and man.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe, another man hath in his poſſeſſion that which is my right, yet I cannot violently go and take my right from him; I may juſtly be dealt withal as one that doth wrong, and be proceeded againſt as a malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; I muſt be content to ſuffer til ſuch time as I can legally recover my right out of his hands: And ſo if one in authority hath that in poſſeſſion given him which he ſhould not have, as to command things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, by our forefathers or our own ſubjecting our ſelves to him, I muſt ſuffer til I can recover my right out of his hand in a legal way by the power that firſt gave it him.</p>
            <p>And this wil anſwer a great objection.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, that lived under perſecuting <hi>Emperors,</hi> they commanded them to worſhip Idolls, that was a thing that was unlawful, yet they would not riſe againſt them, though they had ſtrength enough, but rather ſuffered. And upon this ſome think, whatſoever men in authority do command, there is no way to right it but by paſſive obedience. It is true the Chriſtians did not riſe, but did ſuffer paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the <hi>Emperors</hi> had power given into their hands, and they could not recover their right out of their hands, in a legal way, by the ſame power that gave them power.</p>
            <p>So that all wil ariſe to theſe three concluſions.</p>
            <p>The Firſts is this <hi>That al true authority is from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42455:20"/>Secondly, <hi>So farr as authority is adminiſtred lawfully. We are to ſubmit, not only for fear but for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If authority be adminiſtred unlawfully, yet ſo long as it is authority, there muſt be paſſive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or flying.</p>
            <p>This ſhal ſuffice to give ſome light unto the bond of obedience to thoſe that are obvoe us.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Some further Directions, how we ſhould order our ſelves, if we ſhould be injoined unlawful things.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUt to give ſome further rules of Direction; if we ſhould be enjoined things unlawful, and we could not in a legal way recover the power out of the hands of thoſe that do injoine ſuch things, how we ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Do not do any thing otherwiſe than au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enjoines raſhly: forbeare as long as you can, and conſult, and conſider further about it, becauſe we ſhould loath to do any thing than that which is injoin'd by tho ſthat are above us. If there be any arguments to ſhew that they may be done, we ſhould liſten to them. Some aſſoon as they ſee a thing Commanded that is forbidden. they flie upon it, before they try it, and therefore when they come to ſuffer they have little comfort in it: we are to try all our actions, eſpecially when they ſhal ſeem to have any oppoſition againſt authority.</p>
            <p>Secondly. If we be put upon it, that we muſt of neceſſity do thoſe things that authority forbids, do them privately, that it may appear we are loth to diſobey
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42455:20"/>
thoſe that are in authority: becauſe if we ſhould do it openly, others that know not our grounds, may be brought into contempt of authority.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We are to do it as ſilently as we can, not to make a brag and boaſt of it: as many will take a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pride in it: if they have warrant enough to go againſt the command, they brag and boaſt of it whereſoever they come: it is enough for us to go on ſilently; if we may do our duty to God, make little noiſe of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Obſerve all circumſtances of time and place, and ſo all other circumſtances, ſo as to do it in a way that may as little exaſperate them that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as poſſible we can. Many when their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc will not ſuffer them to do thoſe things, which thoſe that are above them do enjoyn, they wil go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it with ſuch bitterneſs of ſpirit, as if they did take delight to exaſperate them, this doth not become a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Fiftly. Howſoever we do thoſe things that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity forbids, let us take heed we give as reverent reſpect unto authority as wee can: not to be violent in our words, nor to give revileing, provokeing ſpeeches; that ſhews our own pride of heart rather than any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly. Be ſure you keep to your Principles; that they may be convinced that what you do is out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and not out of any refractory humor: if ſo be you ſhould plead you cannot do ſuch &amp; ſuch things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of your Conſcience, and they ſhal obſerve that you wil do other things that are as apparent againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they may ſee, it was not out of your conſcience but out of your ſtoutneſs: but if they ſhal obſerve that there is nothing in which you dare go againſt the rule of your conſcience, they ſhall ſee that it is not out of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto them, but in obedience to conſcience: And therefore by how much the more you are forced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42455:21"/>
in ſome things, by ſo much the more be careful, to obey in what you may.</p>
            <p>And this is uſual, that thoſe that are truly gracious and are in place of office, they wil labor to ſee thoſe laws that may make for Gods glory ſhal be executed, and ſo they are accounted rather two buſy, Becauſe they wil do ſo much for authority: but howſoever, it ought to be the care of all Gods people to be obedient to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in what they can.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place. If authority ſhould deal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hardly with you, take heed you have no thoughts of revenge, but commit your cauſe to God, and requite good for evil, and pray for thoſe that perſecute you.</p>
            <p>And theſe directions being premiſed, you ſee how far you are to fear the wrath of the King, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of al that are in place above you.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>BUt now we come to the point more ſtrictly: After you have obſerved theſe rules, and made uſe of theſe directions, you are to go on in your way reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably, and cheerefully, whatſoever falls out, not to baulk your way at all in the leaſt degree that God requires at your hands, but to go on without feare.</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſaith concerning a righteous man, In <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.1. <hi>He is as bold as a Lion</hi>: if a man know he is in the way of God, he is to go on boldly like a Lion; and in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.30. not to turne out of his way for feare of any creature. We find in ſcripture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42455:21"/>
how the Godly are commended for their reſoluteneſs and courage of ſpirit, that they would not fear man and the creature.</p>
            <p>As thoſe three Prophets. in 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 18.17.18. <hi>Elijah, Eliſha,</hi> and <hi>Micaiah.</hi> When <hi>Elijah</hi> met <hi>Ahab,</hi> Saies he <hi>Art thou he that troubleſt Iſrael</hi>? No ſaith he, <hi>it is thou and thy fathers houſe.</hi> And ſo <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when thoſe three Kings came down to him, the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> and the <hi>King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>: ſaies he; 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 3.14. <hi>Were it not that I regard the preſence of of Jehoſhaphat King of Judah, I would not look towards thee nor ſee thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Micaiah,</hi> when they would have had him propheſie good things, ſayes he, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 22.14. <hi>What the Lord ſayth unto me, that wil I ſpeak.</hi> I might give you many inſtances in <hi>Job and David</hi> of their courage, not fearing the wrath of man. <hi>Job</hi> hath a notable expreſſion. <hi>Job.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Did I feare a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, or did the contempt of families terrifie mee?</hi> that I kept ſilence, and went not out of the door? he was not affraid though he lived amongſt thoſe that were vile and wicked.</p>
            <p>And great courage you have in <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. and others, <hi>Though he walked in the ſhadow of death,</hi> and whatſoever befel him he would not be affraid. And ſo the Church of God ſayth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.2.3.4. verſes, <hi>Therefore we wil not fear though the earth be removed, and though the mountaines be carried into the middeſt of the Sea. Though the waters thereof roare, and be troubled, though the Mountaines ſhake with the ſwelling thereof, There is a river the Streams whereof ſhal make glad the City of our God.</hi> We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ordinances of God, and we wil not fear though there are ſuch tumults abroad in the world.</p>
            <p>And ſo that which is ſaid concerning <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in Chap. 15.12. <hi>Shall iron breake the Northern Iron and the ſteele?</hi> though they were as Iron that reaſoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42455:22"/>
               <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> yet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was to be as ſteel when Iron Strikes againſt Steel. It doth not break it, but brighten it; and ſo al the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had from all the great ones was but as the ſtriking of Iron againſt Steel, it did not break his ſpirit but brighten it. And that of the three Children in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16. Shews the magnanimous ſpirit that they had. <hi>We are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter.</hi> And ſo that ſpeech of Saint <hi>Paul. Acts,</hi> 21.13. <hi>What meane you to weep and break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but to dy at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem for the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo many expreſſions we have of the Martyrs in the Primitive times. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> making his apologie for the Chriſtians to <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>we do not ſpeak to diſſemble to you, but for our own right, we can be hurt by no man, you can kill us, but not hurt us, if you like mad men will obſerve the cuſtoms of men before the truths of God, do then, we wil not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not name every ſpeech of thoſe ſervants of God as imitable, becauſe we do not know what ſpirits they were carried on with, but to ſhew the ſtrength of their ſpirits.</p>
            <p>And ſo that of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Emperor do not lift up thy ſelf O Emperor, if ſo be you would rule, be ſubject to God.</hi> And ſo <hi>Odoſius,</hi> that was a good man, when he had been croſſed with the people of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> he cauſed many of them to be murdered; upon that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> refuſed to give him the Sacrament, though he came to the Temple door, and deſired it of him, and fell down upon the ground, yet <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſtood and reſiſted him till there was through repentance manifeſted to the Church.</p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Chriſoſtome.</hi> The <hi>Empereſs Eudoxia</hi> had taken by wrong the vineyard of another; <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad her the Communion.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>wherein lieth the power of faith to help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginst the fear of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much hath been ſaid concerning the power of faith to help againſt ſufferings, but now we have divers things to ſay concerning the power of faith in helping againſt the feare of man.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Whereſoever faith is, it putts the Beleever into a very ſecure and ſafe condition, making ſure of the ſafety of the Soul, and that the termes between God and it are good, and by that meanes it delivers the ſoul from being tranſported by feare. There is nothing can ſecure the ſoul that the termes between God and it are good, but faith: and that it doth by putting the Soul into the Covenant of Grace, and conveys the good of that everlaſting Covenant that can never be broken, unto the ſoul, and transferreth upon the ſoul <hi>the ſure mercies of David</hi>: and that muſt needs make the ſoul in a ſecure condition. A man is not troubled with feares, when he knows he is provided for his life: So a beleeving Soul is provided for Eternity, what now can trouble ſuch a ſoul?</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. Would have us in the time of danger <hi>commit your ſoul to God in wel do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>: when the ſoul is committed unto God in wel do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is no further fear. As if ſo be a man were travelling, and he had ſome precious Jewel were worth abundance, and he apprehends himſelf in ſome danger if he can commit his Jewel to ſome ſafe hand he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

fear. And therefore in ſome countries you have your <hi>Banks</hi>: men that are affraid of their money, commit it to the <hi>Bank,</hi> and there it is ſure. So a ſoul that can commit it ſelf to God in weldoing, and be ſure of that, it is not troubled with much fear.</p>
            <p>Quſt. <hi>But ſhould we not take care for our estates, and lives, and liberties?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sayth the Apoſtle, be at a point for them, but be ſure you commit your ſouls to God, and you are wel enough.</p>
            <p>As in a time of common fire and burning, If a man have ſome lumber in the fire, he doth not care for them, but if he hath Jewels and treaſury, he commits them to ſome ſafe cuſtody: and ſo a beleever having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſoul to God by faith, and ſo being ſure of the termes between God and it, his ſoul wil not admit of fear.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Noah. Gen.</hi> 6.14. When he had made an Ark, he pitched it about the; word that is tranſlated <hi>pitched,</hi> is the ſame word that is uſed for <hi>propitiation</hi> or <hi>attonement</hi>: noting, that pitch was to Noahs Ark, that the attonement of Chriſt apprehended by faith is to the ſoul: whn a ſoul by faith can apprehend the ſure meercies of <hi>David</hi> in the propitiation of Chriſt, this is to the ſoul in the middeſt of dangers, to keep it from fears, as the pitch was to <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark in the midſt of the waves, that kept it from the waters. And that is the firſt thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith keepeth from fear, becauſe it hath a ſpeiciall eye to the higheſt firſt being of all things, now that is a rule, No inferior cauſe can worke, but by an influence from the Superior; and therefore when by faith the eye can behold the higheſt ſupream cauſe, ſo as to ſee.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is no Power in any creature but from that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:42455:24"/>Secondly, The Acting of that Power is from that.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. The Force of that Power, is from that.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Succeſs of that Power is from that cauſe; and when the ſoul looks up to this higheſt cauſe and ſees all cleare there, it needs not much to look how it is with the inferior cauſes. As if a man had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, that hung upon many wheels, though the inferior moves, and it ſeems as if it would break and fall upon him, yet if he hath an eye upon the higheſt wheel that moves all, upon which all depend, and be ſure that holds, he doth not much regard the other. And ſo it is with a ſpiritual eye. A carnal eye looks only at things that are objects of ſence, he looks at the creatures, but a beleever looks at the higheſt ſupreme cauſe, and if that be right, he doth not looke at the loweſt cauſes.</p>
            <p>We have a notable ſpeech in Iſay. 54.16. <hi>Behold I have created the ſmith that bloweth the coales in the fire, and that bringeth forth an inſtrument for his work, and I have created the waſter to deſtroy.</hi> Are you affraid of the ſword and the waſters? <hi>I have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſmith that blows the Coals, and I have created the waſter to deſtroy;</hi> If they have any power to do hurt, it is from mee; why do you look upon the inſtrument and not upon the hand? If there be any power in any inſtrument of war, they depend upon God, and he makes them to deſtroy: and therefore faith looks to the higheſt cauſe, and is converſant with that, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the affections to that; it is not much affected with under cauſes; it doth not fear the wrath of men, nor the power of any creature, becauſe it looks ſo much at the higheſt cauſe that is above al.</p>
            <p>The confidence that carnal hearts have in outward helps, keeps them from fearing God, ſhould not the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42455:24"/>
confidence of the Saints in God, keep them from fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man?</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Faith helps againſt the feare of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it helps the ſoul to overcome greater fear than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feare the creature can cauſe.</p>
            <p>A beleeving ſoul hath been converſant with other manner of fears than the wrath of a King, namely, the wrath of an infinite God, a beleever knows what the wrath of a Deity means, what the terrour of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the curſe of the Law, and the flaſhes of Hell meane, and he hath had ſome experience concerning the feare of theſe, and he hath <hi>received</hi> ſome thing of <hi>the ſpirit of bondage,</hi> that hath cauſed him to feare other manner of things than the feare of man, and when faith comes, that hath delivered the ſoul from theſe fears, others muſt needs vaniſh; the power of faith ſoon extinguiſheth them 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. As <hi>David</hi> when he was delivered from the <hi>Mouth of the Lion, and the paw of the Beare,</hi> he was not affraid of <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>: ſo a beleeving ſoul is not affraid of the wrath of man, becauſe it hath been delivered by faith, from the wrath of an infinite Deity, and the terrors of the Law and of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>In the 51. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. Mark how God brings the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his people from the fear of his wrath, as an argument to ſtrengthen them againſt all other fears. <hi>Behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, even the dregs of the Cup of my fury.</hi> To what end is this ſpoken? In the beginning of the next chapter (for Chapters were not divided by the Prophets, but afterward, and therefore they have an immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion to one another) <hi>Awake, awake, put on thy ſtrength O Zion, put on thy beautiful garments.</hi> So ſayth faith to a beleeving ſoul, why art thou affraid of the wrath and diſpleaſure of men, be not feareful, for I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling: there was a time wherein there was a cup of trembling in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42455:25"/>
thy hand, and thou wert affraid thou ſhouldeſt drink of that, I have taken that out of thy hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore awake, put on ſtrength, be not affraid of man, being thou art delivered from ſuch fear.</p>
            <p>It is a paſſage in the book of <hi>Job. Job,</hi> 38.17. when God would bring <hi>Job</hi> to feare, ſaith God, you ſeem to have ſome boldneſs: <hi>but have you ſeen the gates of death? and hath the ſhadow of death been made known to you?</hi> that were another matter if you had gone through thoſe fears, and yet were bold; but a beleeving ſoul may ſay, yea Lord the gates of death, and the ſhadow of death hath been in ſome meaſure made known to me, and yet I am bold.</p>
            <p>The Prophet ſaith in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Be not thou a terror to me, for thou art my hope in the day of evil.</hi> Lord let me be delivered from thy terror and all the world ſhall not terrifie me. Thoſe that have been brought up delicately, and know not what any danger means, if they heare of any commotion and danger, they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but thoſe that are uſed to warrs, that continually heate the noiſe of Cannons, and ſee the affrighting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and deſperate things that are there, they are not ſo ſoon made affraid, becauſe they have been where terrors have been, and have been delivered from them and ſo a beleeving ſoul hath been acquainted with other manner of terrors than the terrors of men, and faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering from them, will deliver from theſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Faith helps againſt the feare of men, and all dangers and evils, by implanting the true feare of God in the ſoul. Where faith comes, as it brings all grace with it, ſo it brings the grace of the feare of God and the reaſon of al diſorderly feare in the world, is for want of the true fear of God: I do not meane the fear of his wrath, but that reverence that we owe to God as creatures to the Creator, that fear of God wherein a great part of Gods worſhip conſiſteth: if the ſoul were poſſeſſed with that, other fears would vaniſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42455:25"/>As in other afflictions. True ſpiritual joy will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come carnal joy, and the beſt way to cure carnal joy, is to have the heart poſſeſſed with ſpiritual joy: many take content in the fleſh, but they never come to have their carnal joy mortified, till their ſouls be filled with ſpiritual joy. And therefore though in the time of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They cry out againſt their carnal joy, it is not mortified, but they returne to it again, becauſe they had only the conviction of conſcience that their carnal joy was naught, but had not a contrary ſtream to fil their hearts.</p>
            <p>And ſo for ſorrow, There is no way to mortifie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſorrow, as to ſorrow for ſin; and ſo for deſires: no way to mortifie ſinful, creature deſires, as to have deſires Sanctified for God. As in other afflictions, ſo in that of fear: no ſuch way to mortifie carnal, ſinful fear, as to have the true fear of God planted in the heart.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the rod was turned into a Serpent, the Magicians turned their rods into ſerpents, but the text ſaith, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.12. that <hi>Moſes Serpent did devour the Magicians Serpents.</hi> So there is enough in the true feare of God to take up al the ſoul, that it hath no ſpace for the fear of Man; As when God is truly worſhipped, there he is only worſhipped: ſo when God is truly feared there he is only feared, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fears are in ſubordination to that. Where God is truly feared nothing elſe is feared, and indeed nothing elſe need be feared: As where God is not feared, no creature can help us: ſo where God is feared no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can hurt us, in <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Becauſe we feared not the Lord, What then ſhould a King do to us?</hi> ſo on the contrary, becauſe we feare the Lord, what then can a King, what can all the power in the world do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Faith doth diſcover unto the ſoul, that it hath more with it than againſt it. You know the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42455:26"/>
man was affraid, when he ſaw their enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them ready to apprehend them: the Prophet prayed to the Lord to open his eyes, and to let him ſee in 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> 6.16.17. <hi>There were more with him than againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So till a mans eyes are opened by faith, he may ſee many enemies againſt him to cauſe fear; but when God doth open the eyes of his Soul to ſee more with him than againſt him all fears are gone. It ſees al the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, all the waies of Gods Providence, all Angels, all creatures working for the good of it; and ſo it ſees more with it then againſt it.</p>
            <p>If a child or man, be alone in danger he is affraid, but when he comes into the company of his freinds, that hath more with him than againſt him, he is not affraid. So by the eye of faith we ſee more with us than againſt us, and that frees from feare.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Faith keeps from feare by bringing in the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt into the Soul, and makes the Soul partaker of the ſpirit of Chriſt: Now Chriſt is called <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah, Revel.</hi> 5.5. He was full of courage, and did not feare any thing which op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed him in his way: now every Chriſtian doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lion-like ſpirit of Chriſt, and hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing of it in him, and that puts ſtrength &amp; courage into him.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. We read of the <hi>ſpirit of Chriſt</hi> that he was anointed withal, <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſpirit of counſel, and might, the ſpirit of knowledg, and the fear of the Lord.</hi> Whereſoever the ſpirit of Chriſt is, there is a ſpirit of might and ſtrength, that will not eaſily yeeld to feare It is a ſign of a poor low ſpirit, to ly down and feare every thing that is never ſo little feareful: but a ſpirit that is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, and a raiſed ſpirit wil not eaſily feare. The ſpirit of Chriſt is a magnanimous glorious ſpirit, he hath the ſame ſpirit with his Father, and ſo thoſe that are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42455:26"/>
Chriſts come to have the ſame ſpirit of the Son and of the Father with them. And therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>We have not received the Spirit of fear, but of power.</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt hath a great deal of power and ſtrength in it, and when faith brings in the ſpirit of Chriſt it muſt needs help againſt fear.</p>
            <p>Seventhly. Faith helps againſt feare, by taking off the heart from the creature, and from all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that are in it. Why doth a man feare? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thinks the creature wil take away ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from him: now if the heart be taken off from the creature, and the comforts of it, and ſo from creature evils, neither eſteeming the one, nor accounting much of the other, there is not much cauſe why he ſhould feare, now faith takes off the heart from the creature. In <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.11. It is ſpoken of thoſe that overcome <hi>Antichriſt, that they loved not their lives</hi>: and if they were taken off from the love of life, then by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they were taken of from the love of any creature.</p>
            <p>It is a notable ſpeech that <hi>Chriſostome</hi> hath concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a worldly man. <hi>None more miſerable, and more feareful than a man that is faſtned to earthly things, for ſaith he, he doth continually live the life of care, and of trembling</hi>: but when faith comes, it takes off the heart from being faſtned to the creature, and ſo ſuch a one comes no longer to live the life of care, he doth not tremble any more. And ſuitable to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſo was his life; ſpeaking of <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres</hi>: ſaies he, <hi>what wil ſhe do</hi>? wil ſhee banniſh me? the earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof. Wil ſhe cut me aſunder? ſo was Iſaiah. Wil ſhe drown me? <hi>John</hi> was caſt into the Sea. Will ſhe ſtone me? So was <hi>Steven.</hi> Will ſhe behead me? ſo was <hi>Paul</hi>; Will ſhe take away my ſubſtance? my heart is taken a way from that already.</p>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Illaria</hi> meeting with theeves, ſay they <hi>are you not affraid?</hi> no ſaith he <hi>I have nothing</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42455:27"/>
to looſe: but <hi>We will Kill thee</hi>; ſaith he, <hi>I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to die</hi> And to a Heart ſeeing it hath nothing to looſe, and it is prepared to die, it doth not fear; it values no evil in the creature, nor any good in it, and therefore it is not affraid: Now it is faith that glorious and mighty grace, takes the heart off from all creature Evil, and creature good: and by this you may know the work of Faith in your Souls; When you feel a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within you taking you from the creature, and lifting you aboue creature comforts, and creature evils, that is the glorious work of Faith. And that is the Seventh thing.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Faith doth intereſt God in the cauſe of a Beleever. Whatſoever cauſe a beleever doth undertake, wherein he doth exerciſe faith, his Faith doth intereſt God in it, ſo that it hath not only the countenance, command, and faithfulneſs of God to help it, but the Name of God, and God himſelf. As in <hi>England</hi> if a man hath a debt, and knows not how to get it, he will turne it over to the <hi>King,</hi> and if he can intereſt the <hi>King</hi> in the debt, He thinks that will be a way to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. So here when a beleever is in a ſtraight, and he knows not what to do, he looks this way and that way, and ſees nothing but fears and Terrours and knows not how to help himſelf, yet if he can but turne over the cauſe to God, and intereſt him in the cauſe, he is quiet.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Faith hath a notable work to help againſt fear, in that it fils the heart with ſpirituall good: and the true boldneſs that is in any heart comes from the fulneſs of ſpirituall good that is in their Souls. As the Naturaliſts obſerve the reaſon why the Lyon hath that courage and boldneſs, Is, becauſe he hath a heart compacted and filled with ſtrong ſpirits. Many things when they are empty are weake, but when they are filled ful of that which is ſutable to them, it makes them ſtrong: So when a Soul hath a fulneſs of ſpiritual good in it, it is very ſtrong,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42455:27"/>Look what is the reaſon of the boldneſs and courage and impudence of wicked men in their ſin, the contrary is the reaſon of the boldneſs and courage of Gods people in the way of God.</p>
            <p>The ſpeciall reaſon of the courage and boldneſs of the wicked in a way of evill, is the fullneſs of wickedneſs that is in their ſouls; And therefore in that fact of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira Acts.</hi> 5.3. ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie unto the holy Ghoſt</hi>: If Satan had not filled your hearts, you could not have been thus bold to have lied to the holy Ghoſt. And ſo it is a notable paſſage we have in <hi>Eſther.</hi> 7.5. ſpeaking concerning <hi>Haman,</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>Who is he? and where is he that durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in his heart to do ſo</hi>? In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <hi>who</hi> hath filled his heart to do this? who hath a heart ſo ful as to venture upon ſuch an evill as this;</p>
            <p>As the filling of the heart with evill makes it bold and couragious in that which is evill, ſo the filling of the heart with ſpirituall good makes it forward in that which is good. As it is obſerved concerning <hi>Steven</hi>; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Steven</hi> was filled with the Holy Ghoſt how bold was he? he could look upon the face of his perſecuters with boldneſs: in <hi>Acts</hi> 6.15. and the <hi>Councell looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſaw his face, as it had been the face of an Angel,</hi> becauſe his heart was filled with the Holy Ghoſt. And ſo the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were very feareful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghoſt came down upon them, but when they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt they had no more feare.</p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Eliſha,</hi> how full of courage was he when the three Kings came to him, ſaith he, <hi>Had it not been for Jehoſaphat I had not ſeen thy face</hi>: What was the reaſon? he had the Spirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> double upon him, and therefore he was bold. As there is a Plerophorie of evil that cauſeth boldneſs, ſo there is a Plerophorie of good that filleth the heart with boldneſs, and nothing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42455:28"/>
doth ſo fil the heart as faith: that fetcheth of the fulneſs of Chriſt, and of his fulneſs we are full.</p>
            <p>In the Tenth place; Faith hath a great deale of power to cauſe boldneſs and take off the heart from the feare of Man; becauſe Faith doth acquaint a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever with the waies of God towards his people, and therefore he doth not fear: A beleever comes to have skill in the paſſages of Gods Providence, and his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards his people, and thereby he comes to know that it is Gods ordinary way to ſuffer the enemies of his people to rage againſt them and prevail againſt them, and to have much power over them, and yet they are his people. And it is no argument that God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken them becauſe of their affliction: And therefore you know, the Scripture ſpeaks oftentimes of Gods leading his people <hi>through the Fire and the Water, and that God will be with them there, Iſa.</hi> 43.2. It is the way of God to chooſe his people, and ſet his heart upon them in the Fiery Furnace; when he intends the greateſt good to his people, <hi>He brings them through Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſetteth them in wealthy places: Pſal.</hi> 66.12. And if one be acquainted with Gods way he doth not fear.</p>
            <p>If a ſouldier be not acquainted with the way of his General, when he ſeeth him undertake great things, and brings them into danger he is affraid: but one that is acquainted with the way of his General, how he will lay his ſtratagems, and knows that it is his way to go through ſuch dangers, he is not affraid: And ſo it is true; carnal Hearts aſſoon as they ſee any danger, they are affraid, becauſe they have not the skil to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the mind and will of God in his way towards his people, when as the people of God know, that it is the ordinary way of God to work good out of Evil.</p>
            <p>As Luther ſaies, <hi>He doth kill that he may quicken, and caſt down, that he may raiſe up,</hi> And the like;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42455:28"/>
and ſo he goes on in three or four lines together: but ſaith he, <hi>For to know this, this is the art of arts, and the Knowledg of Knowledges, very few do know and underſtand this way of God.</hi> It is a ſecret that God doth diſcover only to thoſe that fear him; Faith doth not make one like a Child to know nothing, but doth Doctrinate the Soul in the waies of God, and ſo doth enable it to overcome fears.</p>
            <p>In the Eleuenth place. Faith helps againſt feare: becauſe it doth put the ſoul into a high and glorious condition, as into ſafety, ſo into a wonderful high condition. A man that is great in the world is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid as others are: Now faith makes the place of Gods people to bee very high and glorious In the 43 <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight thou haſt been honourable and I have loved thee Therefore wil I giue men for thee and people for thy life feare not for I am with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a King ſhould come to a poore ſubject and ſay feare not, you are honourable in mine eyes, I prize your life more than the lives of thouſands, would not this keep him from being affraid; God ſayth ſo to every gracious ſoul, and faith cloſeth with it, and this keepes the ſoul from feare. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Feare not</hi> ſayth <hi>Chriſt, you are more worth than many ſparrowes</hi>: Gods providence is over ſparrowes but you are more worth than they. So precious are Gods people to him, that <hi>he numbers every haire Mat.</hi> 10.30. <hi>and tels all their ſteps, and bottles up all their tears. Pſal.</hi> 56.8. Surely he values every drop of blood, and <hi>much more their lives,</hi> Pſ. 116.15. and their ſpirituall priviledges. They are in a high and excellent condition aboue others.</p>
            <p>It is a notable expreſſion that <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> hath of the <hi>Preiſt Azariah,</hi> becauſe he reſiſted <hi>King Vzziah</hi> when he would have offered ſacrifice; ſayth he, <hi>Every one that commits ſin, is a ſervant to ſin, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42455:29"/>
therefore baſe though he hath a thouſand of crowns upon his head: but he that keepeth righteouſneſs is more a King than any King, he is in a higher conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than any in the world,</hi> But a moſt excellent expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion is that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> concerning this <hi>Why ſhould I fear when the Saints ſhall be raiſed to judg the world? why ſhould that man fear, that ought to be feared by Angels, for he ſhal judge them, and ought to be feared by Devils, he ſhal have power over them, and ought to be feared by al the world, he ſhal judge al the world.</hi> Doth a judg fear the priſoner that is before him. This is the condition of a Saint of God, and faith makes uſe of this, and knows what it is that God hath revealed of the high condition of his people, and therefore they do not feare.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly. Faith helps againſt fear, becauſe faith doth much ſtrengthen a good conſcience; whereſoever faith is, and according to the degree of it ſo a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſtrengthened; they go together faith and a good conſcience. Therefore the Scripture ſpeaking of ſome, In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>That they had made Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of faith, they had put away a good conſcience too.</hi> The one cannot ſtand without the other Now we know what a great power there is in a good conſcience to make one without feare: to know nothing ill concerning our ſelves, is a wal of braſs; the the breaſtplate of righteouſneſs helps againſt any dart that comes; and a good conſcience holds forth the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of righteouſneſs: and ſaith a good conſcience, they accuſe, but I will excuſe, they condemn, but I wil juſtifie: I wil be with thee in death, and before the Lord, and plead for thee.</p>
            <p>If a man come to be made a terror to himſelf, then no marvail if he be affraid of every thing elſe; but if a man be not a terrour to himſelf, if he be able to behold God in righteouſneſs, and his conſcience be right and good, he may look with boldneſs upon any thing. <hi>Job.</hi> 11.14.15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it farr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42455:29"/>
and let not wickedneſs dwel in thy Tabernacles: For then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without ſpot, yea thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and ſhalt not feare before men, no nor before the Lord himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, Faith helps mightily againſt fear, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and making uſe of all the gracious promiſes to help againſt fear. I wil name but two promiſes, and you ſhall ſee what a great deal of power is in thoſe to help the ſoul againſt fear. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.8. <hi>He it is that goeth before thee, he wil be with thee, he wil not fail thee nor forſake thee, fear not, neither be diſmayed.</hi> Mark how God heapeth up expreſſions. Before he bids <hi>Moſes</hi> bid <hi>Joſhua</hi> be ſtrong in the 7 verſe, Firſt he goeth before thee, Secondly, He wil be with thee. Thirdly, He wil not fail thee. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee, be not diſmayed, for I am thy God, I wil ſtrengthen thee, yea, I wil help thee yea I wil uphold thee with the right hand of my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Thus God heaps up expreſſions to help againſt feare. Faith makes the encouragements of the word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the ſoul, faith brings the divine power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of them to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Againe, Faith helps againſt fear by making uſe of al experiences of Gods dealing with his people in former times, In <hi>Habb.</hi> 3. throughout he makes uſe of the waies of God, and ſhews what God had done for his heretofore. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.4. <hi>I will make mention of Rahab and Babilon, I wil make mention of What God hath done in Rahab and in Babilon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. Faith helps againſt the fear of man, becauſe it cauſeth a Chriſtian to judge of men as God himſelf judgeth of them, and look at men as God looketh at them, and to have the ſame thoughts of men, as God hath and this is a mighty help againſt fear.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt ſee how God hath revealed himſelf concerning man, and what little cauſe there is to fear men eſpecially wicked men, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods people. I <hi>wil no fear</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt,

            </p>
            <p>But now let us conſider him as a wicked man, and then he is leſs to be feared, and there we wil conſider of him in three reſpects.</p>
            <p>Conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. His baſeneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. What he is in the greatneſs of his power oppoſing the Godly.</item>
                  <item>3. How neare thoſe that are wicked and enemies of Gods people are unto deſtruction.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt Conſider the baſeneſs of wicked men, we do not feare things that are baſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wicked men let them be never ſo glorious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of outward things, they are but as <hi>droſs</hi> and <hi>duſt. Pſal.</hi> 119.118.119.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then their Root (that which ſhould up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, and be their power) is rotten. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5, 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are <hi>as Straw trodden down for the dunghil.</hi> Iſa. 25.10.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:42455:31"/>4. They are compared to the Froth and Fome of the Sea. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.7,</p>
            <p n="5">5. His baſeneſs is expreſſed by being compared to <hi>Briars and Thornes. Ezek.</hi> 2.6.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould wicked men be feared that are compared to ſuch baſe things? Thus God judgeth of them, and thoſe that have Faith ſhould judge ſo of them. But they have a great deale of power and much ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us therefore conſider what God ſpeaks concerning the power of wicked men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is all but a <hi>Noiſe Jer.</hi> 46.17. Egypt was a great Kingdom, and the King of Egypt with all his power is but a noiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All their power is but <hi>a litle ſmall duſt Iſa.</hi> 29.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all their power, they are but as a company of beaſts, or little children that have reeds in their hands. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.30. <hi>Rebuke the company of Spearmen, the multitude of the beaſts.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>Spear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> is rather to be tranſlated Children that carry Reeds inſtead of Speares.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Their power is <hi>Curſed. Pſal.</hi> 119.21. <hi>Thou haſt rebuked the proud that are curſed.</hi> When they are in the top of their pride and rage, and they look upon the Servants of God with ſcorne and contempt, then they are curſed in their pride, and ſtrength; and that which hath the curſe of God upon it, muſt needs come to nothing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All their power is as nothing. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.11 And if their power be as nothing, there is no cauſe to feare their power.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are <hi>Leſs than nothing. Iſa.</hi> 40.17. Now what can be ſaid more, for the power of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be leſs than nothing. If we have the ſame Judgment that the Holy Ghoſt hath cocerning Man, there is no cauſe of feare of man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly: Conſider what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42455:32"/>
ſaies of wicked men, in regard of their nearneſs to deſtruction. <hi>They are ready to periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They are compared to <hi>Tow. Iſa</hi> 1.31. A litle ſpark of fire doth preſently blaze up tow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are like the <hi>Crackling of thornes under the Pott. Eccleſ.</hi> 7.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are like to <hi>Smoake.</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.2. Smoake the ſooner it aſcends the ſooner it vaniſheth: ſo the greater men are in their power, the ſooner they periſh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are compared <hi>To wax that melteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire, and as the chaffe before the wind, and as ſtubble.</hi> as <hi>Job.</hi> 21.18.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And al <hi>Their light is but as a Candle</hi>; Solomon ſaith, <hi>The candle of the wicked ſhall be put out. Prov.</hi> 24.20.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And they are likewiſe compared to <hi>The tops of the eares of Corne,</hi> that one can nip off with his finger. <hi>Job.</hi> 24.24.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>God cutteth off the ſpirit of Princes. Pſal.</hi> 76.12. The word ſignifies ſuch a cutting off as one with a knife would cut off a bunch of Grapes.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Againe they are like <hi>The blaſted Corne:</hi> and not only as graſſe, but <hi>As Graſſe on the Houſe top. Iſa.</hi> 37.27. Wicked men are going to deſtruction as a thing rouling before the wind. It is ſaid they are ſet in <hi>Slippery places, and the Angell of the Lord perſecutes them. Pſal.</hi> 35.6. If one be ſet upon the Ice, and another come to perſecute him, he cannot ſtand long.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And they are as a Garment that the moth hath eaten. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.28.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And they are compared <hi>To the fat of Lambs before the fire. Pſal.</hi> 37.20. <hi>And as Snow melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt conſider what man is in himſelf; and wicked man in his baſeneſs and power, and how neer they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42455:32"/>
are to deſtruction, and this is a mighty meanes to help againſt feare. Oh! Let us be aſhamed, that profeſs our ſelves to have Faith, and yet when we ſee how the Scripture doth judg of men, that we ſhould be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to our ſelves of ſo much fear of wicked men, how they will Cruſh us, and we ſhall never goe on in quiet before them, and they are ready to put us out of our way.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee wherein the power of Faith lyeth to help againſt fear.</p>
            <p>There are two things yet behind for the explication of the point.</p>
            <p>To ſhew the difference between that boldneſs of ſpirit, and audaciouſneſs that men have that have no Faith, and that Feareleſneſs that comes by Faith.</p>
            <p>As alſo to ſhew how farr we may lawfully avoid dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, without feare of men.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 9.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>How Audatiouſneſs and boldneſs of ſpirit differ from Faith. <hi>1.</hi> Audatiouſneſs make us bold to ſin. <hi>2</hi> It appeares in Cauſes that concerns our ſelves, then thoſe which concern God. <hi>3.</hi> Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the curing of one paſion with another, Faith the curing of paſſion by Grace. <hi>4.</hi> Natural bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes men raſh, and henders conſultation. <hi>5.</hi> The cauſe of immodiſty <hi>6.</hi> It is ſuden and violent. <hi>7.</hi> It proſeeds and lives upon outward encouragements. <hi>8.</hi> The iſhew of ignorance. <hi>9.</hi> Or deſpair. <hi>10.</hi> More Outward then Inward.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FAITH helps againſt feare, but it muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that men may be much helped againſt feare by a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42455:33"/>
meer audaciouſneſs of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall we know the difference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Audaciouſneſs of Spirit, though when it proves to be in Gods cauſe, it ſeems to be faith, yet there are many differences.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Where it is <hi>Audaciouſneſs</hi> of ſpirit, when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerves, they wil be bold in Sin againſt God, as well as bold in that which is good for God: but now where faith is, though it doth make the ſoul to be bold and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for God in the way of God, yet there are none ſo affraid of ſin: they tremble at the appearance, or occaſion of ſin: many that are mightily bold in ſin are mightily affraid when they are in danger, others that are fearleſs in the way of God, thay have no boldneſs in the way of ſin. Wicked men that have had the baſeſt ſpirits of all, have been bold in ſin; As <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> how audacious was he in ſin? and when he came into danger how feared he? It is ſaid he was <hi>found among the thorns,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 33.11.</p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Ahaz,</hi> what a bold ſpirit had he in ſin? when he came into danger what a baſe ſpirit had he? he was affraid and ſhook like an aſpine leafe. And ſo it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Caligula, in Iſa.</hi> 7.2. That was a bold wretch in ſin, yet when he heard it thunder, he would run into a bench hole.</p>
            <p>And ſome may go ſo far, as not only to be bold in ſin but to be bold in ſome danger too, and it may fal out to be in the cauſe of God, but know, if there be any boldneſs in ſin, and if you do not fear every ſin, al your boldneſs and fearleſneſs in any thing elſe never comes from faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Where there is natural <hi>audaciouſneſs,</hi> then men are eſpecially bold in cauſes that concern themſelves more than in cauſes that concerne God. When any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs concerns themſelves in which they are oppoſed, they care not for any one that have more power then them ſelves, but they are not ſo in the cauſe of God: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are truly gracious, that are feareleſs from their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42455:33"/>
faith, they are very yeildable and ſhamefaced in their own cauſe, in things that concern themſelves, but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hings that concern God, there doth appear another ſpirit, they have a new ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Where the boldneſs is meerly natural, there is a curing of one paſſion with another; but the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that comes from faith is the curing of paſſion with the contrary grace. As thus, where the boldneſs comes from natural audaciouſneſs, there is the curing of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear with the paſſion of wrath and anger, they are never fearleſs and bold, but when their paſſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſtirred up: where faith cures the paſſion of fear, it cures it not by ſtirring up another paſſion, but by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of this, and bringing in the true fear of God into the ſoul, it doth not put out one evil with another, but puts out an evil with a ſtream of the contrary good.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Where men are naturally audacious, and bold, uſually their boldneſs hinders their conſultation, they have not command over their ſpirits, they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on raſhly and headily in their boldneſs: therefore in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.4. The word that is tranſlated <hi>feareful,</hi> it ſignifies a raſh heart, it is the ſame word you have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.4. <hi>The heart of the raſh ſhal underſtand knowledg</hi>: to ſhew that fearfulneſs doth cauſe raſhneſs where it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate; but where feare is moderate, and guided right, it makes men to have power to conſult of things and adviſe of things, and examine of things: but your bold, impudent people care not, nor conſider not what they ſay, but where fear is rightly ordered by ſaith, the heart is able to conſider and adviſe beſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Again, Audaciouſneſs when it is natural makes men to forget the diſtance that is between one man and another, makes them immodeſt, care not what they ſay to ſuperiors that are above them: but when men are feareleſs by faith though they wil not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in their way by feare of them, yet they know how to give due reſpect to them that are in Superior place,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42455:34"/>
which a natural Audacious ſpirit doth not.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Again, Natural Audaciouſneſs is ſudden, and violent, but a man that is feareleſs by faith, doth not preſently, get up to this boldneſs of ſpirit; but it comes by degrees and ſeveral ſteps, firſt, more fearful, and then leſs, and ſo by degrees he gets power over that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his which before he found feareful, but the other is violently up, and doth not come by degrees.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, Natural Boldneſs it is according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward encouragements, but the fearleſneſs that is from faith is by the breathings of Gods ſpirit upon his heart; &amp; according to the ſeveral breathings of Gods ſpirit upon their hearts, ſo they are more or leſs feareful: the other boldneſs being natural it works always alike, if they have but the ſame outward encouragements: but Gods people though they have the ſame outward encouragements yet they are more fearleſs at ſome times then at other times becauſe they have not the Spirit of God breathing upon them alwaies alike.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Natural boldneſs comes from ignorance, and inſenſibleneſs, becauſe people do not know or are not ſenſible of the danger they are in: but faith diſcovers the danger, and makes men ſenſible of the danger, and then it helps; it is nothing to be bold when one is not ſenſible, and doth not underſtand the danger; but a gracious heart conceives aright of the danger, and is ſenſible of it and then faith lifts above ſence, and above reaſon.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Men that are naturally bold, it is through deſperateneſs, becauſe they have nothing to looſe, and care not what become of themſelves: but by faith men are not fearleſs becauſe they are deſperate, but they ſee help in God, and in Chriſt and his mercy, the more they hope, the leſs they fear, but the other are deſperate and therefore they do not feare.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Where audaciouſneſs is but natural, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more outward then it is inward, but by faith men are leſs feareful inwardly then it appears outwardly:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42455:34"/>
faith doth more cure fear within, then it is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs courage, and boldneſs without: but your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral audacious people know, though they ſpeak great words and make proud braggs, yet within their hearts do tremble; but it is not ſo where there is true faith: There is an aſperſion caſt upon Gods people, becauſe they are forward in Gods cauſe. They are bold impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fellows: and thoſe that are bold and impudent they go away as the men that have the only courage: now the ſcope of that I ſay is to ſhew that Gods people are not impudently bold, but hold by the grace of God that comes from his ſpirit, and is maintained by faith, and others though they be bold in many things, yet they are far from this excellent ſpirit that Gods people have.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THe laſt thing that is to be opened in the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the point is this. Faith helps againſt the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42455:35"/>
feare of danger and the feare of man.</p>
            <p>Object, <hi>But ſome may ſay that which you have ſaid hitherto may ſeem to embolden men to ruſh into dangers, this is the plea of many that bring themſelves into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ruſh upon their ruine, we muſt not be affraid of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To that I anſwer, Religion doth not teach men to be fooliſh or to be deſperate; it is too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for any man to think God ſhould give him aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in fooliſh, deſperate, raſh ways. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Cyprian, God would rather have us ſtay to manifeſt our faith, til we are called by him, and ſee him go before us, then that we ſhould go upon our own heads.</hi> Faith as it hath the word evermore for its ground and bottom, in that great act of it, intereſting the ſoul in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace; ſo it hath the word for the ground of it in every action it puts the ſoul upon. We have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table text for this in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.8. <hi>The wiſe in heart wil receive Commandements: but a prating fool ſhal. fal. the wiſe in heart,</hi> thoſe that are truly gracious receive commandements: before they ruſh into danger, they wil ſtay for the commandement, for the word: <hi>but a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fool ſhal fall,</hi> one that will boldly venture himſelf in danger, in ſpeaking before he is called unto it, he ſhal fal in it, he muſt not expect the aſſiſtance of God in it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But if we muſt not feare man, may we not flee from danger? may we not labor to deliver our ſelves from it when it comes? we muſt not ruſh into danger but ſuppoſe we ſee danger before us, may we not flee from it, and avoid it before it comes? if we muſt not feare the creature, muſt we deliver our ſelves from it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt I ſhall give ſome general anſwers unto it, and then I will come more cloſely to anſwer to that caſe of conſcience concerning fleeing from danger.</p>
            <p>For a general anſwer unto this, conſider theſe five things.</p>
            <p>Your queſtion is, whether a Chriſtian may not flee danger?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42455:35"/>I anſwer, Firſt, That the greateſt care of a Chriſtian ought to be to do his duty, rather then to avoid danger that may fal out in his duty: we ſhould be more affraid of our own baſe, earthly, cowardly, unbeleeving hearts then we ſhould be affraid of any evil that the malice and power of al the men in the world, and Devills in hell can being upon us: No Chriſtian is in ſo much danger of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil from the malice and power of al the men in the world and Devils in hell, as he is in danger of miſcheif from his own heart, and that man that doth not feare himſelf and his own vile heart, more then he doth al the power and malice of the men of the world and the Devils in Hell, he doth not yet know his heart: It is a greater judgment to be delivered up to a mans own heart: then to be delivered up to the malice of al the enemies we have in the world; yea, it is a greater judgment to be delivered up to ones own heart, then to be delivered up to the Devil himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are ſo ſollicitous to deliver themſelves from the danger and evil of the power of men, let them firſt labor that the ſtrength of their Sollicitouſneſs be to deliver themſelves from the danger and evil of their own hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You ask this queſtion whether you may not flee danger? I anſwer, when God doth ſo diſpoſe of things, as to bring his people into danger, uſually God intends more to exerciſe faith and courage, and patience, then to exerciſe diſcretion, though it call for both? and that which is Gods uſual cheif intent, ſhould be our chief care; when as the care of moſt Chriſtians in the time of Danger, is more to exerciſe their diſcretion for their ſafety. Then to exerciſe faith, courage, and patience that God calls moſt for.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Grant that the danger may be avoided, yet a Chriſtian ſhould count it a more honorable thing to be called to exerciſe faith, courage, and patience in a way of ſuffering, then to be called forth to exerciſe his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42455:36"/>
in avoiding of ſuffering. Indeed God doth not cal at all times to that which is the moſt honorable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet a Chriſtian ſhould account that more honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not bleſs himſelf that his condition is better then others, becauſe God calls others to ſuffer, and there gives them an opportunity to exerciſe faith, and courage and patience, and that he gives him liberty to avoid ſuffering, wherein he gives me an opportunity to exerciſe my diſcretion, and wiſdom; I am to count them the moſt honorable Chriſtians that do ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When God doth call for the exerciſe of diſcretion in avoiding ſuffering, there muſt be a great care in Chriſtians, not to miſtake their diſcretion, to think that the work of Chriſtian wiſdom, and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to abate the vigor, and activity and ſtrength of any grace of Gods ſpirit: But the work of it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the managing, improving, and increaſing of al the graces of Gods ſpirit. There is a great miſtake in the world about this, many think they muſt be zealous. But there muſt be diſcretion exerciſed: what do they count diſcretion? that which doth ſomething take off the activity, and vigour of grace; but there is not one grace is ſo an enemy to another, as to abate in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the vigor and activity of any grace whatſoever, but the work of diſcretion is to mannage and improve our faith, and courage, and patience, and all other graces wel for the glory of God, and the good of his people, this is diſcretion; but if you account that diſcretion which abates the vigour and activity of grace, though you put that glorious name of diſcretion upon it, God cals it by other names, by cowardlineſs, ſelf-ſeeking, and temporizing, and what wil become of thoſe?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, You ask whether you may avoid danger, and ſuffering? The cheife way that a Chriſtian ſhould uſe in avoiding of danger ſhould be in this; namely, in Laboring to get his heart to be willing to ſubmit to God
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42455:36"/>
in a way of ſuffering to be willing to endure ſuffering when he calls to it. As it is the beſt way to obtain a mercy from God, to get our hearts to be willing to be without it, if God ſhal ſee it ſit, ſo it is the beſt way to avoid danger and evil, to get our hearts willing to ſuffer that evil if God ſhal cal to it. Theſe things being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, there may be liberty to avoid danger.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Containes a further Reſolution of the former Caſe in nine particulars. <hi>1.</hi> God doth give leave to his people to fly, and avoid Danger. <hi>2.</hi> Such avoiding of Danger (if rightly qualified) argues neither diſtruſt of God, nor defect of Courage. <hi>3.</hi> In ſome caſes, Chriſtians not only permitted, but commanded to flee. as, <hi>1.</hi> When no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie thing depends upon him in that ſtation in which God hath ſet him. <hi>2.</hi> When the hand of God looſeth thoſe relations, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be obligations to him. <hi>3.</hi> When God gives him an opportunity elſe where, to bring greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of glory to him. <hi>4.</hi> When a Chriſtian is doubtfull about his call to ſuffer at the preſent. <hi>4.</hi> There are ſome caſes wherein it is utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to flee, <hi>viz.</hi> The contrary to thoſe above named <hi>5.</hi> Miſtakes in flying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as, <hi>1.</hi> To flee upon every ſlight and trivial thing. <hi>2.</hi> When it tends to their ſpiritual diſadvantage. <hi>3.</hi> When having ſecretly denied the Faith, Men flee to prevent the ſhame of Apoſtacie. <hi>4.</hi> When they look at their own ſafety alone, without care to fit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for further ſervice of God. <hi>5.</hi> How to know when avoiding dangers proceeds from Faith, or Cowardiſe, <hi>1.</hi> That which is by Faith is not in a Violent, Raſh, Heady manner. <hi>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> When it proceeds from Faith, it is joined with a reſolution to return and beare witneſs to the truth, when God cals. <hi>3.</hi> When we uſe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we have to get hearts to return. <hi>7.</hi> The caſe of publique Officers, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the latter.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUT yet for the more cloſe and full anſwer to this caſe of Conſcience, whether a man may flee from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42455:37"/>
danger yea or no, I ſhall expreſs my ſelf in theſe eight or nine ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhall lay this for a concluſion that God doth give his people leave to avoid danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if it be done as it ought, it is no argument of diſtruſting of God, or want of courage, and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In ſome caſes, ſome not only may, but are bound and ought to flee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some in ſome caſes, muſt not avoid danger, and muſt not flee from it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I will ſhew you ſome miſtakes that may be in the fleeing of danger.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I will ſhew you whether that avoiding of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger comes from faith or baſe feare.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I wil ſhew how far publick officers may avoid dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, eſpecially the caſe of a miniſter.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I wil anſwer to ſome objections that may be made againſt the avoiding of danger.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I will give you ſome directions for the behaving and carrying of our ſelves in fleeing and avoiding of danger.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, God doth give leave to his people to flee and to avoid danger (that in the general muſt be laid as a certaine concluſion) you know that of Chriſt in <hi>Math.</hi> 10.23. <hi>When they perſecute you in this City, flee into another.</hi> There is leave given and injunction too. It is that which is according to the light of nature, and religion doth not extinguiſh the light of nature though it ſhews ſomewhat above it, and except there come in ſome other command above nature, we may follow the light of nature, if we do not miſtake a falſe light for a true.</p>
            <p>And further we find it by plentiful example of Gods people, yea Chriſt himſelf avoided danger, and fled from it, and therefore he gives leave to it. As <hi>Elijas</hi> was a man of ſpirit enough, and yet in 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 19.3. <hi>He fled for his life.</hi> and thoſe Prophets that <hi>Obadiah</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42455:38"/>
hid were willing to avoid danger, as in 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 18.4. And the example of Chriſt himſelf preſently after he was born, when <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew al the children of two yeers old and under, then there came a commiſſion from God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Joſeph</hi> to flee with Chriſt into Egypt. Afterwards when Chriſt came to yeers, when he ſaw himſelf to be in danger, he avoided it. Divers texts we have for that in <hi>Math.</hi> 12.14.15. <hi>John,</hi> 10.39. And ſo Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> in <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.25. Preſently after God had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly and wonderfully appeared unto <hi>Paul</hi> yet notwithſtanding when he knew the Jews laid waite for him to kill him, the diſciples let him out <hi>by the wal in a basket</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. it was a contemptible way of fleeing of danger, and yet notwithſtanding that glorious word of God, that he was a <hi>choſen veſſel to beare his name before the Gentiles,</hi> in <hi>Acts,</hi> 9.15. he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to avoid danger in that contemptible way. The caſe is cleere, that it may be done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But you wil ſay, though it may be done, it ſeems to be ſome abatement to faith, and courage. No, the avoiding of danger when it is in the way of God muſt not be counted the leaſt abating of faith and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and for that I will give you two texts of ſcripture that are very remarkable for that purpoſe, In <hi>Math.</hi> 10.23. Where Chriſt ſays, <hi>when they perſecute you in one city flee into another</hi>: The next thing that he ſays is <hi>feare not them.</hi> verſ. 26. and againe, <hi>feare not them that kill the body, verſe</hi> 28. Here ſeems to be a croſs thing: they might ſay bleſſed Saviour, doeſt not thou bid us flee? How can we flee and not feare? this ſhews there may bee fleeing from danger, that may not come from the leaſt degree of cowardlyneſs and feare of man and there may be fleeing from danger, and yet no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith and confidence. As in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. The title of the Pſalme you have thus. <hi>A Pſalme of David, when he fled from Abſalom his Son,</hi> When <hi>David</hi> ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in danger of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he doth not venture bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42455:38"/>
upon it, and ſay God hath eſtabliſhed me in my kingdom, and made me many promiſes to uphold me why ſhould I flee? he did flee, but was it not an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his faith and confidence in God? no, at verſ. 3 <hi>But thou O Lord art a ſhield for me, my glory and the lifter up of my head</hi>: To ſhew there may be fleeing and yet confidence in God as our ſheild, and glory, and lifter up of our head and at verſe 5. <hi>I laid me down and ſlept, I awaked for the Lord ſuſtained me,</hi> he Fled, but he was quiet for al that in verſe. 6. <hi>I wil not be affraid of ten thouſand of people that have ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me round about.</hi> He Fled from his Son and yet ſaid he would not be affraid of ten thouſands of people. in verſe, 7. <hi>Ariſe O Lord, ſave me O God for thou haſt ſmitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone, thou haſt broken the teeth of the ungodly.</hi> His faith was ſo confident as it made him to think that which was to be done as done already and yet he penned this pſalm in a Fleeing condition. So that the ſecond thing is appearent,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In ſome caſes a man not onely may but muſt Flee, he hath not only a permiſſion but a command. <hi>when they perſecute you in this citty flee into another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What caſes are thoſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt If the caſe be ſuch as no extraordinary thing depends upon me in that ſtation that God hath ſet me: There is no ſtation but hath ſomthing depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, therefore if we ſhould ſay they may not Flee, but when the caſe is that nothing depends upon it, then none ſhould Flee: but where there is nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary depends upon it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When I feel the hand of God looſe my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which are otherwiſe tyes to me.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when God in the way of his providence doth open a door to me elſe where, where I may honor him (may be) honor him more.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When I find my heart doubtful about my call to ſuffer for the preſent: after much ſeeking of God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42455:39"/>
and much examination of things, yet with a heart deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſubmit to God when the caſe is ſuch no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is a bond to Fleeing, and it wil be a ſin againſt God, and tempting of God not to do it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There are ſome caſes we muſt not Flee in If you ask what they are? It is breifely anſwered, the contrary to the other; when as God hath ſet me in ſuch a place as ſome ſpecial thing depends upon me; or if I be convinced in my conſcience (being willing to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) that the cauſe of God, and people of God ſhall have more prejudice and hurt by my fleeing then by my ſtaying.</p>
            <p>It is an expreſſion of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>to Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> about this argument: <hi>When any by fleeing ſhal do more hurt then he is able to requite by any worke in all his life (as the caſe is ſo ſometimes) then he is bound to venture himſelf and not to flee.</hi> And it doth depend much upon a mans own conſcience, and the judgment of others to know this: a man would be willing to favour himſelf in ſuch a caſe, but let him be ſure he deal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly with God and his own ſoul, and not go only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own judgment, but take the judgment of others, and then if conſcience ſhal give him this dictate, his life cannot recompence that hurt he ſhal do by Fleeing, he is to ſtay, when he ſhal ſee the cauſe of God ſhal ſuffer much in it, and God comes in by ſome eſpecial aſſiſtance helping of him, in a more then ordinary way; he may take it as an item from God, that God hath a ſpeciall work for him to do. And this was the caſe of <hi>Daniel.</hi> He ſaw the cauſe of God lay upon that work, and it would ſuffer if he ſhould baulk his way, and God did come in with eſpecial aſſiſtance, and ſtrength to him, and rather then the cauſe of God ſhould ſuffer, he would put himſelf upon that danger: men according to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcretion would think he might have ſpared the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of his window, but his conſcience was convinced that his life was not of ſo much uſe as his witneſſing to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42455:39"/>
the cauſe of God at that time: and eſpecially if we be in ſuch a way, as we find God hemming of us in, and knocking off thoſe things that may further our fleeing, that we cannot flee but we muſt do ſomthing againſt conſcience and do ſomthing that is evil; you are to know that God doth cal you rather to ſuffer, and to venture upon him in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Thoſe that flee to avoid danger if they take not heed, there may be many miſcarriages in their flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby they may much ſin againſt God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor their cauſe. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. To flee upon every ſlight thing, that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeem a Chriſtian, it ſhould be ſomthing of weight that ſhould cauſe him to leave his ſtation: for there is no man or woman in any Station, but God ſet them in that ſtation, and therefore without the command of God we may not ſtir: We are all as Souldiers, and God hath put us into our ranks, as a Captain ſets his Souldiers in their ranks, now a Souldier dare not preſume to Go out of his rank without a commiſſion: whatſoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he hath, though it be to do much good for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: ſo we muſt have a Commiſſion from God, and not flee upon every ſlight thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many in their fleeing flee much to their ſpiritual diſadvantage: as they wil flee for feare of ſuffering loſs in their eſtates, and outward liberties, and care not whither they flee to further themſelves in their ſpiritual courſe: though (may be) they might with ſome loſs of their eſtates have more ſpiritual advantage then in the place whither they flee, yet they wil rather flee then looſe ſome of their eſtates, this is a miſcarriage. Indeed if this be the care of a man when he flees, to flee where he may have moſt ſpiritual advantage, not outward tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but God in his ordinances, he may have comfort in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if men flee into places where they have no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual advantage, but onely for trading this is a miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42455:40"/>3. When ſecretly they have denied the truth before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand not only fear what they may do but their hearts tells them if they be called to ſuffer they cannot ſtand out, and they flee only to prevent the ſhame of their apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; they cannot tell how to look upon the faces of their acquaintance that ſhal know they are Apoſtates, this is a miſcarriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath a whol treatiſe upon this concerning fleeing in perſecution, and I know no man that ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it might not be, but only he; he would not have any flee in any danger for the caſe of religion; and he brings in many arguments, but they are not ſuch, but an ordinary underſtanding Chriſtian may anſwer, but this is one thing amongſt the reſt, ſays he, <hi>When you flee either you find in your hearts you ſhall deny the truth of God, or you have done it, or you know not whether you ſhal or no if you find in your hearts you ſhal deny the truth you have done it already: but if you know not whether you ſhal or no ſays he, it is in your own power or in Gods power to uphold you; if it be in your owne power, why ſhould you not rather think you ſhould ſtand for the truth of God; if it be in Gods power, why do you not depend upon God</hi>: But I bring this to ſhew, that if you already think you cannot ſtand for the truth you have declined already.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth miſcarriage is this, when people in their fleeing look at their own ſafety, but do not take care to fit themſelves for further future ſervice for God, or for ſuffering afterwards, if God ſhal at any other time cal them to it, never minding to make their chamber of hiding to be a place of proviſion for ſuffering afterward when God ſhal cal to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Know a man may flee out of cowardlyneſs, and a man may flee out of faith. Moſes by faith forſooke <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhal a man know when he flees, that it is of faith and not of cowardlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:42455:40"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, That which is by faith it is not in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, raſh, and heady way, in the hurrying and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a mans ſpirit; in his Flight he doth not run as one ſcared by common fire, or by the enemies coming upon them; no, but his Fleeing to avoid danger being from faith, it is in a quiet ſetledneſs of ſpirit, and for that take theſe two ſcriptures. The firſt, is that which before was named in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>I laid me down and ſlept.</hi> He did not Flee as a man agaſted, but he was in the way that God opened to him, and his ſpirit was very quiet, <hi>he laid him down and ſlept.</hi> And again that which is obſerved by one in 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 19.8. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Elijah,</hi> Fleeing, <hi>he aroſe and went,</hi> he did not run eagerly, but he went on in the ſtrength of that meate in the way that God would have him: the phraſe denotes a quietneſs and ſedateneſs of ſpirit: ſo thoſe that Flee by faith do it with much quietneſs of ſpirit, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the hand of God, and not with bitterneſs and vexation of ſpirit, as many wil do, becauſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wil urge them they muſt Flee or ſuffer, and they dare not go againſt the dictate of Conſcience, but will Flee, but they wil do it with abundance of bitterneſs of ſpirit: A man thinks with himſelf There was a time I lived, and had al outward accommodations, a houſe and eſtate, and trading, and meanes coming in, and all my freinds about me, what a comfortable condition is this, and now I muſt break off all, and go into a ſtrange land, among ſtrange people, and I know not what ſhall become of me: this is far from that contentedneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that ſhould be in leaving al for the cauſe of God: whereas Chriſtians ſhould not only go on in a way of contentedneſs, but with joyfulneſs, becauſe Fleeing is ſuffering.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again where Fleeing is a work of faith, ſuch a man or woman that Flees from danger, wil Flee with ſuch a diſpoſition of ſpirit, as he is willing to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to witneſs for Gods truth, if God calls him; though
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42455:41"/>
now he doth not ſee his call clear: <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſpeaking upon this text of <hi>Moſes Fleeing</hi>: ſeems to take it for his firſt Fleeing when he had ſlaine the Egyptian, and when it came to be known, he Fled from Egypt: but (ſays he) <hi>the ſcripture ſaith</hi> Moſes <hi>was affraid, and here it ſays, he was not affraid, to that he anſwers thus. The Scripture ſays he was affraid, but now it is not attributed to feare, becauſe though when he was affraid, yet he had a heart willing to returne when God ſhould cal him, he did feare becauſe he did not ſee his call cleare; yet he went away with ſuch a diſpoſition of heart, willing to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Gods cauſe, when he called him to it, therefore the Scripture ſays, he was not affraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is an argument I Flee out of Faith, when I do but make that receptacle a chamber to fit me for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make uſe of al the liberty I have, to get ſuch a heart to returne when God ſhal cal; this is a Fleeing that is rather to be attributed to faith then to fear.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, For the caſe of thoſe that are in publick office in Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, great care is to be had in their Fleeing; they above al men ſhould moſt venture themſelves; yet in ſome caſes, Magiſtrates and Miniſters may Flee and avoid danger. As the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would not ſuffer in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.17. <hi>David</hi> to go out to warr <hi>Leaſt the light of Iſrael ſhould be put out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a notable expreſſion <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath upon that in his epiſtle to <hi>Honorius</hi> ſays he, <hi>he would have gone, he would not of himſelf have abſtained from the danger leaſt others ſhould have been imitators of his ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but it was their work to keep him from it.</hi> But now to ſpeak eſpecially of the caſe of a Miniſter, whoſe tye is moſt to ſtand out againſt danger in dangerous times he is not very readily to Flee, eſpecially when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is general, and <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> hath notable expreſſions about this in his epiſtle that he writ to <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in anſwer to this queſtion, being againſt it. <hi>He
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42455:41"/>
that is weake ſhal periſh by that knowledg,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. S. 11. <hi>no, he that is weak, ſhal periſh by thy ignorance rather.</hi> Again ſays he, There is more cauſe to feare that <hi>the living Stones of Chriſts building ſhould be demoliſhed, we fleeing, then that the ſtones of the buildings of our earthly houſes ſhould be ſet on fire, we being preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe ſaies he, <hi>Let us rather feare that the members of the body of Chriſt being deſtitute of their ſpiritual food ſhould be hurt, then that the members of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by the violence of our enemies ſhould be tormented, and never ſo afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it be ſo, then conſider this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You that are the people, you muſt not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake a Miniſter neither; if Miniſters are ſo tyed to you in time of danger, as they muſt venture themſelves for your good, ſurely people are not at liberty to depart from their Miniſters, for the tye is a mutual tye. You wil ſay, there is a difference between the Miniſter and another member: it is true, in regard of uſe, but if you come to the tye, the tye of another member is as real and ſtrong, as the tye of a miniſter: As in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the eye is of more uſe then the hand, yet ſomtimes the hand may preſerve life more then the eye, and though it be of more uſe, the hand is as ſtrongly and as truly tyed to the body as the eye; yea take al the members conjunctive, and there is a greater tye upon them to their Miniſter, then upon their Miniſter to them: the Miniſter is tyed to the whole directly, and they are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by being tyed to one another: and if there be liberty for one member of a Church to depart when he wil, then there is liberty for another, and ſo for all, and if liberty for them to depart, then there is liberty for the Miniſter too: many cry out of the Miniſter if he leave his people when he liſt, there is as much cauſe for a Miniſter to cry out of his people if they leave him when they liſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42455:42"/>Secondly, If there be ſuch a tye upon a Miniſter to venture thus for his people, he had need look to his cal: and the eſpeciall cauſe why in other places, and we our ſelves when we were elſewhere, were ſo ready to fear, and Flee upon every occaſion, was becauſe there did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſome kind of feare and ſuſpicion of our call.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If there be ſuch a tye upon a Miniſter to his people, his people had need labor what poſſibly they can to encourage their Miniſter, there need be ſtrong union in their ſpirits, and they ſhould take heed of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this body, and that body, or that melancholy ſuſpicions be caſt to hinder the leaſt union, that if time of danger come, they may freely and chearfully venture themſelves amongſt them: we know not what things God may call us to, the way that we walk in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to walk in, is that which the world and the Devil hate, and though through Gods providence we have a breathing time, yet if we reſolve to walk in this way whatſoever befal, we may meet with much before we die; and as we are bound to venture all that we are or have for you; ſo al that you are or have ſhould be bound to us.</p>
            <p>But in ſome caſes a Miniſter may be ſo affraid as to Flee, and yet not to ſin; as the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles did Flee in the time of danger. A miniſter may Flee, if the perſecution be perſonal, and not gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, and ſo as his people be provided for otherwiſe by others, and ſo as he may be more uſeful to his people being abſent, then he could have done being preſent, and if he Flee being willing to returne again, when God ſhal ſhew him his way, and if people break their relations; when things fal thus, then certainly he may Flee. In that Epiſtle of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Honorius,</hi> he inſtanced in Athanaſius, and juſtifies his Fleeing; becauſe the <hi>Emperour</hi> was incenſed, and enraged againſt his perſon and he was willing to returne when God ſhould give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. I might inſtance in al theſe, but I wil only inſtance
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42455:42"/>
in that if they Flee being willing to returne as God gives occaſion.</p>
            <p>As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in <hi>Acts,</hi> 14. if you compare it with that in Chap. 13. They Fled two or three times from ſeveral places, and yet when there was reſpite they returned again to the very ſame places from whence they Fled, In Chap. 13.14. They came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> there <hi>the Jews ſtirred up the devout and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Women, and the cheif men of the City, and raiſed perſecution againſt them, and expelled them out of their coaſts</hi>: being perſecuted, from thence they came to <hi>Iconium,</hi> where they ſped as before in Chap. 14.5. From thence <hi>they went to Lyſtria</hi> at the begining of the verſe where at firſt they thought them as Gods, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſo malicious were thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> that when they heard they were at Lyſtria, they came to perſecute them there: ſo in all theſe three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they were perſecuted even to death. Yet at verſe 21. <hi>they returned again to thoſe three places</hi>: thus you ſee the practice of the Apoſtles, But if the relation be broke between miniſter &amp; people, then they may depart.</p>
            <p>In the time of perſecution the caſe is more difficult, it is not ſo difficult for a Miniſter to leave his people in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſickneſs and weakneſs of body, as in the time of perſecution: and he is more bound to ſtay with them in the time of perſecution; then in the time of ſickneſs. Chriſt ſays <hi>the hireling when the Wolfe comes he Flyes from the Sheep</hi>: A true Shepheard undertakes to venture his life againſt the Wolfe; and for him to avoid that danger he undertakes, that muſt needs be unfaithfulneſs, <hi>Jacob</hi> was content to watch his Sheep in the night, in the froſt and cold, as wel as in the day, and in ſummer time The ſcripture doth not ſay if a Lyon come he is a hireling that ſhal Fly away; if the danger be ſuch, as nothing but a miracle can preſerve him, and his life may be more uſeful to the Church in another place, then to lay it down there, then he is not as an hireling, but as a wiſe Shepheard may avoid danger.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>AND now I come to the Eighth particular to anſwer ſome objections that may be made againſt this</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object,</hi> 1. It may be ſaid men may not leave their country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> We know a mans country may be left on many occaſions as for merchandiſing, to get eſtates to maintaine their families, ſo <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Sonns did: For learning as the Queen of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42455:43"/>
               <hi>Sheba</hi> did; ſurely then for Religion: It is true if we ſee any opportunity of ſetting up Relgion in our own Countrie, we are bound to ſet it up there rather then any where elſe, but if not we may leave our country, as the Evnuch travelled and left his countrie to come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for Religions ſake. Beſides;</p>
            <p>God hath a great work of providence in ſcattering his people, and had it not been for perſecution it is not like, the word of God ſhould have been ſpread abroad in divers countries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> 2, But ſhould none ſtay to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> For this we are to know that fleeing is a ſuffering; and if it be examined to the bottome, many plead with others to ſtay to ſuffer, and the bottome is becauſe they are loath to ſuffer ſo much preſently, as the departing from their country, and ſhops, and eſtates is. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in a treatiſe of his about fleeing from perſecution, gives a notable anſwer to thoſe people, and hath a pretty expreſſion to ſet out the temper and humour of thoſe people. <hi>It is like to many that are diſeaſed, and the diſeaſe is ſuch, as there muſt be the cutting off of a Limbe, or the induring ſome great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to cure it, one that is delicate and loath to endure hardſhip; if he can but get any one to plead his cauſe that this is not the way to cure this diſeaſe to put the patient to ſuch pain, it may be cured by more gentle means, and it were better for to venture with more gentle meanes then to cut off a Limb, now ſome through their loathneſs to indure ſome preſent certain paine wil venture to have it cured with more gentle meanes, though at length it coſt them their lives.</hi> So ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are loath to indure ſo much certain preſent trouble as to part from their Countries and Eſtates, they rather venture with more gentle meanes, when as many times they grow to deny the truth, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42455:44"/>
to defile their conſciences with ſuperſtitious things, and ſhamefully to ſubject them unto others.</p>
            <p>But why do not they ſtay to ſuffer; may be their time is not come (as Chriſt ſaies in another caſe) if they had ſeen their time come they ſhould have been as willing to ſtay as others,</p>
            <p>Againe, if they ſhould ſtay they ſhould ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unthankfull for the providence of God in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them a doore, to injoy the ordinances other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>Againe they dare not ſtay becauſe they ſhould tempt God, and truſt in their own ſtrength: if they ſhould ſtay and have not Gods call, they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Gods ſtrength, and they know their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> 3. But is not God Alſufficient and able to help in the greateſt dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Certainly if it were compared who truſts in Gods power moſt, I beleeve it may be found that thoſe that do fly to avoid danger have more exerciſe of their faith in truſting in Gods power then many that ſtay and plead in that manner, as if ſo be we had not much need of the power of God for to ſupport us and releeve us, and the truſting in Gods power for that, is as much as an ordinary, Yea, a ſtrong faith is able to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again we muſt take heed of ſtretching Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to work according to our minds, God hath power enough for the releife of his people, and he will put it forth for the defence of his people, but if we wil think to bring Gods power, to work for our wills, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving but preſumption: if God will put forth his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the upholding that way that he is in: Who art thou man or Woman, to think God ſhould put forth his power in the upholding thy way?</p>
            <p>Beſides God will put forth his power in the uſe of meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42455:44"/>Object. 4. <hi>But then we leave to give Teſtimony to the truth, and is not the giving Teſtimony to the truth of God more worth than our eſtates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Fleeing is giving witneſs, and thoſe that plead againſt it are loath to give ſo much witneſs, for a man to leave his eſtate and Country for a truth is not that witneſs?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides being abſent they may by their writing, or by their practice give witneſs, &amp; they may be reſerved to give witneſs further.</p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>But many of Gods deare ſervants (as the Martyrs) had power to flie, and they would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To that I anſwer firſt, may be there were many engagements upon them, God did not looſe al the tyes they had.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides, ſecondly, much doth depend on circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which a Chriſtian that is faithful by compareing one thing with another may ſee in which moſt of Gods glory is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be they felt ſome extraordinary work of Gods ſpirit in them, in away of aſſiſtance, and comfort, and emboldning of them, ſo as their example cannot be drawn into a general rule.</p>
            <p>Object, 6. <hi>But what ſhal become of thoſe that are left behind, if others that have abilities forſake them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To that I anſwer firſt by the example of thoſe that fly, what to do if God open a door, But if it be ſaid they cannot Flee, To thoſe I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, though they cannot Fly they may be confirmed in a truth by others, that do depart and are willing to ſuffer ſo much for the truth in their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42455:45"/>
and that more perhaps than they would have been by many exhortations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, I anſwer, if God ſhut the door againſt them that they cannot flie, and open the doors to others though their parts and graces be weak; if they be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they may comfortably expect, that God wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them and come in with more bleſſings and more aſſiſtance, than thoſe that have ſtrong parts and ſtrong graces could have expected, if they had not taken the way that God opened for them.</p>
            <p>Object. 7. <hi>But if men would ſtay a while the clouds may blow over, but they are fearful and cannot ſtay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, we ſhould be glad of that, that thoſe that abide may enjoy ſo much as we do, and bleſs God for it, and ſhall not enjoy them at all, but though this ſhould be, yet it is not enjoyed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And if it be the enjoyment of the ordinances one year we ſhould account it more than ſhould countervail the loſs of our eſtates all our lives. And thus we have finiſhed the eight particular in anſwering this caſe of conſcience, but that we may further direct chriſtians in this, there are divers notes for the ordering of our ſelves when we do Fly. When we are put into fear by man, and cauſed to Flie, we muſt ſhew it as a work of faith; and therefore let us learne ſo to order our ſelves in our Fleeing, and when we are Fled from danger as it may appeare it was a work of Faith: as,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When any are put to Flee danger, let them be careful they leave as little guilt behind them in that place they Flee from as poſſibly they can, let them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to purge out the guilt they brought on that place as much as they can, for there are none, that have not only brought guilt upon their own conſciences, but upon the place where they lived, and conſider whether that were your care to remove the guilt from the place, and if it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42455:45"/>
were not our care, now we are gone, let us mourn for our ſins, ſo as they may not bring judgment upon the place.</p>
            <p>Again, in the place into which we are Fled let us labor ſo to carry our ſelves as the name of God may not ſuffer among us, that they ſhould have occaſion to ſay, <hi>theſe are</hi> the men <hi>that Flee for religion, do they live as ſuch</hi>? but let us labor ſo to walk as they may ſay, <hi>theſe people that make conſcience of their waies, ſurely they did come for conſcience ſake; Their ways are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that they profeſs.</hi> We have a notable expreſſion of ſome that came from another country for religion, and yet walked ſo offenſively, as the name of God ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered much by them that the heathen ſaid, <hi>Theſe are the people of the Lord and are gone forth out of his land, Ezekiel.</hi> 36.20. we dare not ſay we are among hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but when <hi>they were among heathens they propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my holy name ſays God</hi>: and ſo many Fleeing from their own Country, profane the name of God in another Country, that give occaſion to the people among whom they are Fled to ſay, <hi>look here are ſome that are gone from their own Land, that profeſs themſelves to be the people of the Lord, and to Flee for religion, look what kind of people they are</hi>; thus Gods name is profaned, let us take heed that we give no ſuch occaſion to the people with whom we live to ſay, <hi>theſe are the people of the Lord that are Fled for religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould be careful to behave our ſelves, as thoſe that are Fled for religion, as exiled people, to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the things of the world, and to be content with any condition that God ſhal cal us unto, ſhal we repine when we meet with any trouble? that were an argument we had too too delicate ſpirits when we Flee from great danger and yet think we ſhould meet with no trouble at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When we are Fled, we ſhould labor to get our ſpirits into a contented frame, and walk in ſubjection unto God, and give God praiſe, as if we were in the

greateſt proſperity that we could have been in, in our own Country; we ſhould not have our hearts dulled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniency but keep up our ſpirits free in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; It is a notable expreſſion we have of <hi>David</hi> if you compare two Pſalms together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. with the 108. and the 57. <hi>Pſal. was when he Fled from Saul, and was in the care,</hi> but mark how <hi>Davids</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was kept up, he was not dulled and ſtupified as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are, that come from delicate houſes and are faine to live in Sellars and blind holes, their hearts begin to riſe, Oh! the freſh aire, and brave living that once they had: <hi>David</hi> was ſo, and yet his heart was kept up; <hi>In the ſhadow of thy wings wil I make my refuge,</hi> a poor dark hole he was in, and he counted that dark hole the ſhadow of Gods wings, againe <hi>I wil cry to God moſt high,</hi> though I be brought low and meane I have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this high God, and wil cry to that high God, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God that performeth al things.</hi> Had God performed al things for <hi>David</hi>? God promiſed <hi>David</hi> the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and <hi>David</hi> is brought into a poor hole to ſhift for his life, and yet <hi>David</hi> ſayes he wil cry unto God <hi>that performeth all things for him: He ſhal ſend from Heaven, and ſave me,</hi> though I be in this blind place, the God of heaven regards me, and ſhal ſend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſave me, verſ, 5. <hi>Be thou exalted above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, let thy glory be above al the earths,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>My heart is fixed O God, my heart is fixed, I will ſing and give praiſe:</hi> al this was when he was in the Cave, if you compare this with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108. which was a Pſalm of thanksgiving, and rejoycing that he made upon his deliverance, and the ſame expreſſion that <hi>David</hi> had within the cave, the ſame expreſſions he had when God had fulfilled his promiſes, and he was Bleſſing his name for his great deliverance: noting thus much, look what <hi>temper of heart we ſhould have in the enjoyment of the greateſt mercies, we ſhould labor to have that temper of heart in our ſubmiſſions unto God when we are Fled from danger.</hi>

            <p n="5">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42455:46"/>5. Again, let it be our care when we are delivered from the danger that we apprehended our ſelves to be in, to keep our ſelves in the fervency of our hearts, and ſpirits for God, and in the fervency of our love unto God and his truth as we had in danger. Many when they are in danger of their enemies and afraid of them, their hearts are in a great deal of fervency, and zeal for God, and his truth; and if they can get a few together to faſt and pray or hear a Sermon repeated, how do they rejoyce; but when they are in ſafety their hearts are dead and Flat, and if they meet together to pray or to commune about the word, their ſpirits are not ſo fervent as before, the Lord keep this from us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, let us labor to do al the good we can to the place which we are Fled from, by our prayers, or any other way we can; as the people of God, when they were from their own country; yet they would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Jeruſalem: ſo ought we to do, for we are much bound to God for it, in regard of the good we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly, let us labor to make that hiding place that God provides for us to deliver us from danger, to be but a preparing place for greater danger: let us not think becauſe we have avoided ſome danger and are in ſome ſafety, that al is well, but this ſhould be our care that thoſe places that are our hiding places to hide us from ſome danger, ſhould be our preparing places for greater dangers afterwards, and thus uſing theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we ſhal honor God in our Fleeing, and ſhal not have cauſe to repent us. And thus we have done with that argument, the anſwering the caſe of conſcience about Fleeing.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>How the Heart may be taken off from the fear of man. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is againſt the ſolemn charge of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is an Idolizing of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It becomes not the State and Spirit and profeſſion of a Chriſtian. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It diſhonors God, and the Cauſe of God. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It mightily heartens the enemies of Gods people. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is threatned as a great judgment of God upon a people, <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The evil effects of the ſinful feare of man. <hi>1.</hi> It diſtracts our thoughts. <hi>2.</hi> Weakens the heart. <hi>3.</hi> Eates out the true feare of God. <hi>4.</hi> It indiſpoſeth us to any ſervice. <hi>5.</hi> Inſnares a Chriſtian. <hi>6.</hi> It cauſeth other deſperate fears. <hi>7.</hi> Procures the judgment of God in our deſtruction.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>A VVord of Exhortation, How the heart may be taken off from the fear of man.</p>
            <p>There are two things that yet remain in this point, namely, to labor to take off the heart from the fear of man, or any danger, by ſhewing the evil that there is in the ſinful fearing of man, or of any danger that may befal us: Secondly, by laying down ſome means to bring off the heart from creature fear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Chriſtian muſt take heed of ſinful fear of man, and not to fear any creature in an inordinate ſinful way, for there is much evil in it, more than we are aware of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Firſt place, It is that which is againſt ſo many ſolemn charges of God, whereby he charges his people againſt this to take heed of it as a thing that would be exceeding diſpleaſing in his eyes, I ſcarce know any thing in ſcripture that God doth in a more ſolemn way charge his people to take heed of, then this; as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42455:47"/>
that place In <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.3. Mark what ſeveral words God hath, <hi>let not your hearts faint, fear not; do not tremble, neither be terrified,</hi> and ſo in Iſa. 41.13.14. <hi>Fear not, I wil help thee, fear not thou worme Jacob</hi>: though thou thinkeſt thy ſelf a worme fear not, and ſo he goes on in that chapter uſeing many arguments, and giving many cavaets againſt fear. So in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. in a few verſes you have two or three ſeveral expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fear, verſ. 26. <hi>Fear them not therefore,</hi> in verſ. 28. <hi>Fear not them that kill the body</hi>: and in verſ. 31. <hi>Fear ye not therefore</hi>: this ſhews our natures are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſinful fear, we are dul enough to the true fear of God, but to the feare of man our natures are exceeding prone: now that which is againſt ſo many ſolemn charges of God, that muſt needs be a very great evil.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The fear of man, and of the creature, is an Idolizing the creature, giving that to the creature which is due to God; and as we ſet up the creature in the place of God, by loving it, deſiring it, truſting in it, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in it, in an inordinate way; ſo by fearing it, yea fearing of it in a ſinful way inordinately, not in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God, is an Idolizing the creature in a ſpecial manner, becauſe the affection of fear is a mighty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful affection, and darws the Heart mightily after it; and therefore God gives great charge that he himſelf ſhould only be feared in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 8.13. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> So that to fear the creature ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, is contrary to the ſanctifying of Gods name, and againſt the ſpecial worſhip that God challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore in verſ. 12. He would take off their hearts from the fear of man, and the fear of the creature. <hi>Say ye not a confederacy, to al them to whom this people ſhal ſay a confederacy, neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</hi> The fear of God is put for the whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, for one to ſay I fear the Lord, and worſhip the Lord, is all one: <hi>They are taught my fear by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42455:48"/>
of men,</hi> they are taught my worſhip: <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ſayed to fear the name of God becauſe the ſpecial wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that <hi>Iſaac</hi> tendered to God was the fear of his name, and if the fear of Gods name be ſuch a ſpecial part of Gods worſhip, for this to be Given to the creature not in a way of ſubordination to God, that is a great evil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the third place it is that which is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbeſeeming the eſtate, and ſpirit, and profeſſion of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is unbeſeeming the Eſtate of a Chriſtian. What is the eſtate of a Chriſtian? It is a rayſed eſtate, higher than the eſtate of the world, but this makes their eſtates low, for it ſubjects them to the Iuſts and humors of men, we need not fear what man can do when he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not by the rule, and when he abuſeth his power, it is his luſt, and when we fear ſinfully we ſubject our ſelves to the luſts of men, and it is againſt the raiſed eſtate of a Chriſtian to ſubject himſelf to the luſt of any man in the world, we muſt be ſubject unto the power of man according to Gods rule, but be ſubject unto the luſts of no man though it were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Monarch in the world. The eſtate of a Chriſtian is a rich and eſtabliſhed eſtate, but this fear makes it uncertaine, as if he had nothing to reſt upon; The eſtate of a Chriſtian hath many priveledges; but this makes it ſeem as if there were no good to make up the leaſt evil. The eſtate of a Chriſtian is ſuch as all the attributes of God work for it, the power, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and mercy, and truth of God: But this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fear ſhews as if we had nothing to help us in our ſtraights and diſtreſſes. The eſtate of a Chriſtian is ſuch as muſt make account of a great deal of trouble in his way, but this ſinful fear ſhews as if we promiſed to our ſelves nothing but eaſe and contentment to the fleſh. The eſtate of a Chriſtian is ſuch as hath gone through a great many fears before, other manner of fears than the Creature can cauſe; the feare of the wrath of God, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42455:48"/>
the ſtroake of Juſtice, and the Curſe of the Law, but this ſinful feare makes it ſeem as if we had never been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch fear.</p>
            <p>It is unbeſeeming the ſpirit of a Chriſtian 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of fear,</hi> that is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Chriſtian. The ſpirit of a Chriſtian is a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirit, this is a low ſpirit, The ſpirit of a Chriſtian is ſtrong, this is a weak effeminate ſpirit; The ſpirit of a Chriſtian is raiſed upon high principles; this is from baſe principles; The ſpirit of a Chriſtian is an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, this is a mean ſpirit diſcouraged upon every little danger; The ſpirit of a Chriſtian is ful of love, this is ful of Jealouſy. The ſpirit of a Chriſtian is a Clean ſpirit, this is a polluted ſpirit conſcious to it ſelf of abundance of evil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is unbeſeeming the profeſſion of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; a Chriſtian doth make profeſſion of ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that he hath in God, and in the Covenant of Grace and the promiſes of the Goſpel and to be daunted with every little fear is quite croſs to this. And therefore thats obſervable of <hi>Ezra, Ezra,</hi> 8.22. When he had made profeſſion of Gods being with them, <hi>he was aſhamed to aske of the King a band of Souldiers</hi>: he was aſhamed to do any thing to ſhew that they feared the enemy; and ſo when a Chriſtian ſhal profeſs intereſt in God, yet have ſuch baſe ſinful fear, this is mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſion of a true Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A ſinful fear is that which much diſhonors God, and his Cauſe, a great diſhonor it is to God to have his people ſo affraid of every danger, it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to his power, his truth, his faithfulneſs, and his care over his people, It is a diſhonor to God, and ſo in that reſpect it is contrary to the ſanctifying of Gods name, and therefore you ſhal obſerve, where the Lord chargeth his people with ſinful fear, he charges them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they did not remember him. Iſa. 57.11. <hi>Of whom haſt thou been affraid, or feared t,hat thou haſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42455:49"/>
lyed and haſt not remembred me,</hi> where there is ſinful fear it takes off the heart from God, as if there were no God in heaven to help a Chriſtian. Therefore it was <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> 6.8. Would not be affraid when he ſaw others ſought to make him affraid, becauſe it would have been a diſhonor to God, and his cauſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Beſides ſinful fear is that which doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily hearten the enemies of Gods people and diſhear tens Gods people, it makes the enemies of Gods people ſo much the more bold; the fear of anenemy heartens an Enemy, as <hi>Gideon</hi> when he came to the Hoſt of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and heard their communication that they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of <hi>Gideon,</hi> then he was ſo much the more heartned; and ſo the ſpies that went to the land of Canaan, when they heard that the fear of them was amongſt the people this heartened them, and ſo when one knows his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is affraid of him, he will be heartned; a dog will follow another, that runs from him. And this diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the people of God when they ſee others afraid in the cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is a great evil, becauſe it is that which is threatned as a great judgment of God upon a people, it is not only a ſin but a puniſhment for ſome former ſin, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.65.66. This is Gods judgment againſt wickedneſs, and therefore a ſore, and great evil that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould count to be upon them, if the ſpirit of fear be upon them.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The evil of it appears in the evil effects that proceed of it upon ourſelves: as.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The diſtraction of our thoughts and therefore the word that is tranſlated <hi>Raſh,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.4. It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Fear,</hi> becauſe it doth diſtract the thoughts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and makes them do they know not what, It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an excellency that was in <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and other valorous ſpirits, that they were in the time of danger able to command their thoughts, and to conſult and mannage any buſineſs, for uſually fear diſtracts ones thoughts.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:42455:49"/>2. Again it weakens the heart exceedingly, though a ſudden fear may cauſe ſome ſtrength, and the putting forth of the ſpirit, yet uſually it doth weaken the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Weaknes</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> go together, &amp; in <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Fainting of ſpirit</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> go together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fear of man is that which doth exceedingly eate out the true fear of God, as love of the creature eats out the love of God, and joy in ſinful things eates out the true joy in God, So fear of the creature eates out the fear of God. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.11. <hi>Of whom haſt thou been affraid, or feared that thou haſt lyed, and haſt not remembred me,</hi> as if God ſhould ſay my fear and the fear of the creature cannot ſtand together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sinful fear makes one altogether unfit for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to be uſed in any employment for God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Judg,</hi> 7.3. God gives a command to the people by whom he would do great things, that <hi>all that were of a fearful heart ſhould return back again,</hi> as If God ſhould ſay they are not fit for me.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The fear of man is a great ſnare,</hi> 29. Prov. 25. It brings a man to many ſinful courſes, and ſhifting ways and to commit ſin againſt God in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.11. Of whom haſt thou been afraid, or feared, that thou haſt lyed: many ſervants when they have done any thing that they are affraid of the diſpleaſure of their Maſters or Miſtreſſes, they are afraid and lie: and ſo in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when as people are poſſeſſed with the fear of man, they wil take any ſinful courſes, and lie to avoid danger you know what the Pſalmiſt ſays in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 19. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean,</hi> but the fear of man is very impure, the fear of God purgeth the heart; but the fear of man defileth the heart and exceedingly polluteth it <hi>I was affraid</hi> ſays Saul <hi>of the people and I obeyed their voice:</hi> In 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.24. And ſo many in Scripture were convinced that it was Chriſt, but they were affraid and did not confeſs him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>John,</hi> 12.42.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The fear of the creature hath abundance of evil in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42455:50"/>
it, in that it brings moſt deſperate fears; if you give way to the fear of any creature, to fear any danger and ſo to avoid it in a ſinful way, you bring your ſelves by this means to moſt deſperate fears: As it was the deſperate condition of <hi>Francis Spira</hi> when he was affraid of thoſe that had power over him and ſo denyed Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his conſcience, Oh the dreadful horrors of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he was ſunke into; and ſo it is uſual, for men that wil balke the waies of God againſt conſcience, when their conſciences are enlightned, their hearts are Burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch fears, as they cannot ſtand under them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of fears then the fear of man, in <hi>Jer,</hi> 1.17. God ſays unto <hi>Jeremiah be not diſmayed at their faces leaſt I confound thee before them</hi>: it is the ſame word that is tranſlated before, <hi>diſmayed</hi>; do not fear leaſt I fear thee; be not diſmayed leaſt I diſmay thee, and to reconcile both tranſlations the meaning may be, do not fear leaſt I ſo fear thee as to confound thee with fear ſo that you ſee this note is clear. By fearing the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fearing danger, we come to plunge our ſelves into the moſt deſperate fears of al: And let this be a warning from God to us all, be not diſmayed and affraid in any way of God, leaſt God fear you in another manner, take heed you be not terrifyed leaſt God terrifie you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dreadful examples we have how many upon their ſick beds, and death beds, have had dreadful fears, that they have done things againſt conſcience out of fear.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And the laſt evil that wil come upon us in ſinful fear, is the judgment of God in our deſtruction in <hi>Revela,</hi> 21.8. Amongſt thoſe that ſhal be caſt out into the lake of fire and brimſtone are the feareful, and therefore we had need take heed of ſinful fear and make God to be our only fear.</p>
            <p>But now that we may conclude this argument in a word of Exhortation, as ſinful fear is a moſt dreadful evil, ſo the trrue fear of God is a moſt precious Jewel in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.6. The fear of the Lord is called <hi>the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42455:50"/>
of Gods people, ſinful feare hath a treaſure of evil, and therefore to be avoided; Oh then let us take heed of ſinful fear of the creature, as the Lord by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>Say to them that are of a fearful heart be not affraid,</hi> do not plead and ſay I am of a fearful nature ſays God, <hi>ſay to them that are of a fearful heart be not affraid</hi>: ſo ſay I to you that are the people of God, in the way of God though you be by nature fearful, you that are of a fearful nature be not affraid whatſoever your natures have been, yet if your hearts have been brought under the power of the Goſpel, now there is a ſpirit of magnanimity put into you; <hi>Give me</hi> ſays <hi>Lactantius,</hi> (ſpeaking of the power of Chriſtian religion upon the hearts of men) <hi>a man fearful of pain of death &amp; if once Chriſtian Religion prevails in his heart, he ſhal preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemn crucifying fyre, yea that cruel torture of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris his Bull in which that cruel tyrant delighted to hear men roare being put into it when it was made bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hot.</hi> In the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> you have the the holy Ghoſt directing his exhortation to women who are naturally feareful 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 3.6. <hi>Whoſe daughters you are as long as ye do well and are not affraid with any amazement</hi>: it ſeems very ſtrange at firſt view, how the Apoſtle brings in this to women. It is brought in thus: Firſt if you conſider <hi>Sarah</hi> and as the wife of <hi>Abraham; Abraham</hi> was to go out of his own country and was like to meet with many dangers and difficulties and to ſuffer hard things; and this is the Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sarah</hi> and ſhee is ſet before al Chriſtian women as an example, that though ſhee was a woman, and ſo by nature Fearful, yet ſhee was not an hinderance to him, ſhe was not affraid with amazement, ſhee overcome the natural Fear of her ſexe by her Faith and it is a notable note For Women, when God cals their husbands to go out of their country, may be they would go but their wives are affraid of the Sea and of difficulties and they are hinderances to them: but if you would be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42455:51"/>
daughters of <hi>Sarah,</hi> you muſt be daughters in this, not to be affraid with amazement, you ſhould be true yoke-fellows to help them in that worke, &amp; not to hinder them with paſſionate fear. Further <hi>whoſe daughters you are</hi> this is ſpoken to Chriſtian women, now then many had Infidels to their husbands, now the Apoſtle would have them imitate this example of <hi>Sarah</hi> and by faith to go beyond their ſexe, may be their husbands would threaten them; if you do thus and thus, you ſhal live ſuch and ſuch an uncomfortable life with me, this might diſcourage many, and hinder them in their way, how ſhall I be able to live with ſuch a one that ſhal always be croſſing and vexing of me becauſe of ſuch and ſuch waies that I take; therefore the Apoſtles inſtance in this particular, if God have revealed his way and truth to you, whatſoever difficulties you are like to meet withal be not affraid with amazement. Again they living in thoſe times, whether they had good Husbands or bad, they were like to ſuffer perſecution: and now might they ſay how ſhall ſuch poor women as we; that are weaker uſually then men, be able to lie in priſon or Burn in the fire? this would bring down the ſpirit of the ſtrongeſt man. The Apoſtle therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects this to women, be not affraid with amazement, you have a ſtrong God to be with you in whatſoever you are called to ſuffer. There are many Gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that we find in Scripture that there is a time Coming when God will deliver his people from the fear of man that wil be a bleſſed time, for much evil doth come to the people of God by the ſinful fear of man, and we ſhould labor to fulfil Gods promiſes what we can. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.11. God promiſes. <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſts and not comforted, behold I will lay thy ſtones with fayr colours and lay thy foundations with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires</hi>; where was this promiſe ever fulfilled? the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church ſhal be very Glorious, that God wil lay the foundations with Saphirs, and the ſtones with fair colours; we uſe to lay the foundation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42455:51"/>
with rubiſh, and ordinary ſtone, but God wil lay it with Saphirs, verſ. 14. <hi>In righteouſneſs ſhalt thou be eſtabliſhed, thou ſhalt be far from oppreſſion, for thou ſhalt not fear; and from terrour, for it ſhal not come neer thee</hi>: So in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 23.4. <hi>I will ſet up Shepheards over them which ſhal feed them, and they ſhal fear no more, nor be diſmayed</hi>: many people have Shepheards over them but they are affraid they ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but then they ſhal have Shepheards and ſhal not fear, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.10.11. and verſ. 46, Chap, 27. There is a bleſſed condition of Gods people, and the more it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled to us, the more Glorious ſhal our condition be. And this is an obſervable note, that I have met withal that ſome have concerning that place in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.4. <hi>I charge you O Daughters of Jeruſalem that ye ſtir not up nor awake my Love till He pleaſe</hi>: In the former part of the Book in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.7. And in <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.5. The Church charges after another manner, <hi>I charge you O ye daughters of Jeruſalem by the Roes &amp; Hindes of the field, that you ſtir not up nor awake my Love until he pleaſe:</hi> But in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.4. <hi>The Roes and Hindes of the Field,</hi> are left out, only ſhe charges them, <hi>Not to ſtir up her Love til he pleaſe</hi>; What is meant by <hi>ſtirring up her beloved?</hi> And what is meant by <hi>the Roes and the Hindes?</hi> Stir not up my beloved till he pleaſe, that is when the Church is brought into any comfortable condition, there is a charge that they do nothing to alter that condition, to make it more uncomfortable, not, to ſtir up Chriſt ſo ſtir up Chriſt ſo as to diſpleaſe him. But ſhe charges <hi>by the Roes and the Hindes.</hi> The Roes and Hindes are fearful ſhy creatures, that wil run away from every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle motion, ſo ſome eſtates of the Church are ſuch, that many would come to joyne, but if they ſaw the leaſt danger, or commotion they would preſently run a way, and then the charge runs thus, you that are the Church of God, when God hath granted any proſperity and peace, take heed you do not take ſuch a courſe as to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42455:52"/>
looſe your proſperity, becauſe many are looking at you and would joyne to you that are of fearful hearts and are not ſo eſtabliſhed as to venture upon dangers, and troubles and therefore if you cauſe diſturbances, and Chriſt be ſtirred up before he pleaſe, thoſe that ſtand by that are of fearful natures, will be afraid, and they will Reaſon, we thought to have joyned with them, but we ſee what troubles are like to be among them, and theſe are the Roes, and Hindes that retreate: but now afterward the Church came to be in a more eſtabliſhed condition, and thoſe that God intends to bring into his people ſhould not be of ſuch fearful natures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8, he leaves out the Roes, and the Hinds and ſays take heed what you do: indeed now there is no ſuch danger of fearful natures, thoſe that God wil bring in they ſhal come through danger, and through trouble, they wil reaſon there hath been troubles amongſt Gods people ever ſince the beginning of the world, and they wil not go back becauſe of them, yet take heed of troubles and diſturbances:</p>
            <p>Now there are many eſpeciall means to help againſt theſe fears, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. Labor to take off your love from the creature and you will not have much fear, Says an ancient <hi>he that hath nothing in the world that he loves, he hath nothing in the world that he feares,</hi> for the foundation of all fear is love: According to the degree we love any thing ſo we fear the contrary, let us but mortify our love to the creature and we ſhal mortify the fear of the creature,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us get and keep our intereſt in God, and that wil keep us from the fear of the creature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us labor to ſee clearly that the cauſe we are in is Gods Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Look to the call of that cauſe, though the cauſe be good if we have not as all to that cauſe, we cannot be helpt againſt Fear.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Labor to bring your Hearts to count it Honor, and Riches, and pleaſure enough to be employed in Gods
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42455:52"/>
ſervice any way, whatſoever comes of it, if I ſhould endure ſuch and ſuch troubles in it, yet the wil of God be done, God cals for my eſtate, and liberty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be employed this way, and that is enough that any thing I have may be employed in Gods way, and if it be loſt in Gods ſervice, it is well loſt, if the Heart be brought to this diſpoſition, it wil not fear the loſs of any thing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Keep the conſcience upright in Gods way, <hi>Job,</hi> 11.14.15, <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand put it far from thee and let not wickedneſs dwel in thy tabernacle, for then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without ſpot; yea thou ſhalt be ſteadfaſt and not fear</hi>: When the Heart begins to decline in the leaſt degree, then it is filled with Fear.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Keep a cloſe and ful and comfortable communion one with another, let there be no fear with one another, as that is a notable place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10. Concerning the care of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> over <hi>Timothy,</hi> becauſe he was young, and ſo weak, <hi>That he might be with the Church without fears.</hi> As a means to help <hi>Timothy</hi> in his way againſt whatſoever troubles he met abroad, ſo whatſoever dangers there be abroad in the world you will find this a notable means to ſtrengthen your hearts to be without fear of all the world, to keep cloſe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If you will needs fear, fear proſperity rather then trouble: and indeed there is more cauſe to fear our eaſe and our proſperity, then to fear any trouble in the world, there is more cauſe to fear the favors of men, then their threatnings, there is more cauſe to fear the world when it comes like a Fox, then when it comes like a Lyon, the joys of this preſent world are to be feared by a Chriſtian: now Chriſtians fear altogether preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, but you ſhould labor to fear proſperity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Laſtly, conſider how little good, fear of any creature will do, it will never a whit free you from the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42455:53"/>
evil you fear. But rather bring it ſooner, as when <hi>Peter</hi> was affraid of the waves, and affraid of ſinking, did it help him? No, it rather brought the waves upon him, and ſo in trouble your fear cannot help you, and deliver you but bring trouble ſooner upon you. And therefore that is an obſervable note, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>John</hi> and <hi>the other diſciples,</hi> when Chriſt was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>all the diſciples fled,</hi> except <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſtood when he was in the Prieſts Hall, and when he was <hi>upon the Croſs,</hi> he ſaid to him <hi>behold thy Mother,</hi> ſo that he was not affraid of his life, now their was not one of all the Diſciples that fled for there lives, but dyed violent Deaths, and their lives were taken away, and <hi>John</hi> that did not flee, lived fourſcore years after Chriſt, and continued in his miniſtry. So that you ſee God many times will preſerve ſuch as are leaſt affraid, and let ſuch as are affraid, fal into the trouble that they are affraid of, at that time they are affraid or afterwards; And thus we have finiſhed the ſecond Doctrinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from theſe words, that faith cures ſinful Fear.</p>

            <p>WEE come now to the next Doctrinal conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which was raiſed from hence, there was a time when <hi>Moſes</hi> was affraid, he did forſake E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt out of fear; now <hi>Moſes by faith did forſake E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and was not affraid</hi>; The Point is.</p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> There is a great deal of difference between the Spirits of Gods people at ſome time, from that they are at other times.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have further courage and ſtrength then formerly; we have many examples in ſcripture, and dayly experience of this that there is a wonderful differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the ſpirits of Gods people at ſometimes and at other times, As <hi>Elijah</hi> was a man of mighty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that could look <hi>Ahab</hi> on the face, and when <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid, <hi>art thou he that troubleſt Iſrael,</hi> nay (ſaith he) <hi>it is thou and thy Fathers houſe,</hi> at another time he fled from <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and God ſaid to him, <hi>what doſt thou here Elijah,</hi> art thou fleeing from a woman that but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day hadſt ſuch a courage: And ſo <hi>David,</hi> there was a time when David was affraid; and behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with much folly in his fear, as in the change of his behavior before the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> at another time as in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 23. <hi>He would not fear what man could do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, though he walked in the vally of the ſhadow of Death.</hi> And ſo in many <hi>Pſalms</hi> you have his heart mightily dejected in the beginning of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done mightily raiſed: And ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> ſometime he had mighty ſtrength and confidence of his Faith, at other times his faith failed him, and he was fain to equivocate, and ſhift for himſelf, And ſo <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> God ſaid he would make him <hi>as a Brazen wal,</hi> and he would give him a ſpirit of courage, at another time <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was mightily dejected becauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach he met withal, and he would <hi>ſpeak no more in the name of God unto the people.</hi> And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> there was a time when he was affraid of a poor damſel, at other times who ſo bold as <hi>Peter,</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.14. And ſo <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was a diſciple of Chriſt but ſecretly for fear of the Jews, but afterward
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42455:54"/>
he came boldly and begged the body of Chriſt at Pilates hand</hi>; And ſo <hi>Nicodemus</hi> he was convinced that Chriſt was a great prophet of God, and much Good might be got by him, but he was affraid of the Jews, and <hi>came to Chriſt by night,</hi> afterward he went with <hi>Joſeph to begg the body of Chriſt,</hi> and appeared publickly for Chriſt, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was a time, when he was let down in a basket for fear, and he ſhifted for his life that way, but afterwards what abundance of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age had he. And ſo in after times many of the martyrs, ſometime what mighty feare was upon them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards what ſtrength and courage had they. As <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lney,</hi> thar bleſſed Martyr; (as <hi>Latimer</hi> ſpeaks of him) he was in greivous perplexity, that thoſe that came to apply any promiſes to him, did as it were ſtrick daggers to his heart, afterwards he ſuffred a glorious martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and had abundance of Courage, as may be read in his ſtory. And ſo <hi>Saunders</hi> when Doctor <hi>Pendle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> came to him to ſtrengthen him, ſays he, <hi>will you that have put your hand to the plow now give in, and you that have left Antichriſt wil you now follow him?

And ſo Mr. <hi>Glover</hi> when he was in priſon after he was condemned he had much fear, and a ſpirit of heavineſs, yea the morning that he was called out to the ſtake he was troubled with doubtings, till he came to the ſight of the ſtake, and then he had abundance of courage and Joy: Theſe are the examples; but now the reaſons.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 1.</head>
               <p>The firſt, Reaſon of the Differences of the ſpirits of Gods Servants is from the different diſpoſition that their hearts are in for their receiving of the truths of God at
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42455:55"/>
ſome time, from that they are at othertimes; that it is even to admiration ſometimes to conſider, that ſuch a truth that there is but a hint of it Given at one time, ſhal have ſuch power upon their hearts as ſhal mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them, they ſhal eaſily entertaine it, and eaſily be convinced by it, and overpowred with it; at another time when there are ſtrong arguments, to bring the truth a great deal more powerfully, and fully to the heart, it vaniſheh and comes to little: we uſe to ſay; <hi>Whatſoever we receive is received according to the diſpoſition of the receiver</hi>: what is the reaſon why people in the time of ſickneſs are ready to heare of any truth, and ready to be convinced of it, and no wranglings and objections againſt it. If God come in their proſperity, and health with the ſame truthes, they are nothing to them, but wrangle, and object againſt them and wil not yeild and be convinced? The truth is the ſame but the difference is in the diſpoſition of the receiver. And ſo in regard of the temptation to ſin, ſometime when a temptation to ſin is preſented, the heart preſently cloſes with it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining; at other times through Gods mercy when temptation comes, it doth not ſo eaſily take, but a mans heart wil ſtand out againſt it, ſometimes a mans heart is to the temptation, as tinder to the fire, every ſpark wil take hold, at other times the heart is as the three children, though they walke in firy temptations, their hearts have not ſo much as the favour of them: There are three things that do cauſe the difference in the diſpoſition of heart for receiving a truth of God or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a temptation to ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The abating of the ſtrength of that which is oppoſite unto any truth, or unto any temptation, when as a truth comes to a man, there is in every mans heart ſomthing oppoſite to that truth, now if the ſtrength of that which is oppoſite be abated that it doe not ſtir, the truth prevailes whith a great deale of ſtrength; but if that which is oppoſite to a truth be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42455:55"/>
and ſtirring at ſuch a time when they truth comes, then though it comes a great deal more ſtrongly, it cannot prevaile: And ſo if temptation comes, and the principle that is oppoſite to that temptation be ſtirring at that time, a man can prevaile againſt it, but if a man have ſome principle of grace, and that ly dead when the temptation comes, then a great deal leſs temptation prevailes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which makes a difference in the diſpoſitions of the ſpirits of men for receiving a truth, or receiving a temptation, is the ſtirring or activeneſs of thoſe habits that are ſutable to a truth or unto a temptation: when there comes a truth preſented to a man that cals for duties, ſervice or ſuffering, if a man have principles ſutable to the duty, and theſe principles be now ſtirring, then he can cloſe with that truth and it prevailes powerfully. And ſo for ſin if a man have ſeeds and habits of ſin, and temptation come when theſe ſeeds and habits are ſtirring, then he cloſeth with it preſently.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But the eſpecial thing that makes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a man to receive a truth or a temptation different at one time from that it is at another, is when ſelf is engaged in a buſineſs: As now take it in perſon or opinion; Suppoſe there is ſuch a man or woman that I am any way ingaged to and ſerve my turn in; in any thing that is ſpoken for them or their commendation, I am ready to imbrace it; but ſuppoſe this man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man do not ſerve my turn, but the ingagement is broke, then I beleeve the leaſt evil that is ſpoken againſt them, when as I would not have beleeved ten times as much before, not that there is more in them then before, but only the frame and diſpoſition of my heart towards them is otherwiſe then before: And ſo in opinion: If a man hold an opinion upon which there follows ſome conſequents that he did not ſee before, after he hath held this opinon upon which ſuch conſequents
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42455:56"/>
will follow, he ſeekes with all his might to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, not becauſe the conſequents are true, but becauſe it is his opinion that he holds. Come to a man that is ignorant which holds an opinion, and tel him nakedly the conſequents that will follow upon that opinion he holds, without any reference to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and he is mightily againſt them, but come an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time and ſeeke to draw thoſe conſequents from that opinion which he holds, and he ſeek to maintaine them, which he would not do but for that ingagement he hath unto that opinion; but when a gracious heart finds this that al ingagements to men, and the world, and ſelfe are broken, and he gives himſelf to be ingaged wholy in God, al that was ſelf before in his credit, and liberty, and eſtate, and eaſe, and comfort, is put upon the name of God, the praiſe of God, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the truth of God and his Goſpel, then any truth of God that comes to the ſoule at this time, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes mightily, becauſe the heart is ingaged in God and his truth: and indeed if ſo be we did underſtand aright, we ſhould ſee more of our own good to conſiſt in God, then in our ſelves; and this is the ground and principle of ſelf denial, when as the ſoule ſhall come to ſee my good is more in God, then in my ſelfe, and therefore I will deny my good and comfort ſo far as it is in my ſelfe and I will ſeeke my good and comfort in God: and indeed no men in the world ſeek themſelves more then the Godly, only the one ſeeks himſelf in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the other ſeeks himſelf in God, the one is engaged to his ſelf-ends and ſelf-praiſe, and the other makes himſelf only ingaged in God, and when a man comes to be thus engaged in God, then any truth prevails with a mighty ſtrength more then before. And this is the firſt reaſon (which is a principal one) that cauſeth the heart, to be at a different condition at one time, from that it is at another.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 2.</head>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is in regard of the differences of their preſentations of a truth, though when we are indiſpoſed let the truths come never ſo powerfully it is all one, but if the heart be fit in any reaſonable manner to receive a truth, there may be a great deal of difference in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the repreſentation of a truth, ſomtimes the truth comes more cleerly, and with more evidences, more particularly, more powerfully: Somtimes it comes with greater evidence of the ſpirit of God then at other times, there is not only a little gloſs of a truth of God, but the ſhine of it, that a man cannot ſhut his eyes againſt it: ſomtime the truth comes more particularly to the heart, God doth not only preſent a truth in the general to him that this is a duty Chriſtians muſt do: but it ſhal come to the particular frame of the heart, and ſhal meet with every objection, and he ſhall find the ſecrets of his thoughts to be diſcovered and anſwered, ſo that the truth ſhal come like a key that is fitted to a lock; if you bring a key to the lock though it may be like the right key and as ſtrong a key as the right is, yet if it be not indeed the right, if it miſs but in one ward of the lock, never ſo little, you may ſpoil both the lock and the key, but you cannot open the lock though you have never ſo much ſtrength, but come with a key ſuted to that lock and do but turn it, and it opens preſently: So when it pleaſeth God to come with his truth to our ſouls, we were backward and we heard many truths, but they did not meet with all our objections, and therefore it was ſtopped with ſome one or other, but afterward it pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe of things, and to bring the truth ſo fully to the heart, as it meets with every objection, and then the heart quietly yeilds, and therefore it is ſaid <hi>God opened Lydias heart, Paul</hi> preached to others and had much wringing with them and could not prevail,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42455:57"/>
but Saint <hi>Paul came to Lydia,</hi> and he prevailed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, becauſe God did ſo diſpoſe of <hi>Lydias</hi> heart as it was fitted to the truth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny when they come to hear the word, cannot but ſay the truth of God hath met with me in every particular, and I have no ſecret object on in my heart, but it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſomtimes the truth comes more powerfully then at other times: as in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 8.11. <hi>For the Lord ſpake thus to me with a Strong hand, &amp; inſtructed me that</hi> I <hi>ſhould not walk in the way of this people,</hi> God did not only tell the prophet his duty, but he ſpake with a ſtrong hand, ſo when God comes ſometimes he tels you what you ought to do, but he doth not alwaies come with a ſtrong hand as ſometimes he doth: <hi>Job,</hi> 36.10 <hi>He openeth alſo their Eares to diſcipline and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that they returne from iniquity</hi>: does not God command men at al times to returne from their iniquities doth not god command men in proſperity to return from their Iniquities, yes, but in the time of affliction ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the truth comes with more commanding power, then <hi>he ſealeth inſtruction</hi> as in <hi>Job.</hi> 33.16. when people came to hear the word they heard inſtructions to do ſuch and ſuch duties, but thoſe inſtructions did not come with command, they were not ſealed, but in affliction God ſeals them, if a man ſee a writing and ſee the hands of others to it, it is ſomthing to perſwade him to ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of that opinion, but when he ſees the broad Seal to it then it comes with authority, and ſo when men come and hear the word of God, they think it is but our opinion, and caſt it off, but in affliction thoſe truths come with authority, and have the ſeal of Heaven upon them, and then they prevail, you have other manner of thoughts of them then before; that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke it was in power to the hearts of the people; and they could not <hi>reſiſt the ſpirit wherewith Stephen ſpake</hi> becauſe he was ful of faith and power. So ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God ſpeaks with ſo much power as they cannot
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42455:57"/>
ſtand out: we may ſee the different ſpirits of men by the different repreſentation of a truth in our ſelves or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſomtime when God pleaſeth to convince us, and work upon us, we admire it our ſelves, did we not hear theſe things before, what was it that kept me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced, I never was ſtirred before, and now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks there is ſuch mighty power in them as I cannot ſtand againſt them, what was the matter? and ſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: let there be two men, that ſhal go upon the ſame principles, and their ends ſhal be the ſame, and both their hearts ſhal be upright, and yet they cannot yeild to the ſame thing, becauſe the ſame thing is preſented to the one, one way, and he ſees it cleerly, and the ſame thing is preſented to another, another way, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it; And therefore it ſhould teach us to have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience when we have to deal with ſuch as do not ſee a thing clear. As when we come to a lock that we have not the right key, and we try, and it wil not open, we do not preſently throw it away, but we think, it may be there is ſome duſt in it, we pick that out, and try again if it do not open, then we think may be we did not put in the key right, too far, or not far enough, and if it do not open then we think may be we did not turn the right way, we try again if it do not open then we think we did not turn ſtrong enough: we try again, if it do not open then; we think may be we have not the right key, if I chooſe another key that would open it: Then we try again, if it do not open it, we are loath to looſe the lock, we think may be there is ſome ward in the lock that is a little bent, if that were mended it would do, or the key is bent, and rather then we wil throw it away we wil mend that, may be I have bent ſome ward, and a man wil reaſon al he can before he wil throw away the lock: So when you have to deal with others that are of another opinion, do not throw them away; reaſon this way, &amp; that way, becauſe there is much in ordering mens ſpirits, in the communication of a truth unto them, it is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42455:58"/>
not alwaies the evidence of a truth that is ſufficient to convince, but the manner of preſenting of the truth, and that is the ſecond reaſon of the difference of mens ſpirits.</p>

               <p>The third reaſon is becauſe that ſomtime the graces of men do not burne out ſo clearly and purely as they do at other times, As in fire when you kindle a fire, firſt there is a great deal of ſmoke and we ſee little brightneſs in the fire, ſtay but a while, and the ſmoak wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and the fire burne bright: So in the graces of men and women, ſometime there is a great deal of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when grace is kindled at firſt, a great deal of ſmother but grace continues and workes out that corruption, and it burns more clearly: So in the ſun when it riſeth in the morning it may be a great miſt, but when the ſun is up a little while it conſumes the miſt, and ſhines clearly; So Children when they are young may be they have many il humors; afterwards their natural ſtrength conſumes their humors, and ſo they are more active and ſtirring; ſo though the Godly have not that diſpoſition of heart to do that for God they ſhould, yet when grace comes to burne more clearly they can do it.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, As grace is mixt at firſt, ſo ſomtimes it is weak, the parts and members not being conſolidated, and ſtrengthened: when an infant comes firſt into the world if you expoſe it to the cold it is not able to endure it, which afterward it wil do, when the Joynts are ſet, and ſo young plants cannot endure that froſt, which they wil do afterwards: And ſo Chriſtians at firſt are as <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, carryed away with every wind of doctrine,</hi> til afterward they come to be more ſtrong, and then they are fit for ſervice. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not have his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

The meaning is do not bring unſureable duties to mens ſpirits; faſting and prayer is a duty but they are not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for it yet, noting when people grow ſtrong they ſhal be fitter for duty, ſervice, or ſuffering.</p>

               <p>The fifth Reaſon is becauſe ſomtimes our hearts are filled with more heavenly conſolation then at other times that does refreſh the ſouls of Gods people as with new wine, that they can go forth as a Giant, cal them to any duty, and they can go through fire and water. As for ſin when a mans heart is warmed with ſin and they have had delight and ſatisfaction in their ſin, come and ſpeak what you wil againſt it and they can eaſily caſt it off, and ſo for duty when Gods people have been warmed by duty, and their ſpirits are refreſhed in Gods way, with what reſolution do they go: and as that martyr Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> ſayd, <hi>that which made the difference</hi> in him was <hi>becauſe God was pleaſed to come in with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments to his ſpirit that he felt the conſolation of God, not only upon his ſoul, but flow into his body</hi>; and that put a great deal of courage in him: And in the ſtories that I have read of <hi>Scotland</hi> Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> reports of a young man, of eighteen years of age, that ſuffered martirdome under the Biſhop of <hi>Glasgow</hi>: and when he came to ſuffer he was mightily affraid, and thought to have recanted, and it pleaſed God that his ſpirit came in mightily to him at that time, and he fell down on his knees and bleſt God. <hi>Bleſſed Lord (ſaid he) great is thy mercy to man kind, and to me poor wretch, that was like to forſake Chriſt my ſaviour, and put my ſelf into
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42455:59"/>
eternal damnation, and now thou haſt come with the conſolation of Heaven, and haſt filled my heart and now I am freed from thoſe fears that ſuppreſſed my ſoul, let men do what they can I am ready.</hi> And to God ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comes to fill the hearts of his people with mighty conſolations and that makes a mighty difference.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42455:60"/>
he ſees we are in a diſpoſition for it: it is a wonderful mercy of God, not to call out his people, but at ſuch a time when they are fit. And ſo for temptation to ſin: God ſees what diſpoſitions there are in the beſt of us all, he knows how corruption is working many times, and if a temptation to ſin ſhould come at that time, what ſhould become of us, we could not but forſake God, and his cauſe, and wound our conſciences, acknowledg the mercy of God towards you, in keeping the temptation from you at ſuch a time, ſometime we are wandering from God, if the roaring Lyon ſhould meet us then how like were it that we ſhould be devoured; ſomtimes we are ready to ſtumble upon every ſtraw, and if God ſhould lay ſtumbling blocks before us then, what ſhould become of us, this is a mercy that God doth not grant unto others, for thus God very frequently deals with wicked men, when there is an opportunity for them to enjoy the greateſt good, at that very time there ſhal be ſomthing fall out that ſhal put them in an oppoſition to that Good: as perhaps ſomtimes God in his providence orders it; that a miniſter ſhould be partly upon ſuch a ſubject as ſhould be marveilous uſeful, and God is more then ordinary aſſiſting of him, then ſomthing ſhal fall out to keep them from the exerciſe, or the corruption ſhal be up to harden their hearts, or there ſhal be ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to take up their minds, more than at another time, that they ſhal not get that good they might: but this is the mercy of God, to thoſe he intends good to, that he will give them an opportunity to receive Good, when they are fit for it: there was ſuch a time if ſuch a point had been handled, their hearts would have been unfit, but at ſuch a time ſuch a point ſhal be handled and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on, and ſays God <hi>I</hi> will order it ſo, they ſhal break through difficulties to come to the exerciſe; and though corruption wil be ſtirring, I will order it ſo that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhal not be ſtirring at that time: And ſo ſometimes for temptation to ſin, God ſees many times how a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption

            <head>USE, 2.</head>
            <p>THe ſecond uſe of this point is this: If there be ſuch a difference between the hearts of Gods people at ſome time, from that they are at others, hence is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the ſervants of God, to teach them, though they do not feel their hearts always in the ſame temper, and to have the ſame ſpirit to do good, not to be diſcouraged: it is true we ſhould be humbled for want of having our hearts up at any time, but be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, becauſe it is no other but what befals the moſt dear ſervants of God, and though you do not find your hearts up always as at ſome time, do not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is now no good at al in me, for Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42455:62"/>
are ready and prepared for every good work, and my heart is thus dul, and heavy and dead, and it wil never be otherwiſe with me, I am afraid whenſoever I ſhal be called to the ſervice of God, my heart wil be thus, and I ſhal forſake God, and betray the cauſe of God; Do not reaſon thus to diſcourage your ſelves: take heed of thoſe determining thoughts: to determine that your hearts wil be always ſo becauſe they are ſo for the preſent, there is a great deale of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpirits of Gods people at ſome times, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, and therefore there may be ſo in you. For your help againſt theſe diſcouraging thoughts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider that you have union with a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is ful of al Grace, though you do not feel the influence of it, at all times alike, you have union with a principle ſo ful that you have no cauſe to determine againſt your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Know you have promiſes that are ful of Grace, for the encouraging of Gods ſervants: Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that there may be drawn abundance of good from; and therefore you cannot determine that it ſhall not be otherwiſe with you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, know <hi>the glory of God is as deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him as your own ſouls are to you</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſo be the cauſe, the honor of God depend upon it; know God wil take care for his own honor, you are afraid you ſhould betray the cauſe of God becauſe you find your hearts ſo down now, and perhaps if they were ſo down then when God calls you to ſtand for his cauſe it might be ſo: but what is it that troubles you? you are afraid to bring guilt and miſery upon your ſelves and diſhonor God; but know the glory of God is precious to him, and being it is engaged in you that you ſhould diſhonor him; being one of his, he wil take care of you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider how God hath come in graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſupply his people in the time of need, he hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42455:62"/>
their ſpirits in the time of ſtraights when he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to any hard work, and they have done that which they thought they ſhould never have done, as it is with wicked men: you ſee ſome ſo vile and wicked, as you could never have thought they ſhould have been, ſo the Godly though ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>imes their hearts are down, yet at other times they have ſuch aſſiſtance, and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fulneſs of the ſpirit, as one would never have thought they ſhould have had.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God hath made a mighty difference in your eſtates from that they were before, and therefore why ſhould you not hope that God will make a difference between that we are now, and that we may be hereafter, If God have wrought the leaſt degree of ſaving grace in you, he hath made more difference between you, and one that is in his natural condition, than there is between you and the gloryfied Saints: (as I have noted before) and if God have made ſuch a great difference, why ſhould you diſturbe your ſelves to think it wil never be other then it is now?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, nay I appeal to you, have you never found your hearts up for God? was there never a time that there was quickning and enlarging of your hearts for God, that you have felt ſome comfortable fitneſs for ſervice, or ſuffering?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>I cannot but ſay it hath been ſo with me, but it is gone, and down again; there are none but have ſome flaſhings, and ſtirrings, and ſome good moods, and mine may be no more for all I know; grace is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant thing, and the heart is eſtabliſhed with it, and therefore though I feel my heart a little up ſometimes, yet they are but ſuch flaſhings as any may have, that have no grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, There are ſome works of Grace that are ſteady, and conſtant, that do more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42455:63"/>
flow from the principles, and being of Grace: and there are other works of Grace that are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, that are not ſo ſteady and conſtant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſome that are ſteady and conſtant; as theſe two things: take Gods people, and conſider of them in any condition, if they know but their own hearts, they will find theſe two things: Firſt, An ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the life and power, and the ſtrictneſs of the waies of Godlineſs. Secondly, they wil find a ſavor of that which is ſpiritual, either in Ordinances, or in Gods People, their hearts will ſavor them, though their hearts be very much down, yet theſe two things they find conſtant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But for the abilities to perform duties, for abilities in ſervice or ſuffering; they do not lie ſo next the root of Grace; they are but as the Leaves, or the bloſſoms, or the fruit: now though the ſap be conſtant at the root, yet the bloſſoms, leaves, and fruit are not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you wil ſay, <hi>Being there may be good moods in men, take the worſt of all, though their hearts be naught ſometime, yet their hearts are up at other times, and may not you inſtead of encouraging Gods Servants, encourage the wicked? they may think, we hear there is a difference between Gods People, they are not alwaies alike: ſo it is with me, ſomtimes I am diſtempered, but at other times (thanks be to God) it is better with me, and ſo inſtead of taking away diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements from thoſe that are weak, there may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the wicked, and therefore where lies the difference between the good moods that ſome have, that have no true Grace, and the difference of ſpirit in thoſe that have true Grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that I Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There may be a difference diſcerned by that which hath been ſaid; there is ſomthing is conſtant:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42455:63"/>
Whether is that which lay at the root of grace in you ſtill there? If you do not find thoſe two things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant (viz. An approving of the life and power and ſtrictneſs of godlineſs; and a ſavor of that which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, either in Ordinances, or in Gods People) all your good moods in the world, though your hearts be never ſo up, wil not diſcover the truth of grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe that have only ſome good moods at ſome time, and no bottom of any true grace, they in their good moods are not humbled for that which was failing in them before; their hearts indeed are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times up, and they bleſs themſelves in that; but now this doth not make them look back how it was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with them, and to be aſhamed and humbled for the wretchedneſs, and diſtempers of their hearts formerly: but where the heart is up for God in thoſe that have truth of grace, when their hearts are moſt up, then they make uſe of this to be abaſed, and humbled in their own thoughts for the deadneſs and diſtemper that was in their hearts before; the good moods of others rather puff them up, than further any work of humiliation for any evil that was in them before, they think theſe good moods now, and being in a good temper, ſhall ſatisfie God for their evil diſtempers that were in them before: But it is not ſo with a gracious heart, a gracious heart when it does get up, it makes uſe of this work of God upon it, to be aſhamed and confounded in its ſelf for thoſe evil diſtempers that were in it before. The more the heart is up, the more diſcovery it hath of its own baſeneſs, and vileneſs, and wretchedneſs, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when their hearts are up, have not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods People when their hearts are up, that doth bring gracious diſcoveries of God unto them, and of thoſe things that do wonderfully ſpirituallize their hearts: others though they have their hearts up, they only have ſome affections, but in thoſe good moods of theirs, they have not thoſe Heavenly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42455:64"/>
of God, ſo as to purge their hearts, and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize their hearts, and make their hearts to be more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly as it doth the godly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Thoſe that have only good moods, and no truth of grace, when they have their good moods, they are not by them carried out of themſelves to a principle beyond themſelves, but they reſt in the workings that they feel in their hearts: whereas a gracious heart when God raiſeth his heart, and puts it into a better frame, this carries it out of it ſelf, to a principle beyond it ſelf, and it dare not reſt in thoſe ſtirrings and workings it finds for the preſent, to think, now I am ſafe and well, becauſe of them, but by theſe it is carried beyond it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Where there are only good moods, and not the truth of the work of grace, they do not work ſo ſeaſonably, and orderly, as the breathings of Gods ſpirit in his ſervants do: but the breathings of a gracious heart coming from the ſpirit of God, it works ſeaſonably, and orderly in their hearts, when there is a ſpiritual uſe of them, <hi>in that hour ſhall it be given to you,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, the ſpirit ſhal come upon you when you have moſt uſe; whereas in others, their good moods work only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward occaſions, and as means come in; but now at thoſe times when they have moſt uſe of them, they are furtheſt from them.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Where the heart is right, and truly godly, and God comes and breaths in it more than formerly, ſuch a one wil watch over it ſelf, and wil not be ſecure after this; but the other grow leſs watchful, and more ſecure upon ſuch moods.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Thoſe that are truly gracious, though they do not find their hearts up alwaies alike, yet when they find their hearts down, they count it their ſickneſs, and their diſeaſe, and it is the diſquiet and trouble of their ſpirits; whereas others that have only ſome moods, they are not ſenſible of their hearts being down
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42455:64"/>
as their ſickneſs and diſeaſe, and the burden and trouble of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, In thoſe that have grace when their hearts are up at any time, it is but a preparation for ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice; others having but moods, their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, this is the period of all their godlineſs, in which they reſt; but the godly, when their hearts are up, at ſome time more than at others, it is but a preparation for further Service, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>The hearts of the people were up,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> bleſt God for it, and ſaies he, <hi>prepare their hearts unto thee</hi>: unſound hearts would ſay, now our hearts are up, and we have offered thus freely; are we but in a preparation? Yet <hi>David</hi> praies to God to prepare their hearts, as if all their heart and affection at that time was but a preparation to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty: and this is the difference between the good moods of the greateſt Hypocrite, that come to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch, and the difference between the breathings of Gods Spirit; and by theſe means only preſented to you it may be ſome help to diſcern the difference between good moods at ſome time, and the different breathing of Gods Spirit in his people.</p>

            <p>THirdly, If there be ſuch difference between the hearts of Gods People at ſome times, and at other
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42455:65"/>
times; This is an Uſe of Direction to all the people of God that are acquainted with this difference of Gods breathing upon their hearts, in theſe Four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, When you find your hearts up more at ſome times, than at other times, give God the glory.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Learn to rebuke your Unbelief.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, Labor to keep your hearts up.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, Improve this great working of God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, If ſo be you find your hearts more up at one time than at another (as Gods People do find much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and can ſay ſomtime, <hi>let my Beloved come into his Garden</hi>) give God the glory and praiſe of it, for it is a great mercy. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It doth prevent, and deliver you from abundance of danger you were in: when your hearts were down, if a temptation had come, what abundance of danger had you been in? now God hath prevented that danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If your hearts were right when they were down, then you powred out your complaints to God of the deadneſs of your hearts; now if God be come in, it is a fruit of your ſeeking God, and of your humiliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord: now that which comes in as a fruit of humiliation, and much ſeeking of God, ſurely that ſhould be the matter of our praiſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is a gracious viſitation of God, God comes in with this, and here is the preſence of God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is much cauſe of praiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is an argument that God hath ſome eſpecial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for you to do: now thoſe that are godly, count this a great mercy, for God to have any employment for them: now that they have received an evidence to their ſouls that God intend to imploy them, this is a great mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Learn to check your Unbelief; when your hearts were down, you were ready to ſay, it would never
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42455:65"/>
be otherwiſe: now check your hearts, and bring your hearts to this concluſion; I will never think it in vain to ſeek God, though <hi>I</hi> do not find him come in preſently; and I will learn, though I may judg my ſelf worthy that God ſhould leave me, yet I will never determine that God will not come in, becauſe I ſee <hi>Gods waies are not as my waies, and Gods thoughts are not as my thoughts.</hi> Oh take heed of judging the waies and thoughts of God, according to your waies and thoughts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is God come in? and do you find that you have a ſpirit of courage and boldneſs more than before, now you find God ſweetly breathing upon you to put life into that dead, and to raiſe that heavy heart of yours? do you find God ſweetly and comfortably enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening your ſouls, and putting the ſpirit of confidence in that unbeleeving heart of yours? Labor to keep your hearts thus. There is a great deal of difficulty when a thing is fallen down to get it up; but when a thing is up, if one be careful, it is not difficult to keep it up. It is a notable expreſſion that <hi>David</hi> had, when he found the hearts of the people got up in their willing Offering, 1 Chron. 29.18. <hi>O Lord God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>our Fathers, keep this for ever in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the thoughts of the hearts of thy people, and prepare their hearts unto thee.</hi> So let it be thy prayer, and it is my prayer for thee: Is thy heart up more than before? Pray, <hi>O God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Iſrael, <hi>keep this in the thoughts of the heart of this man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for ever</hi>: be careful now to keep your hearts up: ſo when you are well, or otherwiſe if you ſhould loſe this through this negligence.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It wil make you cal into queſtion the truth of theſe gracious breathings, yea, you wil think it was but a meer flaſh, ſuch as Hypocrites may have, yea, not cal this into queſtion only; but to cal the truth of al into queſtion: this is that which makes men take the foundation of al, becauſe their hearts ſomtimes are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42455:66"/>
and they through their negligence let them fall, and loſe that ſpiritual life and courage once they had, and ſo bring abundance of ſadneſs upon their hearts: now as you would have an evidence of the truth of Gods work upon you, and the truth of grace, labor to keep up your hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Labor to keep up your hearts otherwiſe if they fal off again, the waies of God wil come to be very tedious to you: As a man that walks unevenly in regard of the unevenneſs of his leggs, or the unevenneſs of the way, he is quickly tired: and ſo if a Chriſtians way be up and down, and there be not an evenneſs in his way, he is quickly diſcouraged; and a main means to help one to go on with freedom and courage in Gods waies, is to go on in an even courſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If ſo be you loſe this, you loſe the beauty of your profeſſion; the beauty of the waies of Godlineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts much in the conſtancy, and if your way be up and down, there is no beauty in your converſation, it takes away the convincing power of your way and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if others ſaw your hearts up, and ſaw a conſtant evenneſs in your way, this would mightily convince them, that it is a work of Gods Spirit upon your hearts; but ſomtimes your hearts are up, and down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſomtime you are patient and meek, at other times you are paſſionate and fretting; this doth not convince them that it is the work of Gods Spirit, but only the ſtirring of a natural ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By this means you wil cauſe God to walk diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently with you; if you keep not up your hearts when God hath raiſed them, though God be in a way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, you wil cauſe him to walk in a way of diſpleaſure againſt you.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Again, When your hearts are up, that is the thing that the Devil doth moſt watch to give you a trip in. As when <hi>Daniel</hi> walked ſo ſtrictly in al the matters of the Kingdom, as they could find no fault in him, they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42455:66"/>
accuſed him <hi>in the matter of his God,</hi> of his Religion: ſo ſaies the Devil, if I ſhould tempt him to ſuch and ſuch ſins, I cannot prevail, but there is ſuch a way I may prevail; and the Devil doth labor there moſt to trip you. As he did with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in another caſe; when you are on the top of the pinacle, then he labors to throw you down: It is true, it is the work of God that hath brought you up to the pinacle, but there the Devil doth labor to throw you down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> You wil ſay, <hi>How ſhall we come to keep up our hearts, whenas our hearts are in a better frame, than at ſome other times?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, When your hearts are up, labor to make uſe of that grace that raiſed your hearts; improve it ſo as to make your hearts more holy, and more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. A Tree if it ſprout upward only, and do not run down in the root proportionably, it wil wither, and die: and ſo if grace do work only upward in abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and performances of duties, and joy, and ſuch things, and do not proportionably work downward in the root, it is like it will come to little, and you will ſoon loſe all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Work that grace you find in your inward, as wel as outward man: Do not think it enough that you have ſtirrings of Grace to enable you to do duties, but improve this grace for the working out of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: conſider the corruptions of your heart, and now take the advantage to work them out.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, be ſure you take nothing that is Gods due at this time; that is, if God have raiſed your hearts, though the peace and joy of it be yours, the Glory of it is Gods, do not be fingering of that, take heed of lifting up of your hearts in a way of pride, it is enough your heart is lifted up in a way of grace, and you muſt be content with that, but many when God gives them a lift in a way of Grace, they cannot be content with their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42455:67"/>
part, the peace, and the joy, but they lift up themſelves in a way of pride, and would have ſome of Gods part of the Glory, and that ſpoils all.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When you are in the beſt condition, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the greateſt ſuffering, to lie down at Gods feet, and this will keep the heart in a ſweet frame, many when they have got their hearts up for ſervice, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of ſuffering, now they are in a ſafe condition, and free from trouble, and they bleſs themſelves, and when trouble falls upon them unexpectedly their hearts ſinke, and they think God is come againſt them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and if that rayſing of ſpirit had been true, God would have kept me from ſuffering ſuch and ſuch hard things: thou art deceived in that, a gracious heart that is wiſe, when he is moſt enabled to do ſervice, he wil prepare for ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Take heed of depending upon the old ſtock, do not reſt on grace received, but keep thy heart ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a need of a ſupply of grace, many when they have been ſeeking of God, and have in ſome meaſure got that they prayed for, they think they have ſtock enough, and they can trade prety well in the world, but though we had a hundred times as much grace as we have, and had not ſupply from Chriſt, we ſhould fail.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Watch againſt the leaſt declineing, and account it a very great evil to decline, and therefore be often calling of your ſelves to an account, at ſuch and ſuch a time it was ſo with me, how is it now? is it now as it was then? when people decline, it is hard, it is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them to think of returning, and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and decline, and looſe all; wherefore obſerve the beginning of your declinings and cal your ſelves to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count dayly, that when you abate in the leaſt degree, you may reforme it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Do not content your ſelves with what you have, but yet get higher and higher, the heart muſt be in motion upward, or downward, therefore the way
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42455:67"/>
to get eſtabliſhment is to be in a continual motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17.18. Saies the Apoſtle, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leaſt you alſo being led away by the eror of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs</hi>: God hath brought you into a good temper, take heed you do not fal from your ſteadfaſtneſs, how ſhall we do? <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and ſavior Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Labor to get higher.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Improve that you have well, and that wil be the way to contrive that you have, God juſtly takes it from you if you do not improve it. It were a bleſſed thing if our hearts might be kept up conſtantly, our lives would be comfortable to our ſelves, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully comfortable to others: we ſhould cauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to rejoyce in us, otherwiſe it takes away the comfort that Gods people might have in us, though we be up at ſometimes there is a great deal of croſneſs at other times. There is a notable expreſſion for this of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 1 Phil. 3.4. I <hi>thank my God upon every remembrance of you.</hi> Sometime a Miniſter of God may thank God upon the remembrance of ſuch and ſuch workings upon the hearts of his people, but never to think of them but to thank God, this is a great matter. <hi>Alwaies in every prayer of mine for you all, making requeſt with joy</hi>: Sometime a Miniſter can make his requeſt with joy for his people, but at other times it is with ſorrow; but people ſhould labor ſo to walk, as that a Miniſter may make requeſt with joy for them. And ſo we paſs to the laſt thing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If God have raiſed your hearts, improve it, we have but a little time, and we have not many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and therefore we had not need loſe any time then, it is not often we have abilities to do for God, and therefore when we have them we ſhould improve them. As a Scholler that hath a weak Body, and is not alwaies fitted for ſtudy, if he find himſelf fitted at any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42455:68"/>
time, he is loth to loſe one hour of his ſtudy then: So with a Merchant or Marriner that lay long for a wind, when it does come, he is greedy of that opportunity: ſo we are fain to lie long for a wind, we ſee our duty, and are convinced of it, but we want the breathings, and aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, and wait for a wind, if God do come in ſeaſonably, we had need improve it; if we had improved al thoſe times that were ſit, what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance might we have got by this time? When we are fit for outward imployment, we may do more in one hour, than we could have done in ten hours before; at other times they do but bungle, and trouble themſelves, and little good comes of it; but when they are fit for work, and the work goes off well, what encouragement is it? And ſo if we had taken all advantages that we found in our hearts, ſince we came to the knowledg of Gods waies, what abundance might we have done? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in compariſon of that which God is worthy of, though we had ſpent al our lives in his ſervice, it would have been but little; but in compariſon of that we have done, it might have been abundance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you wil ſay, <hi>How ſhall we improve this time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, When God is come into you, look back to former neglects in your running with God in the time of unfitneſs: Many times you have ſaid, I am unfit for duty, and therefore you have left it undone, which you ought not to have done. Now if God have put your hearts into a fitneſs, labor to make up your former neglects in your running with God: If a man decay in his Eſtate, and break through negligence, and he be ſet up again, it is expected he ſhould make up former neglects: and ſo doth God expect of us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Set upon thoſe duties that you never could do before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:42455:68"/>Thirdly, Gather up al the experiences of God towards you at this time; if you have had more manifeſtations of Gods preſence with you than before, treaſure them up.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When God doth grant unto you peace, and joy, make uſe of all the peace and comfort you have for the furtherance of the work of your grace, and that is a mighty improvement of that which God doth give you: do not only improve your grace, but that which comes in. Many that have comfort and peace, reſt in that as the fruit of al the good they do as their reward, but they do not look at that as a means of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Improve this work of God upon your hearts, by watching al opportunities; let time now be precious unto you, let there none be loſt.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Labor for that Chriſtian skil to make up the graces of God every way, according as God calls for the uſe of them. There are divers uſes of Gods graces; ſomtime for life and comfort, at other times for defence; ſomtimes to draw in, at other times to let out, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.4. <hi>They ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning books</hi>: they ſhould have peace and their inſtruments ſhould be of another faſhion. But in <hi>Joel</hi> 3.10. it is otherwiſe, <hi>They ſhal beat their plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares into ſwords, and their pruning hooks into ſpears</hi>: So apply it to grace; ſomtime grace is to bring life, and nouriſhment to the ſoul; at other times it is to bring in grace. As <hi>Faith,</hi> ſomtime it is to cloſe with Chriſt, and bring nouriſhment from him; at other times <hi>Faith</hi> is to be a Shield: Many Chriſtians look upon the work of grace to bring life and ſtrength to themſelves, but have not skil to make uſe of grace as a ſhield. So <hi>Hope,</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is to prop the ſoul, at other times it is to be a <hi>Helmet.</hi> So we ſhould labor to underſtand the uſe of graces, according to the ſeveral imployments that God calls for; ſomtime one way, ſomtime another. And this is the Third Uſe.</p>
         </div>

            <head type="sub">USE, 4.</head>
            <p>A Fourth Uſe is this: If it be ſo that Gods people are in ſuch a different frame of ſpirit; ſomtime they are afraid, and their hearts are down; at other times they have a ſpirit of courage, and fitneſs for any ſervice that God wil have them to do: This ſhould teach us when our hearts are down, and not in that fitneſs we deſire, to be reſtleſs till we get our ſelves in a good frame: Somtime the Godly have their hearts in a good frame, and therefore it is poſſible to be had, and we ſhould never be in reſt til we had got it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall we get up our hearts when they are not in a frame fit for ſervice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Be ſenſible of the evil of an unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable heart, ſo as to be humbled before God for the want of it, and be more ſenſible of the evil of that, than ſenſible of the evil of want of peace and comfort: Many when they find their hearts down, and not in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree fit for ſervice that they deſire, they are troubled for it, but the reaſon is becauſe their hearts being down, there ariſe doubts of their condition, and their peace is hindred, and they cannot have comfort in it, but they are not ſo much troubled becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable, and want hearts fitted for duty, and that is the reaſon why their hearts are kept down: Now this ſhould be our care, to be more ſenſible of the unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of our hearts, than of the unpeaceableneſs of our hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:42455:69"/>Secondly, Obſerve which way the ſtrength of your ſpirit is let out, and labor to recal your hearts from that; as thus: If the ſtrength of a mans ſpirit be not for God, it is let out to ſomwhat elſe, it is alwaies working ſome way or other; if it be not let out to ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object, it is ſcattered and divided into divers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Now if your ſtrength be not let out for God, call your hearts to an account, where is the ſtrength of my heart? which way runs it? If it can be diſcerned which way the ſtrength of your heart is let out, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to any creature, or any luſt, that ſhould be your care to get it off.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When you come to preſent your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in his Ordinances, come with hearts panting after ſtrength: as when you come to the Word, Prayer, or Sacraments, bethink your ſelves beforehand, I come before the Lord that I may get this dull heart of mine quickned in ſuch and ſuch a particular, I find my heart unſerviceable in ſuch a particular. Now my heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf before God, and pants after God to be fitted for ſervice in ſuch a particular; it is much may be done when we come to the preſence of God panting for help from God in ſuch particulars.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Obſerve the beginnings of Gods coming into your hearts, and acknowledg them, and improve them, and follow them, many times God is coming into the heart, and becauſe God comes not in fully as much as they would at firſt, they take no notice of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the work of God to imbrace them, and improve them: There are a great many ſparks have fallen upon your hearts, if they had been gathered together, they might have been a flame by this time, but becauſe God did not come in with a flame all together, they did not regard that; you ſaid, what can a ſpark do upon my heart? if you had improved that little you might have had more by this time.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Labor to recall all thoſe ſoul quickning
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42455:70"/>
Truths that ever you have felt working upon your hearts: there was a time my heart was more lively, I can remember ſince God did come in with his truth, and work mightily upon my heart, labor to recal thoſe truths, and ſet them freſh before your hearts, with as much power as poſſibly you can, and keep your hearts in view of them continually, and by meditation chafe them into your hearts; though the fleſh be benummed, yet if it be rubbed, and exerciſed, there will come ſtrength, and ſo thoſe ſoul quickning Truths that you have found before have quickned your hearts, if you preſent them afreſh before the heart, and chafe them by meditation, they wil get ſome ſtrength and life into the heart.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Look into the preſent condition you are in, and exerciſe the duties ſutable to your preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>BUt now in the next place: If Gods people find ſuch a difference between themſelves, that at ſomtimes it is far otherwiſe with them than at other times: Hence then, what a miſerable thing is it to be alwaies down, and alwaies unfit for ſervice? This is a thing that does not uſually befal the people of God; though ſomtimes their hearts are down in compariſon of other times; yet to be alwaies down, and unſerviceable, this do not uſe to be the condition of the Servants of God:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42455:70"/>
this is a ſad miſerable condition to be ſo, as if you never felt the power of God upon your hearts, never felt the Spirit of God breathing upon you, never felt the grace of God ſtirring upon you; you come and hear the Word, and thoſe Truths that are ſoul-quickning war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Truths, that ſtir others, and their hearts lie lumpiſh as a Log that lies in a flaſh of water ſeven yeers together, and is never ſtirred by them. Like unto a veſſel in a Houſe, that is caſt aſide, and lies moulding and rotting, that is never imployed, nor fitted for any ſervice, are theſe Veſſels of Honor? In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Veſſels that are in a great houſe,</hi> that are <hi>Veſſels of honor</hi>; and he deſcribes them that they <hi>are purged and fitted for the maſters uſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for every good work</hi>: Now if a veſſel lie alwaies moulding, and rotting, and never uſed, this is <hi>for the fire, and not for uſe</hi>: So thoſe hearts that are alwaies moulding, and rotting, and never fit for ſervice, they may fear they are veſſels of diſhonor, and for the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome ſay, <hi>I am afraid I am a veſſel for the fire, for I cannot tell that ever I found my heart ſit for any ſervice that God called me to.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, That heart that is ſenſible of unfitneſs, and is humbled before God for it; it hath not ſuch an unfitneſs as to prepare it for the fire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be it is thy unthankfulneſs that makes thee ſay thou art never fit for ſervice, becauſe you are not fit for that degree you deſire, you do not take notice of the work of Gods grace for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, May be now you are framing and fitting for ſervice, if you be but making fit it is a ſigne you are not for the fire, if there be a veſſel for the fire, there is no mending of it, but if the maſter of the houſe ſhall call for a veſſel and require it to be cleanſed, and waſhed, and there is ſome work about it, it is a ſigne it is not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42455:71"/>
for the fire, ſo may be God is fitting and prepareing you for ſervice.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, May be it is that you miſtake your work, you do not know what the work is that God calls you to, you are alwaies unfit for ſuch, and ſuch ſervice, but that is not the work that God calls you to for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, God calls you to a work of humiliation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon himſelf, and ſeeking of his face, and a work of patience, do not ſay you are unfit for the Maſters uſe, becauſe you are unfit for ſuch and ſuch a work; may be the time is not yet, for the eſpicial work that God intend to uſe you in.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Shewing the power of Faith to carry through the moſt difficult work. <hi>Queſtion,</hi> What is there in Faith which helps the Soul? <hi>Anſwered,</hi> in four Particulars. <hi>1.</hi> It ſetles the Heart on the ſureſt ground, which is <hi>Gods call,</hi> and <hi>Promiſes. 2.</hi> It fetcheth in the greateſt ſtrength. <hi>3.</hi> It aſſiſts with the higheſt encouragements. <hi>5.</hi> Faith of its own Nature is a mighty ſtrong principle. The moſt illuſtrious work of Faith. Thirteen remarkable things concerning Faith, and the difficulties which it breaks through.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOw there is one point more out of theſe words, we have ſeen the Faith of <hi>Moſes</hi> in taking away of the impediment of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his work, the great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the fear of the wrath of the King, but by Faith that was taken a way.</p>
            <p>Now he goes upon the work: and went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with a high hand; from whence the Point is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That Faith will carry the Hearts of Gods People through difficult works and Services.</p>
            <p>Though the work be difficult, and they have many hinderances to let them, Faith will carry them through it.</p>
            <p>I remember in the beginning of this argument, I hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Point of Faith in carrying through ſufferings,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42455:72"/>
now the argument is, that faith will carry through diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult ſervice, as this work of forſaking <hi>Egyyt</hi> was a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult work for <hi>Moſes</hi> to undertake difficult; in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>In forſaking his own country. Egypt</hi> was <hi>Moſes</hi> own country, and he himſelf might have ſhifted well enough, and have enjoyed abundance of proſperity, the Egyptians would have made enough of him; for him to forſake <hi>Egypt</hi> his own country was ſomething.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For him to carry ſo many thouſand poor people with him, unarmed into a Wilderneſs without proviſion, and knew not what ſhould become of them, Fleſh and Blood would reaſon, what ſhal I carry this people into the Wilderneſs; what proviſion ſhal they have? they have but a little dough at their backs, and if that be ſpent what ſhal become of them?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then <hi>Moſes</hi> might think, <hi>Pharoah</hi> is ſuch a man that there is no hold of him, how if he follow us with his army and cut us off? again, if we go to the Wilderneſs al the Nations round about us may come and cut us off. Not withſtanding al theſe difficulties <hi>Moſes</hi> went on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith will carry a Chriſtian through works that have much difficulty in them,</hi> faith hath done mighty things in the world, and ſtil it mightily prevails where it comes, no difficulty is able to ſtand before it, faith breaks through all, it caſts down all oppoſition, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all reſiſtances, whatſoever it doth undertake, it does conquer, and al ſtrength is but as weakneſs before it, we need no further teſtimony of the great things that faith hath done in carrying through difficult ſervices then this 11. <hi>Chapter of the Hebrews,</hi> and therefore we will look no further to other ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Quſtion, <hi>But you will ſay, what is there in faith that helps the ſoul, and carries a Chriſtian through the moſt difficult works and ſervices?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:42455:72"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Faith doth it by ſetling the heart upon the ſureſt ground; if a man be ſet faſt upon a ground that is ſure, and unmovable, it may do great things: as one thought, if he could but have a ſure ground, he might make ſuch an Engine as to ſhake the Earth. Now faith ſets the heart upon a ſure ground, <hi>Gods Call</hi>; Faith doth not only ſhew a Chriſtian his duty, and tell him what God doth call him to (that may be done by bare knowledg) but Faith ſettles the heart upon <hi>Gods Promiſes,</hi> it doth bring unto the heart the Authority, Majeſty, and Soveraignty of God in this his Call, and that hath a great deal of ſtrength upon the heart to make it go through difficulty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith doth fetch in the greateſt ſtrength, and doth bring it into the ſoul, it doth not only make the ſtrength of God to be his, but the glorious ſtrength of God, the chief of Gods ſtrength (to ſpeak after the manner of men) if there be any thing more glorious in the ſtrength of God than other, Faith doth fetch in that for the ſtrengthening of the ſoul in the ſervice of God. For that we have two or three notable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. which doth not only ſpeak of the power of God in working of Faith, but of the power of God in the ſould after Faith is wrought.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, <hi>It is the Power of God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>It is the mighty Power of God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>The working of his mighty Power.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Fourthly, <hi>The greatneſs of the working of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Fifthly, <hi>The exceeding greatneſs of the working of his mighty Power.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Sixthly, <hi>The ſame Power that raiſed Chriſt from the dead.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This is in be getting Faith in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now it is that Power which a Beleever being once a Beleever, hath the uſe of afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:42455:73"/>Another Text which is remarkable for this purpoſe, is <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. <hi>That he would grant unto you according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit, in the inner man</hi>: that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle praies for, is that which a Beleever by Faith may fetch in, and make his own.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is <hi>ſtrength in the inner man,</hi> and that is more than in the outward.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is <hi>ſtrength by the Spirit</hi> (now Spirit is a word that is uſed to expreſs ſtrength) and that by <hi>Gods Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is ſtrength by the Spirit with might; one would think it were enough if he had ſaid, Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the Spirit of God, that doth bring in might; but it is, <hi>with might by the Spirit in the inner man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, This is <hi>according to his Glory</hi>; it is ſuch a ſtrength, ſuch a might of Gods Spirit as God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it; it is the glory of the might of the Spirit of God in the inner man. And yet there is one higher expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is <hi>according to the Riches of his Glory</hi>; Whoſe Glory? The Riches of the Glory, of the Might, of the Spirit of God: Of what God? <hi>That God that is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whol Family of Heaven and Earth is named.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely this ſtrength muſt enable to do mighty things, and this ſtrength is a Beleevers own, to work for him, and aſſiſt him in any ſervice. What a ſhameful thing is it for any Chriſtian to complain of the want of ſtrength in the performance of Duty, when ſuch a ſtrength as this is made over to him, and he by Faith may fetch it in, imploy it, and make uſe of it as his own?</p>
            <p>Another place to ſhew what ſtrength it is that Faith doth bring in, it is that in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Strengthened with all might according to his glorious Power, unto all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs.</hi> Now if in your lives you would ſhew that which is proper to a Chriſtian, you muſt do that which muſt manifeſt a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42455:73"/>
glorious power of God. Now what is it that you do, or have done in all your lives, that doth manifeſt a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power of God? This ſhews the glory of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that al that ſee him may ſay, the power of Nature could not do this, the power of Grace could not do this, and the power of all Creatures in Heaven and Earth could not do this, yea, it is more than an ordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, it is a glorious power of God that muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to do this. But though the power of God be glorious, it is not alwaies put forth in enabling men to do duties; but it is ſomtimes put forth in enabling of them with patience to undergo that which is laid upon them as wel as to do great things: may be you do not find the glorious power of God for to enable you to do great works; God would ſomtimes have his glorious power work to make you patient; therefore you muſt not only be patient, as an ordinary man or woman, but be ſo patient as to ſhew you have a glorious power of God to make you patient. Somtimes you have been croſt, and have had afflictions upon you, that have been ſore afflictions, and have been long upon you, and may be you have been patient, but you muſt be ſo patient as to manifeſt the glorious power of God in your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and therefore though I have been ſomwhat pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, yet, have I been ſo patient as to manifeſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power of God in it? and have I been ſo long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering towards thoſe that have croſt me, as to manifeſt the glorious power of God in it? Faith doth fetch in ſtrength to enable to do that. And that is the ſecond thing that Faith doth to carry through difficult ſervices, it doth fetch in the greateſt ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which Faith doth in enabling the ſoul to any difficult work, is the aſſiſting of the ſoul with the higheſt encouragements that poſſibly can be; the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Promiſes of God, and the encouraging Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in the Word, that might put life into the deadeſt ſpirit in the world: the encouragements that are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42455:74"/>
in the Scripture, lay as it were dead to the heart, no but that there is life in them, but becauſe of the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heart; now Faith comes and puts life into them. In this 11. chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Faith i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> commended by <hi>raiſing dead to life</hi>; here is as great a commendation of Faith, when Faith ſhal raiſe a dead Promiſe, and dead encouragement, and put life into it. We read a Promiſe or an encouragement may be twenty times before, but it was as dead; but now Faith doth come and put life into it, and the ſoul can come and lay face upon its face, and mouth upon its mouth, and eyes upon its eyes, and it comes to be a mighty quickning thing to enable it to any ſervice.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Faith carries the ſoul through works that God cals to, becauſe faith in it ſelf (beſides that it brings in) is a mighty ſtrong principle: it is the moſt glorious work that ever creature was enabled to do in this world; the Angels in Heaven were never able to put forth a more glorious work for the kind of it, than a beleeving ſoul doth put forth in the proper eſſential work of Faith; and if Faith in the proper eſſential act of it be the moſt glorious difficult work that ever creature in Heaven or Earth did; then ſurely it muſt have a mighty deal of power to enable the ſoul to do the moſt difficult, and glorious Services.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> You wil ſay, <hi>What is that proper eſſential work of faith, that is the moſt glorious difficult work that ever was performed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For a Creature that doth apprehend it ſelf by Nature an enemy to God, a poor wretched defiled creature by ſin, ſtanding guilty in the preſence of God, having the wrath of God incenſed againſt it, the Juſtice of God crying for ſatisfaction, and the Law of God pronouncing an eternal Curſe upon it, for a ſoul to ſee this, and be ſenſible of it, and yet in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to raiſe up its ſelf, to lay hold upon the perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of a Mediator, God and Man, and to venture
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42455:74"/>
its eternal eſtate upon that righteouſneſs, and to tender up to God by Faith that righteouſneſs as a ful ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Juſtice, and as ſufficient to bear off the the wrath of God from it; and notwithſtanding al the pollution of its nature, yet to unite it ſelf to the Deity, in the neereſt union that ever creature was united to the Deity, except the perſonal Union of Chriſt to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature: this is a glorious work; and no marvel though ſuch glorious power of God be in Faith; and a Faith that can do this, may do any thing, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>If you can beleeve, all things are poſſible</hi>: ſo ſay I to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that hath low thoughts of Faith, and think it a mean work, If you can beleeve, al things are poſſible; it is a greater thing to beleeve truly, than for to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; a man may work miracles, and yet be damned; but juſtifying Faith doth ſo unite the ſoul to God that it is impoſſible the ſoul ſhould be damned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a greater miracle than ever any was enabled to do; though God enables Angels to do great things, yet he never enables them to do ſuch a glorious work as this. Beſides, though people think Faith is an eaſie matter, yet it is the moſt difficult work in the world.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Difficult in regard of the impediments, no work hath ſuch great impediments as this. The ſoul ſeeing an enmity between God and it, and ſeeing it ſelf a polluted Creature, and ſeeing the Law of God in its ſtrictneſs, and the Juſtice of God muſt be ſatisfied, and ſees the wrath of God burning againſt it, and having nothing in its ſelf to ſatisfie God, yet Faith doth break through al theſe, and if it can break through theſe, then certainly it wil break through any thing; for there can be no greater impediment to any ſervice that God calls to, than there was to this one work of beleeving: Let us not therefore be feared by any difficulty and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that lies in our way to any work, becauſe there can never be any mountain laid in our way to hinder us in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny work, as did lie in our way to hinder us from belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42455:75"/>
and if Faith did burſt through thoſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it ſhal be able to break through al other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is difficult, not only becauſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, but becauſe it is the higheſt duty of all; to reach high is painful to the Body; ſo the high actions of the ſoul are difficult to the ſoul: now Faith is high; the object is high, the act is high, and the end is high: the object is the higheſt object, it is the perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a Mediator, God-man; and the act is of the higheſt nature, it is an act of uniting the ſoul with the Deity: as by ſin the ſoul departed from God, ſo by faith the ſoul comes to be made one, and for the end that is high, it is for the ſatisfaction of infinite Juſtice, and for appeaſing of infinite wrath, and for acceptation from infinite holineſs: let God be never ſo holy, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more than we can conceive of him, yet faith does procure acceptance; for ſuch a polluted filthy creature as man is, from the infinite holineſs of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is difficult, becauſe it hath the leaſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance from any principle of Nature: ſome other Graces, as Patience, and Juſtice, and Sobriety, they have ſome help from the principles in Reaſon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but Faith hath no help from any principles in Reaſon or Nature; and therefore ſurely it is difficult, and if it be the moſt glorious, and difficult thing, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it wil enable the ſoul to do moſt glorious and difficult works.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Faith appears to be a moſt ſtrong thing to carry the Soul through any ſervice, becauſe it enables a ſoul to go on in any way of ſervice that God calls to in a gracious manner, and this doth facillitate a work, a main thing that makes our ſervices difficult is our blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering about them, and going about them in a confuſed untoward manner, we do not carry things graciouſly, and ſweetly, In an outward work, to carry it on in a right manner doth mightily further the work; ſo in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42455:75"/>
work that Godſets us about if we went on in the right way that God ſet us about, it would help us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt difficulty, we may thank our ſelves, becauſe we go about our work unto wardly: As an apprentice that handles his tool untowardly, he works with as much ſtrength as another, but not going in the right manner to work, he does but hack &amp; ſpoil his work, wheras a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Carpenter that workes, by rule and goes to it in the right manner he goes through his work with eaſe, and if there be a knotty peice in the timber he knows how to order it, becauſe he hath skil: when as others would throw away the work, and could not tell what to do. So many not having the grace of faith to guide them by the right rule, when they ſet upon any work in religion, they cry out of the difficultneſs, and how it tires them no marvel if you be tired when you do not know the right rule: but the principle of Faith being begotten by the word, and being fed and nouriſhed by the word, it will keep the heart cloſe to the word, and give skill to the ſoul to apply it ſelfe to the rule, and therefore though the work be hard, yet to ſuch a one in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is Eaſy, and ſo carries through abundance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulties which otherwiſe would hinder him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Faith carries through difficult works, things that are hard to be done, becauſe by faith it is that the ſoul of a beleever hath much to do with God, with the ſupream Cauſe, with the higheſt cauſe of all, and by reaſon of Faith the great things that he undertakes are tranſacted between God and him; the cheif difficulty of buſineſs lies moſt in ſecond cauſes, in under cauſes, now if ſo be the thing be cleare between the ſupreame cauſe, and the agent that undertakes the work, it may go on and that with eaſe. As many times in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affaires of a country, if a man have to do with many under Officers he may have a great deal of difficulty in his work, in paſſing through them, but if the buſineſs be tranſacted between him and the King and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42455:76"/>
all be cleare there, he may carry his buſineſs with eaſe; ſo all the buſineſs of a beleever is tranſacted between God and him, and faith keeps the ſoul to the ſupreame cauſe and works it that way, and this muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure much eaſe to a ſervice, becauſe the ſupream cauſe depends on no inferior, but all inferior depends upon it and the ſupream cauſe is enough to work without any inferior cauſes, and no inferior can any way reſiſt the working of the ſupream; yea it is a great particular of the glory of the ſupream cauſe, to work above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all inferior cauſes, and faith having to deal with that, it is not ſo much ſcared with difficulties as others are</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Yet further Faith helps through great difficulties, becauſe it doth remove and cure the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are within the ſpirits of men and women, and if theſe be taken away, external difficulties have little in them, we complain of many difficulties in a work without, whenas indeed the greateſt difficulties are within in our hearts, and faith hath a ſpeciall efficacy for removing and curing of them; As now unruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are great hinderances to any worke that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, faith hath a mighty power in curing of them. And likewiſe diſtracting fears, (but of that before) And the reaſoning of fleſh and blood have a mighty deal of power to make a work difficult, and great care is to be had in curing of them: And the lumpiſh deadneſs of our ſpirits, And the baſe ſluggiſhneſs of our hearts, And the baſe ends that a man hath: faith cures them, and cleanſes the heart of them, And ſo fooliſh preſumptions that people have and their falſe confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and reſting upon rotten props, theſe and divers others may be named which are inward difficulties that faith helps againſt, and by removing of them doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily overcome any difficulty that is without, therefore when you have any work which is hard, look not ſo much for the removing the difficulties that are without
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42455:76"/>
as the difficulties that are within.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, The Eighth particular wherein the power of Faith is, That Faith makes the work that God ſets a Chriſtian about, to be ſuitable to his ſpirit; let the work be what it wil be, if it be a work of God, any way of Godlineſs, Faith hath a power to work the heart to be ſuitable to that work, that there ſhal be an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the frame and temper of heart, and the work that God ſets it to, and then a work wil go on. If you ſet one to a work that does but bungle, the work does not go off hand, becauſe it is a work that is not ſuitable to his principles: but if a man hath a work that is ſuitable to him, he can go to it with ſinging, and it goes off readily: as in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The work went on, becauſe the people had a mind to work;</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was a hard work.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Again, Another power of Faith is this: Faith hath power to make uſe of difficulties for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the work, and therefore much more power for to carry through difficulties: Faith can bring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the Rock, it can make the mountains that lie in the way to be advantages to raiſe the heart upon: We have a notable place for this in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.3, 4. where it is ſaid, <hi>Out of weakneſs they were made ſtrong:</hi> not that they were made ſtrong being weak, that they were brought out of their weakneſs, and had ſtrength conveyed to them (that is not al) but it is made a fruit of their Faith, that they were made ſtrong out of weakneſs: Faith did make uſe of their very weakneſs to ſtrengthen them by; ſo that Faith is not only able to ſtrengthen thoſe that are weak, but to take advantage by weakneſs for to ſtrengthen, to turn al hindrances into furtherances: for ſo God having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all ſhal turn to good, Faith can take hold of that Promiſe, and ſo turn all hindrances that can be into furtherances: Faith hath a <hi>Chymical Art</hi>; thoſe that have that Art wil get Gold cut of Stones or Iron: So
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42455:77"/>
Faith wil draw Gold out of Iron and ſtones, out of things that ſeem to be never ſo croſs and contrary, it wil draw help.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Faith helps againſt difficulty, becauſe <hi>it works by love,</hi> and that hath a great deal of power to carry through difficulties; <hi>Much water cannot quench Love</hi>: it is a ſpeech of <hi>Bernard.</hi> Cant. 8.7. <hi>The force of Love is violent.</hi> Saies the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Remembring without ceaſing your work of Faith, and labor of Love:</hi> Love is very laborious, it will force through difficulty; therefore that which makes ſo much uſe of Love, and inflames that, that hath much power againſt difficulty.</p>
            <p n="11">11<hi>ly,</hi> Another thing wherein the power of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, is, Before we enter on the work it aſſures of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good ſucceſs: Now when we know the ſucceſs ſhal be good and certain before we begin, this wil help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any difficulty though the work be never ſo hard; it is want of the hope of the ſucceſs that deadens the heart: But this muſt not be miſtaken; Faith doth not alwaies aſſure of a particular ſucceſs, if we wil aſſure our ſelves of a particular ſucceſs, which is more than the Promiſe wil bear, this wil hinder Faith: but faith wil aſſure of ſucceſs in the general.</p>
            <p n="12">12<hi>ly,</hi> Again, Faith aſſures of the reward, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 75.7. <hi>Be ye ſtrong therefore, and let not your hands be weak, for your work ſhall be rewarded:</hi> Faith aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this wil make one ſtrong, though God cal to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch hard things. Marriners in hope of a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they wil venture themſelves in ſtorms &amp; tempeſts, and in dangers on the Sea. And ſo a Soldier, if his Captain wil give him a months, or two months pay, over and above, he wil venture his life.</p>
            <p n="13">13<hi>ly,</hi> Laſtly, Faith quickens and ſtirs up al Graces, cals in the help of every Grace. Now many hands will do great works: and ſo, where al Graces do work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42455:77"/>
much wil be done. And thus much for the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the work of faith in carrying through ſervices that have ſo much difficulty: For Uſe,</p>

They are hard and tedious to you, becauſe you want a principle to do them by, but they are not hard to the Chriſtian: indeed it was cruelty, and hardneſs to to <hi>Pharoah</hi> to put the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon work, and take away their ſtraw, but God though he puts his ſervants
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42455:78"/>
upon hard works, he gives them a principle whereby to do them: If a man ſhould put another upon an hard work, and give him an engine to carry him through, then it is not hard; ſo though God puts them on hard works, he gives them an engine to carry them through; ſaies <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iel</hi> 10.19. <hi>ſpeak Lord thou haſt ſtrengthened thy ſervant.</hi> So a Godly man may ſay, true Lord I have no ſtrength in my ſelf, to do this difficult work, but being thou haſt ſtrengthened thy ſervant, and given him this ſtrong principle in ſome meaſure, now Lord ſpeak, Command what thou wilt.</p>

               <p>A ſecond Uſe is this. Hence let all beleevers that have evidence to themſelves that they are beleevers, or any hope that God hath wrought faith in them, let them expect to be put upon difficult things: becauſe God hath put in them a principle to carry them through dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult things, and God delights to improve al his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according to the powers they have; there is no power of nature, but God wil cal it forth, and improve it at ſome time or other, and if God delights to improve the power of nature, much more the power of Grace, which is the ſpeciall, and choice power that he doth communicate to any creature in the world; and for the kind the choiceſt thing that he will communicate to any creature to al eternity, and therefore if you have not found hard things, expect them and make account that your faith ſhould be called out, Faith is the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Grace, able to do the moſt Glorious things that ever creature is able to do, and have you it for nothing? have you faith only to keep you in that ordinary way that the principles of nature are able to keep you in? if God have given you faith, he hath given you it for to do great things, and therefore expect difficult things.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo expect them, as
<list>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42455:78"/>
                     <item>Firſt, not to be diſcouraged,</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Not to count it an affliction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Be not diſcouraged: ſome think I can hardly do ordinary things, and therefore how ſhall I do ſuch hard things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you have faith though you be called to difficult things, you cannot be called to a more difficult work than you have done already, and this is a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to faith: the weakeſt beleever in the world hath done as difficult a work as ever any ſhall be called to beſides that, viz. the work of beleeving at firſt, when we look upon our ſelves as enemies to God, for God to juſtify the ungodly, this is a more difficult work then ever God will call you to; and therefore if God hath carried you through the difficulties in the point of juſtification, never fear any difficulties that may follow hereafter: If a man be called to any hard thing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himſelf in this, I am not called to a harder then I have done already, ſuppoſe God hath called you to an hard duty this not an harder duty then that you have done already, that is the work of faith in cloſing with Chriſt in the point of juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though you know God will call you to hard things, God hath engaged himſelf that you ſhall never have any temptation befall you, but you ſhall have ſtrength accordingly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you be called to any thing, God doth not call you to any hard work, nor never wil, in expectation that you ſhould do it in your own ſtrength, but in that ſtrength which he will give you, and yet count it upon your own ſcore, as if you did it in your own ſtrength to reward you for it, indeed when we conſider what little ſtrength we have, we may be diſcouraged, but when God doth call us to any work he doth not expect we ſhould do it in our ſtrength, and yet he will reward it as our own, as in that 60. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 12. <hi>Through God we ſhal do valiantly, for he it is that ſhall tread
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42455:79"/>
down our enemies</hi>: is it God that treads down our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies how do we do valiantly? it is God that doth vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, we do nothing, yet ſays the text <hi>through God we ſhal do valiantly, for he it is that ſhall tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d down our enemies</hi>; ſo that though the ſtrength whereby God expects us to do any work by, be not our own, yet God accounts it as our own, and Chriſtians may reckon it their own to give God the glory of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Further be not diſcouraged for fear of any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work you ſhall be called to, becauſe there is no work of a Chriſtian, that he is called to, but as it ſpends ſtrength it gives ſtrength, it gives more then it ſpends, in the way of ſpending it gives: A man will never be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of cold in work that brings more heat then cold, <hi>the ſluggard would not plow becauſe it was cold,</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20 4. But if he had plowed his labor would have brought in heat; and ſo it is a ſluggiſh reaſon to think, ſhall I do ſuch an hard work and I have ſuch little ſtrength? the work will bring in ſtrength; as if a man ſhould ſay I am cold in the houſe, how cold ſhould I be in the feild, and how cold when I take hold on the plow which is cold, and the earth which is cold? indeed if there were nothing in the work to bring in heat we might ſay ſo; but the work brings in more heat, then there is cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ayr: And ſo people think I have ſcarce ſtrength for that work which I have now, but if it be more difficult what then? If it be more difficult, and it bring in more ſtrength, then it would be better then it is now.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Count it no affliction; do not complaine as if your caſe were worſe then the caſe of any, that God put you upon ſuch hard taskes and works that he doth not others, thou knoweſt not what thou doeſt in complaining of the hardneſs of thy worke.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Know a difficult work is a moſt honorable thing. As if a Captain have ſome great difficult work to do, that is of great conſequence for the good of his countrie,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42455:79"/>
he will not call out every baſe fellow, but his prime ones, and they count it an honour to be called out. And ſo if a maſter of Defence have ſome difficult work to be done, he doth not call out the loweſt in the Schoole, but the chiefeſt, and it is an honor to him: and if he were called to do onely ordinarie things, and another were called to do great things, it would be a diſhonor to him, and ſo it might rather be an affliction, for God to call you to do only ordinarie things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a mighty opportunitie for the exerciſe of Grace: now as the ſcripture ſaith, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The tryall of Grace is more pretious than Gold.</hi> For the exerciſe of Grace, Grace it ſelf is for exerciſe, and ſo the exerciſe is better than the grace, and if grace be pretious in the habit, it is more precious in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, you ſhould prize one exerciſe of Grace more excellent then the whol world: People prize grace in the habits; Oh that God would beſtow Grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but they do not ſet a price upon every gratious act, but come to this, to ſet a high price upon every act of Grace as wel as the habit, and you will not complain of difficult works.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more difficult ſervices you are called to, the more opportunitie you have to honor God, you have don but a litle all this while and the moſt part of your time hath been to little purpoſe, if God will give you an opportunitie to doe a great deale in a little time, will you murmure at it and count it your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Difficult works are for the improvement of your graces: If a man have a ſtock, and he have had ſome improvement for it, but not full, he hath ſome mony ly dead by him or is not improved for that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it might, if he ſhal find a way to improve every penny of his ſtock, to the utmoſt advantage, will he count this an affliction? he counts it an advantage; who grow rich but thoſe that have the full improvement of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42455:80"/>
their ſtock: Men count it a miſery to have their ſtock<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly by them and not improved; why do not you count it a miſery to have gracely by you, and not exerciſed: Would you count it a happineſs that God ſhould ſhew you a way to improve your outward ſtock to the full, and would you not count it a happineſs that God ſhould ſhew you a way to improve your grace to the full.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="application">
               <head>USE, 3.</head>
               <p>The third uſe is this: If Faith enables to carry through difficult works, then it can be no concluding argument againſt a work, becauſe there fall out many hinderances in the worke, for faith carries through nothing but that which is the work of God, and if it be to carry through hinderances, then hinderances and blocks in the way can be no concluding argument that this is not the work of God; this is our weakneſs, we ſet upon many works and before we begin we conſider whether it be the work of God, and we have conſidered and conſulted with God, and his people, and we find it is Gods work, and we begin to ſet upon it, and we would go on, and alwaies think it Gods work if things went on wel, but as ſoone as we find any let that ſtops us, we begin to cal in queſtion whether it were Gods work or no. It is true when we find any hinderances in our work, it ſhould make us reflect our thoughts upon our cal to it and ſee that be right; and further, it ſhould make us humble our ſelves before God to take away whatſoever hinderance God ſhould lay in our way out of any diſpleaſure; for though God ſomtimes do lay hinderances as an honor to improve our graces, yet ſomtimes hinderances may be as chaſtizements to us; and therefore it is uſeful for to humble our ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that we may have more aſſurance nothing is between God and us, and that our hinderances do not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42455:80"/>
come as a fruit of his diſpleaſure, and the hinderances we meet withall ſhould make us keep more cloſe to the rule, becauſe Faith will beare us out in nothing, but according as we goe to the rule, and ſo we ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove hinderances to ſtir up our Faith: But to make hinderances, and hard things that fall out to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to think it is not the work of God, that is a great evil: And for that I only ſpeak this one thing, &amp; that is the way of God towards <hi>Jacob</hi> in that work of his when God called him to goe from <hi>Laban</hi> into his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, You may read the ſtory at your leiſure, God from Heaven calls <hi>Jacob</hi> to goe to that Journey: It was the work of God; <hi>Jacob</hi> might think it being Gods work I ſhall meet with no hardſhip: but if you read the ſtory, you ſhall find it was one of the moſt hard Journeys that ever he undertook in his life as it appeares by theſe ſix things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, After he went <hi>Laban</hi> followed him with an intent to miſcheife him, but that God ſtopt him, and there was ſome danger that <hi>Jacob</hi> was in; God freed him from that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His wiſe's nurſe dyed, that was a great help to his wife, God took away even a right hand to his wife.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His wife dyed in that Journey, this was a mighty croſs, he might think God comes mightily to croſſe me.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, After this His Daughter <hi>Dinah</hi> goes out, and ſhee is defloured,</p>
               <p>Fiftly, After this His two Sons <hi>Symeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> goe and commit that wofull outrage, and murdered ſo many innocent people.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, His Brother <hi>Eſaw</hi> came with rage and fury againſt him, intending to deſtroy him, and he was mightily affraid of his Brother <hi>Eſaw</hi>: Now this may quiet many that are to goe any Journy; firſt, let them ſee the call of God, and then go on in it whatſoever fals
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42455:81"/>
out, take it rather as a tryall of your Faith, then any ſtop of God in your way. And ſo you that are weake, that have friends that undertake hard works, and hard voyages, you think they may doe it before danger come, but if danger come you are ready to think that it is not the right way; if you have no other argument but that, know it comes from weakneſs, and you are to lay downe that weakneſs, and not to diſturbe your ſelves, and your friends by your weakneſs, to think it is not the way of God, becauſe of thoſe hinderances: and that is the third uſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="application">
               <head>USE, 4.</head>
               <p>Fourthly, if Faith be the principle that carries through ſuch difficult works: Hence who ever have been carried through difficult works, look back to what God hath carried you through, reflect upon it and ſee what it was that did it; ſuch and ſuch works God called you to, may be, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> to forſake your owne country, which you have done, not out of any outward neceſſity, but in bare obedience to God, now may be you may meet with many hinderances, and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, you might have ſtayed and lived comfortable and full handed enough, if you could have diſpenſed with thoſe things that others did, ſome hardſhip you had in leaving of thoſe things; and then the example of others might come and make the work difficult: But through Gods mercy the work was undertaken, and gone through, now what is it that carried you through? was it your own naturall reſolutions? the ſtrength of your own purpoſes? was it any aſſiſtance you hade from any friends? or any help that we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from any creature? upon the reviewing of it cannot you ſay as in the preſence of God, I know not what in the world carried me through, but Gods giving me an heart to depend upon him in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42455:81"/>After what manner did God work upon thy heart? did he firſt prepare thy heart, by a work of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſeek him, and make up thy peace with him? when he had done that: did God ſecondly take off thy heart from all creature props, creature confidences, and dependances? After that did God caſt in a word, and promiſe into thee, and by his ſpirit mightily draw thy heart to cloſe with it, and faſten upon it? did God draw out a work of Faith to cloſe with this wiſdom Faithfulneſs and power for the carrying of thee through when thou ſaweſt no ſtrength in thy ſelf, nor didſt not know what ſhould become of thee? wert willing whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to venture upon God, to give up thy ſelf unto him, to be at his diſpoſe? were thy ends good and right in this work? didſt not thou find that there was a principle in thee carrying thee beyond thine own thoughts, &amp; beyond any ſtrength that thou couldeſt poſſibly conceive to be in thy ſelf, and that hath brought the work to an iſſue beyond they expectation? ſurely there was faith in this, and if there were faith in this, conſider what <hi>I</hi> have to ſay to thee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Know that this work is wonderfully accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, God looks upon ſuch works of nature as lovely, as the young man that came to Chriſt, <hi>Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him,</hi> in <hi>Mark,</hi> 10.21. But if it be a work of faith God looks upon it and accepts it indeed, ſays the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Theſe obtained a good report by faith; Heb.</hi> 11.39. They obtained a good report indeed, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, but before God.</p>
               <p>Secondly being a work of Faith, thou mayeſt have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of peace, and joy in it, we never have gone through difficulty but it is pleaſant to us, if we have gone ſome voyage, and have paſſed through difficulties, through many ſtorms, and tempeſts, we prize it, the water that <hi>David</hi> longed for, when it was got with ſo much difficulty, he thought it too good to drink, <hi>but powred it before the Lord.</hi> In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.16.17.

               <p>Thirdly, If ſo be that Faith hath carried thee through difficulty, Let this encourage thee for ever for time to come; certainly there is no difficulty wil ſtand before thee: if difficulties have begun to fal, they wil fal, and wil not be able to ſtand before thee. You may reaſon as <hi>Hamans</hi> friends, <hi>If thou beginneſt to fall before Mordecai, thou wilt fall,</hi> Eſt. 6.13. and therefore thou maiſt cal this work by the name that <hi>David</hi> called that place where his enemies began to fal before him; <hi>Baal-perizem, becauſe God had made a breach upon his enemies,</hi> 2 Sam. 5.20. he took that but as a pledg that God would make al his enemies fal before him. And ſo, hath God made ſome difficulties fal before thee; then al difficulties wil fal.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let God have al the glory, neither thy ſelf, nor the means; thoſe things that we do by Faith, God is in them, little of our ſelves, or nothing at al; <hi>Boaſting is excluded,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. By the Law of Faith, or by the Law of Works? By the Law of Faith, and therefore that which is done by faith, excludes al boaſting from our ſelves, and gives God the glory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Faith of al Graces hath leaſt rooting in our ſelves: as for Juſtice, and Temperance, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Love, they have ſome aſſiſtance in Nature; but faith hath nothing at al, and therefore God muſt have the glory of that chiefly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith of al Graces hath the leaſt influence into that which it doth, though it be under the rank of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſes; it is but an inſtrumental cauſe, and though an inſtrument be an efficient, it is the leaſt efficiency of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42455:82"/>
al, and therefore the glory belongs to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of al Graces Faith is the moſt emptying Grace, it carries a Creature out of it ſelf unto another; and therefore whatſoever we do by Faith we muſt give God the glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Attribute nothing to means; for though thou uſeſt means, ye whatſoever was done by Faith, was done above means, beyond means, and might have been done without means.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hath God carryed you through any difficult work? and was this a principle: Labor to prize the word of God upon which thy faith was built to nouriſh and increaſe this Joy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you have found your faith hath carried you through great things, take heed thy Faith do not fayl thee in leſs things, that will be a ſhame; As a marriner that hath been in great ſtormes, and tempeſts, and hath wrought through them, if afterward he ſhould come, and periſh in the haven, or in ſome ordinary tempeſt, for want of Skill that would grieve him more; &amp; ſo for a Souldier that hath been in deſperate battels af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be overcome with a little ſtrength, he looſeth his honor, this is poſſible that a Chriſtian by his faith may be carried through wonderful great things, and yet his faith may fail him afterwards in leſſer things, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man may eſcape great dangers, and recover great ſucceſs, and yet afterwards die of a cold, and thoſe that God hath carried through great things, may faile in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, but it is an infinite ſhame, take heed to your ſelves in that: As <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>The ſhield of the mighty is vilely caſt away, as though he had not been anointed with Oyl.</hi> God hath given thee fayth as a ſhield, and it was the ſhield of the mighty, and now it is vilely caſt away, an ordinary temptation comes and thou faileſt, as if thou hadſt not been anointed with oyl, when God carried thee through difficult works, thou wert anointed with oyl, and now you fal as if you had not been anointed with oyl, you
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42455:83"/>
have been carried through many difficulties in that work of leaving of your country, now when you come here your faith will not ſerve you to order your ordinary buſineſs, and affaires, but it fails fowly in every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dealing with man, and in your private dealings in your family what a ſhameful thing is it, that ſuch a one as hath had ſuch power, as to look upon the face of his enemies, and to teſtify for the truth before them, when he hath to deal with a ſervant, or child or Wife he fails ſhamefully, and when he comes to deal with bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he knows not how to behave himſelf, as if he were not anointed with oyl, as if he never had faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but nature, as ful of frowardneſs, and pettiſhneſs of ſpirit, and all outward diſtempers, as thoſe that never were acquainted with Faith? And ſo faith hath carried you through great difficulties, enabled you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your ſelf to get to the ordinances, and when you are under them it fails you in aſſiſtance to make uſe of them, and to give God the Glory of them, but you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defile them, and ſpoile them, what a ſhameful thing is this? Be aſhamed and confounded in your own thoughts, and ſtir up your Faith.</p>

works, and amongſt other difficult works the forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ones own country: it is much that we forſake in forſaking our country, and we had need of Faith to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one through this, indeed a Chriſtian ſhould look upon all the world as his country, he treads upon no ground but that which is his Fathers ground. <hi>Socrates</hi> uſed to call himſelf <hi>a Citizen of the world</hi> when he was baniſhed he counted it no baniſhment for the world was his country, and he being a man was a Citizen of it, certainly God hath given the Saints the World: <hi>The promiſe was to</hi> Abraham <hi>and to his ſeed that he ſhould be heire of the World,</hi> Rom. 4.13.

               </gap>ing of a mans country, and he had need of faith to carry him through who doth leave it, But how ſhall we know that faith carries us through, there may be many other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Faith goes upon ſpiritual grounds, motives and ends, Faith is a ſpiritual grace and it works exceeding ſpiritually, and the reaſonings of Faith are above the reaſonings of Fleſh and Blood, what were your motives and grounds and ends by that you might know whether out of faith you forſook your country, it may be it was from vexation or diſcontent that you left your country; or from the example of others, or from engagement unto others, or out of novelty or out of carnal fears or out of vaine hopes, or for further providing for your ſelves, a great many things there may be that may put people on ſuch a way, eſpecially thoſe three, novelty, example, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42455:84"/>
diſcontent: but if it be by faith the ground and the end wil be ſpiritual, for God and out of obedience unto God. It is obſervable of <hi>Moſes</hi> (for I will go no further for notes of tryal then from the worke of <hi>Moſes) Moſes</hi> when he pleads with <hi>Pharoah</hi> to go out of his country, he did not plead the peoples bondage, you do ſo abuſe the people here, and we are in ſuch grievous bondage, that we cannot bear it, but ſaies he In <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.23. <hi>The Lord hath commanded, we muſt go into the wilderneſs to worſhip him,</hi> that was his plea and ground and end rather then the bondage that the people did ſuffer: ſo when men forſake their country, outward things may come in, in ſubordination to higher things: and there may be faith in ordering the heart about them, but faith muſt go above them: now can your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces witneſs, as in the preſence of God, it was your long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire, for to enjoy God in his ordinances and to keep your ſouls from defilement, this was the argument of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not ſet up the worſhip of God there, but they muſt go where God called them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Faith be the thing that brings any from their country, above all things they will be very ſollicitous, and careful, for the enjoyment of Gods preſence with them; though they are in a ſubordinate way to provide for their families and to look how to live yet the great care of their ſouls is that they may enjoy the preſence of God: this was <hi>Moſes</hi> argument: <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Except thy preſence go with us Lord carrie us not hence:</hi> now if ſo be it was thy care in departing to carry God, and his gracious preſence with thee, let me ſtay here and ſuffer any thing, lie in priſon and rot, rather then go without the preſence of God, this is an argument it was of Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Moſes</hi> in forſaking his own country and going from <hi>Egypt</hi> he carries it in a very gratious manner, when he came to <hi>Pharoah</hi> though the people were vext and troubled, becauſe their bondage did increaſe, he did
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42455:84"/>
not fall exclaiming againſt him, but rather yeilding to him in a way of ſubmiſſion as far as he could: he did not go on raſhly, headily, fooliſhly, and ſelf-confidently, as many do, which manifeſt a great deal of pride, and ſtoutneſs of ſpirit rather then any thing elſe, but he carries on the buſineſs with a great deal of ſobriety and gravity, with much humility, and meekneſs of ſpirit, in a way of wiſdom; and ſo it is in every action of faith ſo far as faith is in it, now what was the maner of your forſaking your country, was it in a way of ſeeking of God, knowing the mind of God, with quietneſs of ſpirit, and humility, and wiſdom that you were brought away, that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note that it is of faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he came from his country, above al things the name of God was dear to him after he was come away and eſpecially upon this becauſe their very departing from <hi>Egypt</hi> held out the name of God much, and therefore he was very careful that that name of God, that was held out in their departing from <hi>Egypt</hi> might not be polluted, when he was in any danger, preſently he flees to this, <hi>Lord what will become of thy great name</hi>: he does not ſo much plead in the behalf of the people, as in the name of God, ſo if faith hath brought you from your country, the name of God is much in it: you take a profeſſion that you come from your country for the ordinances of God, and the further purity of his worſhip, now for one to leave friends, and eſtate, and country, and all upon this ground, if it were out of faith, how dear would the name of God be to ſuch a one, leaſt the name of God that is held out in his profeſſion ſhould be polluted; when you come here and there ſhould be diviſions, and nothing but tearing, and rending of one another; conſider what ſhall become of the great name of God, thus <hi>Moſes</hi> reaſoned <hi>what will the heathen ſay, that thou haſt brought the people hither to deſtroy them?</hi> ſo will others ſay, they are come out of their own country to tear and rend, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42455:85"/>
fight with one another. Let that name that is held out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n your profeſſion be dear to you, and make that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to curb paſſion, and to order you in your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one with another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Moſes</hi> was mightily careful that he might not be fruſtrat of his end: he went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> that he might come to Canaan: and when there was any danger that he was like to be fruſtrated in this, how it troubled him it went to his heart; and he cried to God that God would let him ſee that good land: ſo if it be out of faith that you come from your country, great care will be had that you be not fruſtrate of your end, wherefore came you? came you not to enjoy God? to have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther communion with God? to walk with God in a more cloſe way then you could do before? are you careful to attaine your end? doth it trouble your ſouls when at any time you ſee any danger to be fruſtrate of your end? doth it come near to you that you find for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you have attained ſo little of your end? thoſe that come out of other ends, let this go: but if you come out of Faith, you will be mightily careful to attaine the end for which you came, that work that is done out of faith will work mightily to the end, and never leave wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king till it come at its end.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If ſo be you came out of your country by Faith your ſouls will be ſatisfied with God alone and the cal and promiſe of God is that which your ſouls will have recourſe unto continually for the ſatisfaction of your ſouls, ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> when he was in ſtraight he preſently had recourſe to the call and promiſe of God, to bring his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that ſatisfied him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As it will quiet, and ſatisfie the ſoul, ſo that Faith that brought you out will carry you through all difficulties, now you meet with many difficulties, and ſome you thought not of, if it were out of faith that you came, and that faith were a continued work it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you through the difficulties you meet withall, do you
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42455:85"/>
find that upon the difficulties you meet withall your hearts ſink? you may fear it was not Faith that firſt brought you out. I would not have any gather any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter concluſion from this which hath been ſaid, to think that we make compariſons between our country and <hi>Egypt</hi>: no but we bleſs God for the good we received in our own country, and do deſire the good of it as far as we can, but only to ſhew the work of <hi>Moſes</hi> in forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Egypt.</hi> But in thoſe that came from <hi>Egypt</hi> there was a <hi>mixt company</hi>; and thoſe mixt company were a continual trouble and diſturbance to thoſe that were the Iſrael of God. Numb. 11.4. <hi>And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a luſting, and the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael alſo wept again and ſayd who ſhal give us fleſh to eate?</hi> the mixt multitude they began the ſin, and the children of Iſrael fell with them: And ſo into theſe countries there are come many of the people of God that were gracious out of faith; but there are a great many that are <hi>the mixt multitude,</hi> that were of broken eſtates, they knew not how to live, and coming upon thoſe ends, the people of God are troubled with ſuch, and they are the grateſt contemners of the waies of Godlineſs, they have kindneſs from the people of the country, but they meet with trouble from this mixt company, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when any of thoſe do creep into the Church, and come to be members of it, but for thoſe that come from their country by faith, we hope we ſhal enjoy comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table communion with all ſuch, and thus much for this fourth uſe.</p>

I ſeldom undertake a work but my unbelieving heart makes me faile in it; now there is a work of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and nothing can carrie me through that but Faith, and if my unbelieving heart come and ſpoyl me in that, it were better I had never been borne, it hath done me hurt enough in ſuch and ſuch things, I had need have a care it doe not ſpoile me in that: As if a man ſhould ſay, there are ſuch and ſuch buſineſſes I have miſcarried in, and I have loſt much by them, but there are ſuch and ſuch works if I miſcarrie in I am undon, it is as much as my life is worth, and therefore I had need take heed of thoſe things that have been hindrances to me in my other works: So if unbelief have done you hurt in theſe works, take heed it do not hinder you in the maine work. And for a word to thoſe that are weake, who are ready to be diſcouraged, and think they ſhall miſcarry: Know God hath a ſpeciall care of all his people though never ſo weak to keep off hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances in that maine work, though God do ſuffer them to faile in other works, and his name ſuffer ſome diſhonour by it, yet he will have a care they ſhall not

As God deales in the way of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſo of his power, though he may withdraw his ſtrength ſo, as not to aſſiſt our faith in ſome particular actions, yet in the maine and great buſineſs that concerns our eternal eſtate, we ſhall not want neceſſary ſtrength. As a Father that is going along with his child, may be he goes in ſuch waies as the child is in danger of many a fall, to get many a knock, and ſore bruiſe, the father will ſay to him have a care, take heed: but if he come to a way, that if the child fall he loſe his life the father wil not content himſelf with ſaying take heed, but he takes hold on him till he be paſt that place: ſo God in all our ordinary buſineſs ſaies look to your Faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe your faith, but for all that we get many a fall, and many a knock, but then may be there comes another work, that concerns our eternal eſtate, which if we faile in we are undone for ever, god takes hold of the ſoul there, and will not let them miſcarry in that, which is the infinite mercy of God to us; and were we not ſure of Gods mercy in that reſpect, being conſcious to our ſelves of our unbeleeving hearts, we might fear, yea conclude we ſhould faile.</p>

Let us ſet before us the example of our great Captaine the Lord Jeſus Chriſt you know what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult works Chriſt undertooke for the ſalvation of man, ſuch difficult works as all the Angells in heaven and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world would have ſunke under: But Chriſt went through them; and there was a work of Faith in Chriſt that carried him through, though it was not ſuch a work of faith as ours, Juſtifying Faith, yet he had a Faith, his truſt in his father that did help to carry him through great and difficult works. In 2 <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.13. Chriſt is propounded as an example unto us, Saying <hi>I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42455:88"/>
of the Church will I ſing praiſe unto thee</hi>: Chriſt in his own perſon did praiſe God, and he ſung praiſes in the hearts of his people, ſo that by the way, take this as a comfortable note, to encourage us to publique duties, while we are prayſing of God, Chriſt is prayſing of God while we are ſinging of pſalms to God in a gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Chriſt is prayſing of God the father. <hi>And again I will put my truſt in him,</hi> it is a ſpeech of Chriſt unto the Father, Chriſt put his truſt in the Father, and the example of the work of Faith in Chriſt to carry him through all the works he had to do, is brought as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto Chriſtians, to caſt their relyance on God the Father, to carry them through all the hard works they have to do. And as Chriſt did not only praiſe God in his own perſon, but in the Church, ſo Chriſt did not only in his own perſon truſt in the Father and ſo was carried through the difficult works he had to do, but he truſted in his Father, in the hearts of his people, that they might be carried through the difficult works they have to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When any difficult work is to be done, labor to make preparation for the work of Faith by humiliation, before you undertake the work and according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any difficult ſervices there muſt be a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſure of humiliation before you undertake that work: therefore when God hath called to extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry works, uſually Gods people have made preparation for their faith by extraordinary humiliation, as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Ezra</hi> and <hi>Eſther,</hi> that were to undertake great works, which they were to be carried through by faith, they made preparation by extraordinary humiliation before hand. It is in the putting forth of a new act of faith, as it was in the firſt act of Faith, as eſpecially humiliation was a preparation for faith at firſt, ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially humiliation is a preparation for the putting forth of a new act of Faith, after we have it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When any difficult ſervice comes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42455:89"/>
let there be oft renewing of Faith in the great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace: and do not only think to exerciſe faith in this particular work, but let your care be about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Faith in the great covenant, let the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be renewed, and inferiour grants wil come in. Thus God dealt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when any thing befell <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that he was in a great ſtraight, then God renewed his Covenant with him, <hi>I am God Alſufficient</hi>; God thought this a ſpecial meanes to carry him through; If you have renewed the covenant (in which all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are included) this is a great help to Faith, Shall not God who hath given us his Son with him alſo give us al things elſe; the ſoul may reaſon ſtrongly thus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Faith muſt be ſet on work when any difficult ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is to be done, for the purifying of the heart, though you beleeve God will be with you, and ſtrengthen you in the work, yet unleſs you make uſe of Faith to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the heart, as well as beleeve, you may miſcarry in the work, if there be any luſt that lies next the heart, you wil never be able for to do great things; for ſin as it is of a defiling nature, ſo it is of a weakning nature. If you would have a ſpirit of power, you muſt have a ſound mind. In <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> 13.3. When they were about a great work <hi>they ſeparated the mixt company,</hi> &amp; when you are about any great work, Exerciſe Faith to purge your hearts from corruption, Saies <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.32. <hi>It is God that girdeth me with ſtrength, and makes my way perfect.</hi> The girding of him with ſtrength and making his way perfect went together: therefore: labor that the way with God in your own hearts may be perfect, and clean, and then God will gird you with ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In difficulties labor to exerciſe faith to get you off from all ſhifting waies, and creature dependances: It is obſervable of thoſe that have to deal with mettals, when they are working of Gold, that they might have it work the eaſier, they will mixe other mettals with it,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42455:89"/>
and upon the mixing of Lead and tinne with Gold, it works the eaſier, but it is a great deal worſe, it were better they would take more pains in the working of it, it would be purer. Juſt ſo do many Chriſtians, that are ill workemen in the waies of God, when they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of good actions and they find them difficult, and go ſomwhat hard off, they will be mixing their own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pollicy, and ſhifting courſes, and to that end the work may go off eaſier, but though it be eaſier to be done yet it is a worſe peece of work after it be done, then it would have been if it had been done with more paines. Labor to exerciſe Faith to get you off from al creature dependances, if the heart by Faith be given up to God alone, it will do mighty things: but if ſo be we would have two ſtrings to our bow, that if ſuch a means do faile we may have ſome other to reſt upon, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do any great thing: And therefore when God would uſe any of his people to do great things, he firſt took them off from al creature helps they had before, as I have met with an obſervation that one hath from <hi>Moſes</hi> about this. In <hi>Acts,</hi> 17, 22. It is ſaid <hi>Moſes was an Eloquent man, a man of mighty words.</hi> Yet if you read the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.10. you ſhall hear <hi>Moſes</hi> complaine that he was <hi>ſlow of ſpeech, and not eloquent.</hi> This is anſwered, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man of mighty words, but when God was about this work, and a little before God took away his excellency in words, that he might have further dependance upon God, then before he had: whether there be any reality in this or no I know not, yet certainly it is the way of God, when men have any creature helps, God doth take them off from them that they might have a ſheere work of Faith, for when the creature is uſed, it doth uſually rob God of a great part of his honor: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Gideon</hi> had ſo many thouſand, God ſaid <hi>it was too great a multitude for him to deliver his people by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Faith muſt take us off from our own ends too, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42455:90"/>
ingage God in the buſineſs as much as we can, let God be ſeen in the work though we be not ſeen, let God have the glory, though it be not known who did that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work, great things will be done when God is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the buſineſs. And it is a ſpecial work of Faith to take us off our own ends; when you come to a great work, you think to exerciſe faith and not being taken off from your own ends; Faith looſeth its vertue and power.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When we come to any work that is difficult, let us labor to exerciſe Faith, to caſt our ſelves upon the word, to find out ſome promiſe, and to roule upon it to venture our ſelves and the might of our work upon that word, as namely thus: Suppoſe it be a work for the ſubduing of any ſin; that word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhal not have dominion over you,</hi> look at the word, and make more account of it, then of all your endeavors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin whatſoever, if it be laboring to get from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that difficulty, the guilt of Conſcience, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves from the terror of it. That word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If it be for the doing of any work that we are called to, that word that hath vertually a promiſe in it: <hi>he worketh all our works in us, and for us; Iſa.</hi> 26.12. If it be to ſtand againſt any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that word which God gave to <hi>Joſhua, Joſhua.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I will be with thee and will not leave thee</hi>: Exerciſe Faith to get a word and to reſt your ſouls upon it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Take this word and plead it with God in prayer when you enter on any difficulty, do as it were ſhew unto God his bond: though God binds him ſelf; yet he wil not come in and help till the creature come and ſhew his bond: and upon the ſight and pleading of the bond with God, God is pleaſed to come in with help, God is much taken, and delighted with this, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſervants in difficulty ſhall come, and plead his promiſes. The turning of promiſes into praier, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42455:90"/>
as it were the diſtilling of faith into prayer is a thing mighty prevailing with God: As there are ſome Phyſicall things that have great operations, but unleſs they be diſtilled, or taken in ſuch and ſuch things they will not work; but then they will work: So Faith when it is diſtilled and turned in praier, and mingled with praier, and taken down in that, then it works: If a Phyſitian ſhould come and ſay, how did you take ſuch a thing? and you ſay I ſwallowed it down, he wil ſay you ſhould have taken it in ſuch and ſuch a thing, and then it would have wrought; ſo you beleeve God will help you, but have you diſtilled your Faith into praier? and taken it therein pleading with God to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his word: that is a great means to do great things.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Faith muſt refuſe no means, if there be any means that God doth lay in your way, take them thankefully, uſe them faithfully, diligently, carefully as if there were nothing but means: and when you have uſed them depend upon God above means, as if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means: Idleneſs and preſumption are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to faith: and therefore be faithful in the uſe of means. As it is obſerved, God ſaies he brought the people into Canaan, <hi>by his mighty power and outſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arme</hi>: yet there was a great many valiant Souldiers and a mighty power of the people; ſo that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all means, Faith knows how to give God the glory of his outſtretched arme, knowing that all ſecond cauſes work by the power of the Firſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Let us take heed that what we undertake to do, we do it not with a ſlaviſh ſpirit, meerly haled unto it but look upon every duty as a work of the Goſpel; that that people do meerly in a compulſive way, out of a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſpirit, they will never go through it, but by Faith we are to look upon all duties as works of the Goſpel, not as works of the Covenant of works, but as works of the Covenant of grace, therefore that is obſervable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> In <hi>Zach,</hi> 4. <hi>Where God ſaies moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42455:91"/>
ſhall be made plaine before Zerubbabel,</hi> difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall be taken away, how? at verſ. 7. <hi>At the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the corner ſtones they ſhall crie Grace, Grace,</hi> magnifying the Grace of God, looking higher at the Garace of God, then at all the ſtrength that <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> had, and ſo being carried on in a ſpiritual way, <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, Grace,</hi> that was a means to carry them through difficulties, and to <hi>make them as plains,</hi> for when you go about any great work, when you lay the firſt ſtone in that work crie <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> this is a work that I muſt expect the free Grace of God in for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for acceptance, and for bleſſing and for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying me through all: the more you magnify the grace of God in any work, the more you will be enabled to go through that work.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, You muſt not be diſcouraged by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages that have been before. You have ſet upon a work, and you have carried your ſelfe ſo in it as you have miſcarried, and you think I have ſo miſcarried, and ſinned againſt God, as I muſt never expect Gods help, If I had never miſcarried in that work, I might have had hope, but now having ſo miſcarried in that work, there is little hope: do not reaſon by former miſcarriages: If we now ſet our hearts right to the work, and come and ask wiſdom to be carried through it, though we have miſcarried twenty times before, God will not upbraid us; nor ſay, what doe you come to ask wiſdom to do that work, when as you have ſet upon that work before, and have ſpoiled it, through the pride and ſluggiſhneſs of your hearts? therefore now away; be humbled for miſcarriages before, but be not diſcouraged by any miſcarriages in that work or in any other; yea though we have begun the work and miſcarried at firſt, yet be not diſcouraged, many works have miſcarried at firſt, and yet have come to a glorious iſſue at laſt, eſpecially if miſcarriages be through weakneſs: as <hi>Jacob</hi> though he was ſtrook lame,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42455:91"/>
and the ſinew of his thigh ſhrunk in wraſtling with the Angel, yet he prevailed; ſo though there may be fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that our ſinews may be ſhrunk up, and we be lame in our work, yet there may be a prevailing at laſt, and therefore do not hinder your Faith by being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with former miſcarriages.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Againe take heed of the diſturbance of paſſion in the performance of your work, that which is done in a way of paſſion, and frowardneſs and anger is ſeldom well done, if you have a ſervant, that will allwaies be buſie, and doing of ſomewhat, but do it in an anger, you had better he ſhould do nothing, they are the quiet and meek ſpirits that can carry a work ſweetly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly on: So in any work that God ſets us about, let us go about it with quiet ſpirits, <hi>your ſtrength ſhall be to ſit ſtil, Iſa.</hi> 50.7. Saies the Lord; ſo the great ſtrength of our hearts in the performance of any work, is to ſtand ſtill, and be quiet. <hi>Stand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord, Exod.</hi> 14.13. Not the ſtillneſs that is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to endeavor, but that ſtilneſs that is oppoſed to diſquietneſs, and tumultuouſneſs of our unruly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: you would faine have the ſalvation of the Lord, and help in ſuch and ſuch a work, why did you not ſtand ſtil, you are not in caſe to have the ſalvation of the Lord, ſo long as you are in ſuch a diſturbance: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſcarry in a work this way, as many fooliſhly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people that are in a boat, when the boat toſſes they run up and down in the boat and will not be quiet, and ſo are drowned; whereas if there be any skilful in the boat, they ſay, do but ſit ſtill and you are ſafe enough, but they think they cannot be too haſty to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo run up and down and turne the boat over them; ſo are unruly paſſions of men in their hearts, when they are in any work and apprehend any danger, their paſſions are up, and they think there is a neceſſity for them to be ſtirring, and it is in an unruly way, and ſo they overturne themſelves, I beſeech you obſerve it
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:42455:92"/>
in <hi>Moſes. Moſes</hi> he was to do the great work in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the people from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he was of a very qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſpirit a great way; but he was to go on in the work, and though he was the weakeſt man upon the earth, yet the very thing that did over throw <hi>Moſes</hi> in the work at laſt, that made him to miſcarry for his own part, was the diſturbance of his paſſion, when he came to ſtrike the rock, to get water for the people, for not ſanctifying the name of God, but did it in a paſſion, that was the thing that made him miſcarry, as in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 106.32.33. <hi>They angred him alſo at the waters of ſtrife, ſo that it went ill with Moſes for their ſakes.</hi> So you (may be) have done ſome works, ſo as you have found God ſtrengthning of you, at length you come to a work where (may be) there is more difficulty then before, and there being more difficulty your hearts are diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; take heed you miſcarry not now, it is a ſpecial thing to carry on a hard work well; to go on with quietneſs: diſquiet and paſſion do much hinder; as it was the caſe of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Exodus</hi>; When <hi>Moſes came they could not harken to him, becauſe of the anguiſh of heart; and the greatneſs of their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi>: So to apply it ſpiritually, you are ſenſible of ſome gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vous bondage under ſome corruptions, and you have much anguiſh of ſpirit that you cannot overcome ſuch and ſuch corruptions, but take heed you be not ſo diſturbed in your hearts, as your being in anguiſh under that bondage hinder you from hearkning to the Lord in his word, and conceiving the mind and will of God a right and knowing how to order your ſelves in a right way: it was ſo with them, and truly this is juſt the caſe of many people, becauſe they are ſenſible of the bondage they are in under their corruptions, they are ſo troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and their hearts are in ſuch a toile, and tumult, that they cannot hearken to any thing that ſhould guide themſelves in this work.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Another rule for the ordering of your Faith to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42455:92"/>
help you through difficult works, is to obſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances that one work hath upon another; many ſee a work God would have them to do, and they preſently ſet upon that, and do not obſerve what dependance, this hath upon ſomwhat elſe and ſo miſcarry. Suppoſe a Mariner or ſome other ſhould have a work to go and pull ſuch a cable, ſuch a rope, he goes to the place that is in view to pull that rope, but may be there is ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther line; that holdes it in ſome other place, and they may pull their hearts out, and never pull the thing they would. So many are ſtriving and laboring, and tugging in many duties, but there is ſome ſecret holdfaſt that they obſerve not that thoſe duties have dependance upon, and they can never bring their work to paſs. As one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of the difficulty of getting a heart to go to God in prayer, God knows I have been in prayer &amp; have ſtriven with my ſoul with al my might, as in the preſence of God for to get up my heart; you ſtrive and tug at this and may be you think of ſome promiſe, and exerciſe faith too, but there is ſome corruption that ſeems to be a great way off from this, that this hath dependance upon, which makes this difficult, and you ſhould ſet your faith on work to deliver your ſelves from that, and then it will come off better, as now (may be) you have been ſtriving to get your hearts up to God in prayer, and if you look well to it, it may be the frowardneſs and petriſhneſs, and paſſion of your hearts in your families, with ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or wife, or husband is that which keeps down your heart, when you come into Gods preſence, you ſhould firſt have ſet your faith on work, to have cured that, and if you had cured that, you might have got up your hearts: many ſlip over many corruptions, and look at duties a great way off and they ſtrive, and take pains, but if they had true Chriſtian wiſdome, they ſhould look what difficulty and hinderance lay between them and that dutie, and they ſhould labor to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that And ſo for faith, we cannot beleeve in God
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42455:93"/>
and in the promiſes, may be there lay a ſluggiſh heart in your particular calling, it may be ſo far off, though you think there be but little dependance of Faith in that And ſo in affliction you would faine have your hearts be patient, may be there laie a dead lumpiſhneſs of heart and drowſineſs of ſpirit: and therefore look narrowly to corruption though never ſo far off, and ſet thy heart in general againſt all, one as well as another.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Againe take need of liſtening to temptation: when as you are about any hard work there will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of temptation, what you go through this work? thoſe that have been ſtronger then you have miſcarried, it is a mighty hard work, and you are a poor creature: If it be the work of the Lord, go to it with a naked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart, If I miſcarry ſo it is and do not mind temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: A very obſervable place it is of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in <hi>Nehemi.</hi> 6.3. When he was about the great work of God, the adverſaries ſent as if they would parly with them, and it was for nothing but to hinder his work, but mark what he ſaies. <hi>I am doing a great work, ſo that I cannot come, why ſhould the work ceaſe, whilſt I leave it and come down to you?</hi> ſo do you ſay to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, temptation would faine have you come, reaſon the caſe, but ſay I am about the worke of the Lord, why ſhould the work ceaſe, and I ſpend my time and ſtrength about reaſoning with you?</p>
            <p n="15">15. Another rule for the putting on of your faith may be this: when you are doing any great work God calls you to do. Take heed of perverſe reaſonings, as thus. When God calls me to do any ſervice, I ſhould reaſon; if I were able to do thus and thus I could beleeve but who can beleeve when they have ſuch a heart, ſo unable to do any thing, and ſo unable to overcome any corruption? What a perverſe reaſoning is this? If I could do this I could beleeve, you ſhould reaſon I muſt beleeve, that I may do this: as If one ſhould ſay, if I could do any work I hope I ſhould have ſtrength, you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42455:93"/>
muſt have ſtrength to do your work; or if I were at my journies end I could go; you muſt go to be at your journies end, If I were over Sea I could venture into a Ship, you muſt venture into a Ship that you may come over Sea: And ſo if I could do ſuch a thing I could beleeve how ſhould ſtrength come in but by beleeving? Wilt ſtay beleeving till thou canſt get ſtrength? it is as much as if one ſhould ſay I wil ſtay going into a Ship til I get over Sea, his going into the Ship is a means to get over Sea, and ſo beleeving is the way to get ſtrength: and therefore do not reaſon from thy want of ſtrength to hinder faith but rather reaſon from thy want of ſtrength to further faith.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Again when you go about any work that is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, take heed of any diſorderly working of your heart about that work. The diſorderly work of the heart may be diſcovered in two or three part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>culars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To look at the ſucceſs, it looks at the duty principally, for one to look at the ſucceſs more then at duty, this is a miſcarriage and a hinderance to the work of faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you do look at the ſucceſs, yet do not look at the particular ſucceſs, though Faith do aſſure of the general ſucceſs, it doth not alwaies aſſure of the particular ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, take heed you do not judg of the final ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, by ſome hinderances in the work at firſt, as many becauſe they have not ſucceſs at the beginning, they judg of the final iſſue by that.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Above all take heed of determining before hand that you ſhall have no ſucceſs, I may go about the work but it will never go on, it will never thrive: As a ſervant that is froward will ſay, well I may go about the work, but there will never come no good of it, ſo many will go about the work God ſets them to do, but they determine before hand nothing will come of it This is a ſinful boldneſs, who art thou man or woman,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42455:94"/>
ſhal you be ſo bold with God, may you determine, what Gods way ſhall be? you may ſay, I deſerve that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould come of that I do, but when it comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, it is boldneſs and ſinfulneſs againſt God what ſhould not I determine I that am thus and thus vild, will God ſucceed any work in my hand? you may ſay I that am thus and thus vild deſerve that God ſhould blaſt all that I do, but do not determine that I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overcome this hard heart of mine, and I ſhal never get a patient ſpirit. This is that which the prophet ſpeaks againſt. <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 7.13. <hi>Though I have redeemed them yet they ſpeak lies againſt me,</hi> So though God have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed men, and hath given them mercy, yet they ſpeak lies againſt God, that they ſhall never have ſuch and ſuch a mercy, that they labor for, or when God is in a way of redeeming of you, and ſtirring your hearts for you to ſay there ſhal never be no ſucceſs, nor help, this is to ſpeak lies againſt God; be humbled for that you have been guilty of before, and take heed of determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſucceſs for time to come: for aſſuredly, whatſoever unworthinſs you ſee in your ſelves, yet know it is a temptation of the Devil and a provoking ſin.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Againe it muſt be our care, together with our faith to put on that we do with reſolution and courage; As the Pſalmiſt ſaith in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 310.24. <hi>Be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen your heart.</hi> So when you go to any difficult work, put on your faith with all the reſolution you can, natural reſolution helps much againſt difficulty: It is a notable ſpeech of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eca, the mind of man, gets whatſoever it commands it ſelf, if it will lay a command and charge upon it ſelf it may obtaine it.</hi> That he ſaies concerning naural reſolution, natural reſolution is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty help to overcome difficulty, a man ſhall be able to do more then he thought he could have done, but if this be added with faith, that we can make uſe of our Faith

and then lay a neceſſity on the work; it muſt be done whatſoever I hear, it is the command of God, this is a mighty thing to help forward the work.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Another rule is in all ſervices that God calls you to, look upon your ſelves as Gods inſtruments in Gods hand, and look upon the work as Gods work enjoined by him and done for him, and not your own. I am nothing what is an inſtrument, an axe to the building of an houſe? the work is hard and difficult, it is not mine, but Gods, I am not the principal efficient, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and not in mine own hand, but in Gods and ſuch a weak inſtrument in the hand of a skillful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in his own work may do great things.</p>

As <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, <hi>up and be doing and the Lord be with you.</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.16.

            <p n="20">20. Again let us take heed we do not increaſe the difficulty by our diſorderly carriage, this we are many times guilty of, that when God ſets us about any work and there be ſome hardneſs in it, we make it abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more hard by our untoward carriages: As a man that is fettered, by pulling and haling he pulls the skin off his legs, and by that means makes it harder to beare his fetters then before, the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that went out
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42455:95"/>
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and went to <hi>Canaan</hi> through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it was a hard iourney, but they made it abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harder, by their carriage. From <hi>Egypt</hi> unto the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was but <hi>ſeventy miles,</hi> and to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> but a <hi>hundred miles,</hi> and yet by their ill carriage they made it a buſineſe of fourty yeares: ſo though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are to go through a wilderneſs, &amp; a difficult work, yet through our ill carriage we make it more difficult. Let us take heed we do not make it more difficult really, by our complaints of it; we complaine things are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult when indeed they are not ſo in themſelves, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſluggiſhneſs of mens ſpirits in making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the difficulty of the work.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Againe be not all poring upon the difficulty, and looking at thoſe things that are hard and may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you in the work that God ſet you about, but look at thoſe things that may encourage you alſo, if there be any hardneſs in a work, men are alwaies look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that and they never look upon any ſweet that may incourage them, it is never like that they ſhall goe on; Children if they have a ſore upon the body the finger uſually will be touching of that though it makes the ſore to be worſe, and cauſeth it to be more and more angry, and keeps it from healing: So many if they have any thing that is hard in their work, their thoughts will be upon that. Difficulties in any work are like to bitter pills, that God gives us to take down: But what a childiſh thing were it for any that have pills to take down that are bitter, for them to chew them; no marvel then though they ſpit them out and do not ſwallow them, they ſhould ſwallow them down and not chew them: And ſo when God gives us any bitter pills, we muſt not alwaies be chewing of them in our thoughts but free the command of God, and ſo go on in our work. and labor to ſwallow difficulties as much as we can, we have a notable place for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in <hi>Pſal</hi> 86.4, 5. <hi>Rejoyce the ſoul of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42455:95"/>
for unto thee O Lord do I lift up my ſoul, for thou Lord art good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto al them that cal upon thee.</hi> Thus we apply it; the cauſe why many go ſo drooping in their way, and have no joy and comfort in any of their waies, is becauſe they look downward in the dark, if a man were in the bottom of a deep pit, and alwaies looks down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he could never ſee light; if he would ſee light, he muſt look upward to the Sun: ſo mark the way of <hi>David. Rejoyce the ſoul of thy ſervant, for unto thee O Lord do I lift up my ſoul.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> had let his heart alwaies fall downward he would never had joy in his way, but when he would have joy he lift up his heart, ſo if there be any work that is difficult and your hearts are troubled, would you have that which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce you? lift up your ſoules to God in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging waies that he preſents to you. <hi>For thou Lord art good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy.</hi> Here is a way to get mercy, he lifts up his ſoul and looked upon God as good and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and plenteous in mercy.

            <p n="22">22. Do not make uſe of difficulties in your way to reaſon againſt your work, or to make you out of love with your work, but to reaſon againſt your hearts: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is an hard work, but it is through my wretched ſluggiſh heart, and becauſe I do not make uſe of the means, and abilities that God affords me, many that have leſs means and helps then I, can go through harder works then I, and ſo labor to reaſon againſt your own hearts, and not the work, many when they feel the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42455:96"/>
work, hard reaſon againſt the work: the Lord knows I ſtrive and do what I can, but I have ſo many letts and hinderances, God does not come in with his Grace, to help me, and I can do nothing without God, How comes it to paſs nothing is done? becauſe the work is hard, or becauſe you do not uſe what power God gives to do it withall: now the ſafeſt way is rather to reaſon againſt your ſelves, that you have not done what you can, but you rather put off al the guilt from your ſelves and juſtify your ſelves, and that is all the reaſon why nothing is done, it is becauſe the work is hard, and you have ſo many hinderances, and that God hath not given you his power: but if you look into your own hearts, you will find another reaſon, it is not ſo much the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the work as the ill diſpoſition of your hearts: and that ſhould be your care not to reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the work becauſe it is difficult, but againſt your hearts.</p>
            <p>And to conclude all, this is all I ſay: we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to harden our ſelves by our Faith againſt all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: As unbeleefe is a hardning ſin one way, So faith is a hardning grace another way, unbelief hardens in that which is evil, and faith hardens in that which is good: <hi>Acts,</hi> 19.9. <hi>But when divers were hardned and beleeved not.</hi> They were hardned becauſe they did not beleeve, and faith hath the contrary effect, and wil do as much in that which is good, as unbelief can do in that which is evil: As unbelief wil make a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo hard, as to be as Iron to that which is good, ſo Faith wil make a man as Iron to that which is evil, and therefore the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is compared to <hi>Iron and Steel,</hi> Jer. 15.12. <hi>Shall Iron break the northern Iron and the Steel?</hi> God hath revealed himſelf to him grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and he was hardned by it, now of all graces eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Faith doth make the heart as Iron, for God, as unbelief doth make the heart as Iron to ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: And therefore is the exhortation of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42455:96"/>
Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Ad to your Faith vertue</hi>: the word (<hi>Virtus</hi>) comes from ſtrength becauſe every vertue puts forth ſtrength, ſo it is as much as if he ſhould ſay, ad to your faith ſtrength, put it forth ſtrongly, that it may help you againſt ſtrong difficulties, with a war-like power, vertue hath a power to oppoſe enemies: and ſo ad to your faith vertue. And if we do ſo, know it will be a very honorable thing, it is an honor to God, &amp; honor to us, for us to go through difficult things, it is honor to God: as <hi>Davids</hi> men that endured ſo much that broke through an hoſt for to get him water, it was an honor to him, and ſo for us to do difficult things for God, it is an honor to God, and it is honorable to us, non ſo honorable as thoſe that have gone through difficult works, it will make them honorable to others, as ſome obſerve from that place, in 8. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. <hi>If ſhee be a wal we will build upon her, a palace of Silver.</hi> If ſhee be a wal to ſtand out againſt oppoſition, and temptation, we wil build upon her a palace of Silver, ſhe ſhal be made honorable and glorious: and ſo every Chriſtian if your heart be as a wall, to ſtand out againſt oppoſition and difficulty, and hinderances in the way of God, you ſhall have a pallace of Silver built upon you, you ſhal be honorable in the eyes of God, and all his Saints. And going through difficulty is a mighty ſtrengthening to grace, and the more difficulty any go through, the more Grace is ſtrengthened. As it is a rule of any thing that oppoſeth another, if it do not overcome it, it ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens it, as fire and water, if you caſt ſo much water into fire as the fire can overcome it the fire gathernig ſtrength to overcome the water that oppoſes it, burns the better: So in all oppoſitions: So in ſin: If that a man comes to be oppoſed in his ſinful way by the word, if the word do not overcome his luſt, his luſt grows ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: And ſo in grace, if any luſt or ſin, or temptation, or any thing do come and oppoſe grace or any gracious act, and if they do not overcome grace, but grace overcome

            <p>NOw having finiſhed the point in the <hi>Literal ſenſe,</hi> the going through that hard work which <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſet upon by God, Let us ſpeak a little concerning the <hi>Allegorical Senſe</hi>: Though that be not the thing which is eſpecially intended, yet we know many times the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of Scripture in an Allegorical way: And before I enter upon it, I will name two or three ſcriptures to ſhew a warrant for what I do in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this ſcripture in a way of Allegory.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt doth make uſe of Scripture not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the primary ſenſe, but according to the Metaphorical and Allegorical ſenſe, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.34. <hi>There is no Speech nor Language where their voice is not heard, their line is gone through all the Earth, and their word is to the end of the world.</hi> This is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſpoken of the Sun and the going forth of the Sun in the Heavens: The Heavens, and the motions in the Heavens, and the great teſtification of Gods power therein, are compared to a Language and a voice: And the inſtruments that are to be drawn from them, are gone through the whol Earth. But marke how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes uſe of this in a far different ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>But I ſay, have they not heard? yes verily their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42455:97"/>
ſound went into all the Earth, and their words into the end of the world.</hi> Having reference to this place he doth not go according to the direct primary ſenſe, but he applies it to the preaching of the Goſpel, And the going forth of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>And again in <hi>Math.</hi> 2.15. When Chriſt was carried <hi>into</hi> Egypt <hi>that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet, ſaying, Out of Egypt have I called my Son.</hi> It hath reference to that Propheſie in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. Which is meant of the calling his people out of <hi>Egypt</hi> And there it is applyed to Chriſt, and in that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth not only apply Scripture according to the primary ſenſe, but Allegorically, and Tipically we have liberty alſo to do ſo.</p>
            <p>And now we ſhal ſpeak of this Text in an Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe two waies: And that.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of the bondage we are in by nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, and Sathan as the Iſraelites were in <hi>Egypt</hi> under Pharoah, And as <hi>Moſes</hi> by faith forſook <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo we muſt be delivered out of this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> from this ſpiritual bondage, that we are in by nature, under ſin, and Satan, by Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture compares the power of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> &amp; the bondage that men are in under Antichriſt to Egypt <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. There it is called <hi>ſpiritual Sodom: and ſpiritual Egypt</hi>: And as the Iſraelites by Faith, were delivered from the Bondage they were in, in <hi>Egypt</hi>: So faith does deliver people from the bondage of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Then for the forſaking of Egypt, we are al by nature bondſlaves to Sin and Satan as the Iſraelites were to the Egyptians. And Canaan was a Tipe of Heaven, and the promiſe of God unto them to bring them unto Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, was to ſet out the condition of Gods people how they ſhould be brought to heaven: All Gods waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Iſraelites in this work, were Tipical to ſet out further things that were to be afterward. Therefore by faith this <hi>Egypt</hi> is forſaken, and the ſouls of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42455:98"/>
are carried on to <hi>Canaan,</hi> through the Wilderneſs of this world to heaven by faith, as they were through that Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan</hi>: It muſt be Faith that muſt carry through this difficult work.</p>
            <p>This is the difficult work of all works; the Bondage is the greateſt bondage, And therefore the work is the moſt difficult work that may be. If we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The carnal reaſonings that are in mens hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the work of God in bringing them out of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural eſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the ſelf confidences that are in men being confident of their eſtate, and no way ſenſible of their Bondage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we conſider the vaine hopes that are in the hearts of people concerning Gods mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we conſider the dangerous miſtakes that are in people, miſtaking the way of God, and the way of life, thinking they are in the way of life, when they are in the way of Death.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we conſider the curſed prejudice that men have againſt the way of God naturally.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If we conſider the ſtrong ingagements that men have to keep them from returning.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If we conſider the many luſts that are in the heart, that can never be overpowered, but by an Almighty power.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If we conſider the ſtrong accuſations and Terrors that are in the conſciences of men and Women, when they come to be awakned.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If we conſider the woful Temptations of <hi>Satan</hi> following and daunting the Soul, when it would go from this <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Pharoah</hi> followed the Iſraelites.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If we conſider the wonderful diſcouragements that people have in their own thoughts, when they look into themſelves, and ſee their Diſability to do any thing that is good, any Unability to reſiſt any thing that's Evil.</p>

            <p>There are three works of Faith whereby we come to forſake this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt.</hi>

            <list>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, The diſcovering work, Its Faith that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers clearly and with power the great Miſteries of the Goſpel, the great Work of God, wherein the Glory of the great God appeares in providing ſuch a way, for the Reconciliation of loſt man unto himſelf, ſuch a glorious means of Mediation for the ſatisfying of his Juſtice, and for the making up of the breach that is between man and him. Its Faith and only Faith, that can hold out the excellency and Beauty of God appearing in the Goſpel; And to ſhew fully al that good that God intends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Children of men in this way of Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The diſcovering work of Faith is, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before the Soul not only the Glory and excellency and certainty of the work of Mediation in Chriſt: but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42455:99"/>
it diſcovers unto the Soul the Riches of the freeneſs of the grace of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi>: it is Faith that muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Soul that the way of deliverance comes only from free grace, that God doth Juſtifie the ungodly, that it is nothing in the creature for which God comes to juſtifie.</p>
            <p>Secondly: There is a relying Work of Faith: the Soul having theſe things diſcovered in the Glory and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and reality of them: Faith comes to cloſe with theſe things, and to caſt it ſelf upon this Glorious Rich free Grace of God, and venture its ſelf and all its good upon it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Soul having thus ventured upon the free Grace of God, it makes a ſurrender of its ſelf up unto Chriſt. To unite it ſelf to him: I do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to draw Chriſt to me; to be made mine. But I give up my ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt to be his. In uniting of two things I do not only lay one thing upon another, but joyne the other to that; and ſo in uniting the Soul to Chriſt, there is not only a bringing of Chriſt to the Soul, but a ſurrendring of the Soul to Chriſt: to him in him, to him, and for him, and to be ſatisfied with him; And when Faith comes to diſcover with power, the Glory and reality of the great Miſteries of the Goſpel, enabling it to caſt and rowle it ſelf, for all its good upon this way and ſurrender its ſelf up to Chriſt to be wholly his, here is the work of Faith that delivers from this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But may not natural Conſcience help men through much difficulty in the way of deliverance from this ſpiritual</hi> Egypt? <hi>Many come to ſee their bondage by ſin, and ſeeme to be delivered, and may be it is only the ſtrength of Natural Conſcience, and not Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is acknowledged that natural Conſcience may in a great degree deliver men from ſome hind of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42455:100"/>
bondage under ſin, and may deliver from a great deal of the power of their ſin, but you ſhall obſerve the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Natural conſcience may help men to abſtaine from ſin, and ſet upon many duties, that it may ſeem they are delivered from this bondage, but whatſoever they abſtaine from, and whatſoever duties they do, It is rather becauſe conſcience urgeth the neceſſity of it upon them, then any inward principle to approve, and like of the duties they performe, or to diſlike and diſapprove of the ſin they abſtaine from, they are forced out of <hi>Egypt</hi>: But Faith it doth not make men only abſtain from ſin, but is gives them a principle to make againſt ſin; and it doth not only perform duty, but the heartt is for that duty, and there is an agreeableneſs, and ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the heart unto that duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Where it is only naturall conſcience, that carries through many ſtreights, it doth enable to do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, and abſtaine from outward things, but there is but little inward change of the heart, it may keep them from ſome actions, they dare not commit ſuch and ſuch ſins, no not in ſecret, though none in the world know it, but there is not an inward change in the heart.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Where it is a natural conſcience Grace is deſired for peace ſake, where it is of grace the ſoul deſires peace for the furtherance of Grace.</p>

               <p>To apply this a little.</p>
               <p>Is it Faith that delivers from this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi>: Hence let us ſee the ground of the Miſcarriages of moſt people in their deliverances from ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi>: Many people by the word, by the Miniſtry of the Law, they come to ſee their bondage, and woful wretched eſtate, &amp; their conſciences are much troubled, but they miſcarry
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42455:100"/>
and it appears in the end that they were never delivered from the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but they lived, and died, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and periſhed Eternally. They were come neer to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet they periſhed, and never come to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> becauſe it is not Faith that delivered them, they were not acquainted with the miſtery of the Goſpel, and the covenant of Grace: they muſt abſtain from Sin, be no more drunkards, and Swearers, and Adulterers, and Sabbath breakers: They abſtaine from them, and their Religion is a meer natural work, and there they quiet themſelves, and think they are delivered: But the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work of God in Faith, is not mighty and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon their hearts carrying their hearts to God in Chriſt in the way of the Goſpel, and diſcovering the miſteries of the Goſpel: and therefore they are not delivered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence is a rule of direction to ſuch as are about being delivered from this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt.</hi> Are there any ſuch, that God hath made ſenſible of their woful bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and wouldeſt thou deliver thy ſoul from that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bondage? is it thy worke that thou art now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? If any thing do it, it muſt be the work of Faith. Thou maieſt get ſome quiet and eaſe by ſome other means, but for deliverance you can never get it but by Faith: Therefore do not content thy ſelf with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that its better with thee then it hath been; never reſt till thou haſt got the work of Faith: and for the incouragement of ſuch a ſoul to beleeve that it may be delivered by Faith from that bondage, it is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and which it is now about. Know,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If thou beeſt ſenſible of thy ſpiritual bondage, know it is the great work that God hath ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above al the works of the world, to deliver ſouls from this ſpirituall bondage: Many that are ſenſible of their ſpiritual bondage ſay, I <hi>am in ſuch a condition, and will God ever regard me in this eſtate?</hi> will he regard thee? yes, know that the greateſt thing that Gods
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42455:101"/>
heart is upon, as the higheſt thing that he wil do, is upon thoſe that are ſenſible of their ſpiritual bondage of this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> to deliver them? And though thou art not ſure he wil do it for thee, yet this is a great incouragement.</p>
               <p>Object, <hi>But though he may do it for others yet I am ſo vile, that though I have ſeen my ſin, I have ſtil gone on, therefore he wil not do it for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Wherefore know in the ſecond place that the great deſigne that God hath in this work, is not only to manifeſt his power, but to ſet out before men, and Angels, to all eternity, the Riches and Glory of his free Grace. And therefore thoſe objections of thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinſs may be taken away: for thou maieſt ſee God doth not intend to goe on with thee in a way of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſtributive Juſtice, if thou doſt ſo, and ſo and ſo, he wil do ſo, and ſo for thee, but he goes this way to work: that his great deſigne is to magnify his free Grace, And whoſoever he does deliver, it is for this end, to ſhew to men and Angels, what the power of his infinite free Grace is able to do; and this is a great Incouragement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath already removed all differences that are between God the Father, and thy ſoul: the difficulties which make ſuch a mighty vaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal diſtance between God and thy ſoul, is the wrath of God, and the juſtice of God and the curſe of the Law: Now it hath been the work of Chriſt to take away all theſe difficulties: So that when thou lookeſt up and ſeeſt thy ſin againſt an infinite God, that is, infinitely holy, and infinitely juſt, and ſeeſt the curſe of the Law againſt thee; thou thinkeſt theſe are great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, how is it poſſible for me to get over theſe: know it is the work of Chriſt that great Savior of the world, to remove thoſe difficulties, and if he had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, it had been impoſſible for any ſoul to come to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42455:101"/>
God, But he hath done it and therefore thou haſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to come to God; if thou haſt but an heart to venture upon his free Grace, if thou ſaieſt, how can I know, that Chriſt hath removed theſe difficulties for me? Its the work of Faith that gives thee an intereſt. And therefore do not ſtay for any thing elſe: If thou doeſt but venture upon Faith, thou needeſt not take care as thoſe Women did, <hi>who ſhall roule away the ſtone.</hi> Who ſhall remove the difficulties of the curſe of the Law? who ſhall pacifie the wrath of God that is burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me for my ſin? If thou doeſt beleeve Chriſt hath done it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt hath not only removed the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties between God the Father, and thy ſoul; but there are many gracious promiſes in the Goſpel (for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of all difficulties in thy ſoul) that thou haſt as much right to lay claime to, as any one in the world that ever was delivered by Chriſt: Whatſoever ground any had to claime theſe promiſes, before the applying of them, thou haſt the ſame ground; the great hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that is in thee is an hard heart, a ſtout ſtubborne ſpirit: marke what is ſaid; <hi>that there ſhall be a way prepared for the Lord: Make his way ſtrait, every high Mountain ſhal be brought low, every valley ſhal be filled up, every crooked way ſhall be made ſtrait, every rough way ſhall be made plaine. Luke,</hi> 3.4.5.6. Now who hath right to laie hold on theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, this applying of them doth give intereſt: doeſt thou find thy heart proud and canſt not pul it down? ſaies the Lord <hi>every high mountaine ſhal be caſt down</hi> doſt thou ſay I have an unbeleeving heart, I know not how to beleeve Gods word, but my heart ſinks down in unbeliefe, that is as a valley dejected? <hi>Every vally ſhal be filled up.</hi> I have a perverſe crooked heart? every cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked way ſhall be made ſtrait. I have a rough knotty heart? every rough heart, <hi>Every rough way ſhall be made plaine</hi>: So that Chriſt hath not only made things
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42455:102"/>
cleer between God and thee but in thy own Soul.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But he doth not make it clear for all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt as much ground to beleeve as any had before they did beleeve, <hi>I will take away thy ſtrong Heart ſaith God</hi>; This is revealed to all, and therefore thou art to make uſe of them; And whoſoever did get good by them, they could not ſee any intereſt they had to them, more then thou canſt ſee.</p>

               <p>A Third uſe is this, If Faith be that which does deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi>: Then thoſe that are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, let them ſee what hath brought them out; and magnifie the work of God; let them ſtand and admire the Grace of God in delivering them from al difficulties, and in carrying them through, that were ſo poor and weak as they were: know it was not thy endeavor but the work of Faith, and the work of God in thee. Faith workes by a power out of us, and not by our own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; And God delivers the Soul from this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> by Faith, Becauſe he would have the Glory of it. Therefore now if it have been a work of Faith, let this Exhortation prevail with you: Labor to exerciſe your Faith in going through the Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan.</hi> There was a time you were in bondage under ſin and <hi>Satan</hi> and the Law; And now thou art delivered from the Law, and brought to Grace: Is it Faith hath done it? Let this Faith be imployed to carry thee on through the wilderneſs unto <hi>Canaan</hi>: And all the Rules that I will give unto you, ſhall be from the People of Iſraels going through the wilderneſs unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> when they were delivered from <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, When they were delivered, this was a great Evil, their Murmuring becauſe of the hardſhips they met withal: take heed thou beeſt not guilty of this: Let not thy heart run out too far, to murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the waies of God, when you meet with any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips: being God with his outſtretched Arm, and his mighty hand hath delivered thee, God forbid thou ſhouldeſt be murmuring upon every difficulty.</p>

So many, when God is in the way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his grace, they are ready to think what they had formerly, and they were not ſo ſtrictly bound before, &amp; they have ſome hankerings of heart after former luſts: And though thou dareſt not conclude I wil go and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch and ſuch ſins, I ſay though thou doeſt not conclude, yet thy heart and thoughts have ſome hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after them; take heed of that.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42455:105"/>
ſenſe, the cheif ſeat of Antichriſt is <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>ſpiritually Chriſt is crucified there,</hi> There is no place in which Chriſt is more crucified then in <hi>Rome,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his members. Beſides if you wil ſpeak of Chriſts being crucified literally, it may be ſaid likewiſe of <hi>Rmoe,</hi> becauſe he was crucified by the Roman power, &amp; Roman Authority: But by comparing this place with other places in Revelation, it muſt be meant, that in that place <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>: I might ſpend much time in making Compariſons between the moſt abominable wickedneſſes that were in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that are in that place.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is like <hi>Egypt,</hi> in regard of the moſt groſs Idolatries, Of all places <hi>Egypt</hi> was counted the moſt groſs Idolatrous place. They did not only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Sun, Moon, &amp; Stars, as other nations did, but Cats and Onions, and any baſe creatures: So the Papiſts wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtocks, and ſtones, and all kind of holy Reliques, even the haire that came from the taile of that beaſt that Chriſt rode on; and moſt baſe, vile things, that are too baſe to abuſe an Auditory to rehearſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is compared to <hi>Egypt</hi> in reſpect of the cruelty of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> None were ſo cruel and vild as <hi>Egypt</hi>: And ſo of all men thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Antichriſt</hi> are more cruel, as if they were Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers came from hell to ſhew the power of Malignant ſpirits: and therefore they are ſaid, to <hi>be drunken with blood, and ſo have their clothes died in ſcarlet with the blood of the Saints. Rev.</hi> 17.4.5.6. But the chiefe thing I aime at is to ſhew the bondage Chriſtians are in under antichriſt, &amp; the work of faith in delivering from it.</p>

Many crie out of the Godly that they are no good ſubjects, they do not love to be under government, but what do you think of Papiſts, that do teach for to free ſubjects from their loyalty: A Papiſt hath this expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion concerning Antichriſt, The <hi>Pope</hi> their head, <hi>He is the Sheppard, and the Kings and Princes are Dogs, and if Dogs will do their duty, they muſt be at their Maſters command, but if they will be lazey, and bite and not do as they ought, the ſheppard muſt remove them.</hi> And for their Eſtates: Its a woful eſtate that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are in, in regard of their eſtates. I read a ſpeech of <hi>Bonner,</hi> in a preface to the Treatiſe of Gardener; that <hi>the Pope had neere as much out of England yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Revenues of the Crown came to.</hi> And it was the ſpeech of <hi>Innocent the fourth Pope of that name England was his pleaſant Garden and a wel that never was drawn dry and in England many things grew, &amp; abounded and many things were to be had from it</hi>: So that the eſtates of men are in great bondage where Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt prevails: as alſo, the lives, and liberties of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But eſpecially, the thing which I will a little ſtick in, is the ſoul bondage, thus we have it in <hi>Rve.</hi> 18.13. <hi>The Merchandiſe was ſlaves, and ſouls of men.</hi> So that men that are under Antichriſt are ſlaves, and if there were but a true Heroicall ſpirit in men, they would not ſuffer themſelves to be under that ſlavery: though they ſeem to be the braveſt ſpirits, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Antichriſt they are ſlaves: And the ſouls of men are his Merchandiſe: the ſouls of men are under bondage.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This is a baſe ſubjection and ſlavery of the ſouls of men under Antichriſt, in that he takes upon him to make Articles of Faith: that they are bound in conſcience, upon paine of Damnation to beleive, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhal ſay in his Chaire is infallible: what a baſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42455:106"/>
bondage is this? When as we know what moſt Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, Sodomitical, Horrible Monſters have been in that Chaire, and yet they ſhall be bound upon paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to beleeve, whatſoever they ſay is infallible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whatſoever his decrees are (though having no footing in the word) they are bound in conſcience to obey upon paine of damnation: So that if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obey all Gods Commandements, they may be damned for want of obedience, to ſome one of Antichriſts comands, which muſt needs be a miſerable bondage for any man to make a new command, that is not under the command of God, and to make damnation to be the puniſhment of diſobedience to it, then men are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Damnation a hundred of waies more then for ſinning againſt Gods Law.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thoſe that are under Antichriſt are under great bondage in being kept from the rule of life, from the Scriptures, Wherein the counſels of Gods will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Eternal Eſtate are revealed: Thoſe that are ſlaves are kept in dangers, and cannot have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of ſubjects, or of Children: So Antichriſt keeps all under him in the moſt baſe ſlavery, in depriving of them from this priviledg of Children, that they cannot know the mind of their Fathers, and the great things of God, that concerns their Eternal Eſtate; what man that knows any thing of thoſe great things concerning his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſtate, would be under that ſlavery? And yet if ſo be we had continued under the bondage of Antichriſt, we muſt have been deprived of this.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If they hear any thing of the word, they are bound to take no other interpretation, but the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Preiſts give them, though it be never ſo groſs, now to bind mens Conſciencs to this, is a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binable Bondage, And yet what vile Interpretations? If it is Blaſphemy for the Devil to ſay, he will aſcend and be like the higheſt, no leſs to make God deſcend to be like the Prince of darkneſs, to ſet the Kings ſtamp
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42455:106"/>
upon falſe coyne, Now to bind mens conſciences to their wicked interpretations of Scripture, this is a moſt abominable bondage.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is a great bondage that no Ordinance can be adminiſtred but by the power of Antichriſt, and thoſe he ſhall give power unto; and this is a great bondage to the Church to be ſtinted in Gods Ordinances: They are the Churches priviledges, eſpecially that of Prayer the ſpirit of Prayer and Supplication, is one of the eſpecial Priviledges of the Church. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe you are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts crying</hi> Abba <hi>Father.</hi> There he ſpeakes of the liberty of Gods people as they are ſons, &amp; they have the fruit of their ſon-ſhip: Now when as God doth give his ſpirit to his Church as part of their liberty; for them to be reſtrained in their liberty to pray juſt no more then the Pope ſhal appoint, and ſo to have no Ordinances but according to his power; what abominable bondage is this, and what heart that knows any true Chriſtian liberty, would be in ſuch a bondage.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He takes upon him power of abſolving and binding, keeping men under the guilt of ſin, and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from it when he pleaſes. from this power over mens conſciences, is commited all manner of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Bondage which is greater then all, is that he keeps men under the rigor and curſe of the Law by keeping men off from Chriſt, and teaching the doctrin of juſtification to be by the works of the Law, he keeps them under the bondage of the law, and under the rigour and curſe of the Law, and ſo keeps al that are under him from that precious liberty that Chriſt hath purchaſed by his blood to deliver us from the Law: And this is a greater burden then the other, this is a damnable bondage that doth indanger eternal deſtruction; the other is not ſo dangerous.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:42455:107"/>8. He takes away al Chriſtian liberty in regard of the uſe of the Creature, reſtraining the uſe of the Creature, and Time, and Place.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ninth is the bondage of human Ceremonies; we know that is a heavy bondage: The bondage of the Ceremonies of the Law was great. And the Apoſtle ſaid <hi>Acts,</hi> 15.10. It was a <hi>Yoke, that neither they nor their Fathers could beare.</hi> But the yoak of the Papiſts is a great deale heavier. If we were to chuſe to to be under al the Ceremonies of the Law, which the Jews were under, which the Apoſtle ſaid was a yoak that we nor our Fathers were able to beare, or to be under the Ceremonies of the Papiſts, if we did chooſe according to wiſdom, we ſhould rather chuſe to be under al the Ceremonies of the Jews: Yet if we read the 4. of <hi>Gal.</hi> we ſhal ſee it was a great priviledg to be delivered from them. And if we were under the power of any to appoint religious Ceremonies in the Church. We have no benefit by the purchaſe of Chriſt to deliver us from the Ceremonial Law, for it is a great deale bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and eaſier to be under the Ceremonies of the Law then to have any man appoint Ceremonies; in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Ceremony of the Law was by divine inſtitution: but when man appoints Ceremonies they are but human, and any man had rather yield and be under the power of Gods appointing Ceremonies, then be under the power of men: You had rather be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Princes then under meane Officers; ſo you had better be under the power of God, then under the power of man; yet in the 2. <hi>Col.</hi> they are called <hi>Beggerly rudiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a great deale of doubt and ſcruple about the Ceremonies of men: Suppoſe that upon ſome diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we may yield to human Ceremonies, yet it is not without doubt and ſcruple, but under the Law there was no doubt nor ſcruple, and we had better be under
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42455:107"/>
a hundred where there is no ſcruple, then under one where there is doubts and ſcruples.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Againe, Thoſe Ceremonies were typicall, and the preſence of God might be with them, and a ſpirituall efficacie might be expected; but as for the Ceremonies of men, there can be no ſuch thing expected with them, and therefore it is apparent that the Jews under the Ceremonies of the Law were in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then the Chriſtians ſhould be in now, if they were under the power of any to appoint Ceremonies, and therefore to be under the power of thoſe that do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Ceremonies, that is a miſerable bondage.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Again another bondage that they are in is, that they are urged to the waies of Idolatry, and ſin by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, without regarding the weakneſs of any, or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to inform any, not regarding that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4. When God complaines, <hi>they did Rule his people with Cruelty</hi>: And if any be weak and deſire to be informed they jeer at them, and ſay a priſon, or a fire, or a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, ſhall inform them. Theſe and many other things might be named, to ſhew the moſt abominable and vilde bondage that thoſe are in that are under Antichriſt; but put both together the outward and the inward bondage, to be under thoſe that are of ſuch baſe and vile ſpirits this is mightily againſt the ſpirit of an ingenious man: And for a Church of God, a thouſand Congregations, to be under the power of a baſe, filthy abominable, Whoremaſter, that is known to be ſo, to be troubled by him when he pleaſe, what a moſt horrible bondage is this? And ſo for any Congregation to be, in which there may be thouſands of Souls, to be under the power of a Tapſter, or Hoſtler, or any baſe fellow, this is a mighty bondage: As now ſuppoſe a rich man die, and he hath a Kinſman, though never ſo vile and baſe, then his land coming to him he hath the Advowzen of the place, then may be he ſends two or three hundred miles for a Preiſt, may be one like himſelf, and though he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42455:108"/>
be never ſuch a blaſphe men, and baſe fellow and ſwearer, then they not knowing of him, and ſo having nothing to ſay againſt him, They cannot keep him from the place; Now that one though never ſo wild, ſhould have ſuch power, to appoint whom he will, any drunkard, Where maſter Prieſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a Congregation, and they muſt depend upon him, to have the Ordinances of God adminiſtred by him this is a ſore bondage. Bondſlaves are fed meerly with Chaffe and brunn, ſo with what chaffe and husks are thoſe fed withal that are under Antichriſt: Many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are loath to ſubmit to the true government of Chriſt, to the true Miniſters of the Goſpel; if they tell them of any ſin they are guilty of, their hearts belk and ſwel, and they will not yeild, yet they will ſubmit to the officers of Antichrſt, and they wil rule over them and do with them what they will. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <hi>For ye ſuffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devoure you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himſelf, if a man ſmite you on the face.</hi> Other falſe teachers you can ſuffer, But the true Apoſtles you cannot ſuffer them, <hi>if one come in his own name, you receive them, I come in my Fathers name, and you reject me ſaies Chriſt. John,</hi> 5.43. And ſo many complain of the Miniſters of God, they take ſo much upon them, &amp; they wil not yield to that they ſay, but if you live under Popery you muſt live under every baſe preiſt, and what he ſaies you muſt believe as your Faith, &amp; venture your ſouls upon it, without examining of it, and you muſt not manifeſt any rejection: So that is apparent men wil yeild to any things rather then to God, rather count the ſubjection to God bondage, then count the ſubjection to Antichriſt bondage, rather be ſervants to Antichrſt, then ſervants to God. I ſpeak this the rather, to ſee what cauſe we have to bleſs God for our deliverance from this: And that we may learn to know how to uſe our liberties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:42455:108"/>This Bondage is worſe then the bondage of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is ſoul bondage, and that was but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body, we do not read that <hi>Pharoah</hi> or the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians did force them to Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was not ſo great bodily bondage, they did not deſtroy them, they laid heavy burdens upon them, but did not put them to death, as Antichriſt doth, if they wil not ſubmit unto them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was their miſery to be under that bondage but not their ſin: but it is a ſin to be under the bondage of Antichriſt, look how much difference there is between miſery and ſin, ſo much difference there is betwixt their bondage, and the bondage of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They were Liable to the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but they were not liable to the plagues of <hi>Egypt:</hi> They were free from them, but thoſe that are under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Antichriſt are liable to the plagues that ſhall come upon Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be faith that muſt deliver from this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, It is a difficult work, as it was a difficult thing to be delivered from <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo it is a difficult thing (that cannot be done without faith) to be delivered from this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee know moſt part of the Chriſtian world is educated, and the principles that are dropt into them from them are Antichriſtian principles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though it be a bondage, there is a great deale of outward pomp and Glory in their Idolatrous worſhip, that does much take ſenſual people, that doe live by ſence; they will not worſhip God in ſuch a meane way as others do, but there is a great deale of pompe and outward ſhew.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though it be a bondage to the ſoul yet they give abundance of liberty to the fleſh, and though ſomtimes they ſuffer pennance, and put the fleſh to ſome hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſomtimes, yet thoſe that are rich may give way to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42455:109"/>
their luſts, and live as they liſt, for they may quickly be freed with a little mony.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beſides there are ſo many examples of great men, and learned men, and ſome that are Godly, that doe yeild to a great part of the yoaks, and their examples are mighty ingagements.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides, If ſo be they begin to flinch, preſently there are ſuch violent afflictions and perſecutions; thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring out of excomunications, and loſs of eſtates, and ſo many dangers that men are in.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Beſides, It is hard, Becauſe in the other of Chriſts government there are but a few meane men, and to come and yeild to them this is hard to fleſh and blood, and there muſt be a great deal of ſelf deniall to yeild to the government of Chriſt, they count that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt bondage, eſpecially conſidering there may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, &amp; many Scandals amongſt thoſe that are God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; do profeſs the waies, and ordinances, and liberties of Chriſt, that except the heart be gracious there is a great deal of difficulty in ſubmitting to it, and people know not what to do but rather buckle under their bondage.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Beſides: It is a fruit of the curſe: not that all that are under that bondage are under the Eternal Curſe; But as all outward judgments are part of the curſe, ſo it is a part of the curſe to be under the bondage of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and not to labor to get from it. I do not ſay that al that are ſick and weak are curſed, but it is a part of the curſe; So men that are under that bondage, are under part of the curſe, that <hi>God wil give them over to beleeve Lyes</hi>: and though a man hath never ſo much Learning and underſtanding, yet if there be a curſe of God upon it, never talk of his learning and underſtanding, if his parts were a hundred times more, they could not help him: It is the work of Faith to deliver from it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the work of Faith in delivering people from this bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:42455:109"/>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There are theſe ſix or ſeven things, that delivers from this bondage under Antichriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Faith diſcovers unto the ſoul the ſpiritualneſs of the government of Chriſt, and without that there cannot be a true deliverance from the bondage of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith ſhews unto the Soul the fullneſs of the Adminiſtration of all Chriſts offices, of his Preiſtly, Prophetical call, and Kingly offices: Now until the ſoul underſtands this, it is never brought off from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antichriſt to the government of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faith ſhews the fulneſs and Glory that is in the world, which is the rule for ordering and guiding of us in al our waies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Faith ſhews the neceſſity of a divine rule, for a ſpiritual efficacy, and that no humane invention can cauſe a ſpiritual efficacy: now the ſettling of this principle is never done but by Faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another work of faith is to diſcover the beauty and glory that is in the Ordinances of Chriſt barely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred: no man but by the eye of Faith can ſee the true luſtre, and beauty, and glory, of a divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, except there be ſome outward earthly excellency mingled with it: As I told you in the expoſition of that place in <hi>Hoſea, They made them Altars,</hi> God would have an Altar of Earth, and if they would have it of Stone, they muſt not lift up an inſtrument to hew it, and grave it, but it muſt be plaine. Now a carnal eye cannot ſee the beauty of Gods Ordinances, unleſs it have ſome outward excellency. It muſt be the eye of Faith, to diſcover the beauty of Chriſts Ordinances, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked beauty of them: And till that they are not willing to come from under the power of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Faith diſcovers to the Soul the reality, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all the admirable and glorious promiſes that are in the Goſpel, made unto the true Church of God: Promiſes of the glorious preſence of God with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42455:110"/>
and promiſes of abundance of ſpiritual good, as it might ask half an hour to ſhew ſome excellent promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are made to the Church, which a carnal Eie doth not ſee: But Faith diſcovers there is abundance of certainty and reality in them, and when by Faith they ſee them, this takes off, and enables them to go through any difficulties to be partakers of them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Again, Faith does diſcover the fearful threats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that follow Antichriſt, and thoſe <hi>(Revel.</hi> 14.9, 10.) that <hi>do receive the mark of the Beaſt but in their hand ſecretly: they ſhall have their portion in the Lake that burns for ever, and ſhall be caſt out from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> They that read theſe threats make nothing of them; but when they read them by Faith then the ſoul trembles, and feares, till it comes from under that bondage, it hears a voice continually crying to it: <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out from among them Oh my people, come out, leaſt being partaker of their ſin, you alſo be partakers of their Plagues</hi>: Now Faith by diſcovering theſe things brings the heart from under that Antichriſtian bondage.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But may not men reject the yoake of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt upon other Grounds beſides Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many times a ſpirit of contradiction may bring them from under the yoke of Antichriſt, though one good cannot be oppoſite to another good, yet one evil may be oppoſite to another evil, and many men may oppoſe the government of Antichriſt by that which is evil in them, but if it be not by the principle of Faith it is not right, and it may be upon other principles.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall we know that we do forſake this bondage from Antichriſt by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will give you ſome notes to ſhew you who
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42455:110"/>
thoſe are that are delivered from this <hi>Egypt</hi> by Faith. And who thoſe are that ſeem to be delivered upon other grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are delivered by Faith are thoſe that are wel grounded in the Doctrinal and maine points of Religion: Faith can never work off the ſoul from the Government and Ceremonies of Antichriſt, unleſs it be well grounded in the doctrine and principles of Religion if I ſee men crie out of Antichriſt, and of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antichriſt, and it appears that they have not a competent meaſure of knowledg in the grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Principles of Faith, they are to be ſuſpected: As many: come and examine them about Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and they wil tell you a great deale (not but that Chriſtians ſhould labor to have knowledg in that) but come to examine them the Principles of Religion, and there they are ſilly and ignorant: if they be not grounded in them it appears it is not a work of Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be a work of Faith, it is a work of much Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and Prayer; was there a time you were under the power and bondage of Antichriſt? how came you from under it? did God ſhew you the evil of it? and you ſought God in much Humiliation and prayer, for the taking off your hearts from it, and ſhewing you his good way and did you find your hearts comming off, was by that meanes, that is a good argument it was of Faith; but many their Conſciences tell them, it was not a work of Humiliation and Prayer that brought off their hearts, they are to be feared.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be a work of Faith it alwaies lets in light: as in the point of the government of Chriſt; many cry out againſt Antichriſtian government: and come and examine them about it, and they have no more light, no other arguments, nor further underſtanding then before but only a bitterneſs of ſpirit againſt it: If a man grow bitter againſt thoſe things which before he yeilded too,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42455:111"/>
he had need have more light, but if they grow exceeding bitter againſt them and have no further light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding then before, it is an argument it is a diſtemper of heart, rather then any thing elſe. And therefore caſting off all at once is very ſuſpitious; where it is of Faith God lets in light by degrees. Its ſaid of <hi>Luther</hi> in his reformation, Firſt he ſaw the evil of one thing, and then the evil of another, and ſo by degrees ſaw the evil of all: And ſo thoſe that forſake the bondage of Antichriſt. By Faith, firſt God makes them ſuſpect their way, ſurely this is not the right way, there is ſome better way, and then they fall a praying and humbling of themſelves, and they fall examining, and ſo they come to ſee the evil of one thing, and then they exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine another, and ſo light comes in by degrees, and then their hearts riſe againſt them, and if according to the meaſure of Light that you have, your hearts do come off, that is a good ſigne.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you break from Antichriſt by Faith, it will make you a Separate from the world aswel as Separate from them: Many are Separates from any thing that hath but the leaſt dependancy upon Antichriſtian government but they conform themſelves to the world, that there appears no difference between them and the world, in their looſe courſes: that man that is a conformiſt to the world, is not a Non-Conformiſt to Antichriſt by Faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If Faith take you off from the bondage under Antichriſt it wil take you off from the bondage under any luſt. That man that hath not the power of Faith, to take him off from any Luſt, That man is not by Faith taken off from the bondage of Antichriſt. If Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livere from the bondage under Antichriſt, it will deliver from the bondage under Sin, and Sathan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though men do crie out of the bondage of Antichriſt never ſo much, and yet they go on under the bondage of any Luſt, it is not of Faith.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:42455:111"/>6. That Soul that is taken from under the power of Antichriſt by Faith, is ſubject to the power and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt and the Word: If Faith takes from the one, it puts under the other: nothing but the Word can be the ground of Faith, and if Faith takes a Soul from under the bondage of Antichriſt, Such a Soul finds the Word comes with divine power, and majeſty upon the heart; and it laies a trembling heart under the power and majeſty of the Word, and it dares not goe from it, no not in no other thing. You plead for the Word in ſuch and ſuch things, but there are other things you do not yield to the power of the Word in, this is very ſuſpitious: Thoſe that by Faith are brought from the power of Antichriſt, their hearts are put mightily under the power of the Word, and they ly with trembling ſpirits before the majeſty and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the word.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If it be Faith that takes off the Heart, ſuch a one is not content that he is taken from under the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian government, unleſs he meetes with Chriſt in the Ordinances: he does not content it ſelf with the bare huskes, and to make all his Religion to conſiſt meerly in Church diſcipline, and Church conſtitution, and to think therefore, he hath Religion enough, becauſe he hath the Ordinances, and yet never finds any panting of Heart, after union and communion with Chriſt Jeſus in this way of Church Government, but goes on from year to year, mearly in the outward performances of Religion. I do not ſpeak againſt the thing it ſelf but to ſhew it is not of Faith, if men do not pant after uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, if they be not ſenſible of the want of it, and do not labor for the enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If it be Faith that brings thee from this way, certainly thou wilt grow more Spirituall: As thy heart will pant after Chriſt; ſo there wil be a Spiritualneſs of thy Soul in the waies of Chriſt, becauſe thou comeſt neerer to the rule: And this is the difference between
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42455:112"/>
Actions of Religion, and civil Actions; civil Actions that are done by civil rule have not alwaies ſucceſs, but a Spirituall Action that is done by the rule, that hath a Spirituall ſucceſs, though not an outward ſucceſs, it does make the heart ever more Spirituall: But for people though they be come from the yoake of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, yet to be as dead as ever no more Spiritualneſs in their way then before, no more ſavour of Godlineſs in their ſociety and company then before: thoſe that knew them before can ſay; I knew them a great deale more ſpirituall and ſavoury in that which is good then they are now, This is a dangerous thing.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Againe, If it be out of Faith, ſuch a one will give all the glory unto God for his deliverance, and he wil walk humbly in his own eyes, and think, I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and wretched and ſhould have gone on in that way, but God by his grace and power hath come, and hath taken off my heart, and it does magnifie the grace of God; It doth not perke up it ſelf, and contemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to think I have got more wiſdom, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding then others, and ſo attribute it to his wit, and underſtanding; but it gives the glory to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of cenſuring others, he prays for them, and ſaies it is not all the arguments under Heaven can convince them, for I had arguments enough, but they were all as nothing, til it pleaſed God by his Grace to ſet them upon my heart, and ſo though they may ſee arguments as wel as I, they will not do: Therefore he pitties o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and prays for them; and he hath a reverent reſpect to the Grace of others, though they be not in the ſame way that he is in, &amp; he doth not preſently caſt them off ſaying, ſurely there is no Grace, and Godlineſs in them, this is a ſigne of a proud ſpirit; there are none that are gracious but know there was a time when they went on in that way, and yet they did not goe againſt their light, but were willing to underſtand Gods mind, and yet til God came in, their hearts were not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42455:112"/>
taken off: and therefore they learn to have good thoughts of thoſe that are godly, though in other waies.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially, if it were out of Faith that you were brought from this Antichriſtian Bondage, it will not leave in thee the Spirit of Antichriſt: many are far from being under Antichriſtian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and yet have an Antichriſtian Spirit, a Spirit of pride, a domineering Spirit, a Crooked, Perverſe Spirit: and this is a great evil, that in the way of Chriſt, there ſhould be manifeſted an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Spirit: this ſhould be lamented with tears of blood. Now ſo much as an Antichriſtian ſpirit does rule in any, though they be from under his Goverment, ſo much it is to be ſuſpected, it was not the work of Faith, but ſomwhat elſe that took them off. We ſhould have the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſpirit of Love, and Humillity, and gentleneſs, and peace, and as we would make it appear, we are taken off from the yoak of Antichriſt by Faith let us ſhew the Spirit of Chriſt, as Faith hath taken us off from Antichriſtian power, ſo we ſhould exerciſe Faith to go on in the waies of Chriſt, as beſeems thoſe that are delivered from Antichriſtian power.</p>
