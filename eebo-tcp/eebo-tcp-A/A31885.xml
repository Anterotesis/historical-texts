         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

strives to confound, and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to subvert. This Hell-nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
malice has been entertained
in the hearts of some malignant,
and ill-affected Members to the
Church, and in their inveterate spleene they have
endeavoured to eradicate that <hi>Basis</hi> or firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of faith, which was laid in Christ by zealous
Divines. I need not speake too obscurely, for my
meaning includes the Bishops, who have envyed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62418:3"/>
the prosperity of Religion a long time, and have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
aboured to supplant the same by preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
introducement of Popery, Ceremoniall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
and Canonicall innovations. And who
soever that was zealous for the truth, and did in any
manner oppose them in their Prelaticall instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was either prosecuted by them in the extreame
severity of justice, (and that sometimes extended
too beyond its limits) or else suspended by them
<hi>tam ab officio, quàm ábeneficio.</hi> Thus they tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
insulted over the Church, and without any let
or contradiction usurped, whatsoever pleased them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
best. They have often times deluded the King
with calumnious, and Parasiticall suggestions, and
by that meanes, under a pretence of his protection,
have surreptitiously inserted divers things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to His Majestie. But they themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found too vitiously delinquent by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were many of them arraigned of High trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and committed to the Tower, where they
maliciously first forged Articles of High treason
against Master <hi>Pym,</hi> the Lord <hi>Kymbolton, &amp;c.</hi> and
withall directed the same unto His Majestie, with a
stupendious Declaration concerning them: and
implored his consent unto them. But they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
in that frustrate expectation: then they
moulded second Articles of high Treason against
Master <hi>Calamy,</hi> Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> Master <hi>Burton,</hi>
Master <hi>Case,</hi> Master <hi>Sedgwicke,</hi> Master <hi>Evan, &amp;c.</hi>
with many other painfull Divines: intimating
againe to His Majestie, that they were Traitors,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62418:3"/>
and were great disturbers of the Church, who did
not onely substract, or at least laboured to induce
the people to substract lawfull obedience to His
Imperiall Crowne, but also did derogate obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
loyalty, both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> His Royall dignity in postpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him behind the Parliament.</p>
            <p>But give me leave (gentle Reader) to discusse the
verity of the thing, and to answer these poore or at
least false subjections against them. As for the first
Article, their actions can sufficiently testifie to
the contrary, for rather then disturbers of the
Church, they have laboured to extract all divisions,
and disturbances from it, endeavouring to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the free power, and authority thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the holy word of God, as it is specified,
or at least prototypically presignified in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For their substraction of Loyalty from the
Crowne, and their labouring to induce the people
to substract their dayly practise in their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
can apparently nullifie: for they have always
pressed, and exstimulated the people with great
fervency of affection to all possible obedience to
his Majesty, and all requisit loyalty to his imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Crowne. And seeing these two have beene
found false and erronious, the other consequently
must be an untruth, for they have laboured to bring
the people to become obsequious reciprocally,
and mutually as well to the King, as Parliament,
so that by subsequent conclusion, no post-position
can be found inclusive in them. But I suppose,
that it was the Bishops sole malice to misinforme
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62418:4"/>
the King, having an intestine envy against them.
For because they would have introduced Popery,
and these laborious Divines did beat it downe to
the confusion of Rome, and its adherents, therefore
they have laboured by all possible meanes (if they
could) to supplant them, and subvert their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But (alas) God is more powerfull than the
Divell: men in authority may triumph, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe
too much arrogancy over their brethren for
a time, but at length the same machination which
they intended against others, shall fall on their owne
heads. For these painefull Divines have not onely
zealously opposed those Romish innovations,
which lately began almost to flourish in our
Church: but have likewise laboured with all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
care, and vigilancy to reduce the same to
the sincere truth of the holy Gospell of Christ.
Yet notwithstanding they have beene opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
scandalized by the Prelates, and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
having invective aspersions cast upon their
innocuous names; the reason no man can perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enucleate, unlesse their intents were to bring the
Church to an Anarchie: for if the pillars of the
Church be shaken, yea taken away, the structure
can no longer remaine, and the foundation it selfe
will be everted. Yet in spite of all their malice,
they are defended from the Tyrannicall mindes
and intentions of the Bishops, and will maugre all
their wolvish resolutions, be preserved from their
nefarious machinations against them: yet envy is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62418:4"/>
a most insufferable torment, and greater than any
Tyranny, therefore I will conclude with that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in Latine.</p>
