         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

your <hi>Itinerary,</hi> but am not

my thoughts on
it; unleſſe I had more
time or a ſteaddier Brain;
for after my riding
three dayes poaſt I am fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for ſleep then Epiſtles.
The thing moſt obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of all your Travells
is your ſelfe, who are able
to graſpe ſo much of the
World, when 'tis not
twice ten yeares ſince you
came into it. I conceive
it flowes from your good

on your ſeverall Stages,
that the Prints are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

done, ſince now ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

for drawing blood, but for
asking Peace. Did others
follow your example,
this <hi>unhabitable</hi>-VVorld
would have more Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

<hi>Itineraries</hi> I have ſeene in
Latine, few in Engliſh,
and thoſe ſo partiall, that
Countries are deſcrib'd
(as <hi>Committees</hi> do Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
not as they are,

them. 'Tis a Noble Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb facs="tcp:169401:9"/>
how <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Italy</hi> (two great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions)

we owe our Civility; ſhee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt
it by conqueſts in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
Propogated it by Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

To bee Retrograde on this
ſubject were to rob Hiſtory of
her birthright, to inſiſt on my
owne ocular obſervation but
veniall vſury.</p>
            <p>There are three evitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that divert ſome from this
Voyage; the firſt is the heates
of the Climate; A ſecond, that
horrible (in Report) Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the laſt, Hazard of thoſe
mercileſſe Out Lawes <hi>Banditas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt may bee allayd by
Moderation, the ſecond preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by diſcretion; the laſt avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the defence of thoſe
ſtates you paſſe through.</p>
            <p>This Duke of florence quite
extirpated that ſavage Race
out of his Dominions by raiſing
a competent number; that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated
Robbers and joynd in
league with the reall ones till
they fouud opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169401:13"/>
As there is connivance at the
<hi>Luterani</hi> (for ſo they terme us)
ſo tis raſhneſſe to proclaime
ones opinion, weakeneſſe to
diſcloſe it: This may gaine the
Odium of the Better, this the
injuries of the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>A novice of late ſo ſoone as
he was come to <hi>Florence,</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Methinks this place is ſomewhat
popiſhly affected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another with more pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ignorance when his Hoſt
askt him whether he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Afternoone, replyd,
to Maſſe.</p>
            <p>One of my Cotemporaries
diſcourſing with a Fryar, in a
Compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t proteſted he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
Clergy men <hi>for that he
was the ſonne of a Prieſt in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
which the Monke could
not conſter but either an <hi>Irony</hi>
to his Order, or Infamous to the
<pb facs="tcp:169401:14"/>
Gentlemans owne deſcent.</p>
            <p>The moſt cautious tongue is
incident to theſe Errours; yet
that nation is not ſo ſcrupulous
as to take notice of a ſtrangers
words or actions unleſſe openly
ſcandalous; for as <hi>Heretico</hi> is a
name utterly deteſtable, ſo
<hi>Tramontano</hi> by the Multitude is
held contemptible, which low
reputation begets a happy
privacy to the Reſerv'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner.</p>
            <p>That ſort of People which
Travellers have moſt agitation
with as <hi>Vetturino's</hi> Hoſts &amp; the
like, are very peremptory and
croſſe, which if you menace
they wil repaire with double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence;
knowing that if in the
conteſt their <hi>Stilletto</hi> ſhould do
miſchiefe, the next Church may
be their Aſylum, where no Law
or violence can attempt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169401:14"/>
The ſafeſt way is Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to winne better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
amongſt them
diſparage not, rather commend
the worſt.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Oſterias</hi> or Innes ſtand
uſually alone, remote from any
Village, ſo that Paſſengers muſt
bee content with what thoſe
<hi>Tabernae</hi> can afford, and he that
ſeemes to diſlike their feeble

               <hi>Allegramente</hi>
for amends.</p>
            <p>This Inference I lay hold on
to ſpeake more amply of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Rome</hi> wore the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Diadem of the ſubdued
World, it might have been a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable
Criticiſme, whither
<hi>Rome</hi> ſtood in <hi>Italy;</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> in
<hi>Rome,</hi> That voice of fame
which attributed all to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169401:15"/>
derogated from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
of the <hi>Italian:</hi> Now,
ſince <hi>Rome</hi> did reſigne the
Crowne to the Miter; <hi>Italy</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
her no Supremacy, but
Eccleſiaſticall; and in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
voge tis the moſt proper
phraſe to ſay ſuch a man is an
Italian, though a Native of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, in the Survey of
this preſent Generation I finde a
reſidue of the old Genius ſtill
ſurviving.</p>
            <p>That Roman Generoſity yet
runnes in the bloud of their No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
Families, which (I have
heard) can draw their Pedigree
from the great Maſters of the
World; as that of the <hi>Savelli</hi>
from <hi>Scipio Africanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither doth the height of
their ſpirits argue leſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Neopolitan</hi> is ſo elevated
<pb facs="tcp:169401:15"/>
with his imaginary Reven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>newes that in his deepeſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
hee will ſpeake thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
rather then betray his
wants.</p>
            <p>One will ſit gravely before
his doore picking his teeth, and
condemne the Capon hee eate
laſt; when a morſell of Bread
would paſſe downe merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Another I have ſeen begging
in this method: firſt he lookes
about to ſee whether the Coaſt
be cleare, before hee will utter
one ſuppliant word; then hee
approaches in a more ſubmiſſe
ſtraine, yet if any one chance
to caſt an eye that way; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates
to familiarity; Preſſing
the juſtneſſe of his Demands
till hee obtaines the almes;
which if but a penny or ſo, hee
caſts it contemptibly in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb facs="tcp:169401:16"/>
face, but ſoone after
peaceably ſearches for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and when tis found prayes
for the Benefactour.</p>
            <p>This is conſonant with the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Genueſian</hi> as
lofty as his buildings, ſo proud
in his Garbe, that at our firſt
nights Supper in <hi>Genua,</hi> ſome
Fidlars came to welcome us
with their Muſick, but with ſo
grave and ſtately a Preamble,
that wee all withdrew from
our ſeats to ſalute the men, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
them no leſſe then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Plebeians</hi> or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of <hi>Italy</hi> ſavour much of
the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls;</hi> yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
theſe are frequently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht
with the worthy Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of <hi>Julio, Flaminio, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:169401:16"/>
once eſpyde a Labourer tilling
the ground neer ſome decayed
Monuments; whereupon I
made towards the fellow and
askt him what thoſe Ruines
were; Hee anſwered mee, hee
knew nothing; but he had often
heard his Grandfather tell a
Story of one <hi>Signor Romolo,</hi>
that fought there. A twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Tradition and implies
much.</p>
            <p>They have a Recreation cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
deriv'd from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours,
<hi>viz: La Mora,</hi> anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<hi>micare Digitis,</hi> at the firſt
it appeares but childiſhly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous;
after better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
a kinde of Conjuration;
Tis of force to binde the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
yet the moſt illiterate are
beſt at the Game.</p>
            <p>And no wonder ſince this
Ayre hath from all Ages che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheriſht
<pb facs="tcp:169401:17"/>
the ſtrongeſt <hi>Atlaſe's</hi>
for Invention and Art.</p>
            <p>What Braine but <hi>Italian</hi>
could contrive Engines to raiſe
ſo vaſt a Moles as the <hi>Vatican
Obelisque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve what machivillian
unheard of Weapons they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
to ſurprize an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> I ſaw a pocket
Church Booke with a Piſtoll
hid in the binding, which turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſuch a Page, diſcharges.
A plot (I conceive) to entrap
him you hate, whilſt yon are at
your devotions together, when
there's leaſt ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>Another as rare, is a Pocket
ſtone-Bow, which held under
a Cloake ſhoots needles with
violence to pierce a mans body,
yet leaves a wound ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169401:17"/>
A third is a walking ſtaffe
in appearance; at the top is a
Spring which graspt hard, at
the other end will jet forth a
Rapier with force enough to
kill at a yards diſtance.</p>
            <p>A fourth is a Gunne to bee
charg'd with winde, which for
ſix paces will not faile of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
with a ſmall or no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>To theſe I may adde their
curious (yet Illegall) tricks
in poyſon, ſome mortall by
ſmelling to, others that given
now, ſhall have no operation
till many moneths after.</p>
            <p>Some will attempt to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Rivers if they can but finde
the Source or Fountaine; and
in <hi>Milan</hi> there ſtands a Pillar
cald <hi>Colonna Infame,</hi> rais'd
where a Magicians houſe was
puld downe, who for a time
<pb facs="tcp:169401:18"/>
poyſond the whole City.</p>
            <p>I omit not their excellency in
Statuary, Limming, Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
Gardning, Sceanes, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
in which all <hi>Europe</hi> gives
them the precedency.</p>
            <p>In what perfection they have
theſe faculties you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from theſe Inſtances.</p>
            <p>Upon a Sepulcher in S. <hi>Peters</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi> in a <hi>Combent</hi> poſture lie
the feminine Statues of <hi>Old age,</hi>
and of <hi>Youth;</hi> In the latter the
Sculpturer hath ſo exceeded
Nature, for Limbes, Features
and Comelineſſe, that tis ſaid
a <hi>Spaniard</hi> at his Beads left his
Devotions to expiate his ſenſe
on that <hi>Niobe</hi>-like Lady, and
for that reaſon a vaile of black
Marble now covers Youths na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe;
whilſt her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
old Age wants a Smock.</p>
            <p>For limming, one <hi>Mattia
<pb facs="tcp:169401:18"/>
Caſale</hi> of <hi>Sienna</hi> (though no
eminent Artiſt) drew the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of a Prince ſo exactly, and
with that vivacity, that in the
Princes eyes, hee plac't his own
<hi>Effigies</hi> perfectly diſcernable as
in the Originall.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> a friend
to Ingenuity, and a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of it in the <hi>Italian,</hi> had
tranſported out of <hi>Italy</hi> a
Piece of two Dogs combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a bone, done with that
life; that a third more living
Curre entring into the Roome,
very eagerly aſſaulted the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
which wanted nothing
but motion, to reſiſt him.</p>
            <p>For their Architecture I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
you to their Cities; A
<hi>Flandrian</hi> Embaſſadour leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Florence,</hi> told the Great
Duke his City deſerv'd to bee
ſeen never but on Holy-dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169401:19"/>
For their Gardens, I dare
conſidently avow all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
affords none ſo volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
as thoſe within the
Walls and Territory of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and at <hi>Bagnaia</hi> (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
there's a Walke for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces archt with Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
ſo that a man may paſſe
drye under the Element of
water; A trick might raiſe a
Queſtion in the Schooles.</p>
            <p>Their Sceanes, (or as they
terme them <hi>Operas)</hi> are <hi>Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,</hi>
they have not yet fully
communicated to us, their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arts wee daily bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>A yeare ſince in a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
at <hi>Venice, Phaeton</hi> in his
Charriot drawne by foure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
well pamperd Steeds,
were all hurld over the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in an Artificiall cloud.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169401:19"/>
In this they but imitate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
marke how they ſubdue
her.</p>
            <p>At the Marriage of the Duke
of <hi>Florence</hi> there was brought
on the Stage a <hi>Balletta,</hi> or
dance of Horſes; whilſt an
Ape playde the ayre on a Git<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarre;
A <hi>Florentin</hi> ſaid a third
Miracle was intended, <hi>Viz:</hi>
a Conſort of <hi>Parachitos</hi> voices,
but the Schollars had not got
their leſſon perfect againſt the
day appointed for the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls.</p>
            <p>They are ſo addicted to
Muſick, eſpecially that of the
Voyce, (which indiſputably
is the beſt,) that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

<hi>Eunuch's</hi> whoſe throates and

            <p>Neither is the Rout leſſe

no <hi>Fachin</hi> or Cobler but can
finger ſome Inſtrument; ſo

Notes.</p>
            <p>Their Carnavall is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

So many men, ſo many Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets;
ſome abuſive, others for

            <p>A <hi>Saneſian</hi> perhaps to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrize
on the French Vanity,
got on a Sute <hi>a la Mode</hi>

where wee place Gold But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons

Round the knees, along the

            <p>From theſe paſſages I have

can aſſert by experience, and to
countenance this ſtory, there
fell out a ſtrange accident in my
ſtay at <hi>Siena.</hi> A Gentleman was
ſo pleas'd with the ſmell of this
<hi>Baſilico,</hi> that he had ſome dry'd
and beaten into powder, which
he ſnuft up, imagining it of the
ſame force with Tobacco to
cleare the head, but hee bought
the experience at the price of
his life, for hee dyed diſtracted;
His skull being afterwards ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Chyrurgion, a neſt
of Scorpions were found fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on his Braine.</p>
            <p>For their creatures they have
many not known to this Iſland,
but for curioſity. About
<hi>Rome</hi> they plow the land with
Buffolos; neere <hi>Sienna</hi> they
hunt the wild Boare, with the
Rowbuck, the Wolfe, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine,

Mountaine Dog.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169401:22"/>
They have many <hi>Reptilias,</hi>
of ſtrange natures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cimici</hi> are moſt Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
bed fellowes; but Fleas
in <hi>Folio,</hi> yet ſo dainty, as they
will chuſe their fleſh; my
Chamberfellowes face hath
lookt bigge as <hi>Boreas</hi> with them
in one night, when they have
not ſo much as toucht my skin,
or diſturbd my ſleepe. They
are very offenſive to his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrills

            <p>The <hi>Cantherides</hi> are greene
flyes by day, and in the night
paſſe about the fields (a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

Glowormes with fire in their

            <p>A <hi>Rimarra</hi> is a Philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
creature in forme like a
Lyzzard, in bigneſſe much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

mee nature had ſo provided
<pb facs="tcp:169401:23"/>
that the property of that beaſt

being come to <hi>Antibe</hi> the
utmoſt City of <hi>France,</hi> wee
found favour of the Governour
(it being a Frontiere and place
of ſtrength) in giving us a Bill
of health, without which it is
very difficult to enter into any
of the Italian States or Cities, &amp;
having over night procured a
Filoaco to carry us all our way
to <hi>Genua</hi> if ſo be wee mett with
no Boate of returne betwixt
thence and <hi>Monaco;</hi> the next
morning we departed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

came before <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
on the Sea ſide, but hath
no Port, the buildings are after
the Italian, &amp; it is commanded
by a ſtrong Caſtle that ſtands
on a hill. Finding no conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of imbarquing better here
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169401:25"/>
we ſayled on, but at the point
of Land that turnes towards
<hi>Morgues,</hi> there aroſe a contrary
winde, which forc't us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre
into the next harbour, to
wit <hi>Villa Franca</hi> (aunciently
called <hi>Portus Herculis)</hi> where
by permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Governour
of the Citadell we lay that
night. This place likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs

we met with a <hi>Genova Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louco,</hi>
&amp; having agreed for our
paſſage in that, quitted our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
yet no ſooner were we in
the boat but a Tempeſt drove
us againe into the harbour; ſo
that we loſt that day entirely.
The day following we had both
faire weather, &amp; a calme Sea,
which encourag'd our water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to adventure out; about 2.

informed to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary.
A little further we ſtrooke into
the Port of <hi>Monaco,</hi> and after
an houre or two ſtay there, the
wind growing contrary, our

to a greater inconvenience,
which wee the more willingly

ſo remarkable a place as no
ſtranger can well paſſe without
eſpeciall obſervation thereof;
for I muſt confeſſe I know no

like conſideration, either for
ſtrength or riches; The Prince
of the family of the <hi>Grimaldi</hi>
of <hi>Genua,</hi> is in his ſtate ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,
and coynes mony, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169401:26"/>
hath ſtill ſome greater King for
his Protector, of late yeares hee
left the Spaniſh party, and gave
himſelfe with this his cheife
Towne, to the King of <hi>France's</hi>
tuition, ſo that at our arrive
there, there was a ſtrict gariſon
of <hi>French;</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
being then Governour to
whom wee had addreſſe from
his Brother in Law at <hi>Antibe,</hi>
us'd us very civilly, and ſent a

               <hi>Monaco</hi> (whether I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169401:27"/>
court fit for to exerciſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
diſcipline in, at the end
is the Princes Palace, which
though Beautifull on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
yet contains greater wealth
within, cheifly in his Gardrobe,
where the variety of Tapiſtries
the great quantity of plate, with
the vaſtneſſe of veſſels, as
Fountaines, Tables, and ſuch
like of pure ſilver, ſtriks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
into him that ſees it,
beſides this rich furniture, there
are two Cabinets or Galeries of
rare curioſities which excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Duke of <hi>Florences,</hi>
may be equaled with moſt of
that nature in <hi>Italy:</hi> amongſt
other ſingularities I was much
taken with the ſtatue of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian

materiall, as likewiſe a gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery

               <hi>Otium Franciſci Bembi;</hi> The
Prince was then in enlarging
this Palace, and beautifying it
with Marbles and waterworks.
Having with great ſatisfaction
ſeene all the particularities of
this place, we returned downe
to our Inne, and it growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
night, ſome few howers
before our departure a hard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
befell us, which was the
loſſe of our Bill of health,
wherefore though it was darke
and the watch was ſet, yet wee
ſent up a letter by a ſtring to
the Governour, who very
courteouſly returned us a
Ticket of larger extent then
our former. At midnight wee
departed from <hi>Monaco</hi> paſt
eight miles farther by <hi>Menton,</hi>
a village belonging to the ſame
Prince, and about breake of
day we came before <hi>Vintimiglia</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:169401:28"/>
the firſt city (towards <hi>France)</hi>
of the Republique of <hi>Genua,</hi>
from hence we were in view of
the mountaines of <hi>Corſica</hi> and
foure miles farther we paſt by
Saint <hi>Remes,</hi> where the ſhore
(which is called by the name
of the rive of <hi>Genua)</hi> is all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Orange, Citron, and
Date Trees. Paſt the reſt of
that day without ſeeing any
thing remarkable, unleſſe <hi>Porto
Mauritio,</hi> where heretofore
there was a very good Port
which the Genueſians ruin'd,
fearing it ſhould bring preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to their owne. Towards
night we ſtrooke in at <hi>Oneille,</hi>
a city which ſeemes to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Genois dominions,
and belongs to the Duke of
<hi>Savoy.</hi> After we had ſupt wee
tooke boate and ſayled all
night by many Townes, <hi>viz.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169401:28"/>
Diano, Araiſſe,</hi> where they fiſh
for Corall, <hi>Albengue, Luan,</hi> a
city of the Prince of <hi>Oria</hi> a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,
<hi>Final</hi> a place of ſtrength
and the only garriſon the King
of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath in theſe coaſts;
the Port though ſmall yet
ſerves much in the conveyance
of men and amunition towards
<hi>Milan.</hi> This place commonly
pillageth ſtrangers, they taking
all for Frenchmen; but (pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God) wee paſt quietly,
and towards breake of day
came before <hi>Savona;</hi> The moſt
ancient and greateſt city of the
<hi>Genevoiſat</hi> after <hi>Genua</hi> it ſelfe.
Behind this city, the <hi>Apennines</hi>
that cleave <hi>Italy</hi> in ſunder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to take their riſe. From
hence to <hi>Genua</hi> is 35. Italian
miles; all which way one goes
more and more into the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe
of Italy, the whole
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169401:29"/>
board being fild with Country
Seats and Villages, which for
beauty ſurpaſſe many cities I
have ſeene elſewhere. Amongſt
thoſe <hi>San Pietro d' Arania</hi> (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the richer Genueſians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
themſelves in the ſommer,
and indeed may bee call'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Genua</hi> for the gallantry of
the buildings) is the beſt; but
three miles diſtant from <hi>Genua,</hi>
the Metropolis of that moſt
flouriſhing Republick, which
contains ſo ſtately Palaces, that
from all the reſt of Italy, it hath
gotten the name of <hi>Genua</hi> the
ſuperbe.</p>
            <p>Tis ſituated at the foot of
very high mountaines,<note place="margin">Genua.</note> which
though ſterile, yet want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that Art can enrich
them with; In gardens, water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes,
and the like. That
which exceeds all the reſt, is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169401:29"/>
the Prince of <hi>Orias</hi> Palace, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
from the bottome of the
ſhoare, to the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
divided into three gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
In the firſt whereof the
Terraſſes or Porches one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
another bore up with
marble Pillars, is very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
as likewiſe the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Eagles, and the
Family of <hi>Neptune:</hi> at the one
ſide that famous Cage of iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
which is of ſo vaſt an
extent that it encloſeth a wood
of Cypreſſe and other trees.
The other two are fild with
Grottes, Orange trees; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
variety of delights: At the
upper part of all ſtands the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> tonant. Within
the Pallace the Gardrobe full
of rarietyes; the Tapeſtries and
precious Furuiture declare
greatly the richneſſe of that
Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:169401:30"/>
Next to this is the houſe of
<hi>Hieronimo del Negro,</hi> where the
excellent Pictures, the fall of
waters, the Fountain, the Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,
the Grove and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
departments, are well
worth ſeeing. On all ſides of the
City is an infinity of ſuch places
of pleaſure, eſpecially round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Port, which is of a
large circuit, reſembling much
the forme of a Theatre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
with faire buildings.
Tis defended by a ſolid Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke
(which they call <hi>Il
Mole)</hi> that lyes about 2 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces into the Sea, rais'd
at a very great expence: Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to that a rocky Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
caſts it ſelfe forth, at
the head whereof ſtands a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lofty Pharos, bearing a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of more then an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bigneſſe, to guide Ships in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169401:30"/>
the night: Within the Haven
is a place where the Gallyes
lay, every one in a particular
Claſſis. As for the City it ſelfe,
it is enough to ſay the Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſians
live in a Kingly luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and I believe it is the beſt
built and compacted City, not
onely of <hi>Italy,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
The houſes generally
are very high, the ſtreets
for the moſt part (its onely
fault) are ſomewhat narow,
ſo that no Coaches are here
admitted, which though an
inconvenience, yet preſerves
the wayes more cleane and
neater. I except here that ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
long, even, and indeed
Miſtris of ſtreets the <hi>Strada
Nova,</hi> which I am confident
may be juſtly preferd before
any in Chriſtendome, ſo proud
in Architecture, ſo rich in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169401:31"/>
are the Palaces tis fild
with. The faireſt one belongs
to the Duke of <hi>Oria.</hi> Amongſt
the publick Edifices, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
or Merchants Hall.
the Dukes Palace with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
for 30 thouſand men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
our walking to. Neither
are the Genueſians leſſe ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
in adorning their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
places; witneſſe the
mighty quantity of poliſh't
Marble, wherewith all the
Churches are fild, eſpecially
<hi>San Lorenzo</hi> the Dome, and
<hi>Santo Ambroſio</hi> belonging to
the Jeſuites. But that which
ſurpaſſeth all, and is of moſt
admiration, is the Chappell of
the <hi>Anunciade,</hi> begun to bee
built not many yeares ſince at
the expence of one Family,
(whoſe Palace joynes to it)
yet is of ſo incredible richneſſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169401:31"/>
for the red and white Marble
Pillars, and other ornaments,
that one would imagine the
revenues of a whole City could
not bee enough to raiſe ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Worke as that will be
when tis finiſht. Finally, the
Genueſians to defend this their
brave City, have encompaſt it
with Walls no leſſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
for beauty and ſtrength,
then prodigious for their large
extent. The people of this
Common-wealth are habited
all alike, ſomewhat tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Spaniſh Mode; and
are of a very auſtere and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbe
humour, hardly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing
to look ſo low as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
wherefore having with
much ſatisfaction ſeene their
Flouriſhing Eſtate, wee left
them. We ſet out from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua</hi>
in a Filouca about Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169401:32"/>
and having ſayld all that
night, about noone the next
day we ſtrooke into <hi>Porto Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi>
and after dinner croſt the
<hi>Golfe of Aſpecia,</hi> (which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with many ſtrong For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications)
to <hi>Lerizi.</hi> This
Bourg being the mid way from
<hi>Genua</hi> to <hi>Ligourne</hi> (ſuch is the
villany of the watermen in
theſe parts) if they get their
paſſengers, chiefly ſtrangers hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they will ſo delay their
departure, pretending the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
of the weather,
that by lying ſtill at ſo great an
expence, they may bee forc'd
to give them their pay, and
to hire horſes for the reſt of
the way by Land. Which trick
wee were forc't to ſuffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
after a day and halfes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
for our boat. Hence
we tooke Poſt, and having paſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169401:32"/>
through the Olive woods, over
the hills that lay neereſt the
ſhoare, wee came into a low
plaine Countrey, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſo to <hi>Ligorne.</hi> Firſt we
paſt the River <hi>Magre,</hi> then
went by <hi>Sarazana,</hi> a good City,
and laſt of the dominion of
<hi>Genua,</hi> after that we came into
the Principality of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we paſt by <hi>Lavenza</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
where out of the hills
they dig great ſtore of Marble,
and then through <hi>Maſſa</hi> it ſelfe,
where the Prince reſides in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>The Towne is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
ſtanding in a Territorie
fruitfull in Orange trees and
other fruits. Hence wee came
ſuddenly into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> but
quickly left it, falling into a
woody Country, belonging to
the State of <hi>Lucas,</hi> and ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169401:33"/>
to <hi>Viregio,</hi> under the ſame
power, ſtanding at the mouth
of a ſmall river, which runnes
from <hi>Lucques.</hi> Here we were
forc't to lye, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome two mile farther wee
paſt the river that parts the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique
of <hi>Lucques</hi> from <hi>Toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi>

to the great Dukes ſubjection.
From whom it hath received
many Embelliſments. Tis ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in a Marſhy land, ſo that
the unholeſomneſſe of the aire
renders it ſcarce of the native
people, much more of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169401:33"/>
which ſeldome tarry any
longer then to ſee the rarities of
the place. Amongſt which I
preferre that worthy peece of
arte the Falling Tower which
travellers boaſt of, (and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly)
as one of the moſt
mervellous things they ſee in
the voyage of <hi>Italy.</hi> Tis cover'd
round with galleries &amp; 7. rowes
one above another of Marble
Pillars, ſo that 'tis hard to bee
imagin'd by what engines ſo
great a ſtructure ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
it being built ſo decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to one ſide, that all men
which regard it, at the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
its fall. Hard by is the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>
or Cathedrall Church of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa;</hi>
where threeſcore Pillars
teſtifie as well its Antiquity,
as the Gates of Braſſe its rarity.
Joyning to this is the <hi>Campo
Santo,</hi> or <hi>Cimetiere</hi> firm'd in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169401:34"/>
with a wall of Marble, and
much reſembles a Cloyſter; in
the midſt is the Church yard
from whence the place hath its
denomination, that implies the
holy Field; becauſe halfe the
ground was brought from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
and it hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
propriety, that all bodies
which are buried there, are
conſum'd within the ſpace of
40. houres. Here are likewiſe
reſerv'd many Ancient Urnes,
which, with the ſtory of the
Old and New Teſtament pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of old worke, make the
place very venerable. Hard by
is the Baptiſtary, or <hi>San Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni;</hi>
wherein, the Font,
and pulpit leaning on foure
Lyons, will for the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the ſtone, yield to no
other in <hi>Italie.</hi> Leaving the
<hi>Area</hi> where theſe things ſtand
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169401:34"/>
together, a little more into the
towne is the Chappell and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
of the Knights of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpiece
of the Chappell is of
Marble neatly polliſh't. The
inſide is adorn'd with the trueſt
Enſignes of Valour; I meane
Trophees taken from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemies of Chriſtianity,
the Turkes. Before their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
is the ſtatue of the great
Duke <hi>Coſmus,</hi> with a Fountain.
This Dignity of Knighthood
is much like to that of <hi>Malta,</hi>
both to maintain Chriſts cauſe
againſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> yet
theſe may marrie, the others
I conceive may not: Theſe
weare a red Croſſe for their
badge in this faſhion. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> From
hence we walk't to the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
garden, which is more for
uſe then delight; although there
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169401:35"/>
be good walks, &amp; water-works
that well waſht us, yet for the
moſt 'tis cover'd with ſimples,
outlandiſh Plants and the like.
Joyning to it is a gallery very
commodious for Medecinall
things, it abounding with all
curioſities of Nature, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
creatures, Stones, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls,
and whatſoever ſtrange
the fartheſt Indies produce. In
generall, this City ſtands ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely,
as few like for the
receiving of all forreign Wares.
In the midſt thereof runnes the
river <hi>Arno,</hi> from thence to its
Embuſchment navigable for
very great Veſſels, ſo that here
is a place where the Duke
builds his Gallies: On one ſide
of the river, is a faire ſtreet cald
<hi>Longarno,</hi> where is the great
Dukes Palace, and before it the
ſtatue of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the third;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169401:35"/>
On the other ſide is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
little, but of Marble,
then which nothing more
common in <hi>Italy.</hi> In a word,
'tis prayſe enough, to ſay tis
the third City under the great
Duke, who I thinke hath the
faireſt of what Prince ſoever.
Having taken a ſatisfactory
view hereof, we went on our
way to <hi>Ligourne,</hi> whither there
is an hourely convenience of a
Coach to tranſport Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
from <hi>Ligorne</hi> to <hi>Piſa,</hi> the
Duke hath made an artificiall
Channell, of 15. miles long,
which bares ſmall boates like
to Venetian <hi>Gondoloes.</hi> The
Eſcluſe of which Channell we
ſaw at our ſetting forth out of
<hi>Piſa,</hi> cover'd for 250. paces.
The moſt part of the way to
<hi>Ligorne</hi> is through Fennes, till
one enters into the great Dukes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169401:36"/>
Forreſt, which continues to the
towne.<note place="margin">Ligorne.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligorne</hi> the only maritimate
place of importance, under the
Great Duke, is ſituated in a
plaine, at the board of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean
Sea,</hi> tis but little,
yet the great concurſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
which flow thither from
all Nations, chiefly from my
one, make it more ſpoken of
than many Cities, of a larger
extent. 'Tis an innumerable
ſumme of money the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
yearly from this ſmall
Port: wherefore his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
with him have omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to make it ſtrong, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the royall Baſtions, and
mote wherewith tis fenct; The
great Port where the Ships lay
at Anchor, is defended by the
Mole, and about hath many
fanalls. The <hi>Darcina,</hi> where
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169401:36"/>
the Gallies (then but ſix in
number) lay as quiet as in a
Chamber, is moſt exquiſitely
well contriv'd: Before ſtands
that beſt of moderne Statues,
the Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in Marble,
and the <hi>Coloſses</hi> of foure ſlaves
under him, in braſſe in divers
Poſtures, ſo lively repreſented,
that if the Statuary could have
fram'd a voice as well as thoſe
bodies, he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querd
nature. Beſides this
piece, there are no more curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
in this towne, yet many
conveniences. The ſtreets are
generally large, the houſes low,
but uniforme, unleſſe ſome
which have been put out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by an Earthquake, to
which this place is often Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
The great place is very
beautifull, and fit for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
of Merchants. On the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169401:37"/>
houſes round about and in the
faireſt ſtreets, are pictur'd all the
battels, and victories of the
great Dukes gallies, obtained
over the <hi>Turks,</hi> which a ſlave
did to gaine his redemption.
The <hi>Jewes</hi> which are here in
great number, have the faireſt
Synagogue I ever yet ſaw,
wherin on a ſaturday their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth,
we ſaw the manner of
their divine (if ſo I may call it)
ſervice. Their priviledges here
are more then ordinary, they
wearing no marke of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as in other Townes, ſo that
here the wealthier and richer
ſort are of that Sect. The
<hi>Greeks</hi> likewiſe have a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and Church here. In
a word, <hi>Ligorne</hi> is compacted
of forreigners, yet the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſomeneſſe
of the aire ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
a great part from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169401:37"/>
thence, which I by dangerous
experience found true; for the
day before I was to depart
for <hi>Florence,</hi> (having all the
while I ſtayed at <hi>Ligorne</hi> found
a ſtrange alteration of the aire,
different both from that of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.)</hi> I was ill
diſpos'd to ſickneſſe, however,
not ſo much but that I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
on my journey, which
though with much difficulty I
perfected. The firſt night we lay
at <hi>Piſa,</hi> which way we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
paſt. The next morning
we tooke Coach, (a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
paſſage over hilly
way) and paſt firſt by <hi>S. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
a Convent of the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantins
ſtanding on high, from
whence is a pleaſant proſpect
downe the valley, from thence
we came to <hi>Empoly,</hi> a neat lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
towne where we lay, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169401:38"/>
the next day towards noone

on all ſides with the
ſame, excepting towards the
Weſt ſide, before which lies a
plaine Countrey, <hi>vulgo Pianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
di Fiorenza.</hi> This City is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in two by the river <hi>Arno,</hi>
over which are built foure
Bridges of ſtone, upon one of
the two chief is the Goldſmiths
ſtreet; upon the other of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtately ſtructure ſtand the
foure quarters of the yeare in

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169401:38"/>
in Porphyre at the top,
which, <hi>Coſmus</hi> the firſt great

<hi>Palazzo de Strozzi,</hi> no leſſe to
be admir'd for the immenſity
of its fabrick, then for its rude
and unuſuall Architecture.
From hence towards the right
hand is the Merchants Vault,
ſupported with faire Pillars,
and before it a brazen Boare
jetting forth water; Keeping
right on, one comes into the
great Place, in the midſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is the great Duke <hi>Coſmus,</hi> a

            <p>Betwixt this horſe and the
<hi>Palazzo vecchio,</hi> is a Fountaine,
which all <hi>Italy</hi> cannot ſhew
the like beſides, round about
the Laver is the family of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
in braſſe, with his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſe
of Marble in the midſt,
bore up by foure horſes; The
whole not poſſible to be equald,
much leſſe excel'd by humaine
art.</p>
            <p>In this ſame <hi>Piazza,</hi> is a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169401:39"/>
Porch archt and adorn'd with
ſome ſtatues, amongſt which
that of <hi>Judith,</hi> in braſſe with
that of the Rape of the <hi>Sabines,</hi>
three Perſons in ſeverall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
cut all out of one ſtone
are moſt remarkable.</p>
            <p>Juſt againſt it is the <hi>Palazzo

two Coloſſes, the one of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
the other of <hi>Hercules</hi>
trampling on <hi>Cacus,</hi> the firſt
of <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> which in
my judgement comes ſhort of
the other, though he the more
famous ſtatuary. Within is a
Court ſet about with Pillars of
<hi>Corinthian</hi> worke; Above is a
very ſpacious Hall with divers
Statues, and amongſt them
thoſe of two Popes, <hi>Leo</hi> the
tenth, and <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh,
of the family of the <hi>Medicis;</hi>
the apertenants of this lodging
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169401:40"/>
are very great, and coſtly, but
it being not ſo frequented as if
the Court were kept there, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing looſeth its luſter.</p>
            <p>Wherefore having ſpeedily
diſpatcht the ſight hereof; that
which requires a week to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
well, is at hand: I meane
that richeſt of Treaſures, the
great Dukes Gallery. In the
lower ſtory ſit the Courts of
Juſtice, with an arcade to walk
in on each ſide. Above are the
ſhops of divers Artiſans which
work continually for the great
Duke. In the uppermoſt part
is contained as many wonders
as things, Some to be admir'd
for their preciouſneſſe and art,
others for their rarity and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
On each ſide of the
Gallerie are ranged Statues, to
the number of foureſcore and
odde, of which for Antiquity
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169401:40"/>
I preferre the Idoll brought
from the temple of <hi>Apollo, at
Delphis,</hi> with this verſe on the
Pediſtall.</p>
            <q>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t potui huc veni Delphis &amp; fratre relicto.</q>

campeſtri, tunicati utere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
After theſe I may reckon
the two triumphant Pillars;
from whence they were taken
I know not; but their worke
ſpeaks them <hi>Roman.</hi> Over the
ſtatues hang the Pictures, ſome
Prototypes of the moſt famous
men of the moderne times, on
the one ſide Schollars, on the
other ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>At the right hand of this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169401:41"/>
gallerie are ſeverall ſtanzas full
of curioſities, into which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
enters is aſtoniſht at the
quantity of wealth; confus'd
with the variety of things
worth obſervation.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Roome we went
into, ſtands the Tabernacle,
or altar deſtinated for <hi>S. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Chappell,</hi> no part thereof
of common Marble; but total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compacted with Jewells and
Precious ſtones; The value
ineſtimable.</p>
            <p>In the next Chamber is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with Flowers, and Birds in
their naturall colours of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſtones, with a Cabinet
priz'd at two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crownes, coverd with
Agaths, Emerauds, Anama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Within is the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

twelve Apoſtles all in Amber.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:169401:41"/>
In the third is a Cabinet
with Calcidon Pillars, fild (as
they told us) with ancient
medailles of Gold; round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this Roome is an infinite
number of Naturall and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
curioſities, as the Nalle
turn'd halfe into Gold by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy,
The Emperours head
on a Turqu'oiſe bigger then a
Walnut, with thouſands more.
Next is the Armory, wherein
are the habits, and diverſe ſorts
of armes of ſeverall ages, and
People; amonſt thoſe, the
King of <hi>China's</hi> habit, <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi>
Head-piece of <hi>Corinthian</hi>
metall, <hi>Charlemain's</hi> Sword;
and an argument of the <hi>Italian</hi>
Jealouſie, an Invention to
lock up female frailty. Here
likewiſe is a Magnet which
beares up foureſcore pound
weight of Iron.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:169401:42"/>
In the laſt Cabinet we ſaw
the curious Turnity of Ivory,
a Pillar of Orientall Alablaſter,
&amp;c. and from thence wee went
into the Gardrobe, where are
twelve great Cubbards of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Plate, a ſervice all of pure
Maſſie Gold; A ſaddle which
the Emperour gave in a preſent
to the great Duke, all Embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with Pearles and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds;
Theſe, with many other
Particularities of this gallerie,
(which might be a Theame
copious enough to write a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
on,) declaring the wealth
of this Prince equall with any
Kings in Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>From the ſaid gallery is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rider;
or private paſſage to the
<hi>Palazzo de Pithi,</hi> on the other
ſide of the river; where the
Duke keeps his Court; The
Front of this edifice is very
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169401:42"/>
majeſtique towards the Baſis
of Dorick work, in the midſt of
Ionick, in the uppermoſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Corinthian.</hi> In the Court
is a Grotte with ſtatues and a
fountaine over it, yet that
which is moſt wonderfull is
the Loadſtone of a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>Neither are the gardens to
be omitted, which for their
largeneſſe have the face of a
Forreſt, for their variety of
a Paradiſe. Here Cypres groves,
there Walkes with ſtatues,
here a Sea of Fountaines, there
Swans, Auſtriches, and other
recreative Creatures.</p>
            <p>Being now on this ſide of the
<hi>Arno,</hi> I will take notice of all I
ſaw there before I returne to
the other. And firſt there
ſtands a Pillar, bearing on it
the ſtatue of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169401:43"/>
the ſame place where hee was
beheaded. Next on the wall
of <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> Church, above
a mans reach are theſe veſes,

            <p>Going now back into the
fuller body of the City, on the

the banck there is a Marble,
which I found of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,

            <p>Leaſt I ſhould dwell too
long amongſt theſe earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
wherewith <hi>Florence</hi> is
fil'd, I will goe and meditate
in the Churches; and firſt in
the <hi>Dome,</hi> which I conceive
either for the exquiſiteneſſe of
the worke, or worth of ſo vaſt
a Bulke of Red, Black, and
white Marble, to be the faireſt
Cathedrall without, that ever
man laid eyes on. Its better
part is the <hi>Cupola,</hi> ſo high that
the braſſe Globe at the top, is
capable of holding ſixteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>No leſſe wonderfull is the
Steeple, which without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169401:44"/>
will yield to no other in
the world, compoſed of the
ſame ſtone and materialls with
the Church, but with more art
and ornaments.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Dome</hi> is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Mars;</hi> built in an Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon;
now cald <hi>S. John,</hi> or
the Baptiſtary. The foure
gates of Braſſe, vvhich <hi>Ortelius</hi>
prefers before any elſe in the
world, the broken Pillars of
<hi>Porphyre,</hi> the pavement, the
old <hi>Grecian</hi> Pieces at the top,
are things to be noted.</p>
            <p>From hence wee went to
ſee that mirrour of Art, and
wonder of this preſent age,
<hi>Saint Laurents</hi> Chappell, which
is ſo glorious, that whoſoever
enters, will even imagine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in ſome place above terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall.
'Tis wholly overlaid
with fine Polliſht ſtones, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169401:44"/>
is any colour upon Earth,
but it is there in ſtones natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all which I have been ſince
told by diverſe, (an argument
of the great riches included in
the Bowells of <hi>Italy)</hi> are dugg
up within the great Dukes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.
Round about this
Chappell are all the ſcutions of

            <p>To conclude my deſcription
of <hi>Florence,</hi> the houſes are
high built, the ſtreets pav'd
with great ſtones, even and
long, many Fountaines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick ornaments, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the magnificence of the
great Dukes. For eight mile
round about the City there
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169401:47"/>
ſeemes another <hi>Florence,</hi> ſo full
are the fields ſpeckled with
Country ſeats. Neither are
thoſe delights to private men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but there are likewiſe
publike walkes, witneſſe that
of Pines two mile long: that
of <hi>Cypreſſes</hi> leading to <hi>Poggio
Imperiale,</hi> and many more.</p>
            <p>Two miles up into the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
Mountaines lies the old
<hi>Feſuli,</hi> often ſpoke of amongſt
the ancient Writers, but now
a poore Village, not having ſo
much as the remnants of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
            <p>In fine, there is no Province
in <hi>Italy</hi> more furniſh't with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull,
and well peopled Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
then that of the great
Duke, whoſe Anceſtours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
united the States of three
Common-wealths together, to
wit, <hi>Of Piſa, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:169401:47"/>
doth now entirely poſſeſſe
all <hi>Toſcany;</hi> the nobler part of
<hi>Italy.</hi> The wife of this preſent
Great Duke, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of that name, comes from
the Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Rovori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Revenues of this Prince
of <hi>Toſcany</hi> exceeed yearly ten
hundred thouſand Crownes,
which will amount to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand pound <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
his ordinary guard is of Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Infantry, with <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
very well equipag'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Florentins</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
notable head pieces, ſo
that from hence ſpring notable
Polititians, and States-men
<hi>Machevil</hi> was of them, and 'tis
ſaid that three Embaſſadours
from ſeverall Kings, meeting
accidentally on the way, prov'd
in the concluſion to be all <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentins.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:169401:48"/>
So ſoone as we had fill'd our
ſelves with the ſight of thoſe
many ſingularities, that are in
and about <hi>Florence,</hi> wee ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for <hi>Siena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Going out of <hi>Florence,</hi> at
the <hi>Porta Romana,</hi> one leaves
<hi>Poggio Imperiale a Villa</hi> of the
great Dukes, which I had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
above. At the entrance
of the walkes of <hi>Cypres,</hi> that
leads to it are the ſtatues of
the <hi>Tybre</hi> and <hi>Arno;</hi> thoſe
of the famous old and new Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
<hi>Virgil, Ovid, Petrarche,</hi>
and <hi>Dante.</hi> The houſe ſwarmes
with rarities, chiefly with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Pictures, amongſt them
all the line of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> this great
Dukes mother, who built this
houſe, being ſiſter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>After wee had paſt by that,
wee lay that night at a little
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169401:48"/>
Bourg call'd <hi>Santo Caſſiano.</hi>
The next morning wee rode
through a Village <hi>Barbarino,</hi>
from whence the mighty ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
family of the Cardinalls
tooke their originall. Wee
din'd at <hi>Poggio Bonci,</hi> a place
noted for the perfumd <hi>Tobacco</hi>
compos'd there; which the
<hi>Italians</hi> through cuſtome take
in powder, as profuſely, as we
in <hi>England</hi> doe in the pipe.
From hence in the afternoone
we arriv'd at <hi>Siena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Siena</hi> formerly a free State
of it ſelf, now ſubject to the
Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſtands aloft
covering the back of a hill; ſo
that in the hotteſt time of the
yeare, this City is ſtill refreſht
by coole gailes of winde; The
ayre is very wholſome, much
agreeing with the conſtitution
of ſtrangers, the Inhabitants
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169401:49"/>
very curteous, a great deale
ſuiting to the humours of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
and beſides the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, is
here profeſt, and ſpoken; theſe
and the like conveniences make
it much frequented by Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and indeed mov'd us to
ſettle our ſelves there, for ſome
Moneths.</p>
            <p>Here wee ſtayd not to ſee the
rarities of the Place, which are
not many in number; but to
get ſome knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
in the Vulgar Tongue,
however <hi>Siena</hi> deſerves a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſcription then my pen
can afford it; for neatneſſe and
gentility, yielding to no other
in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the entrance of the <hi>Porta
Camulia,</hi> or <hi>di Fiorenza,</hi> onely
the higher buildings are in
view; but out of the <hi>Porta Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:169401:49"/>
the City ſeemes to raiſe
it ſelfe with a great deale of
Majeſty; chiefly becauſe of the
many Towers it hath, which
during the time of its Liberty,
were rais'd in honour of ſuch
and ſuch men as had done any
worthy ſervice for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
amongſt theſe
Towers which ſtand yet as
ſignes of its formerly poſſeſt
Freedome; that of <hi>Mangio</hi>
ſurpaſſeth for height, which
though its foundations be in
the Bottome of the <hi>Piazza,</hi> yet
outtops all the City beſides, It
ſerves now for the Clock-houſe;
From above is a faire
proſpect even to the confines
of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> below at the foot
of this hidious Structure, is a
Chappell of Marble, where on
ſet dayes Maſſe is ſaid to the
People in publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:169401:50"/>
To this joynes the Senate
houſe, built by the <hi>Goths,</hi> as
ſome conceive by the manner
of the Architecture. At one
end thereof ſtands a Pillar,
bearing <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi>
ſucking the Wolfe, in braſſe,
which are the Armes of <hi>Siena,</hi>
an infallible argument of its
Antiquity, and certainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the <hi>Romans,</hi> of
whom this City was a Colony.
There are frequently more of
the like pillars about the Town
upon one more decayed, then
the reſt is ingraved-<hi>Memores
Huberum,</hi> old, very old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Piazza,</hi> which lies
in the heart of the City, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fancie a more pleaſing or
commodious Place; tis of a
large Compaſſe, reſembling
(whether naturally ſo, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169401:50"/>
made ſo I know
not) the faſhion of a <hi>Cockle</hi>
ſhell, in the midſt is a Marble
Fountaine of curious worke,
wherein out of the Wolves
mouthes comes water. This
place is pav'd with the ſame
materiall as all the ſtreets of the
City are, to wit, Brick; ſo that
here and indeed throughout all
<hi>Siena,</hi> in the fowleſt weather
one may walke as cleane as
within dores. The houſes are
for the moſt part Brick, built
<hi>alla Moderna,</hi> the chiefeſt is
that of the Pope, and the
Arch biſhops, who is of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the <hi>Picolominys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Strada larga</hi> lives the
Prince <hi>Matthias,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Florence's</hi> Brother, a man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courteous to ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>Cloſe by his Palace is the
<hi>Dome,</hi> or Cathedrall Church of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169401:51"/>
               <hi>Sienna,</hi> which though in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of others in <hi>Italy</hi> is
but ſmall, yet for the great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
and expence which it muſt
needs have coſt, tis inferiour
to none, tis both without and
within of Black and white
Marble; The <hi>Facade</hi> is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
garniſht with ſtatues;
About the inſide are the heads
of all the Popes; The Pulpet
is an unparalelld piece, beſet
with figures of Marble. But
that ſingularity which this
Temple boaſts of above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is the pavement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many parts of the ſacred hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
are ſo lively repreſented
in ſeverall colours of Marble,
as no penſill can come neere it,
though many Maſters take pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
from thoſe ſtones. Going
up to the high Altar, at the left
hand is the Library, painted
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169401:51"/>
by <hi>Raphel d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino;</hi> On the
ſame ſide is a Chappell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is kept the arme of S. <hi>John
Baptiſt,</hi> which (as an Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there manifeſteth) was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a Pope by the King of
<hi>Peloponeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oppoſite to the <hi>Dome</hi> is the
Hoſpitall, whither all Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimmes
in their paſſage to
to <hi>Rome,</hi> may come and take
two or three meales <hi>gratis.</hi> In
the Chappell lyes the body of
their founder <hi>B. Suſorius,</hi> as
yet uncorrupted though nine
hundred yeares ſince he dyed.</p>
            <p>Going downe the Hill, from
the Hoſpitall, one comes to the
<hi>Ponte Brande,</hi> which is a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitoire
of Fiſh, not ſo much
for the publick uſe, as delight,
or paſtime.</p>
            <p>Hard by is the Houſe where
<hi>Santa Catharina</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> liv'd,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169401:52"/>
which, though a place of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
devotion, yet not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
as the <hi>Madonna di Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzana.</hi>
From hence going
up the hill, by the <hi>Dominicans</hi>
one ſees the Fortification, the
onely defence of the City, and
there by the <hi>Cavalrizza,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the ſommer all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
retire a <hi>Spaſſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The walls of <hi>Siena</hi> are of an
exceeding compaſſe, yet but
ſlight, coverd with <hi>Caper</hi> trees;
that fruit growing beſt in that
Soyle, to wit, Morter.</p>
            <p>The Country about <hi>Sienna,</hi>
principally towards the <hi>Marem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
or Marſhes, is filld with all
ſorts of great Chaſe, ſo that
wilde Boare, and other veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in its ſeaſon is ſold in the
Butchers ſhops, as commonly
as other fleſh.</p>
            <p>In a word, I found <hi>Sienna</hi> the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169401:52"/>
moſt commodious place a
ſtranger could pick out to live
retiredly, and make his time

The territorie of <hi>Freſcati,</hi> as
it was the ancient delight of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> ſo it is as yet coverd
with Gardens and Villas, about
ten Cardinalls having their
Countrey ſeats there. A place
of ſuch raviſhing delights, as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
for the Gods to inhabit
then men. Such is the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of trees, which keep perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
green, the murmuring
of Fountaines and the like.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the the Villa's, the
chiefe, and which wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declares the ingenuity of the
<hi>Italians,</hi> is the <hi>Aldobrandina,</hi>
which for diviſes in water is the
firſt within or without <hi>Rome,</hi>
I think I may ſay in the world.
Quite through the garden, falls
a Cataract, or deluge of water,
towards the Embuſhment of
which, ſtand two Serpentin
Pillars of Moſaick, from the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169401:84"/>
tops of which, the water creeps
downe; Below in the Court is
that admirable Fountaine, in
which is repreſented <hi>Atlas</hi>
throwing up water, which
forceth artificiall Thunder, and
a perfect Rainbow; Whil'ſt the
Elements ſeeme here to bee at
difference; A Satyre blowes a
horne lowder then I ever heard
a man; And <hi>Pan</hi> in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,

upon the Organes: Things

a place cald the terreſtiall
Paradiſe, and not undeſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for as the other inventions
are mov'd by water, ſo theſe
goe by wind. At the end of it
is faſhiond a hill, <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:169401:84"/>
whereon ſet the nine Muſes

ſome Maſter was playing on
them, but looking wee ſaw
they went of themſelves, the
cauſe of all this wee afterwards
ſaw; In the midſt of the roome,
there being a Hole out of wch

that for halfe a quarter of an

            <p>Leaving <hi>Freſcati,</hi> that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone
we paſt by <hi>Diana's</hi> Lake,

foure in breadth, about foure
and fourty in all. The materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
tis plaiſterd with, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
is as durable as ſtone, yet
no man knowes of what it is
compos'd, ſome conceive it to
be of the whites of Egges, and
duſt of Marble mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>From hence leaving <hi>Lucullus</hi>
his houſe at the left, wee went
downe into the <hi>Cento Camerel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi>
or <hi>Nerôs</hi> hundred Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
where hee kept his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
a moſt hidious place.</p>
            <p>Below that towards the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
is the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi>
the place where <hi>Agrippina, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi>
Mother was kild, the Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
of <hi>Hortenſius, Tacitus</hi>
his ſons houſe, with many other
ancient fragments which we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169401:102"/>
ſaw though with much paines.</p>
            <p>From thence we tooke boat
for <hi>Baia,</hi> where the Caſtle built
by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth of <hi>France</hi> is
ſtrong, going thither we could
diſcerne the foundations of
<hi>Cimeria,</hi> and old <hi>Baia</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Sea, with the <hi>Via
Conſularis</hi> overwhelm'd by
the water, and on the ſhoare
nothing but ruines.</p>
            <p>Hereabouts <hi>Caron</hi> was feign'd
to paſſe with his Boate. Here
we ſet againe to Land, and ſaw
the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
figures, and her Pallace
of the ſame worke. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Diana</hi> at the left, the
Bathes of <hi>Trullius;</hi> The houſes
of <hi>Marius Pompey, Nero</hi> ſtanding
aloft.</p>
            <p>Hereabout the Sea water is
naturally hot: Hard by we went
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169401:102"/>
into <hi>Ciceros</hi> Bathes, as gallant
and entire an Antiquity as any
in the <hi>Tract</hi> of <hi>Pozzuolo;</hi> Theſe
waters were ſo ſoveraigne, not
many years ſince over moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
that over every Bath
was written for what cures it
was good, of which Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſome letters yet ſtand, but
the Phyſitians of <hi>Palermo</hi> (as
they tell the ſtory) finding thoſe
waters prejudiciall to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
went with inſtruments
expreſly, and demoliſht thoſe
writings (ſo that for the preſent
they are unuſefull) the ſaid
Phyſitians, being all caſt away
in their returne.</p>
            <p>From theſe Bathes we went
up to the Stowes of <hi>Tritola</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
hot, even to Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
yet contrary to the
<hi>Grottadel Cane,</hi> that choking
below, and harmeleſſe above,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169401:103"/>
theſe coole and refreſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but almoſt ſtifeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
            <p>From thence we took horſe,
and paſt by the <hi>Lacus Lucrinus,</hi>
the greater part whereof is now
coverd with the <hi>Monte Nuovo,</hi>
which mountaine (as their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is) was rais'd in one
night, a mile high, from the
aſhes which came out of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatara,</hi>
and ſo coverd the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crin
Lake. Tommaſo Fonnare</hi> an
old man of <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> that dyed
three yeares ſince remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
of that mountaines being
made in one night a hundred
yeares agoe.</p>
            <p>After that wee rode to the
<hi>Lake Avernus,</hi> where abouts
was the <hi>Poets Acheron</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
into hell, at one ſide of
the Lake is the Temple of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo;</hi>
at the other, the <hi>Sybilla
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169401:103"/>
Cumanas</hi> Grotte. Tis very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
at the end is a Magnificent
aſcent where the Oracle ſtood,
with the way that lead to <hi>Cuma,</hi>
Her bath yet ſtands, and her
Chambers painted in Moſaick
worke, yet all under ground,
as indeed moſt of the aforeſaid
Antiquities (excepting the
Temples) are.</p>
            <p>In returning to <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi>
we ſaw the Mount <hi>Gaurus,</hi> from
whence came the beſt <hi>Falernum,</hi>
now cald <hi>Barbaro,</hi> it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſterile. In <hi>Puteoli</hi> there
are ſome Antiquities, as the
Temple of <hi>Neptune,</hi> &amp;c. In the
Port are the vaſt ruines of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulas</hi>
Bridge, which paſt three
mile croſſe the Sea, from <hi>Pozzu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oles</hi>
to <hi>Baia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After dinner wee went back
to <hi>Naples,</hi> In the way wee ſaw
the Lions, Auſtriches, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169401:104"/>
wild beaſts and fowles, that
a certaine Prince keeps.</p>
            <p>Having repos'd a day after
this troubleſome, yet ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
voyage of <hi>Pozzuoles,</hi> the
next morning wee ſet out of
the quite contrary part of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to ſee that Miracle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Brother of <hi>Aetna, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius,</hi>

Upon this Hill, or (chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Letter) Hell is a goodly
Countrey for the ſpace of foure
mile on all ſides, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
produc't the excellent <hi>Graeco,</hi>
made barren, being coverd
with a matter like Seacole Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Going up higher tis hidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to behold the deep cracks
in the Earth, through which
the ſtreames of Sulphure paſt,
all about lyes ſcatterd the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
materialls it caſt forth;
Some like mettall, other like
Pitch, Brimſtone and the like,
with ſuch vaſt ſtones, as (I
ſpeake the leaſt) foure porters
would not able to carrie one of
them</p>
            <p>Being come ſo neere the top,
as we could with our horſes, we
were forc't to alight, and to
crawle up the ſteeper part,
which is all coverd with a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169401:106"/>
ſubſtance, that ſounds like
earthen veſſells, ſome conceive
it to be Pumie ſtone burnt, after
this wee got up though weary
to the top; where the <hi>Vorago</hi> is
ſo terrifying a ſpectacle, that if
I would paint Hell, this would
be the beſt Patterne; It is a hole
about three mile in compaſſe,
and about halfe as much in
depth, in the midſt is a new hill
that ſtill vomits thick ſmoke,
which the fire within hath rais'd
within few yeares, it daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,

after the cauſe of this
inteſtine fire chang'd lives with
Death on this Mountaine.</p>
            <p>In returning, as we were tir'd
in getting up, ſo wee went ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
down, though almoſt up to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169401:106"/>
the knees in aſhes.</p>
            <p>This Mountaine was the <hi>

Meta</hi> of our voyage to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
wherefore having with
much content ſeen theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
things of Antiquity,
Nature, and Curioſity; after
ſome few dayes we parted from
<hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> treading the
ſame path we had before trac't,
At our going out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they made us pay five
times, for our Vallees, although
they could finde no prohibited
goods; At our entrance they
let us paſſe quietly, without
paying a farthing.</p>
            <p>All the way to <hi>Rome</hi> I ſaw
nothing obſervable, but what
I had before ſpoken of, onely
I would not omit the great
quantity of <hi>Bufferos</hi> (Beaſts
which furniſh the Souldiery
with their skins) that we met in
the Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:169401:107"/>
The day after our returne to
<hi>Rome,</hi> wee walkt to <hi>San Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiano,</hi>
where a mercenary Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
let us downe into the <hi>Roma
Sotterranea,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> under
ground, thoſe hallowed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes
where the Church in her
Infancy ſhelterd her ſelfe from
perſecution; there is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Folio out on this Subject.
Tis now indeed a City for the
Dead, where in every ſtreet are
pild gradually one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Corps of Martyrs, to
which ſome Monuments are
added with no other Epitaphs
then this, <hi>Pro Chriſto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place is as ſtupendious
for the rarity as venerable for
the Antiquity: The natives of
<hi>Rome</hi> know not how farre theſe
Vaults continue under the
Earth; yet ſome miles they ſay
are already diſcoverd, with ſo
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169401:107"/>
many <hi>Maeanders,</hi> that hee who
adventures to enter without an
experienc't Guide may (as ſome
<hi>French</hi> men did) goe into his
grave living, yet increaſe the

            <p>From thence wee went into
the <hi>Tranſtevere,</hi> ſaw firſt <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio,</hi>
formerly the <hi>Janiculum,</hi>
and the Chappell where <hi>(ut

In the Church lies buried

<hi>Porta di San Lorenzo</hi> five miles
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169401:108"/>

the Mother of <hi>Severus;</hi> A

            <p>The Grotte of Nature where

The heats growing on at

               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:169401:112"/>
All the time of our ſtay at

a Race of <hi>Barbaries,</hi> which ran

            <p>The ſame Moneth wee went

            <p>

where tarrying one day, the

for <hi>Venice,</hi> paying ſeven
Crownes a man.</p>
            <p>Six miles up the <hi>Apennin</hi> we
paſt by <hi>Pratolin,</hi> a famous ſeat
of Pleaſance belonging to the
great Duke; and about as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miles farther wee dind at <hi>Il
Ponte,</hi> before which lies a moſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169401:113"/>
delicious Valley, environd with
very high mountaines.</p>
            <p>After dinner, about two miles
farther, wee paſt through <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peria,</hi>
from whence we mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more and more up the <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins,</hi>
The way in ſome places
but ſtreight, &amp; on the right hand
is a very ſteep Precipes down to
the plaine below. All that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
we rode up and down
hills, which are as much fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as barren, and at night we
lodgd at <hi>Fiorenzuolo,</hi> a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe
which ſtands in the midſt
of the Mountaines, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiues
of the great Dukes Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toire.</p>
            <p>The next morning depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
long before break of day,
(as the <hi>Procaccios</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169401:114"/>

            <p>All that forenoone wee had

with our Conductor, to
ſtay the reſt of that day, and
halfe the following, that wee
might take a more full view of
this famous City of <hi>Bolonia,</hi>
the ſecond in the <hi>Stato della
Chieſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſituated at the foot of the
<hi>Appenins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bolonia</note> the neighbouring
Countrey producing ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of things neceſſarie
to humane life, that it hath got
the name <hi>Bolonia</hi> the Fat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:169401:114"/>
For ſtrength it is not much
conſiderable, there being but a
ſingle wall without Bulwarks,
Ramparts or the like, Tis a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
habitation for the Muſes,
then for <hi>Mars,</hi> the fame of that
Univerſity which flouriſheth
there, making this Motto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>BOLONIA DOCET.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the things I tooke
notice of at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> the firſt is
the generall uniformity in the
buildings, there running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the houſes, a very ſtately
Cloyſter, with Arches all of the
ſame ſtructure, ſo that a large
ſtreet appeares one building,
which manner though it differ
from the ordinary Italian way,
yet is no leſſe admirable</p>
            <p>Amongſt other faire edefices
of this City, the Popes Pallace
very ſpacious, is chiefe, over
the Gate is the ſtatue of a Pope
in mettall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:169401:115"/>
Before this Pallace is the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza,</hi>
as remakable as moſt in
<hi>Italy:</hi> In the midſt ſtands a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſumptuous Fountaine, where
the Braſen <hi>Neptune</hi> made by
<hi>John of Bolonia,</hi> a famous Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer
is very conſiderable, at
one end of this Place is the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
not yet finiſht.</p>
            <p>The great Schooles are ſaid
to be as ſtately as moſt in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
And likewiſe the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls
are worth ſeeing The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
at <hi>Bolonia</hi> are generally
very glorious, eſpecially <hi>S.
Dominick,</hi> and out of the Town
<hi>S. Michael in Boſco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In briefe, the <hi>Bolonians</hi> agree
with the other <hi>Italians,</hi> in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their houſes built decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in their Courts, ſtill
have ſome Verts ſet, as Orange
trees, Cypreſſes, or the like,
which much pleaſeth the eye
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169401:115"/>
of a ſtranger, as he paſſeth the
ſtreets.</p>
            <p>In the heart of the City, ſtands
the Tower of the <hi>Aſinelli:</hi>
(cald ſo from a Family that
rai'sd it) ſome making <hi>Bolonia</hi>
to repreſent the forme of a ſhip,
ſet this for the maine Maſt. It
is growne ſomewhat to decay
through time, and the ſtaires
are very rotten, however, wee
adventurd to goe up to the top,
and from thence wee had a full
view of the Towne below,
with the ſtreets lying in a
ſtraight line, as likewiſe a
faire Proſpect on the plaines of
<hi>Lombardy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On one ſide of this Tower,
is another cald <hi>Gariſenda,</hi> which
ſeemes to fall much after the
manner of the <hi>Campanile,</hi> at
<hi>Piſa,</hi> ſome impute it to the
Architecture, others ſay it was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169401:116"/>
of the ſame height with that of
the <hi>Aſinelli;</hi> but the Citizens
fearing it would fall, pull'd
downe the upper part, and left
the reſt ſtanding crooked, as at
the preſent it doth.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of what I
ſaw in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> yet berore I
went from thence, I tooke a
taſte of thoſe famous Saltſages,
that are compos'd at <hi>Bolonia,</hi>
the which are tranſported
thence, not onely into other
places of <hi>Italy,</hi> but alſo into
diverſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as a
rare and coſtly diſh, which
addes and maintaines her Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite
<hi>Bolonia La Graſſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Bolonia</hi> for our
more free entrance into the
State of <hi>Venice,</hi> wee tooke a Bill
of Health.</p>
            <p>The firſt day we paſt the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
that goes to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169401:116"/>
our boate drawne by a
Horſe, in which way we went
through about nine <hi>Suſtegne,</hi>
Machines not much unlike our
Sluſes, to keep up and let down
the water for the turning of all
ſorts of Milles, and the paſſage
of Boates.</p>
            <p>Towards Evening wee paſt
by <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> a Caſtle that
gave denomination to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Cardinall of that name.</p>
            <p>Some two houres later, wee
came to <hi>Mal Albergo,</hi> an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Inne, both in name and
in deed, where having poorely
ſupt, wee imbarqu't in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leſſe Boate, and having paſt
all night through the fennes,
The next morning we arriv'd at
<hi>Ferrara.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ferrara.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Ferrara</hi> heretofore a Dutchy
by it ſelfe, yet now ſubject to
the Apoſtolique See, is more
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169401:117"/>
conſiderable for ſtrength, then
beauty, however it is in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and therefore <hi>(ſecundum nos)</hi>
no meane City.</p>
            <p>Its ſcituation is on a plat, ſo
that by it runnes two Channels,
the one towards <hi>Bolonia,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards the <hi>Po,</hi> it is forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with very faire Ramparts,
upon moſt of which are planted
Allies of trees.</p>
            <p>Within the Towne are ſome
faire buildings, as the <hi>Palazzo
del Diamante,</hi> belonging to the
Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> the Caſtle
where, in the Court are pictur'd
the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and tis
ſaid that at the laſt, there was no
Roome left for another</p>
            <p>Before the Pallace are two
ſmall Statues of a Marquis, and
Duke of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> many other
things are obſervable, as the
Epitaph of the famous Poet
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169401:117"/>
               <hi>Arioſtus,</hi> and of many other
famous men buried there,
which my ſhort ſtay would not
admit me to collect.</p>
            <p>Our Inne was the <hi>Angelo</hi> (a
too ſumptuous edifice to have
been made a Taverne) where
having dind, wee went by boat
downe the Channell, and about
three mile beyond <hi>Ferrara</hi> came
into the <hi>Po,</hi> which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and fartheſt navigable river
in <hi>Italy,</hi> for breadth and length
much above <hi>Tyber</hi> it ſelfe; the
ancients cald it <hi>Padus,</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
<hi>Erydanus,</hi> on the Bankes
whereof they feignd that, <hi>Io</hi>
transformd into a heifer was
want to feed.</p>
            <p>About evening wee came on
the confines of the <hi>Venetian</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoire,
and ſupt at <hi>Corbua,</hi> a
place three miles diſtant from
that moſt ancient, yet now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

City <hi>Adria,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
gave the name of <hi>Mare
Adriaticum,</hi> to the Sea now cald
the <hi>Golfe of Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three miles farther, wee
changd our Barke for a bigger
Veſſell, to carrie us to <hi>Venice,</hi>
and having now paſt thirty
miles on the <hi>Po,</hi> we came ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
by an artificiall cut into
the River <hi>Adice (Atheſis in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin)</hi>
that paſſeth by <hi>Verona;</hi>
and the next morning, about
the opening of the day, wee
enterd into the Golfe, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by <hi>Chioza,</hi> a City in an
Iſland on the left, <hi>Paleſtina</hi> on

that lay rang'd in a row to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
it ſelfe, where, wee arriv'd

being come to the Port, wee
(as the cuſtome and order is)
were not permitted to ſet foot
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169401:118"/>
on ſhoare, on paine of death,
till wee had a ticket of licence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Venetia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Venice.</note> is a word never heard
of in the Romans dayes, the
originall of this name being not

I could never conceive
how ſo ſtately Pallaces, how ſo
compacted a City ſhould ſtand
in the midſt of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The particularities whereof
are theſe. I may begin with the

ſtill tend: The Platforme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <p>At the end juſt before the

            <p>
               <hi>Saint Marks Church</hi> is not

            <p>The whole facade, or Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece,

of Braſſe, moſt worthy Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees,
taken (as ſome ſay) by a

And firſt ſtood in an Arch-Triumphall
at <hi>Rome.</hi> Amongſt
the imagiry worke on this
Church, there ſtands a woman
ſtroking a Dog; The Venetian
Annals mention the ſtory, of
a Senators Daughter, who
(her Father altogether, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169401:121"/>
her of ſociety with
men) had a prodigious Birth
by that over familiar Play-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>For the inward part of this
Temple, It is a little obſcure
within, yet moſt richly weneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coted
with Marbles, and the
whole top coverd with lively
pieces in Moſaick worke: An
Art loſt or unknowne in theſe
parts, and highly valued there.</p>
            <p>Neere that Church gate, that
lookes into the Sea, is a little
Chappell, and therein is an ill
hewd image of the Lady, made
(as their Tradition goes) out
of the ſame rocke, which <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſtrooke when the water mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
guſhed forth; And to
make good this ſtory, they
ſhew three little holes out of
which the Fountaine came
forth. Some probability there

In honour of this Saint,
here is likewiſe conſervd a moſt

            <p>To this Cathedrall Church
joynes the Dukes Pallace whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Marble, with a Kingly
Arcade of three and thirty Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
under which, tis a moſt
comely ſight to ſee the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
in their long Gownes, daily
conſulting of State affaires.</p>
            <p>Juſt againſt the great Gate, at
the top of the ſteps, ſtand two
<hi>Coloſſes,</hi> the one of <hi>Mars,</hi> the
other of <hi>Neptune,</hi> works of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Sanſovinus.</hi> Oppoſite to
theſe ſtaires is a Facade of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne.</p>
            <p>Above is a moſt royall <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridor;</hi>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169401:122"/>
and higher are moſt gallant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents

            <p>Below in the Court, in going

two Wells in Braſſe, of very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
art.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the place
is the <hi>Zecca,</hi> where they coine
money, and the <hi>Procuratorio;</hi>
on the top of this ſtructure
ſtand five and twentie Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventeenth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
whilſt wee were at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
there was a new made
<hi>Procurator,</hi> (the ſecond man in
the Republick) enterd into his
office, at which ſolemnity wee
ſaw the Senatours in their robes
of Scarlet, Damaske, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
moſt grave, proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
every one ſpeaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
no leſſe then an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169401:123"/>
in his deportment.</p>
            <p>The following morning, the
Secretarie of the State, of the
Family of the <hi>Tommaſini,</hi> for
appearing a favourite to ſome
<hi>Banditas,</hi> was privately ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and his body afterwards
hung up in the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which place brings mee
againe into my deſcription, it
being Between the two Pillars
that ſtand towards the <hi>Canale
della Giudeca.</hi> Theſe two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomnes
were brought out of
<hi>Greece,</hi> on the one ſtands the
Statue of <hi>Sanct. Theodorus,</hi> with
the Crocodile, on the other
<hi>Saint Markes</hi> Lion of Braſſe.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of what is
to be noted within, and about
the <hi>Piazza San Marco,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I leave it, tis worth the
paines to get up <hi>Saint Marks</hi>
ſteeple, which ſtands by it ſelfe,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169401:123"/>
eightie feet diſtant from the
Church.</p>
            <p>From thence one may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
how the City lies compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of many little Iſlands,
ſeparated by Channells, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Bridges, the number
whereof, if well reckoned up,
comes to foure hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the greater part of ſtone.
The faireſt and moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is the Bridge of <hi>Rialto,</hi>
which, though but of one Arch,
yet for the height, length, and
breadth, hath no where a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</p>
            <p>Upon it ſtand twelve ſhops,
at each ſide coverd all alike
with lead, and behind magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<hi>Baluſtrades.</hi> This Bridge
paſſeth over the <hi>Canal Grande,</hi>
along which are the moſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
houſes in all <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a moſt ſatisfactory
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169401:124"/>
ſight to behold the <hi>Corſo</hi> in this
Channell, every Feaſt towards
the Evening, to ſee the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Ladies habited like
Nymphs, and the <hi>Gondola's</hi>
like ſo many Daulphines run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a race. Theſe <hi>Gondolas</hi>
are Boats, which becauſe of
the little uſe of walking a foot
there, are ſtill carrying ſome
paſſenger one way or another.
Every noble <hi>Venetian</hi> keeps
one of theſe Seacoaches for his
family, and others there are to
be hir'd by any man for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
very genteel and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Hence one may eaſily conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
how populate <hi>Venice</hi> is;
for the number of <hi>Gondolas</hi> is
40000. ſo that in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
the Boatmen would make
a conſiderable army, for every
<hi>Gondola</hi> hath a Rower, and the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169401:124"/>
better ſort too. And now I am
on the water, before I ſet foot to
land, I may viſite ſome of the
neigbouring Iſlands, and firſt
<hi>Murano</hi> a mile diſtant from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here continually (excepting
in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September)</hi> are
Fornaces to make Glaſſes,
which for the variety of the
worke, and the Chryſtall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
exceed all others in the
world, and are tranſported to
all parts: out of which mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
<hi>Venice</hi> drawes infinite
ſummes of money.</p>
            <p>In returning wee ſtept into
the <hi>Arſenall,</hi> The Magazine and
ſtore-houſe of Warre, <hi>Mars</hi>
his warehouſe. In this place the
Republick hath all ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Sea and Land, all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of offence and Defence,
all preparations for ſhipping ſo
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169401:125"/>
ready, that tis ſaid they can
raiſe a Gally in foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
houres, and though the late
approach of their common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
the <hi>Turke,</hi> hath much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſht
this <hi>Arſenal,</hi> yet the
daily labours of Artiſans that
worke there, ſtill reſtore it.</p>
            <p>The next day wee went to
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, where at
their ſervice in their owne
tongue, there was a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
who us'd more Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
but leſſe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which calls the <hi>Greeks</hi> Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
onely, becauſe they
differ not much in exteriours
from them; but will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Pope to bee
head of the Church.</p>
            <p>Neither have the Orientall
Chriſtians alone this Liberty at
<hi>Venice,</hi> but <hi>Loyalas</hi> Sonnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169401:125"/>
exild thence, the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reacheth not ſo far as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which made us <hi>Hereticks</hi>
(as they call us) thinke wee
were come out of the Land of
Bondage, to a more ſecure
Country.</p>
            <p>The day following wee made
a <hi>Gondola</hi> carry us over to <hi>San
Georgeo,</hi> an Iſland with a moſt
beautifull Monaſtery; The
Chappell is pav'd (as generally
they are in <hi>Venice)</hi> with a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
Marble, About the Coire
are very rare Statues, and in the
Cloiſter, ſits <hi>Venice Triumphant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence wee went to
<hi>San Giovanni e Paulo,</hi> more in
devotion to the living Ladies,
then to the dead Image there
worſhipt.</p>
            <p>This Place is much frequent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Venetian</hi> walking
May Poles, I meane the women,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169401:126"/>
which gives mee occaſion to
ſpeake of the common habits or
faſhions of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Citizens rich and poore
follow all the ſame Mode, <hi>viz:</hi>
A long black gowne with wide
ſleeves, and a kinde of skirt to
throw over one ſhoulder, the
collar alwayes open, and a
Black Cap edg'd with Fringe of
Wooll.</p>
            <p>The Ladies have found out a
deviſe very different from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Europaeian</hi> Dreſſes. They
weare their owne, or a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Haire below the ſhoulders,
trim'd with gemmes, and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
their Coats halfe too long for
their bodies, being mounted
on their <hi>Chippeens,</hi> (which are
as high as a mans leg) they
walke between two handmaids,
majeſtickly deliberating of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſtep they take.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:169401:126"/>
This faſhion was invented,
and appropriated to the noble
<hi>Venetians</hi> wives, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to diſtinguiſh them from
the Courteſans, who goe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd
in a vaile of white Taffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Theſe faſhions, becauſe they
are not ſo variable as ours, I
have here inſerted.</p>
            <p>Before the Church I laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>San Giovannie Paulo</hi> is
a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> or horſeman in
Braſſe, with theſe words.</p>
            <p>Bartholomeo Coleono Bergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſi

            <p>This is the chiefe of what I
obſerv'd in three weeks reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
at <hi>Venice.</hi> As concerning
the trade, or traffique of this
City, ſhee is without Doubt,
Miſtris of all others; it is ſhee
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169401:127"/>
that makes riſe or fall the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
at her pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And this I imagine proceeds
from the great and innumerable
company of <hi>Jewes,</hi> that are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourd
here, and that enjoy the
Priviledge of a Synagogue for
every Nation; ſo that in their
<hi>Guetta</hi> they have nine diverſe
ones, yet weare they a Badge of
diſtinction, <hi>viz:</hi> a Scarlet hat.
The ſhops at <hi>Venice</hi> are moſt

            <p>About five miles from <hi>Venice</hi>

One day walking to ſome of
thoſe places, I eſpi'd a good faire
Chappell put to no better uſe
then a Barne, asking the reaſon,
twas told me it had been a Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
Church; an argument that
thoſe Religious States-men are
not welcome where the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
ſway the ſword; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have the <hi>Loyaliſts</hi> one
Colledge in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Cities.</p>
            <p>As for the Churches of <hi>Padua,</hi>
that of <hi>Saint Anthony</hi> deſerves
the firſt place. Before the dore
is a Man and Horſe of Braſſe,
within is a moſt precious Altar,
under which lies the body of <hi>S.
Anthony,</hi> about is his life and
miracles in figures of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
cut by the moſt famous
Maſters of thoſe times, or (I
thinke) that ever were, or will
be.</p>
            <p>Hard by this Church is <hi>Il prato
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169401:134"/>
della Valle</hi> a Medow, at the end
whereof ſtands that moſt weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Chappell is an incomparable
piece.</p>
            <p>In the Cloyſters an Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
might ſpend a yeares ſtudy;
for amongſt the Legend ſtories
deſign'd on the walls, they have
inſerted hundreds of old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
with the Draughts of
old ſtones, and pieces of Urnes,
all which were dug up out of
the ground, when the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this Convent were firſt
laid</p>
            <p>A little farther is the Phyſick
Garden, fild with ſimples, but
the <hi>Euganean</hi> Hills furniſh <hi>Padua</hi>
more abundantly with medeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Herbes.</p>
            <p>Theſe hills are in view from
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169401:134"/>
               <hi>Padua,</hi> and have been alwayes
famous for the Medecinall

            <p>Having ſpent a week in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi>
the Gentlemen wee left at

            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Padua</hi> we hird a Coach

            </p>
            <p>It was almoſt Vintage time
when wee paſt through this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,

            <p>It is now under the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
and ſtands in the <hi>Marquiſate of

capable of Fortification, it being
ſituated at the bottome of a hill
that commands the Towne,
however the fidelity of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
keep it in ſafety.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vicentins</hi> delight to goe

for which cauſe this city is repu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Neither are they leſſe noble

are much given to ſhewes and

they have erected a Theatre, the

            <p>At our going out of the

ſome Engines which convey

            <p>When wee parted from <hi>Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>

glorious, eſpecially for the

About the body of the

            <p>As theſe divine buildings are
glorious, ſo the private mens

about; fitter to be the Court of

men in; yet no uſe can it be put

            <p>Next to this I reckon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
accounted by all Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
the faireſt, the ſtrongeſt
Fortification or Citadell in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
They are very cautelous
in letting ſtrangers to ſee it, to

When our Guide deſird
