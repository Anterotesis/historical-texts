            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now mingle all this Money well together, and tell me whether any Vintner or Coffee-man, Mercer, Taylor, or Haberdasher, be so quick-sighted in this Town, as to pick out the Popish from the Protestant Money? or if he should, whether any would be so scrupulous, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it for the sake of the two <hi>Cross Scepters?</hi> But what's the pretence all this while? The fairest in the World, even <hi>Loyalty</hi> it self; which by virtue of a certain <hi>Crimson Charm,</hi> these <hi>State-Pharisees</hi> would so engross to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as if all true Loyalty were confin'd within the Circle of a <hi>Scarlet Stayband.</hi> Had it not been for an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator</hi> and an <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> Heav'n knows what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Kingdom ere this. Had not they <hi>stood in the Gap,</hi> and rais'd monstrous Plots, horrid Contrivances, desperate Inventions, and providentially discover'd them, when they had done; had not they Erected vast Bulky

Piles of <hi>Surmises, Leviathan</hi> Fears and Jealousies all over the Nation, and then pull'd 'em down again, the Land had been overwhelm'd with <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and delug'd with <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> God forbid Gentlemen, but <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Disloyalty</hi> should be punish'd with the utmost Rigour of the Law; But for the Loyalty of the greatest part of the Nation, and most considerable for Wealth and Trade, to be blasted and tainted with the venomous breath of <hi>Mercenary</hi> Scandal and Reproach, what is this but the greatest Disloyalty i'the World, to unrivet the Affections of the People, and Eloin their Allegiance from their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign? Certainly, were Disloyalty such a General Crime, it could not be the bleating of a Feeble <hi>Observator,</hi> or a <hi>Shatter-brain'd Heraclitus,</hi> that could stem the Torrent of Universal Resolution. But to come to the point; if Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the King's Law be an Act of Disloyalty, as no man will presume to deny, I find none more guilty then these <hi>Primroses</hi> of Loyalty themselves. For the King's Positive Law enjoyns, <hi>That no person or persons shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume maliciously to call or alledge of, or object against any other person or persons, any Name or Names, or other words of Reproach any way tending to revive the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the late Differences, or the Occasions thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But contrary to this Law, now, put but your Nose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Company, What's such a one? A <hi>Whigg, G—dam him.</hi> What's such a one? A <hi>Fan.

A <hi>Tory.</hi> The Devil take me, if I did not think him an honest Fellow by his looks. Sbud, these <hi>Whigs,</hi> and these <hi>Fans,</hi> they have different Faces from other men. Then cries one, <hi>Would they were all at the bottom of the Sea.</hi> Another wishes for a Discreet Plague, to separate the Sheep from the Goats. Now what is this, but to embroile common Friendship

and humane Society? which once unhing'd, farewel Law; and farewel all Allegiance. Yet upon this Foundation the <hi>Observator</hi> rears the Fabrick of all his weekly <hi>Ribble-rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

            <p>This King in his Proclamation against vicious, debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prophane Persons, dared in the <hi>12th</hi> Year of his Reign, is pleased to declare his Royal Will and Pleasure to this effect</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are likewise another sort of men, of whom we, have heard much, and are sufficiently ashamed, who spend their time in Taverns, Tipling houses and Debauches, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other Evidence of their affection to Us, BUT IN DRINKING OUR HEALTH, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing against all others, who are not of their own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Temper; and who in truth have more DISCRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITED OUR CAUSE, by the License of their Manners and Lives, than they could ever advance it by their Affection or Courage. We hope that they will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after become Examples of Sobriety and Virtue.

            <p>Sir <hi>Mathew Hales</hi> left them this <hi>Encomium, Many of the Presbyterians had merited highly in the business of the Kings Restauration, and at least deserved, that the terms of Conformity should not be made stricter than they were before the War.</hi>

            <p>One would think now that the King might be believed.
