            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Parallel, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MR.</hi> Rogers <hi>firſt Character of himſelf is, that he is</hi> one through grace kept under many ſufferings a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant to Jeſus Chriſt, his Cauſe and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
            <p>The Character that by men of his judgement is but too often given of the People, is, that they are <hi>profane wretches, haters of the godly,</hi> or <hi>of a perſecuting ſpirit.</hi> Whereas if the Jayls be looked into under any Commonwealth that is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, the moſt of the priſoners will be found to be in for matter of Crime, few for Debt, and none at all for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the contrary whereof is known in other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And this is matter of fact, whereof every man, that doth not like Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> give his ſpirit wholly unto Paſſion, and never think himſelf bound either to give or take any one Reaſon or Example, is a competent Judge.</p>
            <p>But men skill'd in common converſation know, that if the People be offended by a man upon whom they live, they are very patient; but if they be offended by a man upon whom they do not live, they are very apt to fly out; and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expreſſion upon this occaſion is, <hi>What care I for him? I can live without him.</hi> From the common and vulgar expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Reaſon or Truth, the whole Spirit of the People, even as to matter of Government, may be defined, which in the definition (becauſe there are but too many who in like compariſons boaſt their Spirit for righteouſneſs, godlineſs and juſtice above that of the People) I ſhall make bold to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with that of Mr. <hi>Rogers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit of the People, where they live by a King, will obey a King very faithfully. Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> is not for a King upon any terms whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The People, where they ſubſiſt by Lords, are always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto their Lords; and where they are under the power of a few by whom they ſubſiſt not, never deſiſt from ſhaking that yoke.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> is not for the Government of Lords, or ſuch as might pretend any ſuch reaſon of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167200:3"/>
but for the Government of a Few, that cannot pretend any ſuch reaſon of their Government; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can have no juſtice nor bottom.</p>
            <p>A people that can live of themſelves, neither care for King nor Lords, except through the meer want of inventing a more proper way of Government; which till they have found, they can never be quiet: wherefore to help a people at this ſtreight, is both the greateſt charity to our neighbour, and the greateſt ſervice that a man can do unto his Country.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> is not onely to have a people that can live of themſelves, to be governed by none other but ſuch as himſelf; but throwing away all modeſty, is a profeſſed enemy to any man that at ſuch a ſtreight, ſhall fairly offer a charity to the people, or a ſervice unto his Country.</p>
            <p>Whether he be wronged thus far, I leave unto the Reader in what follows; where what the ſenſe is, we muſt gueſs; but the words are certainly Mr. <hi>Rogers.</hi> He takes me up, after having handled Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Baxter</hi> like himſelf, in this manner:</p>
            <p>But in the winding up of our diſcourſe, I am ſurpriſed or way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with Mr. <hi>Harrington's</hi> correſpondence with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Oligarchy, (I wiſh he had been as much againſt Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy <note place="margin">Mark his Art in ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering: he dareth not to call me A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by my Writings all Men may know that I am none.</note>or Atheiſm) if he means by it the Parliament, or ſuch a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or the body of adherents to the Cauſe, as one of them I believe he must, and ſome ſay all; (wherein Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and he agree.) But when he tells us his meaning without mumping and ſcoffing, (which we must underſtand before we reply) he may hear further.</p>
            <p>I ever underſtood and explained Oligarchy, without <hi>mump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>ſcoffing,</hi> to be the reign of the few, or of a party, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the main body of the people: yet ſaith he, <hi>From their old Mumpſibus, and his new Sumpſibus, good Lord deliver me.</hi> He ſhould be fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> By the <hi>new Sumpſimus,</hi> he intimates that he means the Government by a Senate and by the People: and the reaſon why he deprecates this by his Letany, is, that moſt undoubtedly it muſt bring in a Single Perſon. This conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he purſueth with much Greek, in which you ſhall ſee how well he underſtandeth that Language, or indeed any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Commonwealth or Author. His firſt Greek Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you may finde at length in his 72. page, importeth that in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> no man ſtood up by the way of Honour,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167200:3"/>
but to a King, or to an <hi>Ephore.</hi> This without mumping or ſcoffing, he Engliſheth thus, <hi>None stood or were raiſed up</hi> (meaning in the Commonwealth of <hi>Lacedemon) but a King and the Ephore;</hi> whence he infers, <hi>That a ſingle Perſon had an Executive Power there.</hi> Then out of <hi>Heraclides</hi> he ſets down a Text which ſhews, that the <hi>Theſmothetae</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> were ſworn not to take Bribes; or if they did, were to pay a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gold to <hi>Apollo;</hi> and this he Engliſheth thus: <hi>The The ſmothets were not to take Bribes, nor to ſet up the golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> which he underſtands of a King: and finding a King-Prieſt in that Commonwealth, (as in ours there is a King-He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald) he concludes that they did ſet up a King; and ſo, that the Senate and the People is a Government inclining to ſet up a ſingle Perſon. Nor is there much of his Quotations out of antient Authors, that is leſs miſtaken, and it may be out of Scripture. You ſhall have but one piece more of him, which is concerning Rotation: of this ſaith he,</p>
            <p>Whether this way be not (of any) the moſt liable to an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraciſme, let any judge? by diſcouraging, laying aſide, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of the Land, the moſt publickly ſpirited Worthies <note place="margin">Well bowld M. <hi>Rogers!</hi>

               </gap>, &amp;c. that their children ſhould learn their Laws with Melody; that from the MUSICK they might take <hi>great pleaſure</hi> in them, and more eaſily commit them to memory. We need no ſuch <hi>Law,</hi> to endear or <hi>dulcifie</hi> our cauſe or the <hi>Laws</hi> of it in the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> If the <hi>foundation</hi> of it be that, which the hand of the <hi>Almighty</hi> hath laid amongſt us both for Church and State; from <hi>Chriſtian Principles,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then from <hi>Paganiſh</hi> or meer <hi>Morals;</hi> it will make moſt excellent Harmony in the ears and hearts of all men and Chriſtians; <hi>And the Governours of Judah ſhall ſay in their hearts, The Inhabitants of ſeruſalem ſhall be my ſtrength, in the Lord of Hosts their God,</hi> Zach. 12. 5. Thus our Governours thought (of them) in the days of ſtraits (and will again ſee it) one of their beſt intereſts, to have their Prayers and their God, as well as their Purſes and Blood engaged for them; and not diſoblige them (upon jealouſies ſuggeſted by the enemy) who for their <hi>virgin</hi> fidelity, and untainted adherence to the Cauſe, may be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did their wives after their innocency did break out, and get above the clouds of ſuſpition and reproach. But if (after all) they will be planting and founding us again in the ſpirit of the Nation, as if God had owned no cauſe, or made no ſignal diſcrimination; or ſhaken no ſuch foundations of the earth, &amp;c. (which their Lord General pretended as one ground of their interruption) which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and others would hurry them into, to the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering of the Cauſe, and the diſobliging the Adherents; then will the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that <hi>keepeth Covenant with his people, and not alter the thing that is gone out of his lips,</hi> Pſal. 89. 34. Act. 2. 30. and 3. 20, 21. raiſe up others in their ſtead, to carry on this his

cauſe, both in the civils and the ſpirituals; and to form another people for himſelf to ſhew forth his praiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 21. <hi>Then they that rule over men, ſhall be juſt, ruling in the fear of God; and they ſhall be as the light of the morning when the Sun ariſeth; A morning without clouds, and as the tender graſs that ſpringeth out of the earth, by a clear ſhining after rain,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 3, 4. which that theſe may be, agrees better with my Prayer, then with his Propoſals <hi>I am ſure.</hi> But thus I leave him whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had Coyted as a ſtumbling-block before me: whom I am not onely gotten over, but I preſume have given a good lift to the removing of him out of others way, (as to the right foundation of the Commonwealth, and ſtating of the cauſe.)</p>
            <p>You might have more; but becauſe it is no better, here is enough. I could never yet finde among men like Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> that my ſpirit is likely to paſs with them for any more then a moral ſpirit: and there is nothing more uſual among Divines that make mention of me, then to call me Mad-man or Atheiſt. On the other ſide, Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> and moſt of them that thus uſe me, hold themſelves to be men of ſanctified ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Yet without boaſting, and upon provocation, I ſubmit it unto the Reader, whether Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> or my ſelf be of the better ſpirit: nor do I blame him ſo much for emptying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf luſtily of that which burdened him; Paſſion in a man is far more pardonable then Malice. He accuſeth me in his Title-page, of Venom and Vilification towards the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Members now in Parliament; which, for any thing he hath ſaid, or can ſay to prove it, is not onely to bear falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt his Neighbour, but in ſeeking the deſtruction of his Neighbour by falſe witneſs, to blaſt a Cauſe which he is no otherwayes able to invade. Let this be conſidered: for if it prove to be the truth of his meaning, it muſt be from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpirit. However, the Reader may now eaſily judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſpirit of the people, excluding no man; or the ſpirit of Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> and ſuch like, which is that which he would have, excluding the people, be the fitter to be truſted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
