            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>MEn and Brethren, theſe are to ſhew you, that I am come here this day to lay down my Life for owning Chriſt and his Truths; and in ſo much as we are Calumniate and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, by lying upon our Names, and dreadful upbraiding of us, with ſaying, That we are not led by the Scriptures, and ſay we have taken other Rules to walk by; I take the Great God to be Witneſs againſt all and every one of them, that I take the Word of God to be my Rule, and I never deſigned any thing but honeſty, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to Chriſt: and for owning of Chriſt and the Scriptures, this day I am murdered; for adhering to the Born-down-truths, I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dy; and I alſo leave my Teſtimony, and bear Witneſs againſt all the Apoſtate Miniſters this day, that have taken favour at the Enemies hands: the only thing they take away my Life for, is, Becauſe I diſowned all thoſe Bloody Traytors not to be Magiſtrates, which the Word of God caſts off, and we are bound in Conſcience and <hi>Covenant</hi> to God, to diſown all ſuch as are Enemies to God, and which they are avowed and open Enemies to Chriſt; <hi>And they have made void my Word, faith the Lord</hi>: Say what ye will De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſay Wretches ſay Enemies, ſay what ye will, we are owning the Truth of Chriſt, and his written Word; and condemn me in my Judgement who will, I leave my Blood on one and all, that ſays we are not led by the Scriptures: I leave my Blood upon you again to be a Witneſs againſt you, and a Condemnation in the great Day of Judgment. I have no more to ſay, I think this may mitigat all your Rage and ſo forth, I leave his Enemies to his Curſe, to be puniſhed into Everlaſting Wrath, for now and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
