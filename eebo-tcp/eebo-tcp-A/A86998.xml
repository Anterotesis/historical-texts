            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſtie, beſeeching you to reſpect their ſerviceable praiers: But not to wander in theſe preliminate <hi>Exordiums,</hi> or to ſuſpend your divine care any longer in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: I ſpeake it not in my owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, but in the generall and univerſall name of the whole Kingdome of England. That in reſpect of theſe manifold perills, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſtratagems in this Kingdome, &amp; the late formidible inſurrection in Ireland, that mother of diſſention, and nurſe of Rebells, your ſacred Majeſty would preview your ſafety, &amp; return into your flouriſhing paradiſe England, with all preſuppoſed expedition: Pardon I pray my boldnes herein: but I ſpeak not this, as if I or we were weary of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment of your bleſſed perſon: No, God (that knows the ſecrets of all hearts) knowes the intent of my unguilty minde in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; for I ſpeak freely, I could both live and dye in the happineſſe of your preſence; But I ſpeake it out of my indulgence to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who have beene alwaies carefull in my ſervice for the ſafety of your royall Perſon.</p>
            <p>For if the Iriſh recuſants ſhould reduce their treaſon-growing malice hitherward, our fortifications are not ſo ſtrong as theirs
<pb facs="tcp:157520:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 11 -->of England, neither can your Majeſty bee ſo ſecure in this Kingdome, as in your owne. Alas! England hath growne big in expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your returne, and I dare boldly ſay, your Royall Conſort the Queene, would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme that a moſt happy day wherein your Majeſty ſhall ſafely returne.</p>
            <p>But the chiefeſt argument that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly incite you hereunto, is that, concerning the Prince, whom (as we heare) <hi>Philips</hi> that father of Papiſtery, did labour to ſeduce; but thankes bee to God, who did avert his wicked imaginations, and according to the Pſalmiſt, Hee that digged a pit of Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh impiety to intrappe that illuſtruous ſtem of Honour, is fallen himſelfe therein; and I hope your Majeſty will deſervedly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his treachery audacity.</p>
            <p>Then a ſecond argument appeares from their inconſtancy of Religion, which (like a wavering door) hangs upon two hinges; and unleſſe your Majeſty doe with an exact rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication confirme the ſettled forme of the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of England, I feare it will ſinke as low in hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call opinions, as it ſwelled before in Popiſh ceremonies: yet theſe are but ſuperficiall Ambages to the reall intent of my heart, which aimes only at your ſecurity; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I confeſſe, that if ten thouſand enemies
<pb facs="tcp:157520:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->
ſhould entrench your Royall perſon, they would ſeem but as a <hi>Pigmie</hi> to <hi>Hercules,</hi> for the irradiation of your ſplendent Majeſty, would (like the ariſing Sunne) diſſipate thoſe miſts of diſloyalty.</p>
            <p>Kings are placed on Gods owne Throne upon earth, therefore whoſoever aimes at them, aimes at the divine nature, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aimes at that, ſhall receive an irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable precipitation; for God doth give his Angels charge over them, who will pitch their tents of defence about them.</p>
            <p>Yet I ingenuouſly acknowledge, that your mature returne to England with opportune tempeſtivity, would kindle the flame of their loves, for they waite in expectation of the eſtabliſhment of a formall reformation.</p>
            <p>One thing eſpecially I beſeech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to take into grave conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> The manifold plots of the Papiſts againſt our Proteſtant Religion. Firſt, that formidable Armado in eighty eight, which was almoſt invincible, had not Gods al-powerfull hand ſcattered them: Then that Hel-begotten plot of Gunpowder-treaſon, which likewiſe God of his infinite mercy did prevent: Then late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe ſtratagems againſt my ſelfe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other noble perſons in this Kingdome, &amp; now laſt of all, thoſe new ſprung up <hi>Hidra's</hi> in Ireland, who like baſe catterpillars crawle
<pb facs="tcp:157520:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->amongſt the fragrant flowers of true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, but I hope Gods impartiall hand will avert their nefarious intents. I beſeech your Majeſty to ponder the precedent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and you will finde, that <hi>Concluſio ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur deteriorem partem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I entreate your Royall minde to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the forme of Religion in this Kingdome, and in reſpect of theſe perilous times whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Majeſty can bee more ſecure here, or in England, I leave that to your owne judgement: In the meane while, I beſeech you accept of my devotion herein, and my prayers both externall, internall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſhall conclude with this inference,</p>
