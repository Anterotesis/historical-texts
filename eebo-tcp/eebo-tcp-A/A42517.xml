            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Privy Council.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT has been none of the leaſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to recommend their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
to the World, by denying
a great part of thoſe <hi>Abuſes</hi> which
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have charged upon it;
<pb facs="tcp:42118:3"/>
and aſcribing that to the meer <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of their <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> which at
the ſame time all, who have ever lived
in thoſe <hi>Countries</hi> in which <hi>Popery</hi>
prevails, cannot but know, is every Day
practiſed among them.</p>
            <p>I am ſufficiently ſenſible how little
need there is for Me to ſay any thing
in Anſwer to this <hi>Pretence,</hi> which has
been ſo fully and ſolidly Confuted in
ſo many Learned <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> as the
late Times produc'd upon this very
<hi>Argument:</hi> And which ought to make
them for ever aſhamed of ſuch <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi>
and <hi>Repreſentations</hi> of their
<hi>Doctrin,</hi> as ſhew rather what the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
of them would have their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
thought to be, than what indeed
it is. But yet having had ſome Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
by my long <hi>Converſation</hi>
among them, to <hi>Obſerve</hi> more, and
penetrate farther into their <hi>Myſteries,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42118:3"/>
than Thoſe who have been always
<hi>Strangers</hi> to their <hi>Communion</hi> can
well be ſuppoſed to have done; I
thought it might not be altogether <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to Communicate my <hi>Reflections</hi>
to the World; and ſhew what <hi>Popery</hi>
is not in the ſmooth <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> of
Deſigning Men, but in the Open <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of it, in thoſe
<hi>Countries</hi> where they Act without <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,</hi>
and look upon themſelves to be
the trueſt and moſt Zealous Obſervers
of it.</p>
            <p>This, My <hi>Lord,</hi> was my Deſign in
Publiſhing the following <hi>Diſcourſes:</hi>
And it is this that emboldens me with
all Humility to preſent them to Your
<hi>Grace,</hi> who is ſo great a <hi>Judge,</hi> and ſo
proper a <hi>Patron</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is, My <hi>Lord,</hi> Your Honour to
Govern a <hi>Church,</hi> than which none has
<pb facs="tcp:42118:4"/>
ever approved it ſelf more firm to the
<hi>Proteſtant Intereſt;</hi> or better deſerved
to be eſteem'd, what by all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men it is allow'd to be, the ſtrongeſt
<hi>Bulwark</hi> againſt <hi>Popery.</hi> But it is
much more, ſo to have been thought
worthy of ſuch a Station, by <hi>Princes</hi> ſo
<hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Diſcerning,</hi> and ſo affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
concern'd for the <hi>Churches</hi> Good.
And it ought not to be wondred, if all
Men deſire his <hi>Patronage,</hi> whoſe <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
are no leſs <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> than His
<hi>Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, My <hi>Lord,</hi> this was not all the
Reaſon I had, for deſiring to prefix ſo
<hi>Great a Name</hi> to my Preſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
I am well aware, that in the
following <hi>Relations</hi> many things will
occur which may perhaps appear a little
Strange to the <hi>Vulgar Reader,</hi> and will
hardly gain Credit with thoſe who do not
know how great the <hi>Extravagances</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:42118:4"/>
Thoſe of the <hi>Other Communion</hi> are,
when they act freely, and according
to the true <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of
their <hi>Religion.</hi> And <hi>Travellers,</hi> as
well as <hi>Poets,</hi> are commonly look'd
upon to be <hi>priviledg'd Perſons;</hi>
whoſe buſineſs it is to ſet off their <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
to the beſt advantage, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they write to ſuch as they
think are not able to confute their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
But I hope when it ſhall be
conſider'd to whom I have adventur'd
to preſent theſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> no man
will after that preſume to Queſtion
the <hi>fidelity</hi> of them; Or think I
ſhould have durſt to intitule your
<hi>Grace</hi> to any thing that I was not
ſure would bear the ſtricteſt Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>May it therefore pleaſe your <hi>Grace</hi>
who have ſo often and Gloriouſly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd
over the <hi>Errors</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:42118:5"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in your own <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
now to give a new force, by the
<hi>Authority</hi> of your <hi>Name,</hi> to what
is here produc'd againſt them. A
<hi>Name</hi> as Venerable to all true <hi>lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of their <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi>
as Terrible to Thoſe who bear a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<hi>Enmity</hi> to Either; and know
both how well Able your <hi>Grace</hi> is,
and how Vigorous they have reaſon
to fear you will be, to diſcover and
defeat their deſigns againſt both.
And may that God, who has been
pleaſed to raiſe up ſo great a <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
to his <hi>Church,</hi> at a time when
it never more ſtood in need of the
<hi>Wiſeſt Conduct,</hi> long continue to

And when you ſhall late have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>WHen I Publiſh'd my LETTERS
the laſt Year, concerning <hi>The Frauds
of Romiſh Monks and Prieſts;</hi> I was in ſome
meaſure reſolved not to have troubled the
World with any more of theſe kind of
Writings: And could have been very well
contented to have given thereby a fair Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to thoſe of that <hi>Religion</hi> to commend
my <hi>Moderation.</hi> But my former <hi>Diſcourſes</hi>
having met with a reception beyond what
I durſt have promiſed my ſelf; and ſeveral
of my <hi>Friends,</hi> for whom I have a very
juſt Eſteem, flattering me, That it would
not be altogether uſeleſs for me to ſuffer
the reſt of my <hi>Obſervations</hi> to ſee the light:
I thought I could not do better than in
following their Advice; and that I ought
rather by this means to teſtifie my Zeal for
the <hi>Reform'd Religion,</hi> than to gratifie the
Humors of the <hi>Contrary Party,</hi> by refuſing
<pb facs="tcp:42118:6"/>
their <hi>Deſires.</hi> I do not think, that in any
thing of this I can juſtly be charged to
have exceeded the <hi>Bounds of Charity;</hi> ſeeing
I am ſure I have kept my ſelf with great
exactneſs, within thoſe of <hi>Truth:</hi> And upon
all Occaſions choſen rather to ſay <hi>too little,</hi>
than <hi>too much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much concerning the
Occaſion of my <hi>Publiſhing</hi> the following
<hi>Treatiſe,</hi> I muſt in the next place deſire the
<hi>Reader</hi> to ſtop ſo long as while I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of an <hi>Objection,</hi> which I am told has
been made againſt my <hi>former Book.</hi> In my
<hi>VIIIth</hi> LETTER, <hi>pag. 398.</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> and
<hi>ſecond Editions,</hi> I related a ſingular Inſtance
of the liberties which the <hi>Monks</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>
allow themſelves in their <hi>Intriegues</hi> with
<hi>Ladies.</hi> There is it ſeems a certain <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
in the World, who having an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Zeal for the Truth, and it may be to
render ſome ſervice to thoſe of the <hi>Other
Religion,</hi> has been willing to take upon
himſelf the ſcandalous <hi>Adventure</hi> which is
there recounted. He pretends that it hapned
whilſt he was at <hi>Venice,</hi> and that himſelf
was the very Perſon concern'd in it. And
from thence would have it thought, that I
<pb facs="tcp:42118:7"/>
take up the ſtories of the <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances</hi>
of <hi>Lay-men,</hi> and put them upon the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi>
only to render them thereby the more
Odious.</p>
            <p>It is not my deſign to rob this <hi>Gentleman</hi>
of the Honour of ſuch a Rencounter. But I
muſt needs intreat the <hi>Reader</hi> to remember
what I have before Remark'd in ſeveral
places of thoſe <hi>Letters,</hi> that the <hi>Stories</hi> I
tell, are no extraordinary Events, but things
that happen frequently and ordinarily in
thoſe <hi>Countries,</hi> where <hi>Popery</hi> reigns in its
full liberty. And therefore that it ought not
to be inferr'd, that becauſe ſuch an <hi>Adventure</hi>
hapned to this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> therefore it did
not alſo happen to the <hi>Monk</hi> of whom I
there ſpeak. This I am ſure, that the <hi>Monk</hi>
boaſted of it to me, as he was going to ſay
<hi>Maſs;</hi> and if occaſion were, I could tell
above VII or VIII <hi>Stories</hi> more of the like
nature; but that I fear I ſhould tire out
my <hi>Reader</hi> with ſo many <hi>Relations</hi> to the
ſame purpoſe.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</head>
            <head>The Firſt Days Journy.</head>
            <p>I Departed from <hi>Rome</hi> the 6th of <hi>May,</hi>
in the Year of our Lord 1686, and by
chance joyn'd Company with an Aged
<hi>Neapolitan</hi> Abbot, who was going to <hi>Velétre.</hi>
He was a Man throughly vers'd in the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had been Secretary to
ſeveral Cardinals. And foraſmuch as I had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42118:14"/>
already conceived a ſufficient averſion for the
Romiſh Religion, the Corruption whereof I
had a fair occaſion to diſcover during my
long abode in <hi>Italy,</hi> I was very deſirous to
underſtand the Sentiments of a Perſon of ſo
great Age and Experience. Wherefore after
having diſcourſed him about indifferent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I inſenſibly put him upon the Point of
the Capacity and Learning of the Clergy of
<hi>Rome.</hi> He ſufficiently ſatisfied me on that
Subject; and in the Account he gave me, he
obſerved ſomething of a Method: For in the
firſt place, he ſpoke to me of the Head of
that Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the POPE; and from
him paſſed to the Principal Members thereof,
which are the CARDINALS, the ARCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BISHOPS,
and ABBOTS, and concluded
his Diſcourſe with the Common PRIESTS
and MONKS.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt of theſe, I mean the Pope,
he told me, That it was a lamentable thing
to ſee in what groſs Ignorance many Popes
lived, of the moſt important Truths of the
Chriſtian Religion; and that he himſelf had
been fain to inform Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>Xth,</hi> of <hi>the
true ſenſe of this Paſſage of the Creed,</hi> Qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus
eſt de Spiritu Sancto, <hi>who was conceived
by the Holy Ghost;</hi> for he inſtead of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
them of the Temporal Conception,
in the Myſtery of the Incarnation, did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
them to the Eternal Generation of the
Word; and according to his Apprehenſion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42118:14"/>
theſe Words, <hi>[Who was conceived by the Holy
Ghoſt, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary,] afforded this
meaning: <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who was Conceived
from all Eternity by the Holy Spirit, was Born in
time of the Virgin</hi> Mary. So that if this Pope
ſhould have undertaken to have determin'd
the Senſe of them according to his Notion,
he would have given us a fine Inſtance of his
Infallibility. His Succeſſor wiſh'd the ſame
Abbot to Explain to him the Nature of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sin, and how the Bleſſed Virgin came to
be exempt from it.</p>
            <p>Now it is worth our Obſervation, that they
were juſt theſe very Popes, the moſt Ignorant
that of a long time had appeared in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who undertook to decide the moſt
important Controverſie which ever was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
in the Church ſince the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi>
the Propugnators of the Efficacious Grace of
S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> being of one ſide, and the Defenders
of Sufficient Grace on the other; I mean, the
Diſpute was maintain'd between the <hi>Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
or <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> otherwiſe
call'd <hi>Moliniſts.</hi> The former of theſe two
Popes had at the firſt no great mind to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
any thing concerning thoſe Points:
For he declared one day to <hi>Luke</hi> of <hi>Holstein,</hi>
his Library-Keeper, That the Solicitations he
had from <hi>France,</hi> to pronounce his deciſion
concerning the Propoſitions of <hi>Janſenius,</hi>
drawn from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> gave him a great deal
of Trouble, becauſe the Queſtion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42118:15"/>
Points that he did not underſtand,
neither had he ever ſtudied them. <hi>Luke</hi> of
<hi>Holſtein</hi> anſwer'd him, That his Holineſs
would do well not to begin at the Age he
was of, to trouble himſelf about the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and much leſs about the deciding
of them; becauſe they were very perplex and
intricate of themſelves; and that they had not
only been the occaſion of great Diſputes
amongſt the Chriſtians, but alſo amongſt the
greateſt Philoſophers of Ancient Times; by
reaſon of the difficulty they found, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the Liberty of Mans Will with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Fore-knowledge of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſome of them embraced one Opinion,
Others, another; as was done ſtill to this day,
and would ſo continue as long as there ſhould
be Men in the World. Whence he inferr'd,
That foraſmuch as it was impoſſible for him
to pronounce a deciſion that might ſatisfie
both Parties, it would be better for him not
to meddle with it at all, but to leave things
in the ſtate he found them till they ſhould
drop of themſelves, as they would without
doubt, whenever the one or other Party (or
both of them together) ſhould be weary of
the Diſputing, and forcing their Opinions
upon their Antagoniſts.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid, The Pope was extreamly pleaſed
with this Advice. In the mean time it was
obſerv'd, that by his frequent Aſſiſting at
many Congregations which were held on this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42118:15"/>
Subject, he at laſt took a great deal of pleaſure
to hear theſe different Doctrins diſcuſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the great Repugnance he had
for them at the firſt; and he attributed this
change in himſelf, to an extraordinary aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Holy Spirit. On a time the
Lady <hi>Olympia,</hi> his Siſter, asked him, <hi>What
Matters were treated of in thoſe Congregations,
that were ſo very pleaſing to his Holineſs?</hi> The
Pope Anſwer'd, That <hi>they were certain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
which ſhe did not underſtand; but that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
ſhe might come to comprehend them, in caſe
ſhe were preſent there whilſt one of the Conſulters
Diſcourſed, who explain'd thoſe Points with the
greateſt clearneſs and perſpicuity.</hi> In a word, All
theſe Conſultations were held on purpoſe, to
give his Holineſs a true Notion of theſe Points
in queſtion. But it ſeems to me, that perſons
who pretend to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ought to be in
poſſeſſion of the <hi>Key of Knowledge,</hi> or at leaſt
do their utmoſt endeavour to obtain it: For
can any thing be imagin'd more ridiculous,
than that a Pope, to whom Application is
made by the whole Church, for the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Doctrins of Faith, ſhould be fain
to treat with others, and to demand time and
opportunity to inform himſelf, by conſulting
his Doctors; and afterwards hear him tell you,
That the very ſame Point of Doctrin, which
a while ago he was ignorant of, is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Truth, and which he alone hath the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to determin?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42118:16"/>
I entreated the Abbot to tell me in good
earneſt, Whether he himſelf, who had been
witneſs of ſo much Weakneſs and Ignorance
in thoſe who are ſeated in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, could
receive all their Deciſions for Infallible? To
which he Anſwer'd, That he rather believ'd
them ſuch by a Faith of his Will, than by a
Faith of Underſtanding. I requeſted him to
explain this diſtinction, which ſeem'd to me
to be ſomewhat obſure, and in which I ſaw
that he plac'd ſomething of Myſtery. He
told me, That the Faith of Underſtanding
carried along with it ſome kind of Evidence,
that its Motives were ſo agreeable with the
Principles of Reaſon, or had ſo cloſe a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon Matters revealed, that they could
not be reſiſted without acting contrary to
good ſenſe; and that by this Intellectual Faith,
we believe there is a God, and that this God
muſt be feared and worſhipped; That he will
reward thoſe that are Good, and puniſh the
Wicked; That Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of
the World, foretold by the Prophets, &amp;c. But
as for the Faith of the Will (continued he)
that is altogether obſcure, we find nothing in
it to ſatisfie our Reaſon, and we believe it only,
becauſe we will believe it. 'Tis by this Faith
(ſaid he) that I believe the Infallibility of the
Pope, and a vaſt number of other things. I
indeed can find nothing that in a human way
can perſwade me of the Truth of them; but
at the ſame time do perceive in my Soul a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42118:16"/>
ſecret Byaſs ſwaying my Will to believe them;
and this Byaſs or ſecret Inclination is nothing
elſe, but that Baptiſmal Grace which is infuſed
into all Chriſtians at their Baptiſm. I perceived
that this good Abbot took that for a <hi>Baptiſmal
Grace,</hi> which indeed is no other than an
Inclination proceeding from Education, and
which diſpoſeth him as much to Error as to
Truth, according to the anticipations this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
be it good or evil, hath formed in us.
Moreover, at this rate of Arguing he was
oblig'd to believe, (after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner)
That the Proteſtants are no Chriſtians; for
granting their Baptiſm to be good and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
they muſt be ſuppoſed to have the ſame
Grace infus'd, diſpoſing them to believe the
Popes to be Infallible.</p>
            <p>Behold here the wonderful Engin that is
made uſe of at <hi>Rome,</hi> to tye the Papiſts to their
Good Behaviour; and this was the ſum of all
the goodly Satisfaction the Grand Penitentiaries
of <hi>Rome</hi> could give me during the abode I
made amongſt them. I went often to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
to them about ſome Doubts that rack'd
my Conſcience, with reſpect to the Point of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> in hopes to rid my ſelf of
them. When I told them, That my Reaſon
roſe in perfect oppoſition to it: They anſwer'd,
That I ought not to hearken to it: And
when I reply'd, That it was every whit as
impoſſible for me to go contrary to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as to believe it Midnight at High-Noon:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42118:17"/>
They had recourſe to their laſt Shift, which
was, to demand of me, Whether I was not
really ſenſible of a ſecret Motion which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
me to a willingneſs of believing that,
which according to Reaſon ſeem'd incredible
to me: To which I anſwer'd, That indeed I
ſhould find my ſelf ſomewhat moved, if any
one ſhould go about, to force me immediately
to abjure Tranſubſtantiation; but withal told
them, That this might as well proceed from a
Habit I had acquired, and from thoſe Opinions
which the Romiſh Religion had inſtill'd into
me: But they always obſtinately perſiſted in
aſſuring me, That the cauſe of this difficulty in
the practice of what my Senſe and Reaſon
ſeem'd to lead me to, did not at all proceed
from what I imagin'd, but indeed from that
Habit of Faith, which had been infuſed into me
in my Baptiſin, and which then did operate in
me, as it always doth in time of danger, and
when there is any likelyhood of falling under
ſome grand Temptation. And when this ſort
of People have once declar'd their Judgment,
upon a Caſe of Conſcience, you muſt believe
them, or at leaſt aſſure them, that you ſubmit
to their Reaſonings; for otherwiſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the Noiſe is made about the Secret
of Confeſſion, they would ſoon find means to
oblige you to a very uncomfortable Paſtime,
by lodging you in the Inquiſition before you
ever could be aware of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42118:17"/>
I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to inform my
Reader further concerning their Confeſſions,
and therefore for the preſent ſhall continue to
relate what this Abbot declar'd to me about the
Ignorance of the Clergy of <hi>Rome.</hi> For after
having diſcours'd of the Popes at the rate I
have told you, he paſſed over to the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi>
whom he diſtinguiſh'd into three Claſſes.
The firſt was of thoſe, who are raiſed to that
Dignity at the ſolicitation of Princes, and to
favour the Intereſt of Crowns: Theſe are
either Princes themſelves, or great States-men,
whoſe entire ſtudy conſiſts in advancing their
own glory, or that of their Maſters, and who
have other Fiſh to fry, than to break their
Heads with the ſtudy of Philoſophy, or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The ſecond ſort of Cardinals, are thoſe
who are beholding for their promotion to the
good luck they have had of being the Nephew,
near Relation, or Friend of ſome Pope. It's
of ſmall concern to theſe, whether they be
Learned, or not; for tho' the Nephew or
Friend of a Pope ſhould chance to be the
moſt Ignorant perſon in the World, he needs
not fear that this will prove the leaſt obſtacle
to him in arriving at the Sacred Purple; (for
the <hi>Odeſcalci's,</hi> that is to ſay, the Popes that
abhor Nepotiſm, are very ſcarce nowadays)
and indeed Experience teacheth us, that theſe
ſort of People are commonly at a very low
ebb of any extraordinary Attainments. Laſtly,
The third Claſſis of Cardinals conſiſts of thoſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42118:18"/>
who have diſtinguiſh'd themſelves amongſt
the Crowd by ſome Talent, that hath made
them to be taken notice of above others. Thus
we meet with ſome Preachers, who having
got the knack of that Ability, after the <hi>Italian</hi>
manner, do arrive to this high Degree of
Honour, as likewiſe ſome Generals of Orders,
and ſome Biſhops of the moſt refined Parts
and Accompliſhments. Now in this very laſt
rank (continued the Abbot) we meet with
ſome perſons that pretend to be Learned, tho'
to ſpeak truth, there's very little of any exceſs
of it to be found in them; for if you come
once to preſs them home upon ſome Points,
you ſoon find the dimenſions of their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and that it bears ſmall proportion with
the Conceit they have of themſelves.</p>
            <p>All the World knows, that the Cardinals
are the Pope's Grand Council, and the very
perſons who are his Aſſiſtants in conſtituting
thoſe Decrees, which afterwards become the
<hi>Dogma's</hi> of the Papiſts. When it happens
therefore that an Ignorant Pope fills the Chair,
and that his Cardinals partake of the ſame
Qualification, what can be hoped for, as the
reſult of all their Conſultations, but Ignorance?
It was obſerved, that at the Congregation
which was granted to ſome Doctors of the
<hi>Sorbonne,</hi> who were come to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſolicit
the Condemnation of <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all the Cardinals who were Commiſſioned
to hear them, very fairly took a Nap upon it;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42118:18"/>
whereupon one of the Conſultors finding them
all in that poſture, could not refrain himſelf
from reflecting upon it, by ſaying to one of his
Colleagues, <hi>Al meno ſe foſſe qualcheduno che fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
la Sentinella; At least there ſhould have been
one to ſtand Sentinel the while.</hi> One of the
<hi>Janſeniſt</hi> Deputies makes this Reflection upon
it; <hi>But whether they Nodded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or were
awake, the manner of their managing of things
upon the Information of One Party only, was very
inſufficient to inform them of the Points they were
to determine. This is that which made us often
to lock upon the Condition of theſe Cardinals with
the Eyes of Pity and Compaſſion, who having (for

find themſelves engaged to declare their own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,

Here it is indeed that the Abbot (my Fellow-Traveller)
had ſtill more reaſon to exerciſe his
Faith of the Will, or to ſpeak more plainly,
his blind Faith, to induce to believe, That theſe
Men (in ſpight of all their Ignorance and
Negligence) could pronounce nothing but
Words of Life and Eternal Truth. Nay, what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42118:19"/>
is more, he believ'd, that the more ignorant
they were, the more the Holy Ghoſt was
pleaſed to ſpeak by their Mouths: For the
Sy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> he had formed, in deſcribing to me
the great Ignorance of the Conductors of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not ſo much to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
them, as to exalt the profound Secrets
of the Wiſdom of God, who formerly having
made uſe of poor Fiſher-men, that had no
acquired Parts or Learning wherewith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Wiſe-men of the World in the
Preaching of the Goſpel, did ſtill continue to
make uſe of theſe poor Ignorant Souls, the
Pope and his Cardinals, to maintain the Truth
of the ſame Goſpel, againſt the falſe Wiſdom,
and ſeeming Doctrin of Hereticks. The Zeal
wherewith he urg'd this Syſtem of his, ſeem'd
to me to be ſomewhat extravagant, for he
proportionably extended the ſame to all Biſhops,
Curats, and Monks; in a word, to all the
Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom (in a manner) he dipt
in the ſame Sawce, treating them as ſo many
Aſſes and <hi>Ignoramus's.</hi> I told him, That I
had converſed with ſeveral Perſons of Wit
and Parts, who according to the Principles of
the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
tolerably well, and that ſome Indulgence
ought to be allowed them in this Point, becauſe
the Doctrin of <hi>Rome</hi> was expoſed to abundance
of Contrarieties, which it was not an eaſie
Task to reconcile: As for Example, That Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
are ſeparable from the Subſtance, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42118:19"/>
exiſt without a Subject; That one Body can
at the ſame time be in ſeveral places; and a
vaſt number of ſuch like Abſurdities, which
they are fain to maintain in defence of their
Myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> However, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all that I could ſay to him, he
perſiſted always in his Opinion; and tho' he
appear'd to me ſomewhat too rigorous, yet
I cannot ſay, that he was altogether unjuſt
in his Cenſure. For if the manner and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of ordering ones Studies be the meaſure
of the Knowledge one acquires, I don't believe
there is a Country in the World where their
Studies are worſe conducted, than in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
where conſequently there muſt needs be leſs
Learning than there.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it will not be unpleaſing to my
Readers, if I preſent them with a view of the
Particulars thereof.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, The <hi>Italians</hi> have too
much Indulgence for their Children, and the
fear they have of putting them upon any
thing that might be too laborious for them in
their Tender years, makes them have no
thoughts of putting them to School, till very
late. They ordinarily keep them two or
three Years in the Inferior Schools, where
they only learn to Read and Write <hi>Italian;</hi>
and a Boy, who at the Age of Twelve Years
begins to Read and Write, is already look'd
upon as forward enough in his Studies.
Afterwards they change their Maſters, and are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42118:20"/>
ſent to a Latin School, where they ſpend two
or three years more only in learning the firſt Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of Grammar, and ſome Latin words to
diſpoſe them for the proſecuting of their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with the Jeſuits. Theſe Fathers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
engroſt all the publick Colleges in all the
Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> as making a moſt particular
Profeſſion of inſtructing Youth. But in the
mean time experience teacheth, that God ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
accompanies their undertakings with his
Bleſſing, and that indeed they are the very
Men, notwithſtanding all the Noiſe they make
to the contrary, who make Youth to loſe
their time. For in the firſt place they chuſe
young Jeſuits to be their Maſters or Regents of
their Scholars, whoſe wit is not yet ſetled, and
who are not ſufficiently grounded themſelves
in the Latin Tongue, ſo that it is in a manner
impoſſible they ſhould be capable of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others. But the deſign of the Society
herein is, that theſe young Jeſuits <hi>may perfect
themſelves in their Latin by teaching others,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Maxim, <hi>Optimus modus Diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,
eſt Docendi; the best of Learning, is that of
Teaching.</hi> This method is indeed for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Maſters, but is as diſadvantageous to
the Scholars; whereas when thoſe that teach
others are already perfect in their Art, and
skill'd in all the ways and turnings of it; this is
a great advantage to the Scholars, and a kind
of loſs of time for the Maſters, who learn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by teaching others, but what they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42118:20"/>
perfectly acquainted with: That it is
a very ill boding for the Scholars, to ſee theſe
young Jeſuits take poſſeſſion of the Maſters
Chairs, who are not able to explain an Author
themſelves.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon why the Scholars advance
ſo little under the Conduct of the Jeſuits, is,
becauſe theſe Fathers being too great Lovers of
their pleaſures, give too much leave for Paſtime
to their Scholars. They have two whole days
leave to play in every Week, <hi>viz.</hi> Tueſday
and Thurſday, without reckoning the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
days of Vacation; for when-ever
the Weather is fair and inviting to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
it is a very hard Task to keep a Jeſuit
within Doors. The young Regents addreſs
themſelves to the Rector or Provincial, and
are ſo importunate with them for leave to take
their Recreation, that it is not poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
them. And beſides all this, the Holy-days
are ſo frequent in <hi>Italy,</hi> that ſometimes you
meet with three or four in one Week. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
every year in Autumn they have two
Months of vacancy; ſo that all this being
well conſidered and laid together, we ſhall
find but a ſmall proportion of time left for
Study. The Youth, as every where elſe, are
very well pleas'd with it, tho' ſooner or later
they are made ſenſible of the bad effects of it;
for ignorant they come to the Jeſuits, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
they leave them; and having loſt the
moſt precious part of their time, they for the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42118:21"/>
moſt part continue Ignorants all the reſt of
their Lives. Neither is this all, that there are
only a few days allotted for Study, but alſo
very few hours in thoſe few days; for the
Morning School only laſts two hours, and the
Afternoon an hour and an half. Some Jeſuits
have endeavoured to maintain to me, that it
was not poſſible in <hi>Italy</hi> to ſtudy for a longer
time together: But as to that I anſwered them,
that I had continued my Lectures four hours
together in the Morning, and three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
when I taught at <hi>Milan,</hi> in the Abby
of Great St. <hi>Victor;</hi> and that my Scholars, who
were all of them <hi>Italians,</hi> became at length
accuſtom'd to it. Thus I made it appear, that
they had no lawful excuſe for their careleſneſs
and neglect, and that it was only their love of
pleaſure and idleneſs, that had reduc'd Study
to the condition in which it was. Again, of
theſe few hours that are deſtinated for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
there are but few moments employ'd
as they ought. Theſe young Jeſuits are never
unfurniſht of ſome ridiculous conceit, or ſtory
to tell their Scholars to ſhorten the time; and
'tis obvious for them to ſtart occaſions of Mirth
and Paſtime, when ever they pleaſe, amidſt
that great number of Scholars that ſurround
them. But of all the time they ſquander away,
there's none loſt with a more ſpecious pretext,
than that which they beſtow upon Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whereby they endeavour to diſpoſe and
fit their Scholars to appear with applauſe upon
their Theaters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42118:21"/>
The Jeſuits take much pains themſelves in
making of Comedies and Tragedies, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Regent is bound to compoſe two at leaſt
every year. To this end as ſoon as they have
finiſhed ſome piece of Elaborate Folly or Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonery,
they diſtribute the Perſonages thereof,
to thoſe of their Scholars they judge moſt
proper to repreſent them, and they ſpend a
great part of the time of their Claſſes or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Afternoon Lectures in exerciſing
them two or three months before the Drama
is to be acted publickly. This loſs of time
would not be altogether ſo great, in caſe theſe
Comedies or Tragedies were in the Latin
Tongue; but excepting only ſome few ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of Latin words here and there, they are
all <hi>Italian.</hi> Their end herein is to make them
the more Intelligible to the Ladies that are
invited to them. Amongſt the reſt they take
care not to forget the Mothers of their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
who are raviſhed to ſee their Children
declaming upon the Theater of the Reverend
Fathers the Jeſuits; and conceit their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have profited greatly, in being ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
at playing the Jack-Pudding. Neither is all
this ado without ſome profit to the Reverend
Fathers, for this gives them an occaſion of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Scholars upon a liberal Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards the Decoration of their Theaters
and Machines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:42118:22"/>
There are many <hi>Italians</hi> who are very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the loſs of their Childrens time, cauſed
by theſe methods of the Jeſuits; but they are
fain to ſmothet it, not daring to mention the
leaſt word of it to them; for if they ſhould,
they would preſently call them ingrateful, as
not acknowledging the favour that is done
them in teaching their Children <hi>gratis,</hi> and
after theſe reproaches would not fail ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to expel them their Colledge.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice here, with what
a ſtock of Impudence the Jeſuits pretend and
boaſt themſelves to teach Youth for nothing;
for indeed every City, where they have their
Schools, provides a Fund that is more than
ſufficient to maintain them, and this Mony is
raiſed by new Impoſitions laid upon private
Perſons. The only good effect their teaching
produceth, is this, that there are no Perſons
how poor ſoever they are, but may ſend their
Children to the College; but on the other
hand it gives occaſion to a great Evil, which
is, that this vaſt number of Students, whereof
the greater part are of very mean Extraction,
and ill Educated, do greatly corrupt and ſpoil
one another. Yea, it is in a manner impoſſible
that the Regents ſhould ever be able to teach
them well, becauſe of their exceſſive Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
there being ſometimes no leſs than three
hundred in one and the ſame Claſſis or Form
(as we call it,) and who have but one Maſter
to teach them all. Theſe Claſſes are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42118:22"/>
by the number of Scholars, but by
the degrees and progreſs of their Studies; and
there are Seven of theſe in every College
where the Latin Tongue is taught. They
commonly count them backward; for that
which receives the Petits at firſt, is called the
ſeventh Claſſis, and thoſe who are the moſt
forward in Latin, ſuch as the Rhetoricians,
are in the firſt. They continue a year in each
Claſſis, ſo that the Jeſuits do not undertake to
teach Latin in leſs than ſeven years; whereas
I have known Maſters, who in two years time
have advanced their Scholars further than the
Jeſuits do in all that time. Whence we may
take an eſtimate of the extraordinary Talent
and Capacity they have to teach, and the
great Bleſſing of God that accompanies their
Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>But at this time of day that which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
moſt, is not at all the Information of Youth;
they much more pleaſe and pride themſelves
in Politicks and the Intrigues of State, than in
their Schools, and in giving Law to Princes,
than in ſetting Children their Leſſon. But this
Subject would draw me too far from what I
am upon, and my deſign is not at preſent to
ſtray from the matter of Studies. After they
have finiſhed their courſe of ſeven years to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Latin Tongue, the Jeſuits have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe, ſome other Claſſes where they
teach Philoſophy and Theology, but after a
very poor manner, and ſuch as is not admir'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42118:23"/>
by any but themſelves. 'Tis commonly about
this time, that Scholars begin to determine
their thoughts for ſome particular Profeſſion;
ſome go to the Univerſities, others retire
themſelves into Convents, others dedicate
themſelves to the Church, and become ſecular
Prieſts; and Laſtly, others embrace other
Callings and Employments.</p>
            <p>To repreſent to my Reader in what manner
they continue their Studies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to
what degree of Perfection they arrive, I ſhall
endeavour to give him the moſt exact deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof that poſſibly I can in all theſe
different Stations. And in the firſt place to
begin with the Univerſities; every one knows,
that of all thoſe that are found in <hi>Italy,</hi> thoſe
of <hi>Bononia,</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> and of <hi>Pavia</hi> are the moſt
famous.</p>
            <p>If a man hath but ſet his Foot in one of
theſe Univerſities, it is ſufficient to raiſe him
to the Eſteem of a Learned man, in the minds
of the <hi>Italians,</hi> tho' it may be he knows no
more than he did the firſt day of his Entrance
(ſuch is the prevalency of a vulgar Error)
and, to ſpeak the truth, it is not very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
for a man to become truly Learned
there, and that for theſe four reaſons. In the
firſt place, the Climate of <hi>Italy</hi> is ſo ſultry
hot, that it is not very pleaſing to apply ones
ſelf a long time to one thing: A too obſtinate
and continued application, doth ſo agitate the
Spirits, and puts them into ſuch an Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42118:23"/>
ſay they, that many of them would
fear the over-heating of their Brains, ſhould they
apply themſelves to any ſerious Meditations for
two or three hours together. But it muſt be
own'd, as I have obſerved before, that the
<hi>Italians</hi> are ſomewhat too nice and delicate in
this point. Which is the reaſon why the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
not having the patience to examine a
queſtion to the bottom, chuſe rather to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it ſuch as it is given them, than to take
the pains to penetrate it themſelves.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe they are not
made to Write, that is, to take Dictates. The
Readers of Philoſophy or Theology content
themſelves to take ſome printed Author,
which they explain to them. Now it is ſure,
that thoſe things that are Written, make a
double Impreſſion upon the minds of Scholars,
and that the new Air that is given them, doth
more rowſe and excite their Spirits, than the
Reading of an Old Book. Beſides, Writings
or Dictates keep them more in Subjection,
than a Book, which they are ſure of having
always, and which the moſt part let alone
very undiſturb'd upon their Table, yet look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it notwithſtanding as their courſe of
Philoſophy, tho' it may be they never had
the patience to read it all over. The <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
cannot be charged with being too much
in love with Books, except it be with thoſe as
may aſſiſt them in their Amours, ſuch as are
the Romances and Poets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42118:24"/>
The Third Reaſon, why Scholars gain ſo
little good in the Univerſities, is this, becauſe
having had their firſt Education under the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
they ordinarily bring along with them
thither a Spirit of Libertiniſm and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
which recovering new ſtrength by this
change of place, as commonly it is, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſs
from their Parents, whoſe preſence
alone is a ſufficient check upon Children,
they immediately give the Rains to their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſeem to be more buſied about the
Study of Vice, than that of Virtue. I aſſert
nothing here but what is Notorious to all
Strangers that ever frequented theſe Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and every body knows, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to go abroad to walk the Streets at Night
in the Cities of theſe Univerſities, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in great danger of feeling the Inſolences
of theſe diſſolute emancipated Youths. Now
what can be imagined more incapable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Study or true Science than a diſordered
and debauched mind? That which favours
and greatly heightens this Diſorder is, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretext of not diſcompoſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the Muses, theſe Univerſities enjoy
great Priviledges, and this above all the reſt,
that they cannot be troubled by any Juſtice or
Tribunal, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only in caſe of Murther, or matters
that belong to the Inquiſition; which is the
right way to foment Crimes by aſſuring
them of Impunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42118:24"/>
Laſtly, the Fourth Cauſe of this prevailing
Ignorance, is the pitiful method they take to
try the skill and attainments of their Students.
All men of Learning do agree, that the ſureſt
proof of the Learning and Capacity of a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
is to expoſe him in publick to all the ſhot
of thoſe that are his Oppoſits in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Sentiments, from time to time; I mean
to oblige him publickly to defend ſome The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
or other, to exerciſe him, and ſhew him the
ſtrength or weakneſs of the contrary Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The <hi>Italians</hi> indeed as well as others,
do ſerve themſelves of this method, but in
ſuch a manner as makes it in a manner altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſeleſs. The Defendent having Printed
his Theſes or Concluſions, goes and preſents
them about a Fortnight or three Weeks before
the day appointed for Diſputation, to all thoſe,
with whoſe preſence he deſires particularly to
be honoured. But there are three amongſt
the reſt, whom he makes choice of for his
Opponents, and who are oblig'd in civility,
or rather by the prevailing Tyranny of a bad
Cuſtom, which at preſent has the force of a
Law in <hi>Italy,</hi> to acquaint him eight days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Points on which they intend to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:
Yea, and to ſend him in Writing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
all at length, with which they deſign
to attack him. The Student therefore you
ſee, hath a fair time to digeſt them; and to
get them by heart, as well to facilitate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of them, as to provide himſelf with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42118:25"/>
Anſwers againſt them. Neither is it permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any other beſides theſe three, to enter
the Liſts againſt him; ſo that the Defendent
is clearly out of harms way, without the leaſt
danger of having any ſlur put upon him, and
therefore cannot fail of doing Wonders. The
firſt time that I was preſent at a Diſputation
in <hi>Italy,</hi> I confeſs I was aſtoniſhed to ſee with
what readineſs the Students repeated the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
the pat Anſwers they gave, and how
all the Concluſions of their Opponents turn'd
gloriouſly to the Encreaſe of their Honour:
But after that I had diſcovered the Intrigue
of it, they loſt the great Eſteem I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of their Abilities, and it was no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter for me thereupon to eſtimate the
great diſadvantage accrued to them by this
precarious Conduct. For it follows from
hence, that the moſt Ignorant Scholar of a
whole College; yea, even ſuch an one as has
never read a Queſtion of Philoſophy, may
maintain his Theſes, with as much applauſe,
as the greateſt Scholar poſſibly can: For
when he has got the Arguments of his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
he needs only to procure them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
by ſome of his Friends, to get the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
by heart, in order as they ſtand, in half
an hours time, and then boldly appear on the
Bench, by which means the greateſt Dance,
may paſs for a great Doctor. I have often
preſented my ſelf at <hi>Bononia</hi> to oppoſe ſome
The<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, when I ſaw that the arguments of thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42118:25"/>
who had been Invited, had been very ſhort,
and that there was time enough left for it; but
it was never poſſible for me to obtain audience
with them. They are very diſtruſtful of
Strangers, eſpecially ſince that ſome of them
have ſhewed them a Trick, by exerciſing
them in good earneſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> are very magnificent upon all
publick Occaſions; they ſpare nothing that
may adorn and ſet forth the place where they
Diſpute: All their Theſes are commonly Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either upon Sattin or on fair ſheets of Silk,
of all ſorts of Colours, with curious Braſs-Cuts,
at the Top of them. There are ſome alſo that
preſent thoſe they have Invited, with curious
Noſegays; and generally after the Diſputation
is ended, the Defendent entertains the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
and their Opponents, with a ſplendid
and plentiful Collation. Here now it is that
amongſt their Cups, and good Bits, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
Magnificent Encomiums upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendent,
and upon his Maſter that hath In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
him; they Congratulate him, with a
Glaſs in hand, upon his readineſs in repeating
the Arguments, the Propriety of his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and the profoundneſs of his Learning.
But yet theſe Sumptuous Entertainments would
not be ſufficient to advance one to the Degree
of Doctor, if they were not back'd with a
pregnant Purſe; and this fair Bud of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
I mean the Doctorate, would never
ſpring or open, if it were not watered with a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42118:26"/>
Golden Shower. It is very expenſive to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Licences and the Degree of Doctor;
and 'tis very frequent on theſe occaſions, to
ſee Learning, the Merits whereof ought chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be look'd upon, Poſtpon'd, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
preferr'd, which if I miſtake not, may
well be eſteem'd a fifth Reaſon, why Students
do ſo little concern themſelves to make any
great progreſs in their Studies.</p>
            <p>I had always believ'd that a certain Story
very current in <hi>Italy,</hi> of an Aſs that took his
Doctors Degree at <hi>Padua,</hi> was no more than
a Tale or Fable made at pleaſure: But one of
the chief Doctors of Phyſick, whom I had a
particular acquaintance with, and whom I
will not name, for fear of expoſing him to
the hatred of his Collegues, aſſured me, that
it was very true. He related the matter of
Fact to me in this manner. A young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Country of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> of a very
good Family, but ſomewhat ſtinted in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
had apply'd himſelf with extraordinary
diligence to the Study of the Canon Law,
and had very regularly perform'd all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
in the Univerſity; and his time being
out, he preſented himſelf in order to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Doctor: But notwithſtanding that his
Capacity was without exception, yet there ſtill
remained an inſuperable Difficulty, for want
of Mony. This troubled him ſo much, that
he Writ to his Father about it, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
together to put a Trick upon the Rector
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42118:26"/>
of the Univerſity, a man of a moſt ſordid
Covetouſneſs. The Students Father comes to
<hi>Padua,</hi> having borrowed a conſiderable Sum
of Mony of one of his Friends, and having
brought his Aſs with him, took up his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the moſt famous Inn that was in the
whole Town: This done, he goes to the Rector
about Eleven a Clock at Night, telling him,
that a young Lord a Stranger, whom he
nam'd to him, was come in Poſt to Town to
take his Degree, but that he found himſelf ſo
extreamly tired and diſcompos'd with his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that it was Impoſſible for him to come
and preſent himſelf in Perſon, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
he was obliged to be on Horſe-back again
by Three or Four in the Morning, to get a
Benefice at <hi>Rome,</hi> which he could not be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
for without having taken his Doctors
Degree; and to give more Life and Energy to
his words, he preſents him with a Purſe ſtuff'd
with Ducats, and told him, that as ſoon as his
Letters ſhould be ready, his Maſter in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of ſo great a favour would be very
ready to gratifie him further. The Rector
dazled with this charming Preſent, and in the
hopes of a ſecond part to the ſame Tune, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
nothing of him but the Name of the
young Lord; he got his Letters ready, and
with the ſame Expedition ſent them to the
Chancellor of the Univerſity, to have the Seal
put to them. Thus all paſſed admirably well,
without Rub or Let in favour of good Doctor
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42118:27"/>
               <hi>Martin,</hi> for that was the Name they had given
him, and which ſtill to this Day, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Name of all the Aſſes of the Country.
This was that the Doctor related to me of this
Story; but he proceeded not to tell me what
others add to it, which is, that the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
at the opening of the College-Gates,
the <hi>Griſon</hi> Gentleman drove Doctor <hi>Martin</hi>
into the great Hall, being the place of publick
Diſputation, with his Letters Patent hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Neck, and a Doctors Bonnet faſtned
to his Ears, to the great Aſtoniſhment of all
the Doctors, who could not ſufficiently admire
the Port and Majeſty of their New-Collegue.
I don't love to relate Matters that turn ſo much
to the Confuſion of theſe great Bodies of the
Univerſities, for whom I have always had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and Veneration; and I had rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
my Reader to believe, that all this is no
more than the pure Invention of ſome witty
Droll, whereby he had a mind to expreſs to
the World, that theſe Rectors are commonly
more ſenſible of the Mony, than of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of thoſe they promote. However, thus
much I think my ſelf oblig'd to declare to the
Honour of theſe Illuſtrious Bodies, that they
have at all times made themſelves Renowned,
by ſome great Men that have ſignaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
amongſt them, by their extraordinary
Parts and Learning: And when I ſay that Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
Reigns amongſt them, I ſpeak only
of the generality or greater part of them.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42118:27"/>
For I know that there are always found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them Spirits naturally elevated above
the common Pitch, and who by the Noble
Efforts they make to raiſe themſelves out of
the Duſt, do juſtly deſerve to be diſtinguiſht.
Neither am I Ignorant that many of them
have given ſufficient Proof of their Learning
by the gallant Works they have left us; and
many Perſons who have Travelled in <hi>Italy,</hi>
have received much Pleaſure and Satisfaction
in their Converſation. Some of theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
have proceeded ſo far in honouring of
them, as to give them particular Elogies in
the Relations they have given us of their own
Travels: Yet for my part, I am Inclin'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to underſtand theſe kind of Encomiums
with reſtriction, and that for two Reaſons.
The firſt is this, that Travellers are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often prepoſſeſt with the Learning of ſome
Perſons, before they are well acquainted with
it, and are ſometimes ſtrongly carried to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
them vaſt Scholars, becauſe they have
done them ſome Service, or have expreſt a
great deal of Civility to them on their Voyage.
I know at <hi>Bononia</hi> a Perſon of mean Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Parts, who compell'd a Stranger to
go and ſpend Eight days at his Country-Houſe,
where he Treated him moſt Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
every day, and ſent for all the Rarities
that were to be got about <hi>Bononia,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had heard this Stranger ſay, that he
intended to Publiſh his Voyage of <hi>Italy.</hi> His
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42118:28"/>
Son having demanded of him, why, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Genius of the Country, he would
put himſelf to ſo great Charges in Treating of
a Perſon, who was a perfect Stranger to him?
The Father Anſwered, that what he did was
not without Reaſon, foraſmuch as that honeſt
Man had declared that he intended to Rank
his Name amongſt the Learned Men of <hi>Italy,</hi>
in the Book of his Travels he intended to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.
It is not of to day only that the <hi>Italians</hi>
are accuſed for being Liberal in nothing but
Ceremonies and Compliments, and extreamly
cautelous and reſerved about any thing that
may engage them in any particular Expences:
But yet if a man would take the pains to
comport with them in their humour, and
more eſpecially flatter them in the vain Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
they have, tho' very Ignorant, to paſs
for Learned Men, a Man might draw from
them what he pleaſed himſelf.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon, why I would not always
take the Praiſes that Travellers beſtow, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rigour of the Letter, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there be many <hi>Italians</hi> who practiſe that,
which may be called the Art of being eſteem'd
Learned at a cheap rate. This Art conſiſts
in chuſing out ſome particular and ſelect
Points, and beſtowing all their Application
and Study upon them for ſome time together,
until that they are become perfectly Maſters
of them, and till they find themſelves in a
Condition to reſolve all the doubts that can
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42118:28"/>
be objected againſt them. If it be a matter
that may be confirm'd by Authorities, care is
taken to get the moſt conſiderable by heart;
and if it depend more upon Experience, they
endeavour to exerciſe themſelves therein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the managing of it be made eaſy to them,
and they have got the perfect Command of it.
And after all (ſay the <hi>Italians,)</hi> that Man is a
great Blockhead, who cannot inſenſibly make
the Converſation he is engag'd in, to fall upon
the point he is moſt verſed in; and the more
dexterouſly he can do this, the more he makes
himſelf to be admir'd. But yet theſe ſort of
Men, let them carry it as cunningly as they
can, they are ſtill diſcovered ſooner or later,
by thoſe that frequent their Company for any
time; but Travellers indeed, who only paſs by
and are gon, may eaſily be impos'd upon by
this method, and be apt to believe them equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able in all other Parts. I know many Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men of this Stamp: There was one at
<hi>Venice</hi> whom we call'd <hi>Phyſical Predetermination;</hi>
another, <hi>Copernicus his Syſteme;</hi> another, <hi>the
World in the Moon,</hi> and many others, upon
whom we beſtowed the name of the things
they had got by Rote, and wherewith they
continually alarm'd Men's Ears. As ſoon as
they were entred into Diſcourſe with any
one, it was not neceſſary to draw near to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what they ſaid, for that might be
ſeen from far by their Actions and Geſture of
their Arms and Hands, as the <hi>Italians</hi> uſe to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42118:29"/>
do, who are pleaſed to ſignalize themſelves
this way. This is that I call the Art of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the repute of Learning at an eaſy rate.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay that all make uſe of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
there are ſome to be found that are Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
indeed and in good earneſt; and it cannot
be denied, but we meet with Men there, that
are very able in all kind of Profeſſions; and
what I have before alledged is only to ſhew,
that Travellers may ſometimes be deceived in
them. I ſhall add one Remark more, I have
made concerning theſe Learned Men, which
is, that we do indeed find ſome of them that
excel in the Civil and Canon Law; others in
Phyſick, in Chymiſtry, in Hiſtory; ſome few
in the Mathematicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but withall, that it is
a kind of Prodigy to meet with one that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
<hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> or that is well
vers'd in Holy Scripture, or that is a good
Divine, in the Popiſh way; and yet all theſe
are ſuch accompliſhments, as one would think
ſhould be very becoming, if not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
in a Country that is ſo full of Prieſts
as <hi>Italy</hi> is. The reaſon whereof, as far as I
could ever penetrate, is, that all theſe kind of
Studies, are neither favoured by the great ones,
nor encouraged by rewards, nor ſupported
by any Temporal Intereſt. The Languages
of the Dead (if we except in ſome kind the
Latin,) are of ſmall Credit in the Courts of
<hi>Italian</hi> Princes, becauſe of the difficulty there
is in becoming Maſter of them, and for the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42118:29"/>
ſmall uſe, according to their Conceit, they are
of in the World, after one with great praiſe
has attain'd ſome competent skill in them. As
for Divinity, that ſeems yet more uſeleſs to
them, than any of the reſt; becauſe the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
who are the Popes Emiſſaries, and the
Confeſſors of all the Princes and great Men,
make them believe that it is a pitiful kind of
Science, and only fit for Monks and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
to amuſe themſelves about it, and that
the beſt Divinity for a ſecular Perſon is to
underſtand none of it, but only to believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
and in general as the Church believes,
as being the true and ſure way to avoid all
thoſe Temptations which may carry Mens
minds towards Novelties and Hereſies. So
that if any Man ſhould undertake, at preſent,
to talk of Divinity in the preſence of the
Princes or Lords of <hi>Italy,</hi> he would make his
Company not only uneaſy, but ridiculous.
The Caſe is not the ſame with other Sciences;
thoſe that poſſeſs them, may by their means
advance themſelves in the World. A Perſon
is always in good eſteem that hath attained to
conſiderable skill in the Civil Law, in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
in Phyſick, or even in the Canon
Law, eſpecially in Beneficiary caſes. All
theſe Sciences are of as good ſtead to a Man
as a plentiful Patrimony, and are the making
of thoſe who are well verſed in them: But
poor Divinity is hated, and abandoned by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the World. I was acquainted at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42118:30"/>
with a young Gentleman, who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd
himſelf to this Forlorne Study, for ſome
years; and having one day asked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he continued in the vigorous proſecution
of his Studies, he told me, that he was juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to quit it for good and all; to learn to
play on the Violin, becauſe he believed that
Art would be much more profitable to him.
See here a true account of the Languiſhing
Condition of Theology in thoſe Univerſities,
and which is the reaſon that ſcarcely any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
can be found in them, that are capable
of Teaching it. This is no Exaggeration at
all, but is a thing viſible and notorious; for it
is this extream ſcarcity of Divines, that hath
obliged them to Incorporate ſome Monks into
their Body, under the Name of Doctors or
Profeſſors of Divinity, to the end they might
teach that Faculty amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as I am inſenſibly got amongſt
the Monks, and that I have ſufficiently, as I
ſuppoſe, deſcribed the manner of Studying in
their Univerſities; I perſwade my ſelf you will
not be diſpleaſed to underſtand the method
theſe obſerve in the Colleges of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
or Religious Houſes in <hi>Italy.</hi> We will
begin with the Jeſuits; we have already taken
a View of their way of Teaching Latin, and
it remains now for us to take notice in what
manner they regulate their own Studies, with
regard to their young Jeſuits; for if they be
able to perform any thing in this kind, which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42118:30"/>
is the Foundation of their Inſtitution, we
may expect to ſee the faireſt Fruits of it in the
young Plants of their Society. Thus much
we may ſafely aver of them, that they have
in ſome ſort the very choice of Spirits, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eaſy for them, amongſt that vaſt Number
of Scholars that are under their Inſpection,
to pick out thoſe they think moſt fit for their
Turn, having had the opportunity of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them of a long time. See here the courſe
they take: They induſtriouſly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to examine the Temperament of their
Scholars, eſpecially when they are in their
laſt or higheſt Latin Claſſis, where they are
taught Rhetorick. If they have obſerv'd
any of them that are of a well temper'd, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and compos'd Humor, they ſay ſuch a
one will be good to make a <hi>Benedictin,</hi> for
they call the Monks of the Order of St. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>
not without an Air of ſlighting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
good Men: If they perceive another
that is of a Silent, Soure, Sullen and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Temper, this Youth, ſay they, will
make a good <hi>Chartreux, Camaldule,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhod
<hi>Carmelite:</hi> If they find another of a
ſweet and pleaſant humour, and of a tender
and effeminate Complexion, ſuch a one they
look upon as proper to aſſociate with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Regulars, or <hi>Olivetans,</hi> or to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
to Nuns: If any of them be inclin'd to
Boufonry, and to play tricks of Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
See there a Youth, ſay they, that will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42118:31"/>
fit the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> and <hi>Minimes:</hi> Others that
are of daſtardly, mean and cowardly Spirits,
they turn over to the <hi>Capucins,</hi> for they
are very well acquainted what Spirit Reigns in
each Order.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If they chance to meet with any
poor, ignorant, and ſimple Youth, and whoſe
mind has no Elevation at all, they hope that
ſuch a one may by their means come to be a
good Country Curate. They make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in the Claſs of Rhetorick, to take every
one of their Scholars apart, and declare to
them, the Calling to which God ſeems to
have called them. But as for themſelves, if
they find one that is of a keen and ſubtil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
brisk and active, full of Fire, daring and
undertaking, theſe are the Youths forſooth,
that are for their Society; theſe are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
fit for their Tooth, and ſuch they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to gain to their Number.</p>
            <p>After ſome years paſt in their Novitiat and
Travels, they ſet them to Teach Latin, and
make them Regents over the ſeven Claſſes, in
Order, one after another, which is their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for ſeven years; and during all this
time, they do not ſuffer them to mind any
other thing, but what concerns their Claſſes;
no nor ſo much as to read any Book, but thoſe
that are deſign'd for that uſe. When they
enter into the Society, they commonly are
about 21 or 22 years of Age, ſo that before
they have finiſhed their Regency, over all the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42118:31"/>
ſeven Latin Claſſes, they are above Thirty
years of Age. Then it is they are put upon
the Studying of Philoſophy, and afterwards
of Theology; in the firſt of which they ſpend
two years, and in the latter three.</p>
            <p>'Tis about this time, that the Fathers make
another Scrutiny or Tryal of the Spirits of
their younger Jeſuits. Thoſe who have kept
all their Fire, and make themſelves remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for their Boldneſs and Reſolution, are
deſign'd to be Miſſionaries, and the reſt are
left to their liberty, to apply themſelves to
ſome particular Study, for which they have
moſt Inclination; or elſe they make Preachers
of them, whilſt the Old Jeſuits are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of Fraternites, or hear Confeſſions. But
all of them generally are Educated in a Spirit
of refined Policy, which doth not ſhake hands
with them till Death. And thoſe in whom
this Spirit is moſt rife and pregnant, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the Charges and Employs of the
Society, or elſe means are found out to pleaſe
them in the Courts of Princes; and if any
one be found that is not Baptized into this
Spirit, tho' otherwiſe he be endowed with the
moſt promiſing Talents that may be, he is
ſure to be expell'd the Society of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Now the Concluſion we may draw from
what I have here repreſented, concerning the
Conduct of the Jeſuits, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is in
a manner impoſſible they ſhould ever attain to
any great degree of Learning; for the very
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42118:32"/>
prime of their Youth, and the Age that is
moſt proper to apply themſelves to Sciences,
is wholly employed in Learning and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Latin; ſo that we have reaſon to believe
that to be the only thing they are good at;
and yet the truth is, that even herein they
make themſelves ridiculous. The Proverb tells
us, that <hi>the Corruption of the best things, is the
worſt: Corruptio optimi, peſſima;</hi> and it may be
ſaid alſo, that the Jeſuits, who probably read
none but the beſt Authors of the Latin Tongue,
do make a kind of mixture of them in their
Spirits, to which they ſuperadd an intolerable
kind of Affectation, that utterly ſpoils all the
good that could be in it. All their Latin is
commonly thick, larded with <hi>Enimveros,
Quidems</hi> and <hi>Ergo</hi>'s: I can no better parallel
this their Folly, than by comparing it with
the Vanity of ſome Women, who from an
exceſs of deſire they have to appear Beautiful,
dawb their Faces ſo thick with Paint and
Patches, that quite contrary to their deſign,
they make themſelves ugly and abominable.
All the honour that is rendred to their Latin,
is this, that in all the Societies where they
ſpeak good Latin, as with the Gentlemen of
<hi>Port Royal,</hi> and in all the Schools of Phyſicians,
it is termed <hi>pitiful Jeſuits Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what concerns their Philoſophy and
Divinity, which they are made to Study, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that they have Taught Latin, that we
may diſcover the nature thereof, we are firſt to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42118:32"/>
know, that the Society of Jeſuits, having been
inſtituted at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> had at
firſt no other Schools, beſides the publick
Schools, nor any other Opinions, but ſuch as
are commonly Taught there.</p>
            <p>In their general Aſſembly held in the year
1550, they made ſome Conſtitutions, by
which their Founder oblig'd them to follow
the Doctrin of St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> as to their
Divinity, and conſequently in all Queſtions of
Philoſophy, that neceſſarily depend upon it.
There are to this day ſome of their Theſes
to be ſeen, publickly defended by them in
their College at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the years 1560,
and 1562; a ſhort time after the Death of
their Founder, and at the ſitting of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> where they defend the Opinions
of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> concerning Grace, directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit
to thoſe they maintain at preſent. In
the mean time, <hi>James Lainez</hi> being choſen
General in 1558, two years after the Death
of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> he cauſed a Statute to paſs,
at the ſame Aſſembly where he had been
Elected, by the which it was reſolved, that
they ſhould Teach alſo the Maſter of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;
but in caſe afterwards, it ſhould be
judged, that ſome other Author, would be
more profitable to the Students, as if they
ſhould think fit to compoſe a new Sum of
Theology, or any other <hi>Work that might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comport with the Times, (Temporibus accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datior,)</hi>
that then the ſame might be made
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42118:33"/>
uſe of, after a mature Deliberation. <hi>Lainez</hi>
having thus left the Jeſuits at liberty, to find
out a method of Teaching Philoſophy, more
accommodate to the latter Times, than that
which had been followed ever ſince the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were known in the World, (for it was
about this time, that they reſolved to ſet up
for great Politicians, and to be the Depravers
of Science and Morality, the better to pleaſe
the corrupt age in which their Lot was fallen;)
and the very ſame year ſeveral Inſtances were
given of this Corruption.</p>
            <p>In the Univerſity of <hi>Salamanca, Prudentius</hi>
of <hi>Monte Major</hi> a Jeſuit, publickly maintained
a Theſis, wherein he rejected all the abſolute
Decrees of God, with reſpect to acts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Liberty, and particularly all Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gratuitous and independent on any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
of good actions, with ſome other like
Doctrins. The Divinity Faculty of that
Univerſity condemned them, but they pleaſed
the Society well enough, who gave permiſſion
to their Divines to teach them, according as
occaſion and Time ſhould ſeem favourable
for it.</p>
            <p>Now in order to their finding out a way
intirely to ſhake off the Yoak of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
Doctrin, <hi>Claudius Aqua Viva,</hi> General of the
Jeſuits, in the year 1584, called to <hi>Rome</hi> ſix
of the moſt able Divines of the Society, with
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>der to conſult beforehand, the moſt Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of each Province, to make a choice of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42118:33"/>
thoſe ſelect Opinions, which were to be
taught in their Society. Theſe Divines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to <hi>Rome,</hi> they there compos'd a
Book with this Title; <hi>Ratio atque Inſtitutio Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diorum
Societatis Jeſu. The way and Inſtitution
of the Studies of the Society of Jeſus,</hi> which
was Printed in 1586. Here it was that they
abſolutely caſt off S. <hi>Austin</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
upon the Points of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> and <hi>Phyſical
Predetermination,</hi> which they were allow'd the
Liberty to maintain till then. They eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their <hi>mediate knowledge,</hi> the Foreſight of
future Contingents, and they explain'd the
Efficacy of Grace, after the manner of the
<hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> as if the ſame
were intirely dependent on the Free-will of
Man, which they do not ſuppoſe to be ſo
corrupt, as the moſt Venerable Doctors of
Antiquity, and particularly S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> took it
to be.</p>
            <p>It will not be beſides our purpoſe, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to you here a brief Reflexion upon a
ſhort Sentence I met with in the ſame <hi>Directory
of the Studies of the Society,</hi> where it is ſaid,
<hi>that it is for the honour of the Society of Jeſus
that a new Theology be introduc'd, with Liberty
of Spirit:</hi> That is to ſay, without being too
ſtrictly tied up to the Opinions of the ancient
Fathers, or to the Deciſions of the Modern
Doctors. Beſides it implies, that they had a
terrible Itch of Pride to joyn to their Novel
Inſtitution, a novelty of Doctrin and Morals,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42118:34"/>
that might diſtinguiſh them from all others.
For it ſeem'd ſomewhat hard and grating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that being Jeſuits, they were fain
to be <hi>Thomiſts</hi> in their Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Molina</hi> a Spaniſh Jeſuit, was one of the
moſt bold and venturous in Publiſhing the
new Doctrin of the Society, and publickly
boaſted, that the greater part of it, was of
his own Invention. He Publiſhed in the year
1588, his Work intituled <hi>The Concord of Grace
and Free-will:</hi> The Opinions he there vented,
were the ſame with thoſe of other Jeſuits, but
proved by Metaphyſical Reaſons, after the
manner of the Schools. He made no bones
to ſay, that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had been involved in a
kind of Darkneſs, as to what concerns the
Doctrin of Grace; and that he had believ'd
that <hi>Gratuitous Predeſtination</hi> was neceſſarily
joyn'd with it. The deſign of the Jeſuits here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was this, that conformably to the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they had taken, to diſtinguiſh themſelves
by abandoning S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and finding as yet
no means, they had a mind cunningly and
under other Terms, to reſtore <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi>
which ſeem'd to them more plauſible to be
maintain'd, than the efficacious Grace of
S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which too openly favoured the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating
Grace of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> (as
they are pleas'd to call it,) which had been
condemned at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or rather,
which ſeem'd to be one and the ſame with it.
To the end therefore, they might more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42118:34"/>
obtain this their end, and the more
ſweetly engage the minds of Men to receive
it; they were not wanting from time to time,
to make their Diſciples publickly to maintain
the Doctrin of S. <hi>Austin</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that
by this means they might appear to be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
Men, and that ſearched after nothing
but the Truth. But all this their addreſs and
cunning, did not hinder the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> being
incenſed by <hi>Molina</hi>'s Book, openly to oppoſe
themſelves againſt their Innovations, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſo well in their Purſuit, that <hi>Clement</hi>
VIII. eſtabliſhed a Congregation at <hi>Rome,</hi> to
hear the Reaſons of both Parties. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with the Examination of <hi>Molina</hi>'s Book,
and they reduc'd his Doctrin to four Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which they explained in divers Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And foraſmuch as they make a part of
the Theology of the Jeſuits, I do not think
it a wandring from my Subject, to give you
here a ſhort account of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Principle of</hi> Molina <hi>is,</hi> That the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Concourſe of God, doth not conſiſt in acting
upon ſecond Cauſes, as if they stood in need of
being moved by God, in order to produce their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
but that God acts immediately in the Action,
together with the Cauſe; and that if God ſhould
puſh on the Will to act, he would thereby ruin the
Liberty thereof. <hi>From which Principle</hi> Molina
<hi>drew theſe Conſequences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42118:35"/>
1. That Man by the ſtrength of Nature, can
believe Supernatural Myſteries.</p>
            <p>2. That having performed what lies in him,
according to his natural Strength and Ability,
God comes in and bestows his Grace; and that
God foreſeeing who thoſe are, that will make uſe
of theſe Abilities, when the Goſpel ſhall be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them, he is ready to beſtow upon them
the Grace that is neceſſary for their total Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>3. That a man by his natural Strength, can
form a reſolution of never offending God, for time
to come.</p>
            <p>4. That natural Light may be ſufficient to keep
the Law of Nature, whatſoever trouble or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
there may be in the doing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Second Principle of</hi> Molina <hi>is,</hi> that God
doth not refuſe to any grown Perſon, the aſſiſtance
that is neceſſary for him to perſevere in that which
it good; ſo that it is the fault of him who doth
not perſevere in Godlineſs, and not the want of
Grace, that makes him to fall away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Third Principle is,</hi> that we are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
in God, three ſorts of Knowledg, the one
purely Natural, the other altogether free, and the
third Mediate, or partaking of both; according
to which latter, God by the intimate knowledg he
hath of the Free-will of every man, knows what
he would do, ſuppoſing ſuch or ſuch a thing, tho'
it be in his power to do the contrary. <hi>Under this
Principle are comprehended theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42118:35"/>
1. That there is but one exciting Grace, and
none that is Efficacious in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>2. That it is not Grace that determines the Free-will,
but that the Free-will determines it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fourth Principle is,</hi> That God Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
thoſe, who he foreſees by his mediate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
will make good uſe of the ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and of Grace.</p>
            <p>The Conſulters of the Congregation, <hi>de
Auxiliis,</hi> (for ſo they call'd them, becauſe they
therein treated concerning the aſſiſtances
which God affords Men, in order to apply
themſelves to that which is good;) had couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Sentiments of <hi>Molina</hi> in Twenty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
whereof the moſt are the very ſame,
or to the ſame Senſe of thoſe we have here
ſet down. They cenſured every one of them,
as may be ſeen in the abridgment of the Acts,
which is ſtill in being, and declared that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>
and his Adherents, which are the Jeſuits,
had eſpouſed the Opinions of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
and the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> as well in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of their Doctrin, as in their Proofs and
Objections. They tell us that hereupon, the
Jeſuits joyned Threats with their Prayers, to
hinder the Publication of this Cenſure, and
that out of very Rage they publickly maintain'd
in <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was no part of the Faith, that
<hi>Clement</hi> VIII. was Pope, and that he was not
Infallible. Their Adverſaries have uſed the
ſame liberty towards the Popes, when ever
they proved contrary to them, and there is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42118:36"/>
great probability, that they do not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
oblig'd to maintain the Infallibility of
the Pope, except then only when it is of uſe
to them to overthrow their Adverſaries. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Pope was reſolved to decide this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
by a Bull, in caſe the Jeſuits ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to ſubmit themſelves: But his Death
which hapned the Eighth of <hi>March 1605,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them from the fear they were in of
being forced to retract their Doctrin, or of
being Condemned. <hi>Paul</hi> V. who ſucceeded
to <hi>Leo</hi> XI. took the ſame matter in hand,
with deſign to decide it.</p>
            <p>At this time it was, that the Jeſuits, being
in a greater apprehenſion than ever, of ſeeing
their Doctrin Condemned for Heretical, and
all their fine Projects for eſtabliſhing of their
Novel Opinions, overthrown; their General
<hi>Aqua Viva</hi> thought fit to make a Show of
changing them in ſome reſpect. He made a
Decree, dated the Fourteenth of <hi>December,</hi>
whereby he ordered thoſe of the Society, for
time to come, to teach this Doctrin with
ſome Modification, by approaching in ſome
Degree to the Grace of the <hi>Thomiſts:</hi> But this
having been caſt in the Teeth of the Jeſuits,
as a reproach tending to their ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
<hi>Mutio Vitellexti,</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Aqua
Viva</hi> in the Generalſhip, declared, that it
had not been the intention of his Predeceſſor,
to retract their Dogmas, and accordingly he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
the Opinions of the Society to their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42118:36"/>
former State. Thus we ſee that the Doctrin
of the Jeſuits changed three times in leſs than
Thirty years: For they departed from the
Sentiments of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> to thoſe
of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and from thence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again anew to thoſe of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
from whence ſoon after they fell again to
their diſcharged Vomit, I mean to <hi>Moliniſm</hi>
or <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi> They gave a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in theſe their ſhiftings, that they did
indeed accommodate their Doctrin to the
times, <hi>Temporibus accommodatior,</hi> according to
their own expreſſion. And that at laſt the
great Itch they had of ſignalizing their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by novel and particular Opinions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
againſt all manner of Reaſons whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
They knew ſo well to manage the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Paul</hi> V. which they had ſweetned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, by dedicating to him a ſecond
Edition of <hi>Caſſianius,</hi> that notwithſtanding
the Doctrin of <hi>Molina,</hi> the Jeſuit, had been
pronounced Heretical, by the Congregation
<hi>de Auxilus,</hi> as well as by himſelf and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
he forbore Publiſhing the Bull,
which he had prepared to thunder-ſtrike it
with, and contented himſelf with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of a Decree, by which he impoſed ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
on both Parties, until it ſhould pleaſe
him to make the Deciſion. The Jeſuits in
the mean time, perſiſted in their new Dogmas,
and in proceſs of Time, had the good ſucceſs
to keep them ſtanding, in ſpite of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42118:37"/>
I cannot deny, but that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath a great Intereſt on one hand, to
Found new Religious Orders, as being a ſort
of People, that promiſe total Subjection, and
inviolabe Faithfulneſs to her; but on the other
hand, Time may make it appear, that they
will prove a great means of rending and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
her, by their reſtleſs Ambition of
diſtinguiſhing themſelves by their Doctrins.</p>
            <p>This is that which wanted little of being
accompliſht in our days, wherein we have
ſeen a vaſt number of <hi>Auguſtinians</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi>
under the name of <hi>Janſenists,</hi> in a fair
way of rending themſelves from the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> when by the inſtigation of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
they were going about to condemn the
Dogmas of their Maſters. Yet was it not the
Solidity and prevalency of the Jeſuitical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that made them triumph at laſt;
but indeed the only thing that procured them
this advantage, was the Temporal Power,
which at preſent they have acquired in all
Places, that follow the Communion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was obſerved, that whilſt the poor <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
good Souls, were wholly employed in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon S. <hi>Austin,</hi> to ſearch out thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
they ſtood in need of, to maintain their
<hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> theſe made it their chief bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to manage the Spirit of the Pope, and
of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſecure themſelves a
Party in the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and to engage the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in <hi>France</hi> on their ſide, by making uſe of
the Royal Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42118:37"/>
To make an end of giving you a juſt and
full Idea of all their Divinity, it ſhall ſuffice
to acquaint you, that the Faculty of <hi>Lovain,</hi>
in the Year 1677, did by their Deputies,
preſent to the Pope, ſeveral Propoſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Morals, drawn out of the Books of
Jeſuits, Sixty five whereof were Condemned by
a Decree of the Second of <hi>March 1678.</hi> This
only conſideration of the multiplicity of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
that are found in their Books, ought to
be a ſufficient Ground to the Papiſts, for ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
all the Divinity of theſe Reverend
Fathers. It is not without cauſe, that the
Modern Papiſts are accuſed of being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Lyars in the World, of having no human
Faith, of Violating all manner of Oaths,
of breaking their Words, and of making leſs
difficulty of forſwearing themſelves, than the
very Turks and Infidels. They are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Progreſs they have made in theſe
goodly Virtues, to the Novel Doctrin of the
Jeſuits, who have introduced their mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions,
to ſave them from the odious charge
of a Lye.</p>
            <p>According to theſe Caſuiſts, if a Chriſtian
be asked Whether he believe in Jeſus Chriſt;
he may anſwer no; ſuppoſing that he means
in his heart, that he doth not believe in him
as the Turks do, who believe in him, only as
a Prophet. If he be asked Whether he be a
Proteſtant; he may ſay upon occaſion, that he
is one, if his inward meaning be, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42118:38"/>
againſt the Errors of the Proteſtants. I
heard a <hi>Penegyrick</hi> pronounced at <hi>Milan,</hi> by a
Jeſuit, in honour of St. <hi>Charles Borromeo,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
and Archbiſhop of that City: One of
the Principal Points inſiſted on, was the great
Charity this Saint expreſt towards two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Robbers on the High-way, who were
Purſued by ſome Officers of Juſtice; they
asked the Saint, Whether he had ſeen theſe
two Criminals paſſing that way? No, quoth he,
they did not paſs this way: You muſt know,
he had at that time his Finger in his Sleeve,
through which, his meaning was, that the
Robbers had not paſſed; and the Officers giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
credit to his words, ceaſed from purſuing
them, by which means they had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to make their eſcape. O action truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and worthy of all praiſe! Precious Fruit of
the mental reſervation of the Jeſuits!</p>
            <p>The World muſt alſo be informed, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three years Study ſpent upon this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Divinity, the Jeſuits make choice of
their Preachers, and Miſſionaries, without
ever having had the time, nay it may be, ſo
much as a thought, to read the Scriptures or
the Fathers; and accordingly we may gueſs,
what theſe men are capable to perform. The
former, <hi>viz.</hi> their Preachers abound in words,
without much Senſe or Solidity, <hi>Multa verba,
nullus fere ſenſus:</hi> And as for the latter, that is,
their Miſſionaries, we may take the height of
their Standard, by thoſe of them we meet with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42118:38"/>
in <hi>England;</hi> whoſe whole Stock commonly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to no more than two or three poor
Arguments, which after all conclude nothing.</p>
            <p>They demand in the firſt place, Where the
Proteſtant Church was before <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin?</hi>
and then ſet themſelves to exaggerate the
Vices and Defects of thoſe two Perſons. From
thence they paſs over to give a Repreſentation
of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the moſt malicious Colours
they can; and conclude from all this, that it
is very unlikely, that God ſhould ever have
made uſe of ſuch Perſons, to make a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Others of them ask a Proteſtant, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be abſolutely impoſſible for a Man to be
ſaved in the Romiſh Religion? And becauſe he
is more Charitable than they are, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to condemn any one, they would infer
from thence, that theirs is the ſureſt ſide.</p>
            <p>I am acquainted here in <hi>London</hi> with a Lady,
who turned Papiſt in King <hi>James</hi> his time;
the Argument that overſwayed her was this:
The Jeſuits told her, that that muſt be the true
Church, which can give full aſſurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to all her Members; that the Proteſtant
Church gives no aſſurance at all; but that the
Romiſh Church does: From whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſhe muſt be the true Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
this Gentlewoman went, as ſhe ſaid,
and conſulted the moſt able Doctors of <hi>London,</hi>
the Deans and Biſhops, asking them, Whether
by perſevering a good Proteſtant, and living
well, ſhe ſhould Infallibly be ſaved? To which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42118:39"/>
ſhe ſaith, they gave her only this Anſwer,
That they hoped, that by the goodneſs of God,
and the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe ſhould be
ſo. This ſo modeſt and rational an Anſwer,
was not ſufficient to confirm the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
The Jeſuits were not wanting to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to her, that the Biſhops had ſaid to her, <hi>we
hope,</hi> which did expreſs nothing of Certainty
or Aſſurance; but that as for them, they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her, that ſhe ſhould Infallibly be Saved in
the Roman Catholick Religion.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is not eaſy for me to believe, that
ſo pitiful an Argument ſhould have been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to perſwade a Gentlewoman, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſeems to have Wit enough; and that in
all probability, there muſt have been ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
motive of Intereſt lurking, more ſtrong
than all this, and that ſome Promiſe had been
given her, of the advancement of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in King <hi>James</hi> his Court. In the mean
time, he is at preſent in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the fair Promiſes the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
may have given him, he is fain to live
on hopes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I may not run out into a long Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
having now repreſented to you the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and method of the Studies of the Jeſuits,
I ſhall paſs over to the Studies of the other
Religious Orders, which I ſhall comprize in
few words, that I may not be tedious to you
by an over-long Relation. Thoſe of theſe
Orders, who profeſs a ſtrict and auſtere Rule,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42118:39"/>
complain that the Rigor of their obſervance
exhauſts and flats their Spirits, and makes them
in a manner wholly incapable of applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Study, and that their time is too much
ſhortned by that, which they call the</hi> Divine
Office, <hi>to be able to do any good at it.</hi> How
is it poſſible for me to Study? <hi>ſaid a Reformed
Religious to me,</hi> I muſt riſe at midnight to go to
Mattins, which continue two hours and an half.
After which I return to my Cell, to ſee if I can
take ſome reſt, my Head being much diſordered,
with the unſeaſonable breaking of it: About an
hour or two after, I am fain to riſe again, to go
and meditate, and ſing that which they call <hi>Prime.</hi>
This done, we are ſent to Work in a Garden,
there to Dig and Delve for near two hours more;
after which we muſt go to ſing the <hi>Terce,</hi> and High
Maſs. This done, we go to Dinner, which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with an hour of Recreation; the reſt of the
Day, is taken up in going three times more to the
Church, there to ſing the <hi>Nones, Veſpers</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,</hi>
ſo that we can never have three quarters of
an hour together to our ſelves. For my part, <hi>ſaid
he,</hi> I render thanks to God, that I underſtood a
little Latin, before I ever entred into this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Order, which makes me at preſent to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
a little of my Breviary; but the moſt of my
Brethren ſcarcely underſtand one word of it, and
ſing like ſo many Aſſes, without knowing what
they ſay; and much leſs do they know what Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
or Theology meaneth. They ſay that theſe
kind of Studies are very dangerous to Salvation,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42118:40"/>
and fill Men with Pride and Vanity. For our parts,
we are ſure that by obeying our Superiors, we ſhall
go to Paradiſe, without troubing our Heads before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
to know what kind of place it is. <hi>This
was the Reaſoning of this poor Monk; and
he was ſo far from lamenting, as he ought,
the Miſery of his Condition, which deprived
him of ſo great a Treaſure, as is that which is
the product of Study, that he inſulted over,
and deſpis'd Learning; it being but too natural
to the moſt part of Men, to endeavour to
abaſe and undervalue that, out of a kind of
maliciouſneſs of heart, which their folly or
weakneſs will not ſuffer them to obtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as there are but few Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Orders in <hi>Italy,</hi> where this exact Obſervance
is practiſed; ſo we find other Religious, who
have much more time to themſelves, and that
are altogether of a different humour. And
foraſmuch as the moſt part of theſe, are either
of the Order of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> or S. <hi>Francis,</hi> we
may with reſpect to their Doctrin, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them into <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of theſe, follow the Doctrin of S. <hi>Thomas
Aquinas,</hi> who was a <hi>Dominican.</hi> This <hi>Thomas</hi>
ſtuck cloſe to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in matters of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and ſtudied his Divinity at <hi>Collen,</hi> under
<hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> of the ſame Order. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
afterwards, by the ſubtilty of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to reconcile <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> forcing
that Pagan Philoſopher in a manner, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Chriſtian, and what is yet more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42118:40"/>
a Papiſt, in ſpite of all the averſion he
had to theſe novel Doctrins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was fallen into great Decadence,
and Neglect in S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his time, and 'tis to
him therefore, they attribute the Glory of
having as it were, raiſed him from the Dead,
according to that ſaying, <hi>Sine Thoma mutus
Ariſtoteles, Without</hi> Thomas, Ariſtotle <hi>is Dumb.</hi>
Having addicted himſelf very much to the
reading of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he could not avoid <hi>gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Predeſtination,</hi> nor <hi>efficacious Grace,</hi> which
he ſtrongly maintained, ſhewing himſelf very
inventive and dexterous at ſplitting a Hair in
his way of handling Scholaſtick matters, and
particularly the Points that reſpect <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Urban</hi> IV. who inſtituted the Feaſt of
the Holy Sacrament, ordered him to apply
himſelf to the compoſing of an Office for it.
The Papiſts greatly admire the Hymn, he
made on that Subject, and more particularly
the Proſe, which to this day is Sung at the
Maſs. It is full of the Rapſodies and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
which the Papiſts at preſent do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on that Subject. And he himſelf owns,
about the midſt of the ſaid Proſe, that what
he ſaith of it is incomprehenſible, doth not
fall under the Senſes, and is contrary to, or
beyond the order of natural things.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:42118:41"/>
               <l>Quod non capis, quod non vides,</l>
               <l>Animoſa firmat Fides, praeter rerum ordinem.</l>
               <l>What thou doſt not underſtand, and what thou
doſt not ſee,</l>

things that be.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I am aſtoniſhed how he durſt aſſert that it is
Faith alone, that aſſures us of it; for as ſubtil
as he was, 'tis evident that in his Searching,
he himſelf was very doubtful, whether what
he had writ on this Subject, was true or no.
This Paſſage of his ſeems too remarkable to be
paſt by, without giving you an occaſion of
making ſome Reflexion upon it. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I ſhall relate to you, what <hi>Ribadeneira</hi>
tells us of it, in his <hi>Legends,</hi> in the Life of
S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, ſaith he, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his
Explication of other matters, goes beyond all other
Doctors; yet in the point of this ineffable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Divine Sacrifice, he ſurmounts and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
himſelf, as may be ſeen in his Works, and in
the Office he compoſed at the command of Pope
<hi>Urban IV.</hi> for the Celebration of the Feaſt of the
Holy Sacrament. This thorny and difficult Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
having been once canvas'd in the Univerſity of
<hi>Paris,</hi> concerning the Accidents of Bread and Wine,
which continue there viſible after the Converſion of
the Subſtance to which they belong, into that of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42118:41"/>
Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and which
are called the Sacramental Species or Kinds: S <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
(to whom they had all referr'd themſelves,)
writ to them his thoughts of this Queſtion, upon a
Paper, which he laid upon the Altar; and having
his Eyes and Heart fixed upon a Crucifix which was
there, he beſeeched him moſt earneſtly, that if he
had writ the Truth, he would be pleaſed to do him
the Favour to tell it him; and if not, that he would
pleaſe to ſtop and hinder it. And as he was in
the greateſt Fervour of his Prayer, Jeſus Chriſt
ſhewed himſelf viſibly unto him upon the Altar,
and ſaid to him, You have writ this well, <hi>Thomas.</hi>
The Saint continuing his Prayer, being Proſtrate
on the Ground, his Body was lifted up into the
Air, and continued ſo, hovering there for a good
while, in the Preſence of many Religious of the
Convent.</p>
            <p>At another time, when he compoſed the Office of
the Romiſh Church, which they ſing on the day of
the most Holy Sacrament, being then in the City
of <hi>Orvieto,</hi> a Crucifix ſpake to him, the ſame
words, which Crucifix is to this day called S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
his Crucifix. The ſame hapned to him alſo at
<hi>Naples;</hi> as he was writing the Third part of his
Sum, the Crucifix which was upon the Altar, ſpake
to him with a loud and intelligible Voice, ſaying,
Thomas, <hi>thou haſt well writ concerning me;
What will thou that I give thee for thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42118:42"/>
Thus far are the Words of <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> the
Jeſuit, in his Legend, which is ſo highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Upon all
which, I deſire you to make this Reflexion,
That if S. <hi>Thomas</hi> had not been doubtful of
what he wrote, he would not have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to ſo many Crucifixes, to be confirm'd
and aſſur'd in his own mind; for otherwiſe it
would have been an open tempting of God,
as it would ſurely be, if at preſent we ſhould
deſire Miracles of him, to prove to us the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. And if
S. <hi>Thomas</hi> doubted of this matter, it follows,
that he was convinced, that theſe things were
not ſolidly ratified in the Goſpel, or in the
Doctrin of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or at leaſt could not be
deduc'd thence, as natural and neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.
Wherefore then doth he ſay in his
Proſe, <hi>Animoſa firmat Fides,</hi> that Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
theſe matters? Men have begun in theſe
latter Ages, to recover a little from theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions
of Jeſus Chriſt, and from theſe
ſpeaking Crucifixes: But <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> had
Wit enough, at that time, to diſcern that his
novel Doctrin did ſtand in need of ſuch
Proofs. True it is alſo, that probably he
might have imagined it; for his aſſiduous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
and Meditation of matters purely
Metaphyſical, had made him extreamly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
and Hypocondriacal; and to make
uſe of the Expreſſions of him, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
his Encomium, <hi>He was ſo extatical and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42118:42"/>
ſo inſenſible, that he ſeemed rather a Statue than
a Man. Inſomuch that whilſt he was a writing
his Books of the Trinity, a Candle burnt his hand,
without his feeling of it: And that which is yet
more wonderful is, that he fell into theſe Extaſies
and Raviſhments, how and when he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Author in moſt pious Terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
a very pleaſant thing of him, and which
ſhews the great abſtraction of Spirit, in which he
was at times. He ſaith, that S. <hi>Thomas</hi> at a time,
ſitting at Table with S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>
who made him to Dine with him, out of the
great reſpect he bore to him and his Order;
without minding what he did, or in whoſe
Company he was, he thump'd with his Hand
upon the Table, ſaying, <hi>I am ſure, the</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees
<hi>will never be able to anſwer this Argument.</hi>
The Prior who was there with him, pull'd
him by his Gown, and put him in mind that
he was at the King's Table; whereupon he
came to himſelf again, as one that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from the other World, and asked Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of the King for his Indiſcretion. This
puts me in mind of a like Action of his in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Duke of <hi>Mantua;</hi> He had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a Fly, and having almoſt immediately
let it eſcape again, he made a moſt fearful
outcry, and a thouſand fruſtraneous efforts to
catch it again, without conſidering that he
was in his Maſters Preſence. I don't pretend
by all this, to imply that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42118:43"/>
a Fool; but on the contrary do affirm, that he
had a great ſtock of Wit; yea, and it may be
was over-ſtock'd with it; but withal, that he
had (as many topping Wits have) many bad
Intervals. The only thing I am aſtoniſh'd at,
is, that they would needs make a Saint of him,
and extol that for an act of Heroical and
tranſcendent Vertue, which indeed was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Diſobedience to the declared Will of his
Mother, and of thoſe that had the Authority
over him, and this when he was yet a young
Child. Moreover, I was willing by the way
to make this ſhort Digreſſion, to give you ſome
kind of Idea of the Man, whom the Papiſts
dignifie with the Name of <hi>The Angel of the
Schools; The Hammer of Hereticks, &amp;c.</hi> This is
he that is the Head of that great Party called
<hi>Thomists,</hi> whereof the chiefeſt are the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Party, no whit leſs conſiderable, is
that of the <hi>Scotists. John Duns</hi> a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi>
and who upon that account was Sirnamed
<hi>Scotus,</hi> was the Head of them. He was of the
Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and lived about the latter
end of the <hi>Fourteenth Century.</hi> He at firſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Opinions of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and taught
them publickly: But his Scholars having one
day Reproached him, That he ſaid nothing,
but what <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſaid before him, <hi>Nihil
dicis quod non dixerit</hi> Thomas; he was touch'd
to the quick with this Reproof, and having a
good opinion of his own Ability, he told
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42118:43"/>
them, That for time to come they ſhould
hear ſuch things from him, as <hi>Thomas</hi> never
ſaid. From that time forwards he affected to
contradict him in every thing: Becauſe <hi>Thomas</hi>
(for Example) was for <hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> he
invented another ſort of Grace, which came
nearer to that of the <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> than to
the Grace of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom <hi>Thomas</hi> followed
in this Point. And in the Sacrament, becauſe
<hi>Thomas</hi> would not have the Body of Chriſt
to be there with its natural Quantity, but only
after a definitive manner; <hi>Scotus</hi> aſſerted the
contrary, and ſaid, That his Body was there
with its whole Quantity. But becauſe he durſt
not ſave himſelf by maintaining, That the
Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
of Place, as being repugnant to Senſe
and Reaſon; his Subtilty put him upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
another ſort of Quantity, which he
determines to be an Extenſion of Parts in
themſelves, <hi>Extenſio partium in ordine ad ſe:</hi>
By which means he made the Generical Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> to be only a Species of his.
This Diſtinction indeed was very ſubtil; yea, ſo
ſubtil, that probably <hi>Scotus</hi> did not underſtand
it himſelf. For how can it be conceived, that a
Body ſhould be extended in it ſelf, without
being ſo with reſpect to Place? I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
with many <hi>Scotiſt</hi> Doctors, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to hold this Opinion from their ſubtil
Doctor, yet had not Subtilty enough to explain
it. This ſame <hi>Scotus</hi> died, being only 35 years
of Age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:42118:44"/>
I do not pretend here to run through all
the Oppoſitions of his Doctrin to that of
<hi>S. Thomas.</hi> The only Reflexion I could wiſh
might be made upon it, is this, That the Popes
dare not declare themſelves more in favour of
the one than of the other, for fear of incenſing
one of both theſe Parties, who are become ſo
powerful in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> However
it is evident, that theſe Doctrins being diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically
oppoſit and contradictory one to the
other in moſt of the Points, it's impoſſible they
ſhould be both true, and conſequently one of
thoſe great Parties muſt needs be in an Error. The
<hi>Romiſh</hi> High Prieſts, who boaſt themſelves to
be <hi>Infallible,</hi> ought (as it ſeems to me) for the
Love alone which they owe to Truth, to
pronounce their Deciſive Rules concerning
this kind of Controverſies; but by Ill-hap theſe
two Parties are too ſtrong for them, and they
would be in danger by pulling down one of
them, to be themſelves buried under the Ruins.
They rather chuſe, ſeeing both Parties do own
the Papal Authority, to let them both alone.
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid nothing concerning
<hi>Efficacious Grace</hi> and <hi>Free-Will,</hi> but what the
Diſciples of S. <hi>Austin</hi> and the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> held,
and ſtill hold to this day, tho' under Terms that
are ſomewhat differing, but ſignifie the ſame
thing: Yet the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> condemned
the former, thereby endeavouring to aggravate
and to render odious (by the Citation of a
great number of Errors) perſons that had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42118:44"/>
lifted up themſelves againſt the Holy See.
<hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> are not only different in
Opinions; but we find alſo, that their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
are at great Variance amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
There are no leſs than three or four
ſorts of <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> who every one of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have Reaſon on their ſide, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
they put upon S. <hi>Thomas;</hi> and the
<hi>Scotiſts</hi> do as much by their <hi>Scotus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have here related concerning thoſe
two Authors, and their Adherents, and what
before I mention'd concerning the <hi>Moliniſts,</hi>
or <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the <hi>Auguſtinians,</hi> agrees gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to all thoſe who profeſs to follow them,
in whatſoever Country they may be. But to
apply this more particularly to the <hi>Italians,</hi> I
ſhall tell you, that they differ in nothing
from others on thoſe Points, ſave only in this,
That they do not trouble themſelves to ſearch
to the bottom of them, except ſome particular
occaſion, and where their own Glory, or
that of their Order is concerned, engage them
to it. They are too great lovers of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and Pleaſures, to concern themſelves with
Theological Notions: And they are the Monks
that have invented that way of Diſputing
which I have mention'd, where I ſpeak of
their Univerſities. They muſt ſhew them the
Arms they intend to fight them with, and
point them to the Parts they deſign to make
their Thruſt at, that they may be ſpared for
their own defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42118:45"/>
There hapned once upon this account a
great Diſorder at <hi>Bononia,</hi> whilſt I was there:
A <hi>Dominican</hi> Father, who was a <hi>French</hi> Man,
had been deſired to oppoſe in the Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> at <hi>Bononia,</hi> where he
was arriv'd ſome days before from Foreign
Countries. He being not over-well acquainted
with their Cuſtoms, after that he had choſen
the <hi>Theſes</hi> he would diſpute againſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
his Arguments, a deſire took him
to change his <hi>Medium,</hi> which did ſo extreamly
confound the poor Defendant, who was not
prepar'd for it, and whoſe Stock was not
ſufficient to remedy ſuch an unlook'd for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
that he Anſwered quite wrong, and
ſet all the Company a Laughing; reſembling
herein a certain perſon I have heard of, Who
being ſent to take his Orders, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
a word of Latin, and had only got
by Heart ſo many Anſwers in order, as the
Biſhop (who was no Conjurer) was commonly
uſed to ask Queſtions; but being confounded
in Marſhalling his Anſwers, was at laſt reduc'd
to ſay, <hi>That he had the Devil in his Sleeve, inſtead
of his Letters Patents;</hi> which he ſuppos'd the
Biſhop had by his Queſtion demanded of him.
The ſame thing hapned to this poor <hi>Dominican,</hi>
who defended the <hi>Theſes;</hi> but ſoon after all,
the Storm fell upon the <hi>French-men.</hi> The
Scholars, who were all of them young Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
were ſo extreamly enrag'd at this
Affront, which they pretended to have been
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42118:45"/>
offer'd to their Colleague, that they had no
patience to ſtay till the Diſpute was ended,
but run away from the place like ſo many
Mad-men, to the Chamber of this poor Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and having broke down the Door, they
tore to pieces ſeveral Turbans of Silk, and
other Curioſities he had brought with him
from <hi>Constantinople.</hi> After this, having watched
him at the Door of the Hall, where the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
had been held, One of them, as he
came forth, gave him a great Box on the Ear;
telling him, <hi>He had best learn another time, to
put his Arguments in Form and Figure.</hi> See here
in the mean time, the Inconveniences to which
the <hi>Italians</hi> expoſe themſelves. They are the
<hi>Monks</hi> alſo who have introduced Feaſts at the
end of their Diſputes, and the ſumptuous
Adorning of the Hall where they are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated;
and in theſe Particulars indeed it is
they ſurpaſs all others.</p>
            <p>It may generally be ſaid of the <hi>Italians,</hi>
That they are never excellent in thoſe Studies
that require a conſtant and ſerious Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as on the contrary, there be very few
can equal them in all others, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
do afford Diverſion and Pleaſure. The
greateſt part of <hi>Monks</hi> in the Convents apply
themſelves to learn to Sing, or Play upon
Inſtruments: Some addict themſelves to Poetry,
in order to make Compoſitions and Sonnets in
Praiſe of their Saints, which they expoſe on
Feſtivals in their Churches; and they are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42118:46"/>
good at it. In the Abby of S. <hi>Michael
in the Wood,</hi> where I Taught at <hi>Bononia,</hi> the
Abbot ſent for a Dancing and a Fencing-Maſter,
to teach his Religious. I thought this
very ſtrange for <hi>Monks;</hi> and one day I took
the freedom to declare my Thoughts of it to
the Abbot. The Prelat Anſwered me, That
there was no hurt in all this, and that they did
it for a good End. <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>in the first
place, we ſometimes act ſome little Tragedies and
Comedies in the Vestry, or in the Church, to which
we Invite our Kindred of both Sexes, and our
Friends, to be merry together. Now, you know
very well, that in the Interludes there is alway
expected ſomething of Boufonry; and ſometimes a
little Ball, or a French-Dance, are very agreeable
to the Ladies; and indeed, if a man cannot Dance
well, he expoſeth himſelf to Laughter, and our
Colleagues become the leſs esteemed, who being all
of them Children of Perſons of Quality, ought
not upon that very account to be ignorant of this
kind of genteel Exerciſes.</hi> The Abbot in giving me
this account, took notice of ſome ſort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
on my Brow when he told me, that
they made uſe of the Church to act their
Farces and Comedies in; and therefore would
needs excuſe himſelf on that Point, by telling
me, That they were in a manner forc'd to ſerve
themſelves of that place, becauſe the Ladies
were not ſuffer'd to enter the Convent, ſo
that they had no other place where to beſtow
them; as if forſooth it were a caſe of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42118:46"/>
and inſuperable neceſſity for the Ladies to
be preſent, or for them to act ſuch kind of
Follies. Sometimes alſo they are guilty of
moſt horrible Profanations, by building their
Theatre upon the High-Altar where their
Holy Sacrament is lodg'd.</p>
            <p>The Abbot further endeavouring to ſatisfie
me, paſt over to another Reaſon, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
ſomewhat more witty. <hi>My Religious,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>have all of them (as you know) great
Penſions, and we cannot hinder them from ſpending
their Mony, as they pleaſe themſelves. Now, I
ſhould be very loath, that they ſhould employ it (as
ſo many others do) in keeping their Whores: This
is that which makes me caſt about continually, by
what means I may moſt dexterouſly get it out of
their hands without offending them, by making
them expend it upon other uſes. 'Tis in this view
that I exhort them, to learn all manner of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes;
as to Dance, to Ride the Great Horſe, and
to handle their Arms. They pay their Maſters
themſelves, and by this means their Purſes are
drained.</hi> The Abbot ſuppos'd he had found a
very plauſible pretext, for allowing his Monks
this liberty; tho' in the mean time others in
the City openly flouted at it, as finding good
reaſon to be againſt the Religious, ſpending
their time in Exerciſes ſo little becoming Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick
Gravity. It is to be obſerved, that all
theſe young Religious were then engaged in a
courſe of Studies, but it was not poſſible to
keep them intent upon them; and ſcarcely
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42118:47"/>
with all the pains taking in the World was it
poſſible to bring them to any thing, ſo ſtrangly
were they taken up with their vain Exerciſes.
See here in what manner the <hi>Italian</hi> Youth
ſpend their time in the Cloiſters; and without
doubt at this rate, they cannot but ſtand in
need of having the Arguments of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
communicated to them, before they
come to Diſpute againſt them on publick Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.
I ſhould ſcarce ever make an end,
ſhould I go about to relate all the ridiculous
Occupations that divert them from their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Treatiſe of Studies with
thoſe of ſome Secular Prieſts, who never
having had the means or inclination to go
and ſtudy at the Univerſities, are forced, or
willing to content themſelves with that which
they have learnt with the Jeſuits. The ſhorteſt
way they have to arrive at their end, which
is to be Ordained Prieſts, is to get by Heart a
little Book called, <hi>Examen Ordinandorum,</hi> the
<hi>Examen of thoſe who are to be Ordained;</hi> which
contains the ordinary Queſtions that are put
to thoſe that deſire to enter into Orders.
The moſt part of them learn this like Parots,
without underſtanding the ſenſe of it; being
aſſured, that no other things ſhall be asked
them. For Ignorance hath ſo far prevailed in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that none at theſe Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are put to it, to ſhew their Scholarſhip.
And theſe Men being once Ordain'd, would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42118:47"/>
rather be Hang'd (ſo to ſay) than ever
after look in a Latin Book, except the <hi>Miſſal</hi>
and their <hi>Breviary;</hi> and yet it is a rare thing
to find any that are able to explain them.
They abandon the Trade of Preaching to
the Monks, as I have already declared in my
LETTERS; and for their part, they content
themſelves to ſay their Maſſes, to gad to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms,
and Burials.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, and a thing known to all
<hi>Italy,</hi> that Biſhopricks and good Benefices, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Employments and Offices are not
beſtowed upon Men of Learning; but upon
thoſe who have moſt Friends, who can beſt
pleaſe and flatter, or who being Rich, are in
a condition to make the beſt advances. The
caſe is very different in <hi>England,</hi> where the
Biſhops, and other Dignitaries, are only choſen
from amongſt the Doctors, and where their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is chiefly conſidered. This is the true Reaſon
why the Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>Rome</hi> do ſo little care
or endeavour to get Learning, as being well
aſſured that it will ſtand them in no ſtead at
all; yea, that their Enemies or Competitors
might take occaſion from thence, to render
them ſuſpected. The Abbot with whom I
Travelled the Firſt Days Journy to <hi>Veletre,</hi>
inform'd me of nothing, but what I knew
before, by the deſcription he gave me of the
way of conferring Biſhopricks and Benefices,
which commonly fell to the ſhare of the moſt
Ignorant. I only asked him, what might be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42118:48"/>
the Reaſon of this great Diſorder? To which
he Anſwer'd, That he did not know, or rather
durſt not tell it me: And for my part, neither
durſt I tell him my Thoughts about it in that
Country. But now, that by the Grace of God
I may freely ſpeak my Mind, I ſhall declare,
that the greateſt Secret of all this is, the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the Heads of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church
have taken, to keep the People committed to
their Charge, as much as they can in a profound
Ignorance. The Doctrin of that Church is ſo
extreamly corrupt; the Contradictions it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are ſo great and many; the Decrees of
the New Councils and Popes, and the Doctrins
of their different Religious Orders are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
and irreconcilable one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the uſe, or rather the commerce and
Trade that is made there of Holy things, or
ſuch as are pretended to be ſo, is ſo baſe and
infamous; the Morals they profeſs are ſo low,
wicked and unworthy, that there is no other
way left to keep that Church ſtanding, but by
abaſing the Spirits of Men by Ignorance, or
rather by wholly blinding of them, to make
them fall into the Abyſs of Error. Now the
beſt Expedient in order to this is, to make clear
work with whatſoever might encourage the
Studies of Learning, and to ſet over the People
Ignorant Biſhops and Paſtors; from which God
preſerve all Proteſtant Churches, and more
eſpecially that of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>BEing Come to <hi>Veletre,</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> took

the <hi>Piazza.</hi> My Hoſt asked me if I had not

and a Lady of Quality, the God-Mother,

and Sumptuous indeed. The Bell was placed
at the Lower end of the Body of the Church,
hanging upon two Gudgeons, covered with
rich Hangings of Velvet, of a Violet Colour,
and the Bell it ſelf, was accoutred with a
kind of Robe of the ſame Stuff. There were
two Theaters Built on each ſide of it, for the
Muſicians, and an Amphitheater for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
who were to be preſent at the Ceremony.
The Pillars and Walls of the Church were
richly adorned, with curious ſheets of Silk,
and Pictures. Near to the Bell, was Erected
an Altar, very neatly ſet forth, and upon it
lay a white Satin Robe, which was to be put
upon the Bell, as ſoon as it ſhould be Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with a great and fair Garland of choice
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42118:49"/>
Flowers: There was alſo upon the Altar a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Ritual, a Cenſer, and a Veſſel with Holy
Water, and round about the Altar, rich Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
Elbow-Chairs, for the Prieſts, who were
to perform the Ceremony. Juſt over-againſt
it, a Throne was ſeen moſt Magnificently
Hung, for the God-Father and God-Mother
of the Bell. About Ten of the Clock the
Company came, and having taken their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places, the Prieſts began their Function.
He who officiated was a Biſhop <hi>in partibus,</hi>
whom the Biſhop of <hi>Veletre,</hi> being at that
time very Sick, had deputed for this purpoſe,
and his Chair was placed upon the Steps of
the high Altar. He ſtruck up the firſt Pſalm,
which was continued by the Muſick. Theſe
Pſalms, by the way, which may be ſeen in
the Roman Ritual, have as much reference to
the Baptizing of a Bell, as to the Baptizing of
the Moon; the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
having never had the leaſt notion of the
Baptiſm of Bells. After that the Pſalms were
ended, the Biſhop began the Bleſſing of Holy
Water, to Sanctifie it in the firſt place, to the
end that afterwards it might Sanctifie the Bell
alſo. This Benediction is very long, and no
leſs Ridiculous; which being Finiſhed, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
and Prieſts dipt Spunges in it, with which
they rub'd over the Bell, from the top to the
bottom, within and without, being in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
certainly much better Baptized, than
Children are, upon whoſe Heads only they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42118:50"/>
pour or ſprinkle a little of it. They repeated
in the mean time abundance of Prayers, which
ſpeak of nothing elſe but Heavenly Bleſſings,
that are to Purifie, Sanctifie, and Conſecrate
the Bell; <hi>Ut hoc Tintinnabulum,</hi> ſay they, <hi>coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſti
Benedictione perfundere, purificare, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care
&amp; conſecrare digneris. That thou wouldest
be pleaſed to Rinſe, Purifie, Sanctifie, and
Conſecrate this Bell, with thy Heavenly Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The Bell being thus well waſht, they dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it with clean Napkins; and the Biſhop
having taken the Viol of Holy Oils, which
are thoſe they bleſs on Holy Thurſday, for
the whole year following, he therewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
the Croſs of Metal, which is on the
top of the Bell, in order to make the Devils
flee at the Sound or Ringing of it: <hi>Ut hoc au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientes
Tintinnabulum tremiſcant &amp; fugiant, ante
Crucis in eo depictum vexillun: That hearing this Bell
they may tremble and flee, before the Banner of
the Croſs deſigned upon it.</hi> He afterwards made
ſeven other Croſſes with the ſaid Oil, upon
the outſide of the Bell, and four on the inſide.
This done, he made the God-Father and God-Mother
draw near, and demanded of them
in <hi>Italian,</hi> Whether they were the Perſons
that Preſented this Bell to be Conſecrated?
Who having anſwered that they did; he then
asked them, Whether the Metal of the Bell,
and the Workmanſhip of it, had been paid
for to the Artificers? To which they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Yea. They make this demand, becauſe it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42118:50"/>
hath ſometime hapned, that for want of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Workmen have ſeiz'd and fetch'd
away their Bells, the very ſame day, or the
day after it hath been Baptized, and have
melted them down, to be employed to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
uſes. The third Queſtion he asked of
them, was, Whether they believed all that
the Catholick, Apoſtolick, Roman Church
believes, concerning the Holineſs and Virtue
of Bells? The anſwer to which was affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
alſo. In the Laſt place, he demanded
of them, what Name they deſired ſhould be
put upon the Bell? To which the Lady an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>Mary.</hi> Then the Biſhop took two
great ſilk Ribbands, which had been faſtned
to the Gudgeons of the Bell, and gave each
of them one in their Hands, and pronounced
with a Loud Intelligible Voice, the words of
Conſecration, which are theſe: <hi>Conſecretur &amp;
Sanctificetur Signum iſtud, in nomine Patris &amp; Filii
&amp; Spiritus Sancti,</hi> Amen. <hi>Let this Sign be Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
and Sanctified in the name of the Father, Son,
amd Holy Ghoſt, Amen.</hi> Then turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the People, he ſaid, The Name of this
Bell is <hi>Mary.</hi> Afterwards he takes the Cenſer,
and Cenſeth it on the out-ſide round about,
and afterwards put the Cenſer under the Bell,
filling it with Sacred Fumes, and repeating all
this while Prayers and Invocations, that it
might be filled with the Dew of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<hi>Tu hoc Tintinnabulum Spiritus Sancti rore
perfunde, ut ante ſonitum illius ſemper fugiat Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42118:51"/>
Inimicus. Do thou all beſprinkle this Bell
with the Dew of thy Holy Spirit, that at the ſound
of it, the Enemy of all good may always take his
Flight.</hi> The Office was carried on with a
great number of Pſalms, which they repeated;
the Muſick all the while performing wonders;
and then the Biſhop, for to ſhut up the whole
Ceremony, arrayed the Bell with the white
Robe of a Proſelyte or Convert, and with a
loud Voice read the Goſpel of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha:</hi>
I ſuppoſed at that time, that the reaſon
of their reading this Goſpel, was, becauſe the
Bell was called <hi>Mary;</hi> but I have ſeen ſince
in the Roman Ritual, that the ſame Goſpel is
read at the Conſecration of all Bells, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their Names be. This is that I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
at, becauſe that Goſpel hath no reference
at all to the Ceremony. The whole Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being thus ended, the Biſhop gave his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and the Prieſts received great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
from the God-Father and God-Mother.</p>
            <p>The Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Bells, may be reduced to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Points. The Firſt is, that they have Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and pray God for the Living and the
Dead. Secondly, That they do produce, by
a Divine Virtue conferr'd upon them, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Hearts of Believers. Thirdly,
That they drive away Storms and Tempeſts;
and in the Fourth place, drive away Devils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42118:51"/>
Before that I run over theſe four Points,
Ile tell you a Story that hapned at <hi>Bononia,</hi>
and is of ſufficient Antiquity, tho' the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thereof be ſtill preſerved freſh and entire.
They had been Baptizing a Bell in the Church
of S. <hi>Proculo,</hi> which is an Abby of <hi>Benedictines,</hi>
and after all the Ceremonies, Benedictions and
Prayers, <hi>that the Bell might do good to all, and
hurt to no body;</hi> the firſt time of the Ringing
of it, it fell upon the poor Sacriſtan or Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
that Rung it, and who had taken more
care and pains for the Solemn Baptizing of it,
than to get it well hung and faſtned, and broke
his Neck, together with it ſelf into a thouſand
pieces. The Name of the Sacriſtan was <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi>
and this ingenious Diſtick was made to
Celebrate the Memory of this Accident,
which at this day is found Engraved upon a
Stone, of a Foot Square, near to the Church
Door, where the thing hapned.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Si procul à Proculo Proculi Campana fuiſſet:</l>
               <l>I am procul à Proculo, Proculus ipſe foret.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The agreeableneſs of this Verſe cannot be
rendred in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe of the Adverb
<hi>Procul,</hi> which in our Language is not the ſame,
and therefore will not comport with the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but the Senſe of it, as well as it can be
rendred is this: If the Bell of S. <hi>Proculus</hi> had
been far from <hi>Proculus, Proculus</hi> would at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42118:52"/>
be far from <hi>Proculus,</hi> that is, he would not
as yet have been Buried in that place.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the four Prerogatives,
that are attributed to Bells, by thoſe of the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The firſt ſeems to me to
ſmell too rank of Intereſt, to be ſo eaſily
ſwallowed. I ſhall not take up my time to
prove to you, that an inſenſible and material
thing is incapable of either Merit or Prayer;
my deſign having never been to prove what I
ſet down, by Theological Arguments, but only
to alledge matters of Fact. If indeed they
Rung their Bells for nought, the Doctrin of
<hi>Rome</hi> might inſinuate it ſelf with more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Truth: But a Man muſt pay ſo
dear, to be partaker of their Merit and Prayers,
that it mars the Plot; and I know not why
the Prieſts and Monks ſhould not ſcruple this
Simonio. There are little, midling and great
Bells, and the Mony to be paid for the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, encreaſes proportionably to the
bigneſs of the Bells. There is all the reaſon
in the World indeed, that the Perſons that
Ring them ſhould be paid; but why the Prieſts
ſhould over and above this, receive a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sum of Mony, I ſee not. Is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that this is ſome of the Fruit and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of their novel Doctrin? It ſeems they
would fain introduce amongſt us a new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
according to which ſcarcely any but the
Rich ſhould be ſaved, foraſmuch as none but
they, are in a Condition to pay well for the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42118:52"/>
Graces of God, which theſe Men tell us they
have at their diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>When a Poor Man dies in <hi>Italy,</hi> they bury
him without ever Ringing a Bell, or ſaying
any Maſs for him, except any one out of
Charity will be at the Charges of it for him.
They ſay the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prieſts do (as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular)
outvy the <hi>Italians</hi> in Covetouſneſs;
and Perſons who have been in <hi>Spain</hi> have
aſſur'd me, That when a Poor Man dies, they
expoſe his Body in the moſt frequented Street
and Thorough-fare of the City, to the end
that the People who go and come, may caſt
in ſome Pieces of Mony for their Interment.
The Prieſts come ever and anon to ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the whole Sum be gathered; and, if they
ſhould find ſo much as one Penny wanting,
they would leave the Body there, to ſtink and
infect the place, without ever offering to touch
it. See here to what a ſtrange height of Shame
and Infamy Popery hath reduc'd things! I
mean by Popery, all that new Meſs of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins,
which only tends to fill the Purſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Point of Doctrin, which is this,
<hi>That the Sound of Bells increaſeth the Devotion of
the Faithful,</hi> is built on the ſame Foundation
as the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Covetouſneſs and baſe
Avarice, or rather downright Rapin and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.
The more Bells that are Rung at a
Chriſtning, and the longer time they are
Rung, the greater portion of Grace doth the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42118:53"/>
Infant receive: The more Bells, and the
longer they are rung at a Marriage, the greater
ſhare do the Married Couple obtain of the
Grace of Conjugal Love: The more Bells are
rung at a Burial, and the longer they are rung,
the greater Refreſhment and Ventilation doth
the Soul of the Departed receive in the Flames
of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the ſooner is delivered from
them: The more Bells are rung on a Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and the longer time the Ringing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
the more the Perſons that come to
Church are made partakers of Heavenly
Graces and Bleſſings. But withal it is to be
noted, that all theſe <hi>mores</hi> cannot be obtained
without <hi>more Mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proceed we to the Third Point, which is
this, <hi>That Bells (by the Grace which is infuſed
into them at their Baptiſmal-Conſecration) have
the vertue of diſſipating Thunder, of laying High
Winds, driving away Tempests, and calming of
Storms.</hi> There is never a thing in Nature
which produceth any effect, never ſo little
beyond what is common, but the Papiſts will
needs make a Miracle of it. The Sound of
Bells, by ſtriking the Air, doth ſometimes
diſſipate the Clouds; but ſometimes alſo it
ſplits or breaks them, and makes the Thunder
to fall upon the very Churches or Steeples
where they are rung, as when a Cloud chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to be directly hovering over them. The
former of theſe effects is a Miracle with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42118:53"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Prieſts ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of it, to give credit to the Benedictions
they beſtow upon their Bells; notwithſtanding
that it is very evident at the ſame time, that
the Thunder lights oftner upon Steeples, than
upon any other places, and ſometimes melts all
the Bells, which, one would think, might be
ſufficient to ſtop their Mouths for ever on this
Point. There is a Little Bell at <hi>Venice,</hi> in the
Convent of <hi>Capucins</hi> in the <hi>Judeca,</hi> which has
the Vogue of being ſo miraculous againſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts;
and the People are ſo Superſtitiouſly
poſſeſt with it, that when there is the leaſt
Storm, if the <hi>Capucins</hi> ſhould chance to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to ring it, the People would not fail to
beſiege them in their Convent, and cut them
in pieces. And to the end that all may be
attributed to the Merit of this Bell, they do
not ring it all out, but only Toll it, ſo that
between each Toll a Man may repeat the
Lord's Prayer three or four times.</p>
            <p>It remains, that I ſpeak one word of the
Fourth Vertue, which is that of <hi>Chaſing away
Devils.</hi> A Religious <hi>Benedictin</hi> of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of <hi>S. Maurus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> once related to
me a Story, which evidently proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
It was then not above Three years
ago ſince it hapned in a Monaſtery, where he
was at that time. Theſe Monks riſe at Two
of the Clock in the Morning, to go and ſing
their Mattins and Morning Song. The Devil,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42118:54"/>
or ſome Hobgoblin it ſeems, had taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Bell, and uſed to Ring the Firſt
Peal, and never fail'd of doing it very exactly
at the Hour, without miſſing one Minute. He
continued this good Office to the Monaſtery
for Six years together, ſo that the Monks found
themſelves rid of the trouble of Ringing it.
A vaſt number of People from the Towns and
Villages thereabouts, believing it to be a Fable
that was told them, had the Curioſity to come
and ſee this Bell, which Rung of it ſelf at
Two of the Clock in the Morning, without
any one touching it; and they themſelves were
irreproachable Witneſſes of it. Now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
one Night in Winter, that this officious
Devil rang his Bell three Hours ſooner than
ordinary. The Prior of the Monaſtery, who
was not yet gone to Bed, and was Writing of
Letters, took notice of the Irregularity; and
ſpelling nothing of good from it, he went
immediately to the Door of the Church, where
he ſtaid for the Religious; who being waked
at the ſound of the Bell, and believing that
the time for their Devotions was come, went
to Mattins; but the Prior ſent them all back to
their Cells, without ſuffering any one of them
to enter into the Church, telling them, That
he fear'd the Devil had a mind to play them
ſome unlucky Trick. Neither was he miſtaken
in his ſurmiſe; for about half an Hour after
the Roof of the Quire fell down, and would
have buried them all in its Ruins, had they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42118:54"/>
been there at that time to ſing their Mattins.
The Devil had ſo well gueſs'd at the time
when that old Roof would fall, that he knew
the Hour and Moment thereof; ſo that he
had not put himſelf upon performing this
good Office for them, but only with the
deſign of doing them a great miſchief, if the
Prior had not out-witted him.</p>
            <p>To apply this to our Subject: We find here
that the Devil was ſo far from being frighted
at the Ringing of the Bell, that he Rung it
himſelf, and made uſe of it for the bringing
about of his Malicious intent. Leave we then
this Superſtition of <hi>Bells</hi> to the Papiſts, nor
let this hinder us from making uſe of them,
as commodious Inſtruments to call Believers
together, to ſhew Reſpect to our Dead, and
to be made uſe upon occaſion of Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings;
yet without believing they can make
us better, and without attributing to inſenſible
things, the precious Aids and Helps of our
Salvation, which are the Graces which we
receive from God alone, by the Merits of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I feel an unexpreſſible Joy
to ſee, that the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> have
ſo far forgot the Superſtitious Practices of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is at preſent a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
and ſtrange thing to them, when they
are told of them: But on the other hand; I
cannot bear to ſee the Papiſts take occaſion
from this forgetfulneſs, to calumniate thoſe
who have a mind to write or ſpeak of thoſe,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42118:55"/>
as ſome of them have done who have ſaid,
That I had impos'd upon them, by relating
ſeveral Superſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Practice whereof they deny. Amongſt
other things they have Inſtanc'd in the Bleſſing
of Eggs at <hi>Eaſter:</hi> To which I Anſwer, That
they might as well have given the Lye to their
<hi>Roman Ritual,</hi> where the ſaid Formular of
Bleſſing them is found at length in theſe terms:</p>
            <p>Subveniat, quaeſumus, Domine, tuae Benedictionis
Gratia, huic Ovorum Creaturae, ut Cibus ſalubris
fiat Fidelibus tuis, in tuarum gratiarum actione
ſumentibus, ob Reſurrectionem Domini noſtri Jeſu
Chriſti, qui tecum vivit &amp; regnat, &amp;c. Et
aſpergat Aqua Benedicta.</p>
            <p>In Engliſh thus:</p>
            <p>Let, we beſeech thee, O Lord, the Grace of
thy Bleſſing ſuccour this Creature <hi>Eggs,</hi> that it
may become wholſom Food to thy Faithful, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them with giving Thanks to thee, for the
Reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Christ, who lives
and reigns with thee, &amp;c. And let him beſprinkle
them with Holy-Water.</p>
            <p>In the ſaid <hi>Ritual</hi> we meet with many other
Bleſſings, which I have not mention'd, that
are never a whit leſs ridiculous. We find
there Bleſſings for Houſes, for Ships, for
Swords, for the New Fruits of the Earth, for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42118:55"/>
the Nuptial Bed, for Aſſes and for Horſes, and
in a word, for all ſorts of Beaſts that are ſick.
And becauſe it's likely the Papiſts might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to perſuade People, that I had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon them, as to this laſt inſtance. See
here the very words of it, as they are ſee
down in the Appendix of the <hi>Roman Ritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Primo, Animalia aſpergantur Aqua Benedictâ;
poſtea Sacerdos dicat,</p>
            <p>Miſericordiam tuam, Domine, ſupplices exoramus,
ut haec animalia, quae gravi infirmitate vexantur,
tuâ Benedictione ſanantur, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Aſpergantur iterum Aqua Benedictâ.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Beaſts must be sprinkled with Holy
Water; and then let the Prieſt ſay,</p>
            <p>We humbly implore thy Mercy, O Lord, that
theſe Living Creatures, which are troubled with
great Infirmity, may by thy Bleſſing be healed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let them again be ſprinkled with Holy-Water.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, that in their other Bleſſings
they uſe but one Aſperſion of Holy-Water;
but that in this they uſe Two Sprinklings, the
one at the beginning, and the other at the
end of the Benediction. I cannot give you
any Reaſon for it, except it be, that the Beaſts
being greater in bulk, ſeem to them therefore
to ſtand in need of a greater Sanctification.
It will not now be look'd upon as a ſtrange
thing, what Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> hath writ in his Letters
concerning the Bleſſing of <hi>Aſſes</hi> and <hi>Horſes,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42118:56"/>
which he ſaw in <hi>Italy,</hi> having here given you
the Authentick Form of it, which the Papiſts
cannot deny.</p>
            <p>There is another Obſervance in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is ſtill more ridiculous than
this, which is their Exorciſing of <hi>Rats, Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars,
Flies,</hi> and all other Inſects between the
Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> I my ſelf have
aſſiſted very often, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> to
the performing of this Ceremony; and herein
I can ſay, that I have been among the number
of Fools: True it is, that it was for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
for we were well paid for our pains.
We go from one Farm to another, from one
Country-Houſe to another, and almoſt upon
every piece of Ground we repeat our Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms.
We beſpeak all theſe little Inſects, no
otherwiſe than if they were Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and make uſe of the Name of God to
Adjure them.</p>
            <p>Adjuro vos per Deum Sanctum, per Deum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,
per Deum Omnipotentem, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Adjure you by the Holy God, by the Living
God, by the Almighty God, to depart theſe Grounds,
and to get you gone to Deſert and Waſte places,
where you may not be in a condition of hurting
any one, nor the Fruits of the Earth.</p>
            <p>(If this be not to take the Name of God in
vain, I don't know what is.) Beſides, all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42118:56"/>
this was nothing, but meer Labour in Vain;
becauſe there was not ſo much as one poor
Worm or Caterpillar, that offered to budge
from its place for all this puther. When we
were quite tired with Exorciſing, we went to
refreſh our ſelves in the firſt Farm that was
next to us, where the good Country People
did not fail to ſet before us the beſt that they
had. We found ſome amongſt them tho',
that were no Fools; They told us, <hi>Sirs, If we
did not take the pains to rid our Trees of the</hi> Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars,
<hi>your Exorciſms would ſtand us in poor
ſtead.</hi> We reproved them for their want of
Faith, which render'd the pains we took un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to them. The moſt part of the
Peaſants, by way of acknowledgment for theſe
Exorciſms, ſend all their Firſt-Fruits to the
Prieſts that have Officiated them, ſo that
we had always the Firſt-Fruit of every Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>I was once Invited by a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> to
paſs the time of <hi>Vintage</hi> with him in the
Country at his Houſe of Pleaſure, Two Miles
from <hi>Rovigo,</hi> in the <hi>Poleſiné.</hi> When we arrived
there, there were a kind of Flies, which (as
they ſaid) were fallen from the Sky, and did
much miſchief; they ſuck'd and devour'd all
the Grapes that were not yet ripe. The Noble
<hi>Venetian</hi> deſired me to accompany the Curate
of the Pariſh, in order to Exorciſe them;
Accordingly we went thither with five or ſix
Clergy-men more. The Heat was ſo exceſſive
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42118:57"/>
that we were forced to go for ſhelter into every
Houſe we met with in the Fields. Now it
hapned by Miſchance, that he who carried
the Holy-Water, (whether by his having drunk
much, or otherways) fell aſleep in a Cellar,
where he was entred to cool himſelf. We did
not take notice of his not following us, and
we walk'd almoſt a Mile to a certain Field,
where we were to Exorciſe. Here we began
to call for our Holy-Water, without which
nothing was to be done; but the Man was not
to be found, and we were oblig'd to ſend ſome
Body to ſeek for him with all ſpeed. We
ſtaid there near an Hour expecting him, and
during that time the Flies ſtung us ſo terribly,
that our Faces and Hands were all of a
Gore-blood; they plainly ſhew'd by this their
rudeneſs, that they did not care a Ruſh
for our Exorciſms, and accordingly in our
own defence, we diſpatch'd them as quick,
as poſſible, and with all expedition return'd
to our firſt Houſe. Theſe Inſects we found
diſcharged their fury during the Heat of the
Day; for towards Evening one might ſafely
walk abroad, without being moleſted by
them. And then it was that we went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commenced
our Exorciſms, tho' without the
leaſt ſucceſs; for the Flies perſiſted to make the
ſame havock as before, until that a continual
Rain of four or five days kill'd and ſwept
them all away, better than all the Holy-Water
might have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:42118:57"/>
I went at another time, during my ſtay at
<hi>Bononia,</hi> to Exorciſe the Inſects in the Country,
in Company of a Country Curate, who had
a very Comical Wit. He had always a word
ready to make the Company laugh, and all his
Exorciſms were meer Fancies, or perfect
Drolling. He did not tye himſelf to the
Ritual, or Form preſcrib'd by the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Church, but made his Paraphraſe upon every
thing; ſometimes he ſpoke to the <hi>Piſmires;</hi>
ſometimes to the <hi>Graſshoppers;</hi> ſometimes he
made his Apoſtroph's to the <hi>Rats, Lizards,</hi>
and <hi>Worms.</hi> He baniſh'd them all one after
another, to the Countries which he aſſign'd
them for the place of their Exile, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated
the <hi>Moles</hi> to the Antartick Pole,
without once knowing what it was. He had
ſcarcely pronounc'd the dreadful Sentence, but
a <hi>Mole</hi> came forth out of his Hole; whereupon
the Curate cried out, <hi>Courage, my Friends, look!
there's one of them which is ready to begin his
march.</hi> But the <hi>Mole;</hi> it ſeems, had no
mind to take ſo tedious a Journy, and no
ſooner had ſmelt the Oar, but crept into
another Hole near to it, in the ſame Field.
Then one of the Peaſants that was preſent,
ran to look into the Hole, to which the <hi>Mole</hi>
had betaken himſelf, and ſaid very innocently,
<hi>What, Sir, is this the Antartick Pole?</hi> We could
not forbear Laughing; and becauſe we ſaw
that this was diametrically oppoſite to that
great Gravity, that muſt more particularly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42118:58"/>
be affected upon theſe ſorts of occaſions, we
deſired him to leave off his Drollery; but he
was ſo habituated to it, that he had much
ado to command himſelf. His way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo was much to the ſame purpoſe, which
made, that tho' he was very ignorant, they
ſtock'd from all the Villages thereabouts, to
have the divertiſement of hearing him Preach.
I have been preſent at many other Exorciſms,
and Benedictions of the Fruits of the Earth.
The Prieſts are very willing and ready to
officiate or aſſiſt at them; foraſmuch as it is
an employment both pleaſant and profitable
for thoſe that diſcharge it. For by this
means they take the freedom to enter into all
the Country-Houſes of Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and into their Gardens, where they
never fail of being well Entertain'd. At the
time of Vintage they go and Bleſs the Wine
in the Fats; and at <hi>S. Martin,</hi> the Wine in the
Cellars.</p>
            <p>I might proceed to relate to you, a great
number of other Benedictions and Exorciſms,
to ſhew you the Abuſe is made thereof by the
Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but becauſe I
fear keeping you too long upon one and the
ſame Subject, I ſhall chuſe rather, to diverſifie
it by ſome other Relation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take my Subject from a Remark I
made at the Abby of <hi>Foſſa Nova,</hi> whither I
Journyed from <hi>Veletre,</hi> after having ſeen the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42118:58"/>
Baptizing of the Bell, which I have already
deſcribed. This Abby is not far from <hi>Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine;</hi>
and it was here that <hi>S. Thomas Aquinas</hi>
died, on his Way to the Council of <hi>Lions.</hi>
The Curioſity I had to ſee the Place where
he was Buried, made me alight; and the
Monks of that Abby, who are <hi>Bernardines,</hi>
ſhew'd me a great deal of Civility. They led
me to a Little Chapel under-ground, where
they told me that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> was laid after his
Death. I deſired them to ſhew me his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;
but they told me, They could not
anſwer my Requeſt, becauſe his Body had
never been taken up out of the Ground; and
that the Altar of the Chapel was built upon
his Tomb. But for all this fair Story, I knew
very well, that Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the Fifth had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
his Body upon the Religious of S. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicus,</hi>
who had tranſlated it to their Convent
at <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> and what I enquir'd concerning
it of theſe Monks, was only to diſcover their
Honeſty in the caſe. I told them alſo, That
I had ſeen a <hi>Capucin</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who had ſhewed
me a conſiderable piece of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Arm,
which he ſaid, the Fathers of <hi>Foſſa Nova</hi> had
beſtowed upon him. I gave them a deſcription
of this <hi>Capucin</hi> from Head to Foot, which
made them at laſt call to mind one that was
a <hi>German,</hi> who after he had Fudled himſelf
in their Monaſtery, had with ſo much Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
requeſted of them ſome Relick of
<hi>S. Thomas;</hi> telling them, He was reſolved not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42118:59"/>
to leave their Monaſtery, till they had given
him one; that at length they were fain to
ſhew him a great heap of Dead-mens Bones,
which was in a Corner of the Chapel, amongſt
which he had choſen the Relick which he
had ſhewed me. They told me, That
they themſelves queſtion'd, whether there
might not be ſome Relicks of that Saint
amongſt all their Bones, becauſe the Earth of
the Chapel had been ſtirred ſeveral times;
and tho' it was preciſely believ'd, that the
Body of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> did reſt under the Altar,
yet they were not abſolutely ſure of it. This
is the Reaſon (ſaid they) why many Perſons
have made no difficulty to take ſome of theſe
Bones, in the Conceit, that they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be ſome of his; or at leaſt in hopes,
that the Preſence of the Body of the Saint,
near whom they had the Honour to Reſt, might
have communicated to them ſome Heavenly
Vertue.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak the truth, theſe are the very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
which the Gentlemen of <hi>Rome;</hi> I
mean the Pope and Cardinals, make uſe of
every day, with reference to the Holy Bodies,
which they fetch out of the <hi>Catacombes,</hi>
and which they ſend ſo boldly, and ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to places of their Communion, to be
Worſhiped there. Theſe <hi>Catacombes,</hi> in the
Senſe they take them in, are Subterranean
Places, where Believers aſſembled themſelves
in the times of Perſecution; and where they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42118:59"/>
Buried the Corps of their Martyrs; but they
alſo indifferently Buried there the Bodies of all
Chriſtians, ſo that as theſe places ſerved them
for Temples, or places to meet in, ſo they
ſerved them alſo for Church-yards to bury
their Dead. The Popes having in theſe laſt
Ages, taken into mature Conſideration, the
great gain they reaped from the Bones of their
Saints, had recourſe to theſe places, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible
Mines, and indifferently ſeized all
the Bones they met with there: Yea, their
Avarice laſht out to that degree, that either
not knowing, or not being able to diſtinguiſh
the true <hi>Catacombes,</hi> they have gone to ſearch
for dead Bodies in the Common Sewers, or
Subterranean Vaults, which were the Sinks to
carry off the filth of the City, and where in
ancient times they were uſed to fling the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Malefactors, after their Execution.
True it is, that amongſt them, were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found the Bodies of Martyrs, which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
the knowledge of Chriſtians. The
Popes not having the power to diſtinguiſh the
one from the other, and to ſpare themſelves
a trouble, which beſides would have been pure
labour loſt, by the Power of God himſelf,
which they profeſs themſelves to have, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
them all, <hi>dictum factum,</hi> into Saints.
The Heathens had alſo Caves and Vaults,
where they cauſed themſelves to be Interr'd
with their whole Families; and the greateſt
part of all theſe Bones, are now upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42118:60"/>
of the Papiſts, under the name of Saints,
taken up out of the <hi>Catacombes.</hi> And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the Popes are ignorant of their
Names, they baptize them anew, and give
them a Name as beſt pleaſeth them, which is
the cauſe, why there be found ſo many Saints
of the ſame Name. This is alſo the true cauſe
of ſo many Conteſts and Trials between the
Prieſts and the Monks, who all pretend in
good time, to be the ſole Poſſeſſors of the
Primitive Saint, of this or the other Name.
Theſe Trials are to be determined at <hi>Rome,</hi>
by means of Mony, which ſtill inflames the
Popes with a greater Zeal, to ſend as many as
they can of theſe Saints into all parts, which
one day or other will not fail to furniſh them
with matter for Trials ſo gainful to them; yea,
we may affirm that there be almoſt as many
Trials at <hi>Rome,</hi> about Relicks, as about Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
matters. Now the Doctrin which ſerves
to quiet the Conſciences of the Romaniſts,
from the checks that might torment them, for
having expoſed, and ſtill daily expoſing ſuch
abominable Filthineſſes upon their Altars, is
this, that they believe, that what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
that the unbelieving Wife, is ſanctified by the
believing Husband, ought alſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of their Relicks; foraſmuch as all the
Bones, which are found in one Vault, are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by their Neighbourhood with thoſe of
one Saint. Or at leaſt, if this won't do,
they betake themſelves to their laſt ſhift, which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42118:60"/>
is this, That a good intention is an abundant
excuſe for all theſe petty irregularities in thoſe,
who continue in the boſom of the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that it is enough according to them,
to have a right intention of honouring ſuch a
Saint, or ſhe Saint, and to receive with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Obedience the Inſtruments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to them, for to honour them. They
have propounded ſuch like Arguments to the
Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> to perſuade them to go
to Maſs. Why do you fear, ſay they, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
the Hoſt, as long as you direct your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to Jeſus Chriſt, who in it is worſhiped?
For by this means it will be Jeſus Chriſt whom
you ſhall adore, and not the Bread, ſuppoſing
it to be ſo: Only be obedient to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and your good intention ſhall ſave
you. And they have diſcourſed them at the
ſame rate about Relicks.</p>
            <p>Now the uſe, that the Prieſts and Monks of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do make of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
is this, that there are no Bones whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
no not the Bones of an Aſs or Horſe,
but they may make Relicks of them; they
need only break a piece of them and tell you,
that it is a Relick of one of the Eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Virgins that ſuffered Martyrdom at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
or elſe one of the Soldiers of the <hi>Theban</hi>
Legion, who were all cut in pieces at the
paſſage of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> for refuſing to Sacrifice
to <hi>Mars</hi> the Traveller. They may ſhew you
the Rib of a ſucking Pig, and tell you it is a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42118:61"/>
Relick of one of the little Innocents, who
were Maſſacred at our Saviours Birth; or
Laſtly, tell you that it is the bone of a Saint
taken out of the <hi>Catacombes.</hi> Beſides all theſe,
they can give you many other Categories, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which their Relicks are commonly ranked
and Marſhal'd; and pray how can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
them, as to what they alledge? And as
for them, Good-men, they ſalve their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
by the intention they have, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Honour to ſuch a he or ſhe Saint, for
whom they have the greateſt Devotion, or
who ſuits beſt with their intereſt.</p>
            <p>I was once in the Abby of the Trinity at
<hi>Vandome</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> when they expoſed their
Treaſury of Relicks: They ſhewed us amongſt
other things a Jaw-bone, which the Monks
told us was that of S. <hi>Magdalen;</hi> and a very
able Phyſician, who was preſent at the ſame
time, was ready to maintain to their Faces,
and would forfeit his Head, if he did not
prove to them, by the Texture, ſcaling and
largeneſs of the Bone, that it never belong'd
to a human Body, but it was the piece of the
Jaw-bone of ſome Beaſt or other. But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were ſo far from deſiring him to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
them in the caſe, that they preſently
pop'd up another Relick, to put him by his
diſpleaſing Diſcourſe. This Relick was that
they call the <hi>Holy Tear,</hi> which is ſo famous
in that Country. The Tradition they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have concerning it runs thus, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42118:61"/>
when our Saviour wept over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
gathered up his Tears, in a ſmall Cryſtal
Vial, and that having preſerved them a long
time, he gave them to S. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who
was then doing Penance, at a place which is
called <hi>la Sainte Baume,</hi> near to <hi>Marſeilles;</hi>
that in proceſs of time, this Relick was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it continued du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Reign of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour; and
being afterwards fallen, together with all the
Riches of that great City, into the hands of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour preſented it
to <hi>Godfrey</hi> Earl of <hi>Vandome,</hi> who depoſed it
in this Abby. It ſeems by this Tradition that
it took many turns, before it came thither,
and above all, that which I conſider is, that
it hath paſt through the hands of Infidels and
Enemies to the Name of Chriſt. But for
all this, the Roman Catholicks, and above all,
the Monks of that Abby, have not the leaſt
doubt or ſcruple concerning it; but beſtow
upon it the Worſhip of <hi>Latria,</hi> even the ſame
they give to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Upon any
extraordinary occaſion of great Drought, or
raging Sickneſs, they carry it ſolemnly through
the City, and that with greater Pomp than
they do their Holy Sacrament. Theſe Fathers,
who are Reformed <hi>Benedictins,</hi> told us, That
now for ſo many Hundred years, that is to
ſay, ſince the time of our Saviour, the ſaid
Tear had been preſerved ſo freſh, as a Tear
that actually drops from the Eye. We viewed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42118:62"/>
this Cryſtal very attentively holding it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Light, and afterwards took a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of it at the Light of a Wax-Taper, but
we could diſcover nothing of what they were
pleaſed to tell us. They have recourſe to this
Relick in all Maladies of the Eyes, and upon
this account, it brings a vaſt Income to theſe
Fathers. Surely People had need to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with a great Stock of Simplicity and
good Intention to adore things, which even
according to humane Tradition are ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and doubtful.</p>
            <p>We meet with a Story in the Life of S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
which makes it appear, that this good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
was not ſo generally in vogue in his
time, or at leaſt that the Biſhops did not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it, at the rate as thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
do at preſent. There was a Devotion
got up at ſome Leagues from <hi>Tours,</hi> towards
certain Relicks, which made a great Noiſe.
The People ran from all parts thither out of
Dovotion, and they pretended that great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were wrought upon the Place, and all
manner of Maladies healed. S. <hi>Martin</hi> (as
ſaith the Hiſtory of his Life, writ by <hi>Ribade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neira</hi>
the Jeſuit,) went himſelf thither by way
of Devotion; and being at the Place, he was
ſeized as it were with a ſecret Inſtinct, or
Divine Inſpiration, that the Bones which they
Worſhiped in that Place, were not the Bones
of Saints. S. <hi>Martin</hi> to be cleared in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
adjur'd the Bones to tell him, whoſe they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42118:62"/>
were; whereupon (adds the Story) was heard a
terrible Voice proceeding from the Shrine or
Caſe wherein the Bones lay; which ſaid, <hi>We
are ſo far from being the Bones of Saints, that we
are the Bones of two miſerable Criminals, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
and Robbers on the High-way, who were
executed at ſuch a time publickly for our Crimes;
and yet of a long time have we been here wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped
as if we had been Gods.</hi> S. <hi>Martin</hi> having
received this Information, immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Bones to be caſt out upon the
Lay-ſtall.</p>
            <p>Good, GOD! If all the falſe Relicks, which
at preſent are ador'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
had Voices, and could but ſpeak, as theſe did,
what ſtrange Stories ſhould we hear! Some
would ſay, We are the Bones of Heathens, or of
Malefactors; others, of Horſes, Aſſes, Dogs, &amp;c.
And yet I queſtion very much, whether after
all this, they would reſolve to quit them.
They would ſay, <hi>It's like that theſe Voices were
only the Illuſions and Artifices of the Devil, who
is envious at the Glory that is beſtowed on the
Saints; and that their Church being Infallible,
having propos'd theſe Relicks to Believers to be
worſhiped, She can neither err in matter of Right,
or in Matter of Fact.</hi> See here a true Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture
of the Spirit of that Church, as it is
at preſent; being ſo far changed, I will not ſay
from that of the Primitive times, but even
from that of the middle Ages, as nothing
more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42118:63"/>
But we are to take notice of a diſtinction
here, which is this, That if any Relick ſhould
chance to be introduc'd by any other way,
but that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and come to
the knowledge of the Popes, they would never
ſuffer it. Father <hi>Mabillon</hi> gives us an Inſtance
of it in his Voyage of <hi>Italy;</hi> for he tells us,
That ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> having Addreſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth, to obtain
Indulgences upon the account of a Saint called
S. <hi>Viar;</hi> the Pope being ſurpriz'd at the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
and ſingularity of the Name, would be
informed upon what good ground the Holineſs
of this Saint was founded, to whom ſuch
extraordinary Qualities were attributed in
ſome places: For confirmation of all, they
brought him an Inſcription containing theſe
Letters S. <hi>VIAR.</hi> But the Skilful and Learned
found, that the Inſcription was made for a
<hi>Praefectus Viarum;</hi> that is, a Perſon who had
the care and inſpection of the High-Ways
amongſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore the Pope
forbad them any more to expoſe this their
Saint; whereas indeed could they have made
out, that this Relick had been beſtowed upon
them by one of the Popes, his Predeceſſors,
the caſe would have been alter'd; and we
have all the reaſon in the World to believe,
that to maintain the Honour of the Holy See,
he would never have ſuppreſt it as he did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42118:63"/>
The <hi>Capucin</hi> whom I had ſeen at <hi>Rome,</hi>
that had got a Bone of S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> at
<hi>Foſſa Nova,</hi> had already broken it into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
little bits, which he had wrapt up in
pieces of Paper, with a deſign of diſtributing
them in his Journy, when he ſhould return to
his own Country. The <hi>Capucins,</hi> and others
who are called <hi>Mendicants,</hi> never carry any
Mony about them, and conſequently pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whereſoever they come; but being
look'd upon as men full fraught with Relicks
and <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> the Perſons who entertain
them, ask ſome of theſe to be beſtowed upon
them; or rather, they themſelves prevent
them, by giving them ſome of theſe Preſents
before they ſet any thing before them, as being
aſſured, that by this means they ſhall procure
better Treatment from their Hoſts.</p>
            <p>I have on a thouſand Occaſions, in the
Company of <hi>Capucins,</hi> ſeen them diſtribute a
thouſand Relicks; but amongſt the reſt, I
was once in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> in a Village called
S. <hi>Gothard,</hi> at the foot of a very high and
famous Mountain, which bears the Name of
it. I arrived there at Dinner time, and being
got into an Inn, I perceived two Fathers
<hi>Capucins,</hi> who were warming themſelves at a
great Fire, in the beſt Chamber of the Houſe,
whilſt their Dinner was making ready. The
deſire I had to meet with Company, made me
entreat my Hoſteſs to endeavour to perſuade
them, to let me Dine with them: They very
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42118:64"/>
obligingly conſented to my Requeſt; and I
ſaw that one of the Fathers took the Hoſteſs
aſide to a Corner of the Room, and gave her
a Paper very neatly folded up. I could not at
that time imagin what it might be; and ſoon
after Dinner was brought up. After we had
Dined, the <hi>Capucins</hi> call'd up their Hoſteſs,
and ask'd her what they had to pay? <hi>Truly</hi>
(ſaid the Woman) <hi>as for your part good Fathers,
your Reckoning is eaſily made; but for this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
here, there is a Crown to pay for his part.</hi>
I found my ſhare to be overreckon'd, and
that the Hoſteſs had a mind to make up the
Expence of her Charity towards theſe good
Fathers out of my Purſe. In the mean time
one of the <hi>Capucins</hi> told her very pleaſantly,
that they did not intend to quit her at ſo
Cheap a Rate, ſeeing they had beſtowed upon
her the moſt precious Piece in all their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury;
but that ſuch a Day, the next Week,
they were to paſs by that way again, and
that they hoped ſhe would well weigh and
conſider the great worth of the Preſent they
had beſtowed upon her: Which was as much
as to ſay, That they expected to be once more
plentifully Treated by her, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
ſhe would think of providing ſome good
thing for them againſt that Day. They began
afterwards, as if they had a mind to inſult
over me, for that it had coſt me ſo much,
tho' I far'd no better than they, and that as
for them a ſmall Devotional Preſent had dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42118:64"/>
ſatisfied their Hoſteſs, without paying any
thing. I demanded of them, what kind of
Preſent it was? They told me it was a Relick,
but would not ſpecifie it particularly. This
put me upon making a pretext to go down,
to know of the Hoſteſs what it might be.
As ſoon as I came down, I ſound her very
devoutly preſenting the Relick to her Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
in the Kitchin, for them to kiſs it. It
was a Tooth forſooth of an old <hi>Box-Comb;</hi> ſhe
ſhewed it me, with the Paper in which it was
wrapt, whereon was writ with great Letters,
<hi>A Holy Tooth of the Comb, wherewith S.</hi> Martha
<hi>Combed her Head at</hi> Marſeilles. I viewed it
very attentively, and as I was going to wipe
off with the end of my Handkerchief, ſome
filth that was upon it, that I might with the
leſs averſion kiſs it; not that I believ'd the
Relick, but to the end I might not give any
offence to others (for at that time I was a
good <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick) the Hoſteſs would not
let me, and in a kind of Paſſion told me, That
I was going about to take away the beſt part
of the Relick, which was the Sweat of
the Saint. I reſtor'd the gay Relick to my
Hoſteſs, and return'd to my <hi>Capucins.</hi> I told
them, I came from having taken a view of
the Holy Tooth of the Comb of S. <hi>Martha,</hi>
wherewith they had preſented the Woman of
the Houſe, as a Recompence for her Treating
of them. I eaſily perceiv'd, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
did not pleaſe them at all; for having
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42118:65"/>
entreated them to tell me, how they came to
light upon ſo precious a Treaſure; they An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
very fiercly, That it was not their
buſineſs to give me an account of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I alſo left them, without uſing much
Ceremony, in order to proſecute my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>Many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Roman Catholicks, cannot
endure to hear, that they beſtow their Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
upon things that are ſo very vile and
contemptible; but it is only by reaſon of their
Ignorance of what paſſeth in thoſe Countries
where Popery is rampant; for there may be
ſeen things yet far more ridiculous, ſuch as the
Lanthorn of <hi>Judas;</hi> the Dice wherewith the
Souldiers Caſt Lots, which of them ſhould
have Chriſt's Garment; a Shoe of St. <hi>Joſeph;</hi>
Hair, Paring of Nails, and all manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of their Saints and Sainteſſes. The
Treaſuries of their Churches are top fill'd with
theſe kind of precious Pelicks, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Travellers, may make themſelves very
merry in <hi>Italy,</hi> if they will give themſelves the
leiſure to go and ſee the Treaſures which are
kept in their Churches, and more eſpecially in
the Country, where the <hi>Cupucins,</hi> and other
<hi>Mendicants,</hi> take care to leave great ſtore of
them. At leaſt they may be ſure to find there,
thoſe Implements the Papiſts call <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi>
and almoſt in every Pariſh, one of S. <hi>Margarets</hi>
Girdles. Their <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s are pieces of white
Wax, upon which is imprinted the Figure of a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42118:65"/>
little Lamb, carrying a Croſs upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The Popes bleſs them in the Holy-Week
at <hi>Rome</hi> with abundance of Ceremony, in
memory of the words which S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>
ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God
which takes away the Sins of the World.</hi> They
believe therefore, conformably to this, that
theſe <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> do forgive Sins; at leaſt, thoſe
that are not very heinous ones indeed; and they
almoſt pay as great reſpect to them, as they do
to the Hoſt it ſelf: They carry them in Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
they kneel before them, they pray to them;
Secular perſons may not touch them with their
Fingers, they muſt be Prieſts, or Monks, or Nuns,
to whom the Biſhops give this permiſſion and
priviledge. The Nuns make it a great part of
their employment to make Encloſures of Silk
for them, very neatly wrought with a Needle
into all manner of Figures, and then they
beſtow them upon ſuch Seculars as Preſent
them higheſt, for the Sanctification of their
Souls. And beſides the Remiſſion of Sins, they
are over and above very good to preſerve a
Roman Catholick from all the evil Accidents
of this Life.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns the Girdle of <hi>S. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi>
we are to know, that according to the
Tradition of the Papiſts, a great Dragon
having offer'd to devour this Saint, ſhe whipt
off her Girdle, and having put it about his
Body, he immediately became as gentle as a
Lamb, and did her no hurt at all. The Prieſts
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42118:66"/>
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hereupon believ'd,
That this Girdle which had tam'd the Dragon,
which they pretend was the Devil himſelf,
might as well be of efficacy to tame Women,
or rather the Pains they endure in Child-Bed.
Wherefore almoſt all of them have pieces of
it in their Churches, and ſome of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have the whole Girdle. Inſomuch,
that if all the parts of it were joyn'd together,
they would without doubt make a Girdle that
would reach the length of the <hi>Strand,</hi> or of
<hi>Cheapſide</hi> in the City of <hi>London.</hi> They are the
Prieſts and Monks themſelves that carry it to
Women Great with Child: 'Tis they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
put it about their Bodies, repeating cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Supplications and Prayers; and whilſt they
are performing this Function, all the Company
muſt withdraw out of the Room. If the
Woman chance to be Delivered before the
Girdle comes, there's no hurt done, for her
Deliverance in this caſe is attributed to the
Vow ſhe has made to the Girdle; but if ſhe
happens to die, then it is, becauſe ſhe was too
backward and negligent in ſending for it;
and if it happens as ſometimes it does, that ſhe
dies between the Hands of the Prieſts, having
the Girdle actually about her; in this caſe the
Prieſts very devoutly ſneak away with their
Girdle, and lay it up again in their Chapel,
without ſaying any thing but this, that there
is no obviating the orders and courſe of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42118:66"/>
The Prieſts have brought things to that paſs
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that nothing can be
done without them; they muſt be preſent
every where with their Relicks, their Holy
Oils, and their Holy Water. Their Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Marriage-Bed, is a Ceremony
that deſerves our ſpeaking a word or two of
it. The Prieſts go in the Evening to Bleſs the
Bed of the Married Couple, before they Bed
together, in the ſame manner as God bleſſed
all Living Creatures, after their Creation, giving
them the virtue of <hi>Increaſing and Multiplying.</hi>
After that they have beſtowed their Holy
Water, they have good Wine preſented them
to drink, and they help to put the Bridegroom
and Bride to Bed. What think you, Sir; Are
not theſe very modeſt and becoming Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for Men that profeſs Chaſtity?</p>
            <p>I have made mention of all theſe Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
upon occaſion of that of the Eggs at
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> which ſome Ignorant Papiſts, and little
vers'd in their Ceremonies had denied; and
if any ſhould be found to deny any of theſe
here mentioned, we are ready to ſhew 'em
them in the <hi>Roman Ritual.</hi> I have alſo made
mention of ſome Relicks upon occaſion of
that of <hi>S. Thomas Aquinas,</hi> which the Monks of
<hi>Foſſa Nova</hi> pretend to have in their Abby.
I ſhall now continue my Journy towards <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racinne,</hi>
where I arrived very late; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thence again betimes in the Morning, I
had no leiſure to examine any thing there
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42118:67"/>
about Religious Matters. Only they gave me
a ſad Relation in my Inn, of a terrible Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
cauſed by a furious Tempeſt about five
Days before, all along the Sea-Coaſt from
<hi>Terracinne</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> in which 14 Ships had
been daſh'd againſt the Rocks, or Shipwreck'd
on the Sands in ſeveral places. I had heard
them ſpeak of it at <hi>Rome</hi> Three days before I
came away from thence, but was not then
inform'd of all the Particulars of it. The
only thing I took notice of in the Account
they gave me, ſuiting to my preſent Subject,
was, that amongſt the reſt there was one
Veſſel loſt, which had been but lately Bleſſed,
in order to make it Tempeſt-proof. They
told me alſo, That there was a Prieſt in that
ſame Veſſel, who was put into the Inquiſition
for having burnt his Crucifix, after that it had
happily been the Inſtrument of ſaving his life.
This Prieſt had a deſign of Travelling into
Foreign Countries, and had lighted upon a
very good Invention for to ſave his Life, in
caſe of Danger. He had cauſed to be made for
him a great Croſs of Wood, which was hollow
within, but joyn'd very light and cloſe on
all ſide, like unto thoſe the Penitents carry
upon their Shoulders in the Holy Week; and
differ'd only in this, that it had the Image of
our Saviour faſtned to it. This Croſs was thus
contriv'd by him, that it might be a proper
means for him, in caſe he ſhould be Caſt-away
at Sea, to eſcape upon it; and indeed, both
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42118:67"/>
the Shipwreck and his Eſcape, by means of the
Croſs, hapned according to the foreſight he
ſeem'd to have had of it. There aroſe a
violent Tempeſt, the firſt Night the Veſſel
put to Sea; ſo that after having been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
toſt and beaten by the Waves, it
ſprung a Leak, and let in Water on every
ſide. All thoſe that were in her, periſhed,
except only ſome Sea-men, and our Prieſt,
who after that he had made uſe of his great
Crucifix, to exhort thoſe who were ready to
be drowned, to die well, committed himſelf
to the Sea with it, and by this means was
driven by the Waves to the Shoar; being thus
eſcaped, he had courage enough to take his
Croſs out of the Water along with him; and
ſoon after met with the Sea-men, that had
ſav'd themſelves alſo, who had made a great
Fire on the Shoar to dry themſelves, and paſs
the reſt of the Night, into which the Prieſt
caſt his great Crucifix, and would not ſuffer
the Company to ſave it from burning; but the
poor Sea-men, who were not accuſtomed with
ſuch Sights, were ſtruck with Horror; they
ſeized the Prieſt, they manacled him, and
drag'd him the next Morning to the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and from ſo black a Crime, as this
Action of his ſeem'd to be, inferr'd, That he
was a Sorcerer, and had raiſed the Tempeſt.
Nevertheleſs, I was told, That he defended
himſelf very well; and that in all likelyhood
the Inquiſition would releaſe him, becauſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42118:68"/>
he pleaded, That what he had done, was in
conformity to the Practice of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> with reſpect to Holy things, that are in
danger of being profaned, which is to burn
them: In like manner he alledg'd, That not
knowing how to diſpoſe of his great Crucifix,
and being afraid leſt it might be profaned,
he had imitated the Cuſtom of the Church in
this Point.</p>
            <p>This puts me in mind of many ſad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
which daily happen to the Holy things
of Papiſts, and eſpecially to that which is the
chiefeſt Object of their Devotions, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Holy Hoſt, or their Sacrament. I take it for a
thing that is ſure and certain, that there are
very few days in a year, when in ſome part
of the World or other, they are not fain to
burn it, or to put it into a filthy ſtinking Hole,
to which notwithſtanding they give the fair
Title of a <hi>Sacrarium,</hi> or Sanctuary, which is
(as it were) the Dunghil, where they caſt forth
that which they believe to be the true Body
of Jeſus Chriſt, that the ſame may there return
to Corruption. I my ſelf have found, upon
two ſeveral Occaſions, the Hoſts which are
kept in the <hi>Ciboire,</hi> in very bad order: The firſt
was near <hi>Orvieto,</hi> in a Country Pariſh, where
the <hi>Ciboire</hi> being not cloſe ſhut, and the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
or Cupboard of the <hi>Sacrarium</hi> not being
cloſe joyned, the <hi>Piſmires</hi> had made bold to
viſit the Holy Sacrament, and finding the
Hoſts to their Tooth, had eaten ſome part of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42118:68"/>
them, and were dragging the reſt in little
pieces to their Ant-hills. I acquainted the
Curate (after I had ſaid Maſs) with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
who was much troubled at it; for it
was occaſion'd by his Negligence, who had
forgot to ſhut the <hi>Ciborium.</hi> He entreated me
more earneſtly, than he would have done God,
not to ſpeak a word of it to any Body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
if it ſhould come to the Ears of the
Grand Vicar of <hi>Orvietto,</hi> who was already his
Enemy, he would have been undone. We
therefore both of us endeavoured to remedy it
as well as poſſibly we could; and indeed the
Biſhop himſelf, had he been there, could have
done no more than we did. To prevent all
manner of Scandal, we ſtaid till all the People
were gone out of Church, and traced the
<hi>Piſmires</hi> to their Hole, which went under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground;
and purſuing it, we found it to lead
to a Coſſin, wherein there was a Body that
was half Rotten, which caſt forth a moſt
dreadful ſtink and infection. Foraſmuch
therefore, as it was impoſſible for us to ſearch
any further, we filled the Hole of the <hi>Ants</hi>
with Straw and Wood, and ſet fire to it, in
order to conſume the Hoſt, the <hi>Ants,</hi> and all
that was in it; and there is no doubt but this
ſucceeded according to our deſire. We met
with many of theſe little Animals, who being
laden with their Sacrilegious Prey, ran up and
down the Church, which we pick'd up, and
burnt them in a Chaſing-Diſh, as many as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42118:69"/>
we could meet with, and after that we had
well Swept the Church, we caſt all the Sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
into the Fire, and conſumed them. This
was indeed as much as could be done. But
alas! there were ſeveral other things, which
it was impoſſible for us to remedy; for ſeeing
that in all probability the <hi>Ants</hi> had been long
a labouring at the tranſporting of theſe Hoſts,
the Country People, who all this while came to
Maſs, had without doubt cruſhed many of them
with their Feet, and had carried away with them
pieces of the Hoſt, ſticking to the dirt of their
Shoes: Yea, we our ſelves, who had taken ſo
great pains to remedy this Miſchance, when
we viewed the Soles of our Shoes, found
ſeveral Particles ſticking to them. Now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrin of the Papiſts, the Body
of Jeſus Chriſt is whole and entire in the leaſt
Particle, as well as in the greateſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
we may imagin, how great this Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was.</p>
            <p>I have read ſomething of a Book Printed
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and made by a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> where treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Euchariſt, he takes upon him to
confound the Proteſtants, by the Examples
he alledgeth of Beaſts, who have paid their
Adorations to the Sacrament. Amongſt other
things we read there, That <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>Bees,</hi>
having by chance met with Conſecrated Hoſts,
which ſome Hereticks had thrown away in the
Fields, they had with a great deal of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
gathered them up, and carried them to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42118:69"/>
their Hills and Hives, and having divided
themſelves into Quires, they by turns chanted
muſically, and ſang forth the Praiſes of God,
until the Prieſts being drawn that way by their
melodious harmony, came and fetch'd away
their Hoſts. What Experiences of this kind
the good Father Jeſuit may have had, I know
not; but for the good Curate and my ſelf, I
am ſure we met with no Muſick.</p>
            <p>The ſecond place where I found the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
Hoſts much abuſed, was in a Little
Church near to <hi>Ancona,</hi> in a very moiſt place.
I found the <hi>Ciborium</hi> full of Wafers; thoſe
that lay uppermoſt ſtuck to one another, and
thoſe at the bottom were turn'd into a kind
of Glue or Jelly: And foraſmuch as it was
evident, that ſome of them were wholly ſpoiled,
and the reſt in a fair way to be ſo too, after
that Maſs was ended I caſt them all into the
<hi>Sacrarium,</hi> which is a Hole made in the Wall
expreſs for this purpoſe, and poured upon them
great quantity of Holy-Water, to make them
ſink to the bottom, and to cleanſe the Orifice
of the <hi>Sacrarium.</hi> This was at that time all
the Ceremony I uſed to bury that, which I
then believed to be the Body of our Lord.
Others have found the Hoſts full of Worms;
and in other places, the Rats have eat them up
whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Divines at</hi> Rome <hi>admit, for the moſt
part, as many Miracles in theſe kind of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
as they do in Tranſubſtantiation:</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42118:70"/>
For after the ſame manner <hi>(ſay they)</hi> as at the
Conſecration, the Subſtance of the Bread is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated
into that of the Body, and that the
Accidents of Bread and Wine are ſupported by the
Divine Power without a Subject; ſo in the next
moment to Corruption <hi>(ſay they)</hi> the Body and
Blood of Jeſus Chriſt ceaſe to be in the Hoſt, and
in the Chalice; and that God, by his Omnipotence,
creates in it another Subſtance, which becomes the
Subject of Corruption.</p>
            <p>I have been an Eye-witneſs of many other
conſiderable Accidents that have hapned to
their Holy Sacrament. It frequently comes to
paſs, that Prieſts (whilſt they are ſaying Maſs)
let ſome of the Conſecrated Wafers fall down
to the ground, and tread upon them without
thinking of it. Others ſpill the Conſecrated
Cup upon the Altar; ſo that the Precious Blood
of our Lord runs down on all ſides, and is
ſpilt upon the Ground, amongſt the Filth and
Spittings of the People. Sometimes Prieſts
have been taken with a Vomiting, immediately
after Communion. A Prieſt at <hi>Venice,</hi> as he
was lifting up the <hi>Calice,</hi> for the People to
worſhip it, ſpilt it all upon his Head and Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal
Habit, which was all ſtain'd with it.
Theſe are ſome of thoſe great Accidents that
happen to the Papiſts, with reſpect to their
Sacrament, and which put them to extream
trouble and concern for the remedying of
them. The beſt way they have, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is to wipe it
up with Tow and Linnen Cloths, which are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42118:70"/>
afterwards caſt into the Fire and burnt, to
waſh the Veſtments into which it is ſoaked in
ſeven ſeveral Waters, and to ſcrape the Stones
and the Wood upon which any of it is fallen;
there be ſome Prieſts, who out of Devotion
lick them firſt of all, clean with their Tongues.
True it is, that, according to the Faith of the
Papiſts, if it is the true Body and Blood of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they cannot be too
careful in endeavouring to gather up ſo great
a Treaſure; but in good earneſt, can any Man
believe, that it is conſiſtent with the Wiſdom
of God, to have plac'd the Body and Blood
of his Son, under thoſe accidents that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to a thouſand Caſualties and Profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and this after his having glorified it in
Heaven, and ſeated it at his right Hand? They
ſhew us a frightful thing in <hi>Germany,</hi> at a place
called <hi>Maladurne,</hi> which is a Corporal, or a
kind of Tablecloth of Arras, whereupon the
Hoſt and Calice are placed, when Maſs is
ſaid, upon which there is Imprinted the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
as it were of the body of a Tree, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Seven or Nine Branches; at the end
of each Bow, is a Head like to thoſe, they
make of our Saviour Crowned with Thorns,
upon the Napkin or Handkerchif of <hi>Veronica:</hi>
The whole is very ill Drawn, and all the
ſtroaks and Lineaments of the Heads are very
bungling, neither are all the Heads equally
great, or proportionable to one another. But
for all that, the Tradition is, that the Curate
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42118:71"/>
of that place, as he was one day Celebrating
Maſs, ſpilt the Conſecrated Calice, and that
the Bleſſed Blood of our Saviour falling upon
the Corporal, did Form all theſe Heads, which
therefore they pretend to be Miraculous. This
is one of the great <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> of the <hi>Germans,</hi>
and you ſhall ſcarce meet with any Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Country towards the Upper-<hi>Rhine,</hi>
who have not the Repreſentation of
this Miracle hanging in their Chambers, at
the bottom of which are theſe words,
<q>Christi Sanguis Maladurni in Corporale est.</q>
But we are not to believe that God works Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
without any Reaſon, or without ſome
Order, which may diſcover that ſuch Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
proceed from his Hands: But what do
we meet with in this Figure, that bears this
Character? Would God, think we, demonſtrate
to us, that the Blood of his Son Jeſus Chriſt is
really preſent in the Sacrament after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
by repreſenting an hideous Picture
to us of ſeveral Heads, that are extreamly ill
made, and are not like one another? Or
would he by this means intimate to us, that
Jeſus Chriſt is a Monſter, with many Heads?
This cannot be affirmed without the greateſt
Impiety. For my part, I am well aſſured,
that no reaſon can be excogitated, that can
either far or near give us to underſtand, the
deſign of this Figure. The Devil alſo is too
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42118:71"/>
cunning and ſubtil, to have had any hand in
it; for had it been his doing, he would rather
have made the Figure of ſome little pretty
Child, ſuch as was that, which they ſay ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in an Hoſt, in the time of S. <hi>Lewis,</hi>
King of <hi>France.</hi> It remains therefore, that
we attribute this Artifice, to the good Curate,
who Celebrated Maſs, and who was willing
at once, to draw the Devotion and the Mony
of People to his Church. A <hi>Jew</hi> being come
to vend ſome Commodities at <hi>Mentz,</hi> in the
Houſe where I was Boarded, having ſeen one
of theſe Images hanging in the Stove, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what it was? Whereupon I immediately o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the Garden Door, and left him, leaving
the Woman of the Houſe to anſwer him; for
as for my part, I knew not what to ſay to
him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> have not many Devotions in
their Country, but thoſe which they have are
very groſs ones; they dreſs their Saints of both
Sexes, in ſuch Antick Habits, that one cannot
forbear Laughing in ſeeing them. In moſt of
their Churches, they have Croſſes of a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
bigneſs, and they put upon the Head of
the Figure, that repreſents our Saviour, great
ugly Periwigs made of the groſſer part of
Hair, and great Beards of Hemp.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as I have made mention of the
Figure of <hi>Maladurne,</hi> I have a deſire to give
you here a deſcription of ſome parts of a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,</hi>
undertaken to this Image, where I
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42118:72"/>
was preſent my ſelf upon occaſion, four years
ago. I was Travelling from <hi>Mentz</hi> to <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
about ſome buſineſs; the moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
way to go thither is by Boat, which ſets
out from <hi>Mentz</hi> every Morning at ſeven a
Clock. By ill luck, or rather good luck, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this ſtop procured me very diverting
Company,) I came too late by half an hour,
and the ordinary Boat was already got out of
ſight; but I found another there in the Haven,
which was ready to ſet Sail, to go up the
<hi>Main</hi> to <hi>Francfort.</hi> This was a great long
Boat or Veſſel, which could contain two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Perſons, and it was well nigh fill'd with
Perſons of both Sexes, who went a <hi>Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
to <hi>Maladurne.</hi> As ſoon as I was entred
the Boat, they gave me a very good Place,
perceiving me to be a Clergy-man; only I was
obliged to be ſilent for the ſpace of near two
hours, becauſe I came juſt at the time of their
Meditation, which laſted an hour, and which
was followed by many Prayers, and <hi>Ora pro no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
which laſted another hour. Afterwards
the Father Director of the <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> who
was a Father <hi>Capucin,</hi> having rung a little Bell,
gave them leave to go to break their Faſt, and
ſilence together. Here it was that all our <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
Men and Women, began to rummage
their Bags for Proviſion; ſome produced Legs
and Shoulders of Mutton ready Roaſted, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Gammons of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and Pies, and a
hundred other cold Meats, ſuch as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42118:72"/>
upon ſuch an occaſion, not forgetting
their great Pitchers and Bottels of Wine, and
they ſtrenuouſly applied themſelves to Eating
and Drinking, after ſuch a manner, as was
able to procure an Appetite to the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and diſtaſted Spectators. Indeed there
were ſome amongſt them, upon whom it was not
good to caſt ones Eyes, becauſe their Viands
were ſo ſluttiſhly wrapt up, and they thumb'd
and devour'd it in ſo ſlovenly and beaſtly a
manner, that it was enough to turn ones Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
to ſee them. All the Meat that was in
the Boat, was not common to all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but they Eat in Troops or Knots, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as aforehand they had aſſociated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together, of what they had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, ſo that ſome of them fared
much better than others. However they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
a great deal of reſpect to the Father Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
of the <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> and his Companion,
by ſending them of the beſt they had upon
their Tables. The Father had the Civility to
invite me to come and Eat with him; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very well breakfaſted at my Lodging,
before I came away, I returned him my
Thanks, without accepting of his kindneſs.
Nevertheleſs, they were ſo importunate with
me on every ſide, that I was forced to drink
with them; for in <hi>Germany,</hi> they account it
a great Crime for a Man to refuſe a Health;
and on ſuch occaſions as theſe, Men are forc'd
to incommodate themſelves, how unwilling
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42118:73"/>
ſoever they may be. Their Breakfaſt laſted
much longer than their Meditation; however
at laſt they were fain to make an end of it,
at the Fathers Ringing of his Bell: After
which having impos'd Silence, as well as he
could, he began a kind of Sermon, wherein
he diſcourſed of the great and many Spiritual
advantages we receive by going on <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
and more eſpecially by that of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durne.</hi>
Above all, he inſiſted upon the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a long track of Miracles that had been
wrought in that place, and which were very
Divertizing. Sermon being ended, the
Father <hi>Capucin</hi> put all that were in the Boat
upon making a Confeſſion of their Faith, and
he began with his Companion, asking him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
Do you hold in Heart and Mouth, the
Catholick, Apoſtolick and Roman Faith? The
Brother anſwered, I do ſo by the Grace of
God: The Brother put the ſame queſtion to his
Neighbour, Do you hold with Heart and
Mouth the Faith? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he again made
the ſame Anſwer, and ſo the ſame Queſtion
and Anſwer run through the whole Boat from
one to the other, not excepting the Boat-men
themſelves. They told me that the reaſon of
their taking this Precaution was, to find whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were any Hereticks in the Boat, and
if they had found any, they would have forc'd
them to leave the Boat, becauſe they were apt
to mock at their Sacred Myſteries and Holy
Practices of <hi>Pilgrimaging.</hi> This Confeſſion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42118:73"/>
being ended, and all the Company having
been found good Catholicks, the Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Vows of a Troop of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi>
which were come from <hi>Hockum</hi> that Morning,
and joyn'd themſelves to the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the Boat. He made them all to kneel
before him, and made them ſay after him with
a lowd and audible Voice theſe words, <hi>I</hi> N.
<hi>do vow to go to the holy Relick of</hi> Maladurne, <hi>and
during the whole Journy, as well going as coming,
to be Obedient to the Reverend Father</hi> Blaſius, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
of the Pilgrimage.</hi> This done, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Blaſius,</hi> (for that was the <hi>Capucin's</hi> Name,)
gave them his Benediction, and embraced
them one after another, and afterwards ſent
them to embrace the reſt of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I took notice that the Father expreſt a
great deal of Civility to theſe laſt come <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,</hi>
and plac'd them near to himſelf, on his
Right Hand. Now it is t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be noted, that
<hi>Hockum,</hi> whence theſe Men came, is the place
where the very beſt Rheniſh Wine grows,
and whereof they had brought along with
them, a very plentiful Proviſion. Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with a great deal of reaſon were placed
at the Right, and the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> of <hi>Bacrack,</hi> who
had poſſeſt that Place till then, were fain to
paſs over to the Left. The Father having
Commanded the whole Company to kneel
down, pull'd out of his Sleeve a little Image
or Figure of the Miracle of <hi>Maladurne,</hi> and
having himſelf firſt Kiſſed all the Heads repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42118:74"/>
on it, he delivered it over from Hand
to Hand, that every one might do the ſame;
which done, he enjoyned the ſaying of ſeven
<hi>Paternoſters,</hi> in Honour to every one of the
Heads. Whilſt all theſe Ceremonies, Prayers
and Adorations were performing, the Boat
Arrived at <hi>Hochſt,</hi> which is a ſmall City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and where
they make an Hours halt to Eat their Dinners.
There be very good Inns in this Place, and
many ſtept out of the Boat, either to Dine
there, or to buy more Proviſions; but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part, remain'd in the Boat and Din'd
there. The Father <hi>Capucin</hi> was ſo very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
with me, that he oblig'd me to ſtay
with him. Theſe kind of Boats are ſo large
and long, that always at one end of them,
they have a very large Kitchin, where they
Boil and Roſte whatſoever the Company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
The Kitchin hapned to be very well
furniſht that day, and after that the <hi>Capucin</hi>
had craved a Bleſſing, we ſat down to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The heat and fumes of the Meat and
Pottage, had ſo extreamly heated the Boat,
that one could ſcarcely fetch ones Breath in
it, and cauſed a very unpleaſant ſcent, for theſe
Boats are all covered with Boards, like Houſes,
and they can let in no Air to them, but only
by the ſides, and by a Board on the top of the
Boat, which they can lift up, upon occaſion.
I repented that I had been perſuaded to ſtay
and Dine there, and that I had not ſtept out
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42118:74"/>
to take a little freſh Air, as others did. But
yet to countervail this Diſpleaſure, I took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to ſee the <hi>Germans</hi> Eat at the rate they
did; for notwithſtanding the good Breakfaſt
they had made, they Eat with that Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as if they had ſeen no Meat in three days.
God be praiſed, ſaid the <hi>Capucin,</hi> I ſee that
Devotion procures a good Stomack. He was
a Man of a very good humour, and who had
always a Jeſt at command to divert the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with; but nevertheleſs he did one thing
which did much diſpleaſe me, and was very
unbecoming the Gravity, which ought always
to be inſeparable from a long Beard, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
from one that is a Conductor and
Director of <hi>Pilgrims.</hi> Dinner being ended,
and the <hi>Capucin</hi> having given Thanks, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one hour of Recreation to the Company.
This Recreation conſiſts in ſpeaking and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all ſort of Fooleries, and above all in
drinking Healths, and eating reliſhing Bits,
and Incentives to Drink, as Gammons of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
dried Tongues, and other Salt-Meats.
The Father had for his part, a good Gammon
of <hi>Mentz</hi> before him; and having plac'd on
his right hand a great Bottle of Wine, which
the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> of <hi>Hockum</hi> had beſtowed upon
him, and another great Bottle of <hi>Bacrack</hi>
Wine on his left hand, he plac'd them both
on each ſide of his Gammon of Bacon, and
Laughing ſaid, with a loud Voice, ſo that all
the Company might hear him, theſe Latin
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42118:75"/>
words taken out of the XXth Chapter of
S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> moſt filthily profaning them:
<hi>Grant, that theſe two Bottles may ſit the one on
the Right hand, and the other on the Left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he got into the beſt Humor of the
World, and drunk to admiration. I deſired
him to tell me, why they were ſo cautelous
to prevent, that no Hereticks might lurk in the
Boats amongſt them: The Reaſon is, (ſaid he)
becauſe they mock us; yea, ſome of them are
not afraid to abuſe us very inſolently. Once
upon a time (proceeded he) five or ſix of
theſe wicked Men play'd us a very ill Trick;
they had mix'd themſelves amongſt the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,
to obſerve what we did. We diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
them at laſt, when after having worſhip'd
the Holy Image, I ſent it about for them to
kiſs. One of them took it in his hand, and
inſtead of kiſſing it, he with horrible Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
threw it into the Water, ſaying, That
<hi>that Image was more like the</hi> Hydra <hi>of</hi> Hercules,
<hi>or the Beaſt in the</hi> Revelations, <hi>than like Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> Our Pilgrims ſeeing this horrible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
ran to him with deſign to have pull'd
him to pieces; but four or five other wicked
Wretches, his Companions, drew their Swords
in his defence, and to make way for him to
eſcape; and the only way was left him, was
to leap over-board, which he did, and by
Swimming got to the other ſide of the River.
The Rage our Pilgrims were in, to ſee this
Wretch was got out of their hands, made
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42118:75"/>
them fall upon the reſt, and one of them had
his Arm run through. I had much ado to
appeaſe the Tumult; but at laſt I made them
call to mind the Obedience they had vow'd
to me; and they let the Hereticks go aſhoar,
after that they had ſoundly beaten them. By
ill-luck for our Pilgrims, all this had hapned in
the Juriſdiction of <hi>Francfort,</hi> whither we were
going, and where they are all Hereticks; and
theſe wicked Rogues had made haſte and got
there before us, and had made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to the Magiſtrates; who ſent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to ſtop or arreſt our Boat, and they
carried us all Priſoners to a great Tower,
where we were kept till the next day. We
expected all of us no leſs than to be made
Martyrs; but inſtead thereo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Magiſtrates
having taken more particular Information of
the Matter, the next Morning ſent to us in a
manner to excuſe themſelves, and to tell us,
That they wholly diſapproved the Action of
thoſe raſh and giddy Youths; and if we had
made our Complaints of them, without abuſing
them, they would have done us Juſtice: But
however, foraſmuch as there had been ſome
Blood ſpilt, we were condemned to pay the
Charges of the Juſtice, and an hundred Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to be diſtributed amongſt thoſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
that had been abus'd by them. The
Mony was ſoon found amongſt our Pilgrims,
for all did not amount to Half a Crown apiece.
The Receiver to whom we paid our Mony
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42118:76"/>
told us, in a very girding manner, that the
only cauſe of all theſe Quarrels was, becauſe
in our Pilgrimages we ſwallow'd down more
Rheniſh Wine, than Holy-Water. When
we were returned to our Boat, we found
almoſt all the Proviſions of Victuals that we
had left; only they had taken care to viſit our
Bottles and empty them, and fill'd them with
Water. After that again we had Embark'd
our ſelves, I call'd to mind the Holy Image of
<hi>Malaturne,</hi> which the Heretick had caſt into
the Water, and which we had quite forgot,
by reaſon of this Hurly-burly we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in. I was inſpired of God, to ſend ſome
of our Company in a little Boat to ſeek for it;
and they found it miraculouſly on the Shoar,
amongſt the Sedge. It is the very ſame I have
ſtill at this day, and which all of you have
worſhip'd this Morning. It was an Image of
Paper, faſtned with Starch to a Piece of Wood;
neither was it any great Miracle, that being
ſuch it did not ſink, or that it was ſtopt amongſt
the Sedge. But however, the good Father took
it as a great honour to him. He told us this
Story with a great deal of Pleaſantneſs, and
Laughing ſaid, <hi>We ſhall in the Evening ſee thoſe
Devils, that emptied our Bottles;</hi> he ſaid not, <hi>Who
have profan'd our Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt the Father was telling this Story,
they drunk Healths to him from all Quarters;
and he very frankly Pledged them all out of
his two Bottles. When the Hour-Glaſs, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42118:76"/>
was turn'd up for the Hour of Recreation
was run out, they inform'd the Father of it;
and he having rang his Bell, all the Company
ſhut up their Glaſſes and Bottles, and he took a
Book in his hand, to read a Spiritual Lecture,
which was to laſt one Hour; which was to be
followed with a Meditation of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
as in the Morning: After which, he
was to Preach an Hour, and then they were
to betake themſelves to their Afternoons Treat,
or Collation. The Father accordingly began
his Reading with a great deal of Vigor; but
he was not gon far, before that the Fumes
of the Wine having got into his Head, he
knew no more what he read, ſo that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
was fain to take the Book from him;
neither did he proceed much further in his
Reading: For finding that the Father Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
and moſt of the Pilgrims, were Nodding
and Snoring on every ſide of him, he very
fairly laid down his Book on the Table, and
leaning his Head upon it, fell aſleep for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Never in my life did I ſee ſuch an
Image of Devotion, as was then to be ſeen in
this Boat. Thoſe who could neither Sleep, nor
take Tobacco, ſet themſelves to Chat together,
and to tell Jeſts and Merry Tales, to make
Laughter. They could not Play at Cards,
becauſe all manner of Gaming had been forbid
them. I for my part, being no Pilgrim,
got upon the Deck of the Boat, to take a
little Air; where I found a Gentleman of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42118:77"/>
               <hi>Mentz,</hi> whom I was acquainted with, and
with whom I diſcourſed a good while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Pilgrimage. I told him, that I
was extreamly ſcandaliz'd to ſee ſo much
Brutality acted amongſt Chriſtians, and that
even in the midſt of thoſe Exerciſes, in which
they pretend moſt to Devotion. He told me, that
I had ſeen nothing as yet; that they had yet a
Day and an half to be on the Water, and to
lead the ſame manner of life as I had ſeen;
and that afterwards they were to Land at a
certain place, from whence they had almoſt
two days Journy through Woods to <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durne,</hi>
which all of them went on Foot; That
this was the moſt pleaſant and merry part of
all the Journy, for that they were us'd to go
and ſing amongſt the Rocks, where there were
moſt Raviſhing Eccho's; afterwards, they
would go further, to find ſome pleaſant place
or other, where all the Company might ſit
down upon the Graſs, whilſt the Father was
Preaching to them.</p>
            <p>After Sermon they continued their Journy
a little further, till they came to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
place, amongſt ſhady Trees, where
they refreſh'd themſelves with Eating and
Drinking. The Father Director made thoſe
that were the moſt able and ſtrong amongſt
them, to carry the Proviſions, beſides what
every one carried of their own. Here they
did eat all of them in Common, and an
equal and abundant diſtribution was made to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42118:77"/>
every one, both of Meat and Drink. The
greateſt trouble and inconvenience they have,
(ſaid he) is to carry thoſe, who after their
Meals are found Drunk; for theſe the Men
were obliged to carry by Turns on their
Shoulders, or to lead them under the Arms,
until they had a little digeſted their Wine.
If at any time it hapned, that the number of
thoſe that were Drunk, was too great for the
reſt to lead or carry them, then all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was oblig'd to make a Halt, till they were
come to themſelves again; for they are all
bound by Oath, not to leave any one of their
Company behind them, for fear of any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that might happen to them. The Father
<hi>Capucin</hi> ſhewed himſelf always very favourable
to this ſort of People, becauſe frequently he
had been one of the number, and had been
in his Turn carried upon their Shoulders.
When the Pilgrims were arrived at <hi>Maladurne,</hi>
the Father Confeſſed them, and Abſolved them
of all the Faults and Exceſſes they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
during their Journy, and gave them
the Communion with his own hands; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they went to Viſit the Holy Relick; and
having ſtaid there the remainder of the Day,
he led them back again by the ſame way
that they came, to the Boat, making them
repeat the ſame Exerciſes they uſed in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:42118:78"/>
I deſired this Gentleman to tell me, after
what manner theſe Pilgrims paſs'd the Nights.
I knew already, that as long as they went by
Water, they laid down in the Boat, and ſlept in
their Cloaths, every one in his place, in leaning
their Heads one upon another. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was in a manner the only thing that I
found to be very troubleſom in all their Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.
But I was very deſirous to know,
how they Lodg'd when they Travell'd by
Land, and whether they could meet with Beds
enough for all their Company, conſidering
their great Numbers? The Gentleman, at
this Queſtion of mine, fell a Laughing, and
told me, That he found that I was not over
well acquainted with the Cuſtom of <hi>Germany;</hi>
and that there were no Beds to be found,
except only in great Cities, and along the
Upper <hi>Rhine,</hi> where I had Travelled: But,
that in all other Parts, there were none to be
found; and that Travellers thought themſelves
very happy, when they could meet with freſh
Straw to lye upon. The way therefore of our
Pilgrims Lodging was after this manner: They
got into Barns, or the Peaſants Houſes, where
they procur'd for their Mony ſome Bundles of
Straw, which they ſpread upon the Floor, and
ſtretch'd themſelves along upon it, like Herrings,
Men and Women pel-mel together, of what
condition ſoever they may be, without having
any thing wherewith to cover themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:42118:78"/>
True it is, that I had already had ſome
experience hereof; for having once paſſed up
the <hi>Rhine</hi> from <hi>Collen</hi> to <hi>Mentz,</hi> with a Count
of the Empire, who had with him the
Counteſs his Wife, and two Sons; we were
fain to lye two Nights upon Straw, in
two pitiful Villages, without being able ſo
much as to procure a Bed for the Counteſs.
The Rats and Mice skipt over our Faces all
Night, and we had nothing to cover our ſelves
with, ſave only our Cloaks. However, I did
not conceive this to be ſo common in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
as this Gentleman inform'd me. We
were yet engaged in our Diſcourſe about our
Pilgrims, when we heard the noiſe of our
<hi>Capucins</hi> Bell; this made me go down into the
Boat, to ſee what they were going about next.
I found the <hi>Capucin</hi> a rubbing of his Eyes, and
demanding what of the Clock it was, and
how far we were got. They told him, that
he had Slept three Hours, and that they were
come near to <hi>Francfort.</hi> He teſtified his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that he had not been in a condition to put
them upon their Holy Exerciſes; but <hi>the Spirit
is ready,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and the Fleſh weak.</hi> Well,
there was now no remedy; and foraſmuch as
he perceiv'd that the Collation Hour was
come, he enjoyn'd all the Company to fetch
out their Bottles. The Pilgrims therefore fell
again as heartily to their Eating and Drinking,
as if they had neither Eaten nor Drunk all the
Journy. Indeed the thing I admir'd moſt,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42118:79"/>
was to ſee, how they could Eat and Drink at
the rate as they did; and yet this was not all,
for two Hours after they were to go to
Supper.</p>
            <p>They had ſcarcely begun their Collation,
when the Boat arrived at <hi>Francfort.</hi> I ſtept
out of the Boat in the Haven, after having
taken my leave of the Father, and all his Holy
Company, who were to ſtay there an Hour,
to take in ſome freſh Proviſions. If I had
not had ſome buſineſs at <hi>Francfort,</hi> which I
could not put off, I believe I ſhould have
been induc'd to Accompany theſe Pilgrims
to <hi>Maladurne,</hi> and by this means ſhould have
been in a condition, to have given you an
entire deſcription of this Pilgrimage, and of
the pleaſant Adventures, which ſeldom fail of
being coincident with them; but for want of
a favourable opportunity, I can give you no
more but this ſmall ſhred of it. I ſhall only
tell you, That this was the good Fathers Trade
all the Summer long. When the Pilgrims
had performed their Vows, he brought them
back again to the place where he had taken
them up, after having firſt given them a great
Benediction, and ſome Indulgences, which he
ſaid he had received of the Pope; and thus
having diſpatched them, he provided himſelf
again with others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:42118:79"/>
See here the good Fruit which the Miracle
of the ſpilling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt
has produc'd, which was wrought to confound
the Proteſtants, and to repleniſh the Children
of the Church with Heavenly Graces. I ſhall
not need trouble my ſelf in Moralizing this
Subject any further, as being that which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
its Moral along with it. I only beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of the Proteſtants, for the Shame I have
caus'd them in relating ſuch a Story; and the
Fault I have committed herein was the greater,
becauſe it had no great reference to my <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi>
Journy; neither indeed had I inſerted it,
but becauſe this Second Days Journy from
<hi>Veletre</hi> to <hi>Terracine</hi> prov'd very dry and barren,
and did not furniſh me with ſufficient Matter
to entertain my Reader. However, I cannot
but think, that ſuch like Matters of Fact may
in ſome ſort deſerve to be made Publick, and
I don't believe I ſhall have occaſion, to write
of them any more. And ſo I return to my
Journy.</p>

ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</head>
            <head>The Third Days Journy.</head>
            <p>UPon the Way from <hi>Terracinne</hi> to <hi>Fondi,</hi>
a moſt ſad Spectacle preſented it ſelf
to our Eyes: We ſaw about a Score
of <hi>Sbirries,</hi> who ſurrounding the Houſe of a
Peaſant, had block'd up all the Avenues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and whoſe Countenances ſhewed, that
they had met with a Prize. Having enquired
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42118:80"/>
what the matter was, they told us, That they
had ſeized a Nun, who had made her Eſcape
from a Convent, with the help of a young
Man, who had ſtollen her away. The deſire
we had of ſeeing her, made us ſtay there above
an Hour. At laſt, they brought her forth out of
the Houſe, with Irons on her Hands and Feet.
They ſet her upon a Horſe, to which they
bound her faſt with a great Chain, which
they had put round her Waſte. She did not
ſeem to be above Eighteen years of Age, and
was tolerably handſom. She made dreadful
Outcries and Lamentations, and the Deſpair
that had ſeiz'd her was ſo great, that ſhe beg'd
of all the Paſſengers, they would be ſo kind as
to kill her. She made ſeveral Attempts, to
throw her ſelf down from her Horſe, but all
in vain; for they had bound her ſo faſt, that
it was impoſſible for her. We were not above
Five Miles from <hi>Fondi,</hi> whither they were
carrying her, and we followed her all the
Way, at leſs than half a quarter of a Miles
diſtance. The Throng of People, that came
running in from all Parts to ſee her, was ſo
great, that we had much ado to enter the
Town, for fearing leſt ſome Inſurrection
might be caus'd by ſo Tumultuous an Aſſembly.
As ſoon as ſhe was entred, they ſhut the Gates,
and we were forc'd to ſtay without near five
Hours; after which, with a great deal ado,
we at laſt made a ſhift to get in. Every one
ſpoke ſo differently of the Matter, that it was
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42118:81"/>
very difficult for us to learn the preciſe Truth;
but the greateſt certainty we could gather
from their Relations were, That it was only a
ſimple Eſcape of a Nun, who did not like her
being coup'd up in a Convent. She was of
the Order of S. <hi>Francis;</hi> but they told us, That
about a Month ago, three Nuns of the Order
of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> had made their Eſcape with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſucceſs; for having taken their Way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea-Coaſt, they met with a <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Veſſel, that took them in. The Relation of
ſo ſtrange an Adventure touch'd me to the
Heart, and fill'd me with a juſt Indignation
againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for having ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſuch States of endleſs Reſtraints, and ſo
contrary to Natural Liberty, that thoſe who
have been ſo unhappy as to be engag'd in them,
are afterwards deſirous to quit themſelves
thereof, at the coſt of embracing a perpetual
Slavery amongſt a moſt Barbarous People, and
the greateſt Enemies of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>I had conceiv'd a deſign in the LETTERS
I have Publiſhed, to Treat of the Nuns of
<hi>Italy;</hi> but ſome Reaſons having oblig'd me,
to Publiſh them ſooner than I intended, I
had not the leiſure to reduce that Matter in
order, which yet is of importance enough,
not to be paſs'd over in Silence. Wherefore
I ſhall ſpeak of them here, by occaſion of this
Nun of <hi>Fondi,</hi> and ſhall make it the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of this Third Days Journy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:42118:81"/>
I do not pretend here to diſcourſe of the
Inſtitution of Nuns in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
It is known, that notwithſtanding the ſame
may be thought ancient enough, yet is indeed
but novel, and took its riſe at a time,
when many other Weeds of <hi>Superſtition</hi> began
to over-grow the Church. I ſhall only make
it my buſineſs, to repreſent the State of the
Nuns as it is at preſent. The Motives which
engage them to this kind of Life, their Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
or Employments in the Convents, and
their Intriegues abroad, together with the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
which this forc'd kind of Life doth from
time to time produce.</p>
            <p>We may aſſert in General, That all the
Monaſteries of the Females in <hi>Italy,</hi> are very
well Founded, that is, Endowed, except ſome
few, where the Nuns profeſs the Poverty of
S. <hi>Francis;</hi> as thoſe are, who are called the
Poor <hi>Clariſſes,</hi> and ſome others. Beſides theſe
great Foundations, they have alſo a Caſual
Revenue, which amounts to no leſs than their
yearly Incoms: For all of them take in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
and there is never a Religious Houſe,
that hath not at the leaſt Threeſcore or Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
of them, who all pay great Penſions.
The <hi>Italians</hi> put out their Daughters to Board
in Convents, in like manner as we put them
here to Boarding-Schools, to learn all ſorts of
Work becoming Gentlewomen. There are in
every Convent ſome Nuns deputed to take the
care of theſe Boarders, and Teach them.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42118:82"/>
All their Works belong to the <hi>Nuns,</hi> who Sell
them, driving a conſiderable Trade by this
means to their great Profit. The <hi>Italians</hi> ſend
their Young Daughters at the Age of five or
ſix Years into the Monaſteries, and of this
great Number, ſome are to return again to
their Parents, after a certain time, and the
reſt make themſelves, or are forced to become
<hi>Nuns;</hi> ſo that theſe Schools are the fruitful
Nurſeries, whence the Monaſteries are People<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and receive their Complement, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they would ſoon become Deſerts,
there being few <hi>Italian</hi> Families, who have
ſeen a little of the World, and are come to
the Age of Diſcretion and Knowledge, that
are willing freely to Impriſon themſelves there,
notwithſtanding they be kept in a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Slavery in their own Houſes.</p>
            <p>The Parents of theſe little Boarders, know
ſo well how to command the Spirits of the
<hi>Nuns</hi> that Govern them, that by this means
they do what they pleaſe; and to diſcover the
Secret in one word, it is by Preſents. If they
have a deſire that their Daughter ſhould be a
<hi>Nun,</hi> theſe Governants and Miſtreſſes forget
nothing of what they think may incline them
to it. They will talk to them a thouſand times
a day, of the advantages of a Religious Life,
which may be reduced according to them, to
the following Heads:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42118:82"/>
In the Firſt place, they will tell them, that
a <hi>Nuns</hi> Habit, becomes them extreamly well,
and that the Vail makes them look as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
again, as the common ſecular Dreſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they ſhall be always ſure
to Eat and Drink of the beſt, and that they
ſhall never want any thing conducive to a
pleaſant recreative Life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That they ſhall live in great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and that after two or three years, they
ſhall have the reſpect of being called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That they ſhall always have the
freedom to ſee and ſpeak with their Kinsfolks
and Friends at the Grate; yea, to Treat them
with good Dinners, and ſplendid Collations
in the Parlour, with the Mony that ſhall be
allowed them for their Boarding.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That afterwards they ſhall be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
and raiſed to Religious Charges and
Employments, one of them ſhall be Miſtreſs
of the Novices, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ther the Governeſs of the
Boarders, others again Sacriſtans, Overſeers
of the Proviſions, Prioreſſes; yea, that all of
them in their Turns, may become Lady Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſes.</p>
            <p>And in the Sixth and Laſt place, They do
not fail to add to all the reſt, that they ſhall
be ſure of Eternal Life. To this purpoſe a
<hi>Nun</hi> of <hi>Vicenza</hi> told me very pleaſantly, that
they Preached only ſix Beatitudes to them,
and that they always wanted two to make
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42118:83"/>
them perfectly happy, <hi>viz.</hi> Liberty and a
Husband.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there be many other leſſer
Reaſons, which may engage Young Girls to
make themſelves <hi>Nuns.</hi> Some enter upon this
kind of Life, becauſe they have ſome of their
Kindred that are <hi>Nuns;</hi> they have an Aunt
or a Couſin in the Monaſtery, or ſome She
Friend of theirs. Others engage themſelves
in this Profeſſion, becauſe they know that they
cannot make ſo fair a Figure in the World,
as they fain would; others again, becauſe
they find the Monaſtery, the Gardens, and
Chamber allotted them, to their liking; and
ſome alſo, becauſe they are at liberty to Jeſt
and play the Fool, as much as they pleaſe. In
a word, a hundred other Motives of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
do not fail to give the firſt ſtart to the
Vocation of theſe Girls. But the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
of them all, and thoſe whom I truly
pity, are thoſe, who not ſuffering themſelves
to be cajoll'd by theſe petty Amuſements,
have their Thoughts fixed upon the loſs of their
Liberty, upon the great Temptations they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves to, and who, beſides all this,
have a natural Antipathy againſt all theſe kind
of Maxims, and who openly proteſt, they
can never reſolve to embrace a Monaſtick
Life; and yet for all this, will they nill they,
muſt do it; their Parents, from a Family-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
will have it ſo; theſe Cruel and Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Monſters preſs them to it; and if this proves
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42118:83"/>
Ineffectual, they proceed to Outrageouſneſs
and Blows; yea, even to threats of killing
them with their own Hands, if they do not
pronounce the impious and Sacrilegious Vows;
for ſo I call thoſe Vows which are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ones Will, and where the Will doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accord with the outward act, nor with
the Tongue that utters them.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to relate to you the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
that is performed ſome days before
theſe Young Virgins take upon them the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Habit. They allow them a Week to
go and take their leaves of their Kindred and
Friends, and they Attire them in the Richeſt
Clothes that can be had, and which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Embroidered with Pearls and Precious
Stones, that have been borrowed up and down:
They put a rich Crown upon their Heads,
and a Scepter in their Hands, as it were to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
thereby, that they are entring upon a
State of Life preferable to that of Queens, and
in this Pomp they are led in a Coach through
the City, and carried to all their Kindred,
where they never fail of being Sumptuouſly
Entertained. There are no Young Women,
who ſeeing them paſs by, with all this Pomp
and Magnificence, do not wiſh themſelves to
be in the ſame Condition. But the Miſchief
of it is, the Feſtival doth not laſt always, and
the day of their putting on the Habit comes,
in which theſe Young Ladies are carried in
Triumph to the Convent; as ſo many Victims
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42118:84"/>
they are going to offer up to the Avarice of
their Parents, to the Intereſts of their Family,
or to ſome other Predominant Paſſion; for as
for the Glory of God, that is not a thing that
comes in competition in <hi>Italy,</hi> on theſe ſort of
Occaſions. The moſt part of <hi>Nuns</hi> will tell
you, two or three years after their Profeſſion,
that they have been impos'd upon, or that
they have deceived themſelves, and that the
Motives which have enclin'd them to embrace
this kind of Life, were ſome little fooliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
or Trifles, the deſire whereof has quite
left them. But poor unhappy they, there is
no Remedy left for them.</p>
            <p>The Ceremonies of their taking the Habit
are very Magnificent, and no leſs Ridiculous.
The Abbeſs of the Convent will needs appear
at this Solemnity, in her Pontifical Habit,
and Acts the Farce of <hi>Pope-Joan,</hi> with her
Croſier-Staff in her Hand, and her Miter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Head: The ſignings with the Croſs,
and the aſperſions of Holy-water are never
wanting in abundance. But after a great
many Preliminaries, they come to the point
in Hand, which is to uncaſe theſe Maidens of
their Secular Habits, and to put upon them
thoſe of the Religion. And all this while they
have gayety enough in their Looks; but when
they come to cut off their Hair, then it is
that the moſt of them can hold no longer,
but burſt forth into Tears; which probably
proceeds from ſome remainder of Love, they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42118:84"/>
ſtill have for that, which they have taken ſo
much pains to Cultivate and Adorn, and that
which makes the faireſt Ornament of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Ladies, who cannot endure any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Heads, but their own Hair, which
they frizle, curle and bind up in different
manners, enterlacing them with Flowers ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Artificial or Natural. It may be alſo,
becauſe at that time, they have a more Lively
Senſe of the loſs of their Liberty, they are
then entring upon. For tho' they are allow'd
one or two years of Novitiate, before they
make Profeſſion, or engage themſelves by a
Solemn Vow, yet they never afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to do it. The <hi>Italians</hi> have reduc'd a
<hi>Nuns</hi> leaving her Monaſtery, to that pitch of
Diſhonour and Infamy, that a Maid who had
been Whipt by the publick Executioner, in
the moſt publick places of the City, or who
had been Stigmatized and ſtood under the
Gallows, might appear with leſs ſhame in
Company, than a Religious, who ſhould leave
the Monaſtery after ſhe has taken the Habit.
So that after once they have made the firſt
ſtep, they are in a fair way, or rather in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity of making the other alſo.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as the buſineſs here lies ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in quitting the World, than the Spirit of
it; the <hi>Nuns</hi> are very cautelous, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any <hi>Nun</hi> amongſt them, without being
aſſured of a Penſion for them from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
of at leaſt 100 Crowns a year, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42118:85"/>
ſerves purely and ſimply to buy her things ſhe
has a mind to, and which may give her ſome
ſatisfaction and palliate her Reſtraint. I knew
a <hi>Nun</hi> of the Monaſtery of S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>
in <hi>Bononia,</hi> whom her Parents allowed a
Piſtol every day; with this Mony they buy
the Materials they ſtand in need of for their
Works, which afterwards they preſent to
ſome of their Friends, or elſe Sell them for
Mony. They are alſo obliged with the ſaid
Mony to perform the Offices of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Order, by turns, at their own Charges.
She who is the Sacriſtan, muſt during her
year of Officiating, provide the Wine that
is uſed at Maſſes, and the Wax that is Burnt
upon the Altar. The Overſeer of the Mouth
Proviſions muſt Treat the <hi>Nuns</hi> at her own
Charges, at the Principal Feſtivals of the year,
with all manner of Curioſities and Dainties.
They are oblig'd alſo every one in their turn,
to furniſh a Maſs for their Preacher, and their
Confeſſor; and herein it is, they endeavour
to outvie one another, which is the reaſon
why theſe Fathers lead ſuch Delicious Lives,
and are ſo indulgent in Pardoning of their
Sins, to whom they are beholding for ſo many
good Bits. Beſides all this, they have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Treating their Relations and Friends,
who come to Viſit them at the Grates, and of
giving them Collations in the outward Parlour.
In a word, I am ſure, that if their Penſions
were Ten times more than they are, they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42118:85"/>
would not be to ſeek for Means to ſpend them.
This neceſſity of having ſo much Mony, at
one daſh, excludes all poor Maidens, and
thoſe of midling Condition from all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Houſes, and their Parents find it more for
their Intereſt to Marry them, except they
have a mind to make Convert Siſters of them,
(that is, Servants to the other Nuns,) or poor
<hi>Clariſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Convents of Nuns are no otherwiſe
lookt upon at preſent, than as a convenient
means of diſcharging Families of ſupernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Encumbrances. The <hi>Italians</hi> commonly
Marry no more than one or two of their
Children, and ſo all the reſt are forced to
become Prieſts or Monks, if they be Boys, or
Nuns, if they be Girls. However it muſt
coſt them a Penſion, for without it, they will
never be received. The Call of God to any
of theſe States, is no longer owned, except
they bring along with them a good Purſe to
atteſt it. Is it not a thing to be Lamented,
to ſee the Papiſts have the impudence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Proteſtants, that they have Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
aboliſhed theſe Sacred Retreats, where
the Virgins have their Liberty, <hi>to follow the
Lamb whitherſoever he goes?</hi> Is it not evident
as the Sun at Noon-day, that before they will
open their Gates to them, the Enquiry is not
whether they have <hi>Oil in their Lamps,</hi> but
whether they have <hi>Mony in their Purſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:42118:86"/>
Let us now take a view, how thoſe who
have the happineſs to be Admitted, do employ
their time there. I confeſs, I ſpeak ſomewhat
improperly, for no Body is permitted to go and
take a view of them; but however, we may
make a gueſs of it by the Works that come from
them; the moſt Curious Laces and Points, the
moſt rich and ſumptuous Embroideries, and the
moſt exquiſit Handy-works, Artificial Flowers,
Pretty Knacks and Curioſities, with a thouſand
other Toys, are the moſt ſerious Occupations
of theſe Holy Recluſes; ſo that indeed, tho'
they be retir'd from the World themſelves,
they are wholly buſied to glut and ſatisfie the
Vanity of it in others. But the Maſter-piece
wherein they excel, is their Skill in preparing
all Dainties and Enticements of the Palat, to
preſerve Fruits, to make Sweet-Meats, dry and
liquid, all ſorts of Paſtry-Works, and White-Meats;
all which ſhews them to have very
dainty and licoriſh Palats. All this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
in <hi>Italian</hi> under the Words of <hi>Roba Dolce,</hi>
or <hi>Roba di Monache: If any would have
them to make a Piece of Paſtry, or to Dreſs any
other dainty Diſh, they muſt ſend them as much
more of the Ingredients, as can enter the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
for it is known, they will be ſure to take the
one half for themſelves; and beſides, they muſt pay
Dearer for the Faſhion, than it would coſt them at
the Cooks: But withal it muſt be confeſt, that they
get for their Mony ſomething that is far more
neatly done, and delicious, than if the Cooks had had
the handling of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42118:86"/>
If they ſeem Covetous on one hand, on
other Occaſions again you'l find them as Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Profuſe; yea, one may ſay of them,
That they do not addict themſelves to Avarice,
but that they may be in a better condition to
exerciſe their Liberality. When any Feſtivals are
celebrated in their Churches, all the Prieſts
and Monks that Officiate in Saying Maſs, are
ſure to be diſmiſt with their Handkerchiefs fill'd
with Biskets and dried Sweet-Meats; and they
who perform the Evening-Service, are afterwards
conducted to the Parlour, where they have
a Collation preſented them, of all manner of
exquiſit Dainties and excellent Wines. I once
hapned at <hi>Milan</hi> to be preſent at one of theſe
Collations of the Nuns of the Monaſtery <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giore.</hi>
All the Cruſt of their Paſtry-Work
were made of Almonds, Pine-kernels, and
Piſtaches, which had been beaten or ground
into Flower. An Old Prieſt ſeeing this Exceſs,
could not hinder himſelf from ſaying, <hi>O, Dio,
Come potiamo mangiar queſto ſenza Peccato!
Good, GOD, Is't poſſible to eat this without Sin!</hi>
But a young Nun anſwered him, <hi>Si, ſi Signor,
è coſa buena per i vecchi: Ay, ay Sir, It is a good
thing for Old Men.</hi> They are more ready at
their Jeſts and Drollery, than thoſe who are
moſt Converſant in the World. Yea, what is
more, there reigns in their Cloiſters a Spirit
of <hi>Impudence, Effrontery,</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> beyond
what is found elſewhere; which proceeds, as
I believe, from the ſecret Rage they have
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42118:87"/>
conceiv'd, for having loſt their Liberty. They
abandon themſelves, as far as they are able,
to all manner of Luxury; and were it not that
Modeſty well becomes a Writer in this kind
of Matters, I could relate Facts to you that
would make your Hairs ſtand on end. In
order to remove all occaſions of ſuch Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops have taken care to
double their Grates, which were only ſingle
before, as they are ſtill to this day in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Germany.</hi> The firſt Grate is about a Foot
diſtant from the ſecond Grate; and the Bars
are ſo cloſe ſet together, that one cannot
thruſt in his Fiſt. Moreover, they have moſt
expreſly forbid all manner of Perſons, as well
Eccleſiaſtical, as Civil, (except it be Kindred
to the Second Degree) to go to ſee them, or
ſpeak with them, without an expreſs Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſet down in Writing, and Signed with
their own Hands, or of the Vicar General,
deputed over the Monaſteries, upon pain of
being Proſecuted in the Eccleſiaſtical Court,
and condemn'd either to Priſon, or to pay
great Fines.</p>
            <p>In a word, it may be truly ſaid, That they
have taken more Precautions, to hinder all
Men from Viſiting them, than if they were
ſtruck with the Plague. But yet all theſe rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Prohibitions, do not hinder their Parlours
from being always well fill'd with Company;
and the <hi>Sbirries,</hi> who have Orders to make a
ſearch in the Parlours, and at the Grates of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42118:87"/>
Convents, dare not ſo much as come near
them; for all theſe Nuns commonly have very
powerful Relations and Friends, who would
take care to get their Legs and Arms broke
for them, ſhould they ever offer to attempt
the leaſt thing that might diſpleaſe them. To
ſpeak the Truth, theſe Prohibitions ſerve only
to enflame the <hi>Italians</hi> the more, to go and
Viſit them, if it were for no other thing, but
becauſe it is a thing forbid. <hi>Omnis Praevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
dulcis: Every Sin is ſweet.</hi> Yea, what is
yet more aſtoniſhing, is, That the Biſhops for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
all Prieſts upon pain of Suſpenſion and
Impriſonment, to celebrate Maſs in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of Nuns, without having an expreſs
Permiſſion for ſo doing; by which they ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
give to underſtand, the ill Opinion
they have conceiv'd of their Nuns.</p>
            <p>I have found amongſt my Papers one of
thoſe Licenſes, which I got at <hi>Venice,</hi> in order
to ſay Maſs in two Churches of Nuns, which
are therein ſpecified. The Contents of this

                  <p>TO Our Beloved in Chriſt, the Reverend
. . . . Greeting in our Lord. Having
ſeen the Teſtimonies and Atteſtations in Writing
of thy good Life, of thy good Manners and good
Reputation; We by theſe Preſent grant unto thee
the Permiſſion, that thou maiſt (during the time of
Three Months) celebrate Maſs, in the Outward
Church of the Nuns of the Monaſtery of our Lady
of <hi>Pity,</hi> and in that of our Lady of <hi>Miracles.</hi>
Provided notwithſtanding, that you repair thither,
being modeſtly dreſt; That thou make no ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
either in thy Cloathing or Perſon, of any Vanity or
Laſciviouſneſs; That thou wear thy Clerical
Crown or Tonſure, as does become a Prieſt; That
thou do not ſpeak to any Nun; and when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
be it only with the Converſe, or Siſters
Converſers, appointed for the Service of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42118:89"/>
Church; and this neither, ſave only it be
about things neceſſary, and that reſpect the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Holy Maſs, and this in few words.
That thou have nothing to do with any Nun; or
others (that is to ſay, the Boarders or Penſioners)
by Letters, by Preſents, or any other way. And
that moreover, in all other things, thou do obſerve
all the Patriarchal and Synodal Orders and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.
Otherwiſe we declare theſe Preſents to
be void, and that by this Nullity thou ſhalt incur
the Penalty of Suſpenſion <hi>à Divinis ipſo facto,</hi> and
ſhalt moreover be puniſhed by other arbitrary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>

            <p>We may eaſily perceive from all this, the
high Opinion the Paſtors of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> have of the Virtue of their Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſes;
and without queſtion they have reaſon
for their taking all theſe meaſures about them.
The Prieſts are forbid to ſpeak with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Experience hath taught, that in their
Diſcourſe they did only Cajole and Court them.
They are forbid to make them any Preſents,
becauſe they are well aſſured, that the Prieſts
never give any thing for nought. And in the
third place, they forbid them having any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with them in any other manner; I leave
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42118:89"/>
it to you to conjecture what the meaning of
that may be.</p>
            <p>The Prieſts, for their parts, do not much
concern themſelves with all theſe Threats.
They ſay, That Suſpenſion <hi>Ipſo facto</hi> ſignifies
nothing, except it be publickly declared by a
Sentence; and they know well enough, that
their Colleagues will never proceed to ſuch an
Extremity againſt them; foraſmuch as in their
time, they have been as guilty of the ſame
Tranſgreſſion, as themſelves. Some will have
it, That the Puniſhment of Suſpenſion with
the reſt expreſt in the Licence, cannot light
upon any, but ſuch who are guilty of all
the Particulars there prohibited, that is, who
Diſcourſe with, ſend Preſents, write to them,
and have commerce with them; but that they
who diſcourſe, or have commerce with them,
without Writing, are not of that number.
In a word, The moſt Clear-ſighted perceive,
that theſe Prohibitions are only made to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Honour of the Superiors, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
might be accuſed by the Seculars, for
conniving at all theſe Diſorders, which daily
happen in theſe Matters, and which, according
to a Jeſuitical Interpretation, are ſufficient to
quiet their Conſciences. They ſay, That the
Biſhops after all, never had the intention of
Suſpending them. Thus notwithſtanding they
Court the Nuns, yet they continue to ſay Maſs,
and to perform all the Sacerdotal Functions,
without feeliny the leaſt ſcruple in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:42118:90"/>
The <hi>Italians</hi> do not always pay their Viſits
to the Nuns for the Love they bear them, but
more frequently to conſult with them, and
concert the means of accompliſhing ſome
great deſign, or to manage ſome Intriegue
abroad. The Nuns commonly have the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of a Deviliſh Spirit, and it is matter
of aſtoniſhment to ſee, how young Women
ſhut up in Cloyſters, as in a Priſon, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
able to act at a great diſtance
with ſo much power and efficacy. Is a Man
engaged in an unjuſt Trial, or does he ſtand in
need of the Favour of ſome Great Perſon; the
beſt means for him to ſucceed, next to the
Jeſuits, is to addreſs himſelf to the Nuns. Has
a Man a mind to <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mpaſs ſome Amorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
if you can but once get them to embark
in it, you may be in a manner ſure of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.
I ſhall to this purpoſe relate to you,
the ſubtil Intriegue of a Nun of <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A certain Count courted a young Lady,
whom he was extreamly pleas'd with; but he
had no means of ſeeing her, ſave only at
Church, when ſhe went on Sundays to Maſs,
or ſometimes in paſſing by her Window, after
the <hi>Italian</hi> manner. He had taken notice of
the young Ladies Smiling on him, and from
thence concluded, that without doubt ſhe
would prove favourable to his Wiſhes: So that
nothing remained now, but the finding out a
way for a free and ſecret Interview, wherein
the Count found an inſuperable difficulty;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42118:90"/>
for her Mother, who was a Woman of Honour,
was ſo true a Sentinel to her Daughter, that
ſhe was inſeparable from her, and never ſtirr'd
out of Doors without taking her along with
her. This was a buſineſs indeed, that requir'd
the Intriegue of a Nun to compaſs it. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth
himſelf to an Ancient Mother of the
Monaſtery <hi>Magiore,</hi> to whom he promis'd 20
Crowns, in caſe ſhe could make him obtain his
deſire: The Old Nun undertakes it. To this
effect ſhe writes a Letter to the Lady, wherein
ſhe deſires her to come and ſpeak with her, for
that ſhe had ſome ſecret and charitable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to give her concerning the Carriage of
her Daughter, and ſignifies the Hour, which
would be moſt proper for her to come. The
Mother being very impatient to know what
the matter might be, did not fail of going to
her, leaving her Daughter at Home. When
ſhe was come, the Nun told her, That ſhe had
ſent for her, to put her in mind to double her
Care in obſerving her Daughter; that it was
taken notice of, that a Count was paſſionately
enamour'd of her; and that her Daughter
anſwer'd him with Caſts of her Eye. She made
a ſhift, with her long Diſcourſe, to ſtay this
good Woman near two Hours in the Parlour;
and all this while the Count, who had received
all neceſſary Inſtructions, was with the young
Gentlewoman. The Mother return'd to her
Houſe, with a Reſolution to make good uſe of
the Advice the Nun had given her; but the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42118:91"/>
more aſſiduous her Precautions were, the more
reaſon ſhe found to be aſtoniſh'd, after ſome
Months at her Daughters, being big with
Child. She urged her to that degree, that ſhe
oblig'd her to declare how the thing had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But what could the Mother do? It
would have been in vain for her to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to trouble the Nun upon this account,
becauſe in ſo doing, beſides the loſs of her
Daughters Honour, ſhe might very well have
loſt her own Life into the bargain; for the
Nuns are no leſs able and expert in bringing
about their Revenge, than in managing a
Love intriegue. The moſt part of the violent
Deaths that hapen in <hi>Italy,</hi> are carried on by
their means, and therefore it is that I have
ſaid, that they have a deviliſh Spirit. Thoſe
that have any Enemies in <hi>Italy,</hi> are very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of drinking any Liquors of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,
or of their Sweet-Meats, or Paſtry-Work.
There are too many funeſt Examples
to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>There is to be ſeen in the Mad-houſe at
<hi>Milan</hi> a poor Gentleman, whom they make
to paſs for a Fool or Madman, tho' indeed
he be not ſo. The thing was brought about
by the Stratagem of a Nun, the account was
given me of it, is as follows. This Gentleman
had a younger Brother, who was deſirous to
make himſelf Maſter of his Eſtate; in order
whereunto he took occaſion to get his Brother
go along with him to Viſit the Nuns, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42118:91"/>
a Collation upon them, and the Elder
Brother having drunk a Doſe, fell down to
the Ground, as if he had been quite Dead.
However the Poiſon it ſeems had not been
ſo well prepared, but that he came to himſelf
again. The Nuns in the mean time being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
concern'd that their deſign had not
ſucceeded, Publiſhed that he was a Fool, and
that they had ſeen him carry himſelf like a
Changeling in the Parlour: Whereupon his
Brother cauſed him to be Seized, and to be
carried to the Mad-houſe. It is a place from
whence no Body is ever ſuffer'd to come forth,
and where all the actions and words of thoſe,
whom they have once thruſt in there, be they
never ſo rational and compos'd, are interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and wreſted to Folly. It was to ſpecial
purpoſe for him to ſay there that the Nuns had
Poiſoned him, when they made that a ſtrong
argument to prove him a Fool, for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch thoughts of them. And by this
means his younger Brother is at preſent ſtill
in full Poſſeſſion of his Eſtate. This was the
account they gave me of this Story.</p>
            <p>That which makes the Nuns ſo bold and
daring in theſe ſort of Enterpriſes, is, becauſe
the Civil Magiſtrate cannot take cogniſance of
any thing they do, and their Superiors that
Govern them, receive too many good Treats
from them, ever to uſe them roughly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the moſt Rigorous Sentence that can be
Pronounced againſt them, is to Condemn
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42118:92"/>
them to be ſhut up in the inmoſt part of their
Monaſtery, and to Faſt ſo many days a Week,
with Bread and Water. They themſelves do
execute the Sentence, for no Body hath the
power to enter into their Convents to force
them to it; ſo that we muſt not imagine them
to be ſuch Fools, as to be overcruel to one
another. And if an Abbeſs or Superiour,
ſhould attempt to have the Sentence executed
according to the Rigor of it, they would get
the whole Body of Nuns about their Ears. So
that by this means, they are ſecur'd from the
fear of ever dying an infamous Death; yea,
or ſo much as to ſuffer any thing conſiderable,
whereas a poor Secular Female, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of the like Crimes, would be drag'd to
the Gallows, or Burnt alive. Nay, there are
ſome who excuſe them of all theſe Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
upon the account of their being Reclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
for why do the Seculars, ſay they, go to
them? We muſt not come near the Beaſt, if
we have no mind to be bit by it. And they,
on the other hand, conceive they may juſtly
deceive the World, becauſe they have once
for good and all deceived them, and made
them loſe their Liberties, by forcing them
to become Nuns.</p>
            <p>The Roman Catholicks may well expect
that theſe Monſtrous Vocations, will one day
produce nothing but Monſters. 'Tis too great
a Violence done to the natural Right, which
every one hath to his Liberty, to pretend to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42118:92"/>
force people to a Condition, which they can
never after change: But it is ſtill a greater
Tyranny to handle thoſe as the moſt infamous
Criminals, who make the leaſt attempt for to
recover it. The following Hiſtory which is
a very true one, and happened at <hi>Milan</hi> about
four years ago whilſt I was there, is a moſt
ſenſible proof thereof. A <hi>Dominican</hi> Nun of
the Number of thoſe; whom their Parents
force to ſhut themſelves up in a Cloiſter, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made ſerious Reflections upon her engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
found that her Parents in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her the better, had falſified the Date of
the Extract, which they had taken out of the
Regiſter of her Baptiſm, and had made her
a year older than indeed ſhe was, to engage
her the ſooner in a Monaſtick Life. For it
is to be noted, that the Canons declare all
thoſe Profeſſions to be Null and Void, which
are made before a certain Age, there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
tho' there be but one day wanting;
and our Religious was not ignorant of it.
She therefore reſolved to quit her ſelf of her
Profeſſion, as being null and invalid. The
Abbeſs of the Convent gave advice thereof
to her Parents, who immediately repaired to
the Monaſtery, and having given a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sum of Mony to the Abbeſs, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
her to joyn with them, to hinder her
coming out from thence. The ſhorteſt and
ſureſt way was to make her paſs for a Fool.
Accordingly the Abbeſs and ſome of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42118:93"/>
Publiſh'd that her Brains were crackt;
but becauſe ſhe was not ſo Craz'd, but that
ſhe could upon occaſion, give good Reaſons
of what ſhe ſaid, ſhe was forbid the Parlour,
and never ſuffer'd to come to the Grates. Thus
this poor Creature was forc'd to live in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
manner for ſome years, without being
able to come to the Speech of any Body.
In the mean time, having dexterouſly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
the Spirit of a Converſe Siſter, ſhe took
upon her to deliver a Letter from her, to the
Cardinal Archbiſhop, to whom only it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to take Cogniſance of the Affairs of
Nuns in extraordinary Caſes. She moſt humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repreſented to him, in her Letter, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhe had to reclaim or retract her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and the great Cruelties which the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,
at the Inſtigation of her Parents, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
againſt her, ſince they had diſcover'd
her Intent. The Cardinal far from being
touch'd by the Juſtice of theſe Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſuppos'd, that by granting her Requeſt,
he would give an occaſion to the reſt of the
Nuns, to follow her ſteps, and make them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to examine the day and hour of their
Profeſſions: Wherefore he immediately ſent
his Orders to the Abbeſs, to ſhut her up more
cloſely than before; conformable to which
Order, ſhe was ſhut up in the inward Priſon
of the Monaſtery, where ſhe continued five
years, with the allowance only of a little
Bread and Water for her Nouriſhment, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42118:93"/>
being cruelly Whipt thrice a Week. The
Nuns, as I have ſaid before, exerciſe a very
ſweet and mild Juſtice one towards another;
but if there be any found amongſt them, who
have a mind to quit the Convent, to theſe
they are inexorably Pitileſs and Cruel. They
fear, leſt being got out from amongſt them,
they might Divulge the infamous Wickedneſs
they commit, and as an honeſt Man told me,
they are of the humour of the Devils, who
wiſh Men would Damn themſelves, to have
the more Company in Hell. <hi>Solatium miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum
eſt habere Pares: 'Tis a comfort to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Perſons that they are not alone.</hi> Our poor
Priſoner in this her extream Miſery found none,
but this ſame Converſe Siſter, who had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
her Letter to the Cardinal, that had
any pity for her, who took upon her, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
another Letter for her, which ſhe had
addreſt to an Honeſt Gentleman, in whom
ſhe had a great deal of Confidence; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
reſolv'd with one of his Friends, to
do his utmoſt endeavour to ſet her at Liberty.
He, by means of this Converſe Siſter, furniſht
her with Inſtruments to break her Priſon;
and on a certain Night, according to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they had before taken, they drew her
with Cords over the Wall, and being entred
into the Coach, that ſtood ready for her, ſhe
deſir'd the Gentlemen to carry her to <hi>Genoa.</hi>
The Nuns in the mean time, took ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a care of this poor Creature, that a day
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42118:94"/>
and almoſt two Nights paſt, before ever they
perceiv'd that ſhe had made her eſcape; and
ſhe was already arriv'd at <hi>Genoa,</hi> before the
Report of it came to <hi>Milan.</hi> The Nun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got to <hi>Genoa,</hi> about Eleven a Clock at
Night, made the Gates to be open'd to her,
and having taken up her Lodging in the beſt
Inn, ſhe preſently ſent to acquaint one of the
Principal Magiſtrates of the City, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
ſome Body might immediately be ſent to
take the care of her, and to diſcharge the
two Gentlemen, that had brought her thither,
that all might be ſatisfi'd of their Honeſty
and good intent in this Undertaking; and
that they had not endeavour'd to Steal her
away upon any motive of Licentiouſneſs.
This Sage and prudent behaviour of hers,
which did not at all beſpeak her a Fool, as her
Enemies miſrepreſented her, was well approv'd
of by the Magiſtrates of <hi>Genoa.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
her with extraordinary kindneſs, and
promis'd to afford her their utmoſt Aſſiſtance.
They appointed Commiſſaries to receive the
Reaſons of her leaving the Monaſtery, and
having found them good and juſt, they writ
to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to inform his Holineſs
what had paſt, and to receive his Orders about
it. It was in the Papacy of <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. who
was a great Enemy to all thoſe, who deſerted
their Convents; for they ſay of him, that he
ſent to the Gallies every one of the Monks,
who after having quit their Monaſteries,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42118:94"/>
humbly addreſt themſelves to him for Relief,
without hearing any of their Reaſons. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to this Humor of his, he order'd the
Magiſtrates of <hi>Genoua,</hi> not to meddle any
more in that matter; and immediately to ſend
back the Nun to her lawful Superior, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Archbiſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> who would take
care to do her Juſtice.</p>
            <p>This Order was very cruel; for this Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
being accuſed by the Nun, for having
been ſo far from hearing her Remonſtrance,
when ſhe had recourſe to him, that he cauſed
her to be Impriſoned and Abuſed, was become
her moſt dangerous Adverſary. This made
theſe Gentlemen, to write a ſecond time to the
Pope, to repreſent to him theſe Inconveniences,
and to diſcharge their Conſciences. But <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the XIth was too firm in whatſoever he
had once reſolved on, (and it may be this was
the only Fault he had) and redoubled his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Orders, with greater expreſneſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
threatning them (in caſe of delay) with
Excommunication. Thus theſe Gentlemen, who
were unwilling to involve themſelves in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the ſake of a Nun, ſent her back three
Months after, with a good Guard, to <hi>Milan:</hi>
Every one pitied her condition, and believed
the Archbiſhop would receive Orders from
<hi>Rome,</hi> for to hear her Caſe. But in the mean
time, ſhe was ſent back to her Convent, and
the Nuns ſhut her up in her Dungeon, and
three or four Months after ſhe was never heard
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42118:95"/>
of more. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women have great reaſon
to bleſs GOD, that ſuch a Barbarous Tyranny
is at laſt aboliſh'd in <hi>England;</hi> for they may be
ſure, that if ever <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould ſet her Foot in
<hi>England</hi> again, they would not fail to build
Priſons for them every where (I mean Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,)
where, in ſpight of their Teeth, they
would be made to renounce the World. It
being therefore a thing in a manner impoſſible,
for a Nun ever to get out of a Monaſtery,
it is much better for them never to think of
it.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as the Profeſſion of renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World, does not make one really dye
to it; ſo they ſeem, on the contrary, to have
taken the reſolution of cleaving to it more than
ever, and to follow the Maxims of it, as far as
is poſſible for them to do, and more than it
may be they ever would have done, had they
ſtaid in it. Their Habit ought to be very plain,
without Pride or Affectation; but we find that
they have been very ingenious in reducing
them to another paſs. Only ſetting Silk aſide,
which they may not wear, they uſe the fineſt
and moſt curious Woollen Stuffs they can
meet with; and every thing about them is ſo
neatly made, and to that degree of Curioſity
and Exactneſs, that there is no uneven Fold or
Stich to be found in them; and certainly, there
be a great many to whom a Religious Habit
is much more advantagious, than a Secular, a
making them to appear more comly and hands
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42118:95"/>
ſom. Some of them let their Hair grow on
the fore-part of their Heads, and take great
care in frizling of it. They wear alſo Laced
Head-dreſſes under their Veils, as likewiſe
Neck-Laces, Bracelets, and Pendants in their
Ears; and in a word, the moſt of them Paint
themſelves to exceſs.</p>
            <p>I went once to ask leave to ſpeak with a
Nun of the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> at <hi>Vicenza.</hi>
She made me ſtay for her an Hour and an half
in the Parlour, and came at laſt ſo Curl'd and
Painted, that ſhe e'en frighted me. She excus'd
her ſelf, for having made me ſtay ſo long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
forſooth, ſhe durſt not preſent her ſelf
before me diſorderly. This Nun gave me a
plain and downright deſcription of all that
paſt in her Monaſtery; the Antipathies, the
Jealouſies, the Amorous Intriegues, and the
Parties that reign'd amongſt them. They were
at that time in a great Diviſion amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
ſome being of the Emperor's Faction,
others of the <hi>French</hi> Kings. They who were
of the Emperor's Side, could not endure to
hear the others ſpeak well of his Enemy. There
hapned one day (as ſhe told me) a very furious
Battle between them, upon this account.</p>
            <p>A Nun at Dinner-time drunk a Health to the
<hi>French</hi> King: The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> not being able
to brook it, they came to Words, and from
Words to Blows. They flung the Diſhes and
Plates, and whatſoever elſe came next to hand,
at one anothers Heads; ſhe ſhewed me her Veil,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42118:96"/>
which was yet all ſtained with a Sawce out of
a Diſh they had flung at her. This vexed her
more than all the reſt; for the <hi>Italian</hi> Women,
but more eſpecially the Nuns, are exceeding
neat and cleanly: She endeavour'd her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
in flinging a Chaſing-diſh full of hot
Coals in the Face of the Party that had thus
Affronted her. And ſhe continued to demand
of me, Whether there might not be means
found to ſignifie her Bravery to the <hi>French</hi>
King, and that ſhe doubted not, but that if he
were informed of the Zeal ſhe had for his
Glory, he would ſend for her to <hi>Paris,</hi> and make
her an Abbeſs there. Theſe poor Maidens are
very apt to intoxicate themſelves with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſuch like Fancies. When they are weary
of Quarrelling and beating one another, then
they betake themſelves to Jeſting and Fooling,
and compoſe Comedies and Farces to make
one another Laugh.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> now Lord Biſhop
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> did not exaggerate the matter,
when he ſaith, That <hi>He had ſeen ſome of them
that were not over modeſt.</hi> They make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of repreſenting in their Plays, <hi>Venus</hi>'s
and <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s wholly to the Life; they Sing
profane Songs, and altogether unworthy and
unbecoming Perſons conſecrated to God; they
act Dances and Poſtures that are extream Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
and all that they ſpeak in them, is
commonly conceiv'd in Terms admitting a
double ſignification, whereof one ſenſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42118:96"/>
either impious or wanton. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
have very excellent Voices, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Muſick perfectly well; but if there be
any impure or laſcivious Air, that is that which
pleaſeth them beſt, and which they make
choice of, to entertain the Company with.
That which is the moſt enormous thing of all,
is, that not only in theſe their Comedies, but
alſo (O unheard of Profanation!) in their
Divine Offices for Sundays and Feſtivals, they
intermix theſe filthy Songs, which they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly
pretend to be made in imitation of
the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> All the Debauched Youth
of the City, about this time, flock'd to the
Church of the <hi>Coeleſtines</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> where theſe
Nuns equally tickled their Ears and Fancies
by the ſweetneſs and laſciviouſneſs of their
Songs. The Scandal grew at laſt to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that the Cardinal ſent his Orders to have
their Church ſhut up, and abſolutely forbad
them to ſing Muſick any more.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Cuſtom in the World, for Men to
Court Women; but in theſe Religious Orders,
on the contrary, the Nuns Court the Men;
they write Amorous Notes to them; they ſend,
to entreat them to come and ſee them; and
there are few Nuns, that have not two or
three, to whom they are more particularly
linked in Affection; and they are ſo well skill'd
in diſpoſing their Timos, that they never meet
together in the Parlour. They are very Jealous
of them, and ſhould they once underſtand, that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42118:97"/>
any one of their Lovers had diſcours'd with
any other Nun, beſides themſelves, they would
immediately quit them, and would find a time
to be revenged on them. I take them to be
very unhappy in this, That they deſire ſo
ſtrongly, what is ſo difficult for them to enjoy.
Some amongſt them do ſo far enflame their
Imaginations about their Amours, that they
run Diſtracted; and others are ſo immoveably
determind to what they long for, that they
actually apply themſelves to the inventing of
Means, that may bring them to the poſſeſſion
of what they deſire: Of theſe, ſome give
themſelves to the Devil; and to this purpoſe
they tell a Story, That upon a time, a Nun
being reſolved to give her ſelf to the Devil;
He plainly told her, <hi>He would not have her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe was more Devil than himſelf.</hi> 'Tis for
this Reaſon that we are told ſo many Stories
of Nuns, that are Poſſeſſed. Others endeavour
for Mony to corrupt the Turn Keys and Maid-Servants,
that have the Care of the Outward-Gates,
to admit their Gallants at Night by the
Tower. Some have pluck'd away whole Grates
from the Parlours; others have broke through
the Walls, or have made Paſſages under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d;
and it happens frequently enough,
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> their Cunning, they get the Keys of
the Great Gate of the Monaſtery from under
the Lady Abbeſſes Pillow; or that they are ſo
happy to meet with one Key or other, that can
unlock it. There is alſo another Little Gate in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42118:97"/>
the Veſtries, by which the Prieſts enter, to go
and carry the Holy Sacrament and Extream
Unction to thoſe that are Sick, and by which
they convey the Ornaments of the Altar:
Now, to get the poſſeſſion of this Door, they
need only to gain her who is over the Veſtry.
But the moſt ſure way to obtain their deſires, is,
when a whole Community of Females agree
together, to take their Pleaſures. Of this
there hapned a moſt infamous Inſtance, about
ſeven or eight Years ſince, amongſt the Nuns
of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> which made a great deal of Noiſe in
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Religious finding themſelves quite
weary of keeping their Vow of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> agreed
amongſt themſelves to admit their Lovers into
the Monaſtery, and having all bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in an Oath of Secrecy, they wrought
hard, to make a Paſſage Under-ground, under
the Walls of their Encloſure, and which was
to end in the Houſe of a young Gentleman,
who was one of the Plot. Their Undertaking
had ſo good ſucceſs, that the Nuns enjoy'd the
Galants as often as they pleaſed. In the mean
time there was obſerved a great change in
theſe Recluſes; they became more modeſt in
the Parlour, and more aſſiduous in the Quire,
than ever the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> had been before. Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
who was a very Aged Man, being inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of taking part in their Amours, was not
thought fit to be admitted to the Secret. They
informed him in their Confeſſions and ſecret
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42118:98"/>
Conferences, that they felt from time to time
ſuch Raviſhments and Internal Joys, as they
could no way expreſs; without telling him,
whether they belong'd to the Soul or Body.
And this good Man, who took all in the beſt
ſenſe, and who alſo attributed in part this
their Converſion, to his own good Prayers for
them, went to the Biſhop of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> and made
his Report to him; telling him, That <hi>his Nuns
were all of them become Saints to that degree, as
to ſuffer Exſtaſies and Raviſhments.</hi> The great
Opinion the World had conceived of their
Sanctity ſtill increaſed more and more, when
the greateſt part of theſe Nuns undertook to
obſerve a Six Months Retirement in the Inner
part of their Monaſtery; making a Vow, That
during all that time they would never come to
the Grate: This was to hide their Big-bellies,
and Child-bearing.</p>
            <p>In a word, they had many Children, and
this infamous Commerce laſted many years.
The World has been ſince aſtoniſhed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
how it was poſſible to be concealed for
ſo long a time, without making a Noiſe in
the World; for there were above a Score of
Youths that were of the Gang. However, as
Wickedneſs always drags its own Chain, this
alſo was diſcover'd at laſt by the Cook-Maid.
This Siſter finding her ſelf abandoned and
neglected, becauſe ſhe was very Ugly; and
moreover, finding her ſelf overcharg'd with
Work, by reaſon of the Cawdles and Broths,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42118:98"/>
and a thouſand other extraordinary things,
which ſhe was oblig'd to make for thoſe that
were in Child-Bed. Beſides, whenever the
young Galants came at Night, they always
brought ſome dainty Bit or other along with
them, which ſhe muſt Dreſs for the reſt. One
of the Nuns, on a time, having very indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
jeared her for the bigneſs of her Noſe,
ſhe was ſo extreamly nettled at it, that in
Revenge, ſhe by way of Raillery reproach'd
her with her Big-Belly: From theſe ſtinging
Jeſts, they proceeded to high Words, and in
fine, the Cook-Maid was baſely abus'd by them.
The next Morning ſhe ſends a Letter to the
Vicar-General of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> wherein ſhe informed
him, That ſhe had a Matter of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to diſcloſe to him, provided care were
taken to ſecure her Life from the Revenge of
the other Nuns. The Grand-Vicar was ſo
poſſeſt with the high Eſteem he had conceiv'd
for theſe Recluſes, who of late had undertaken
the Reforming of themſelves, with ſo much
Edification, that having heard what the Cook-Maid
had to ſay, he immediately called her a
Viſionary. But ſhe perſiſting to maintain what
ſhe had diſcovered to him; and offering to
make it appear, that three of the Nuns were
actually with Child, and that two of them had
been lately brought to Bed; the Grand-Vicar
at laſt reſolv'd to perform a Viſitation of the
Convent. Many of the Nuns perceiving, that
there was ſomething extraordinary in this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42118:99"/>
Proceeding, endeavoured to make eſcape out
of the Monaſtery; but they were all ſtopt in
their flight, and brought back to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
where they found very pretty Children,
Males and Females, in the Cells of theſe Nuns,
who call'd them their Mothers.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop having been inform'd of it,
drew up an Indictment, and ſent it in all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to the Tribunal of <hi>Venice,</hi> which is
eſtabliſhed to take cognizance of Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Nuns; (for <hi>Breſſe</hi> is a <hi>Venetian</hi> City,
depending upon the Republick both in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals
and Spirituals.) This Tribunal is very
ſevere, and never fails of puniſhing things with
the extreameſt vigour. In the mean time all
the Young Men, who knew themſelves guilty,
had time to ſave themſelves, ſome in <hi>Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
others in the Country of the <hi>Griſſons;</hi> and
others in <hi>Germany,</hi> as having by good-luck
nothing but the <hi>Alpes</hi> to paſs. Some days after, a
Sentence was pronounc'd and publiſh'd againſt
them, as ſevere as ever had been ſeen. Their
Goods were confiſcated, their Houſes razed to
the ground, and their Heads ſet at a price. I
was troubled to find amongſt this number one
of my Scholars, the Son of a Procurator of
S. <hi>Mark;</hi> but ſome time after, I had the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to underſtand, That he was come freely
of his own accord, to put himſelf in Priſon, in
order to his Juſtification; which he did to ſo
good purpoſe, that he was acquitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42118:99"/>
There were many Perſons in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially
amongſt the Prieſts and Nuns, who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this ſo ſevere and ſo publick Proceeding of
the Republick, which had made the matter to
be much more Nois'd abroad, than otherwiſe
it would have been. They ſaid, it would have
been much better to have ſuppreſt it wholly,
as they do at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in all the other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
of <hi>Italy;</hi> becauſe the Hereticks on
the other ſide of the Hills, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Geneva,</hi> are never wanting, when ſuch
Matters as theſe happen, to make the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it, or, to make uſe of their Phraſe,
to <hi>Butter their Cabbage with it.</hi> As for the Nuns,
they contented themſelves with ſetting a ſtrict
Guard upon them for ſome time, and with
ſtopping up the Conveyance they had made
under their Walls. For above a year together,
the Gentlemen of <hi>Breſſe</hi> durſt not paſs along the
Streets, near to their Monaſtery, for fear of
incurring a ſiniſter Suſpicion. See here the
common End of the Amorous Intriegues of
Nuns, and tho' indeed they do not always
make ſo much Noiſe, it is becauſe thoſe who
ought to take cognizance of them, pretend to
have more Prudence than the Tribunal of
<hi>Venice</hi> made uſe of on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>There be two ſorts of Superiors of Nuns in
<hi>Italy;</hi> for ſome of them are immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Biſhops, and others to ſome Generals
of Orders, of the ſame Rule that they profeſs.
Thoſe that are under the Conduct of Biſhops,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42118:100"/>
are ſomewhat better Govern'd; but they
who are under the inſpection of Monks, do
for the moſt, wholly give the Reins to their
Paſſions, and lead a moſt infamous Life, tho'
with leſs Noiſe. The Monks will ſcarcely
ever ſuffer any Seculars to frequent the Grates
of thoſe whom they Govern, that they may
keep the Affections of theſe Maidens entirely
to themſelves. If any diſorder chance to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
all is kept very ſecret, becauſe this would
turn as much to their Diſhonour, as to the
diſgrace of the Nuns. There are a Thouſand
Stories abroad in the World, of the Loves of
Monks and Nuns, and I find no difficulty to
give credit to them, ſince the Information I
my ſelf have had thereof, during my abode
in <hi>Italy,</hi> from Perſons, whom I can belive;
but am reſolv'd to paſs them by in ſilence,
for fear of offending Chaſt Ears.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Prodigious thing to ſee how Nuns
have multipli'd themſelves in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the
vaſt quantity of Convents they have, as well
in every City, as in the Country. There are
almoſt as many different Orders of them, as
there are of Monks. Amongſt the reſt there
are alſo She Jeſuits, which commonly are
call'd <hi>Urſulines,</hi> who more particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to Inſtruct Young Girls. In <hi>Italy</hi>
they are oblig'd to be Cloiſter'd, tho' in
<hi>Switzerland</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> they are not under
that engagement. I was ſurpriz'd to ſee that
the <hi>Italians,</hi> who are accus'd of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42118:100"/>
become ſo effeminate ſome Ages ſince,
have not yet introduc'd amongſt them a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Order of Nuns, which is extreamly
multipli'd in <hi>France;</hi> I mean that of <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrault,</hi>
which contains ſomething ſo odd in its
Inſtitution, and in its Obſervances, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as I do not believe I ſhall have any
opportunity of entertaining you further about
Nuns, I ſuppoſe you will not find it diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
if I give you here a ſhort Relation of
them, if it were for nothing elſe but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to you, to what a height Folly
and Deluſion are mounted in the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Perſon whoſe Name was <hi>Robert d' Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſſel,</hi>
having been followed by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men and Women, in the Woods of
<hi>Fontevrault,</hi> who had been perſuaded by his
Preachments to embrace a Monaſtick Life,
he gave them the Habit, and placed them in
ſeveral Cels in the Year 1100. And being
of a very complaiſant Humour for the Sex,
he undertook to overthrow the Order of God,
and of Nature, to oblige Women, by giving
them the Superiority over Men. Some ſay he
did this, becauſe of the great Devotion he
had to the Bleſſed Virgin, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to honour the Recommendation Jeſus
Chriſt made of S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> to his
Mother, when he was upon the Croſs, as
may be ſeen in the XIX Chap. of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of S. <hi>John,</hi> Verſ. 26, and 27. <hi>When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42118:101"/>
therefore ſaw his Mother, and the Diſciple
ſtanding by, whom he loved; he ſaith unto his
Mother, Woman, behold thy Son. Then ſaith he
to the Diſciple, behold thy Mother. And from
that Hour that Diſciple took her to his own Home.</hi>
He pretended it might be gather'd from
hence, that Women were to Command Men;
at leaſt he conceiv'd, that Men acquired a
greater degree of Perfection, by ſubmitting
themſelves to be obedient to them. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
he would have the Monks ſhould
oblige themſelves by a Solemn Vow of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Nuns, and make Profeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the hands of the Lady Abbeſs. Pope
<hi>Paſchal</hi> confirm'd his Order, which ſince that
time multiplied exceedingly, eſpecially in
<hi>France,</hi> where it had its firſt Riſe. It hath
been the wonder of theſe laſt Ages, why the
Popes have ſuffer'd ſo long an Order, which
may with good reaſon be lookt upon as the
greateſt Shame and Reproach of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
have been made, to perſuade ſome of
the late Popes to ſuppreſs it, but the great
Ladies that have been Abbeſſes thereof, Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
of them having been Princeſſes, and
amongſt them Five of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi>
have had ſo much Power, that by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Authority Royal, they have
always hindred it. It is the Siſter of Madam
<hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> who at preſent is their Lady
Abbeſs; ſhe met with abundance of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42118:101"/>
at firſt, for theſe Nuns who were already
accuſtom'd, of a long time, to have none but
Princeſſes for their Abbeſſes, would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of her; and that which made them the
more to diſtaſte her was, the motive for
which this place was beſtowed on her; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the abſolute Will of the King, has in fine
prov'd inſtead of a Principality to her. I am
in a Condition to acquaint you with ſome
Specialities, concerning the preſent Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Spirit of this Linſey Woolſey Order;
for having had two Uncles that were Monks,
and an Aunt that was a Nun of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
whom I often went to Viſit; I
came by this means to be very particularly
informed about them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place to give you ſome Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Abby of <hi>Fontevrault.</hi> It is Situated
three Leagues from <hi>Saumur</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> upon the
Confines of <hi>Touraine.</hi> It was formerly a diſmal
Place, full of Woods and Thickets; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it is very pleaſant, as being extreamly well
cultivated and improv'd, and enjoys a very
good Air. There are Five Monaſteries,
whereof Three are of Nuns, and Two of
Monks, without counting the Palace of the
Lady Abbeſs, which is a Stately Building.
The firſt of theſe Monaſteries of Nuns, is
call'd the <hi>Great Montier,</hi> or the greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery;
and in this all the Nuns of the Quire,
that have a good Voice, and are in Health,
are Lodged. The Offices are very regularly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42118:102"/>
Sung here at all Hours, and the Church is a
curious fair Building, to Perfection, Spacious
and Sumptuous. There are about a hundred
and fifty Nuns profeſt in it, who continue
there till they grow Old or Weak and Infirm,
for then they are diſcharged of their Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and from the Service of the Quire,
and are remov'd to the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi>
which is deſtinated only for thoſe Nuns,
that are Old or Diſtemper'd. They have no
other Obligation upon them, but to hear one
low Maſs every day. Their Church alſo is a
very fair one, and they have very curious
Gardens. The Third Monaſtery of theſe
Religious Maids, is call'd the Novitiat, where
they have their Boarders and Novices. Here
they are taught whatſoever they have a deſire
to, <hi>viz.</hi> to Work, to Sing by Notes, to
Dance, to Play upon Inſtruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Fourth Monaſtery, which is for the Men, is
that of S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> which contains
about Fourſcore or an Hundred Monks, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Novices. Their Buildings and Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are very Fair, but more eſpecially their
Library, and their Refectory. The Fifth
Monaſtery is that which is call'd the <hi>Secretene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
and contains the Brothers Converſes,
which are about Sixty in Number. They are
appointed for the Service of the Fathers,
when they are ſent to be Directors to other
Religious Houſes of the ſame Order. All theſe
Five Monaſteries are extreamly well Built,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42118:102"/>
have large Gardens, and their particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures;
but beſides theſe, there is one great
Encloſure, which contains them all, and
makes a kind of City, Peopl'd with Monks
and Nuns. Without the grand Encloſure is
the Town of <hi>Fontevrault,</hi> Inhabited by all
ſorts of Trades and Handicrafts-men, who gain
their Lively-hood by Working for the Abby,
and for the Strangers that come thither from
all Parts, either out of Curioſity, or to Viſit
ſome of their Kindred. This Order contains
about Threeſcore Abbies of Nuns, who all
own that of <hi>Fontevrault</hi> for their Mother, and
depend on it. The Abbeſs is General of the
Order; 'tis ſhe that performs the Viſitation
of the Monaſteries, ſends them Directors
and Confeſſors, and recals them at her Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The firſt time that ever I came to <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrault,</hi>
I was between Fifteen and Sixteen
years of Age, and it was at the Sollicitation
of my Aunt, who was a Nun there, and
Miſtreſs of the Novices, that I went thither.
Her deſign was to perſuade me to become a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Monk of that Order, where ſhe had already
gain'd abundance of Credit. I found alſo
my two Uncles there, who were of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Sentiments and Inclinations; for the one
of them, who was very well pleas'd with his
State of Obedience, endeavour'd, all he could,
to draw me into it; but the other, who had
a more noble Soul, talk'd to me of nothing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42118:103"/>
elſe, but of the baſeneſs and degeneracy of
Spirit there was, in making ones ſelf a Slave
to Women. It is ſometimes permitted in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to remove from one
Order to another, provided it be from one of
greater Liberty to a ſtricter. Accordingly my
Uncle had done his utmoſt endeavour, to quit
the Order of <hi>Fontevrault,</hi> and to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to that of the Reformed <hi>Benedictins</hi> of the
Congregation of S. <hi>Maur.</hi> But Madam <hi>de Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
the laſt Princeſs of the Blood-Royal they
have had for their Lady Abbeſs, perceiving
that the beſt Subjects of her Order abandoned
it at laſt, by the natural ſhame and regret
they had to obey Women, by this means took
a courſe to ſhut this Back-Door. She had ſo
much Power, and ſo many Friends in the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhe knew ſo well to repreſent,
that this Change would not be allowed of in
Conſcience; foraſmuch as her Order, tho'
otherwiſe very mild and ſlack, ought indeed,
(by reaſon of the blind Obedience which it
renders to the Inferior Sex) to be accounted
the moſt mortifying and abaſing of all others,
that are approved by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
that conſequently, according to the Canons it
could not be left, to go to another; That at laſt
ſhe obtain'd a Bull from <hi>Rome,</hi> which declar'd,
<hi>That after Profeſſion, none ever after ſhould be able
to quit the Order, to enter into another.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were her Rank, and her Friends, or the
ſtrength of her Arguments that prevail'd in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42118:103"/>
this caſe, I will not determine. But by this
means all my Uncles deſigns were overthrown,
and he was forc'd by the Tenor of this Bull, to
continue in his firſt Calling, tho' ſore againſt
his Will. He therefore did his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deter me, from Entring my ſelf a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
there: And tho' I was but a Boy then,
I remember very well, that nothing was more
intolerable, than the Pride of theſe Nuns, who
(to exerciſe the Power they had of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
made them do all manner of Indignities,
Follies, and infamous Services, even to that
degree, as to make them undreſs themſelves
Stark-naked before them in their Parlours, to
receive Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are the ſubtil Foxes, that
creep in every where, where they have the
proſpect of Profit and Advantage, had ſo far
inſinuated themſelves into the Spirit of Madam
<hi>de Bourbon,</hi> that ſhe choſe them for her Confeſaors,
and ſent for two of them to be always about
her, as her Directors. This was the greateſt
Affront that poſſibly ſhe could have put upon
her own Monks, as if none amongſt them all
had been able, or worthy to be her Spiritual
Father. In imitation of their Lady Abbeſs,
the other Nuns would needs have <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for
their Confeſſors too; ſo that by this means,
theſe Fathers became very powerful at <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrault;</hi>
and to the end they might be the
more reſpected, they had the Addreſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
the Abbeſs, to command her Monks to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42118:104"/>
obey them, and that the Obedience rendred to
them, ſhould be look'd upon as paid to her ſelf.
If there were a Petition to be preſented, an
Office to be beſtowed, and in a word, any
Favour to be demanded, all was to paſs through
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Hands. The Lady Abbeſs Sign'd
nothing, but what her Father Director had
firſt approv'd of. It was they that had all the
good and dainty Bits, and who devour'd all
their Sweet-meats and Confects. This you
muſt think was a very ſenſible Diſpleaſure to
theſe Monks, who thereupon began to grow
very lean. But by good hap for them, tho' moſt
unhappily for the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> the Lady Abbeſs died;
and they had no ſooner cloſed her Eyes, but
the <hi>Monks,</hi> in revenge of their Sufferings and
Diſgraces, as one Man, fell upon the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
and after having Laſht them very bountifully,
turn'd them ſhamefully out of the Monaſtery.
The Nuns might Cry their Hearts out from
their Parlours, commanding them to Treat the
Gentlemen civilly, and not to hurt them; the
Monks were reſolved not to hear them, ſince
the Authority of the Abbeſs was no longer
there to reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>My Uncle gave me a full Account of all the
Particulars of it: But my other Uncle, on the
contrary, did his utmoſt endeavour to perſuade
me, to make one of them. He told me, That
their Obedience was not at all difficult to be
obſerv'd; that the Abbeſs and the Nuns com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them nothing, but ſuch things as were
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42118:104"/>
ſweet and eaſie, and that there was nothing
of Rigour in all their Obſervance; that they
were not oblig'd to Riſe at Night; and kept
no other Faſts, ſave thoſe of the Church; and
that after they had finiſhed their Studies, they
were all advanc'd to be the Directors and
Confeſſſors of the Nuns of their Order, and
that then they were perfectly happy.</p>
            <p>My Aunt, after this, ſent for me into the
Parlour; where, after that ſhe had made me
take part of a Collation, ſhe told me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pretty things, to engage me to be one of
them. I took occaſion to object to her, what
her Elder Brother had told me, about their
giving Diſcipline to Men: She deſired me, by
no means to give ear to him, as being a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
Perſon, and enrag'd, becauſe he
could not effect his Deſigns: Yet ſhe could not
deny that ſuch things paſt amongſt them, but
that it was only upon young Novices, and
thoſe that were newly profeſt, until they had
accompliſh'd their Studies; that is to ſay, till
the Age of 25 Years. And foraſmuch as theſe
were the very Stages, that I was to paſs
through, in caſe I reſolved to ſtay with them,
ſhe told me, to ſoften the matter, and the
better to prepare me for it, That it was not
ſo harſh a thing, as probably I might imagin;
that all the Nuns of <hi>Fontevrault</hi> were Ladies
of Quality, and that it was a far greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
to receive Diſcipline from the hands of
a Monk, who often is no better than the Son
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42118:105"/>
of a Porter, or Cobler, than from them; and
beſides, that this never hapned, but upon very
extraordinary Occaſions, to try their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
In a word, ſhe told me, That all this
was accounted as nothing amongſt them, as
being accuſtom'd to ſuch matters. However,
all theſe Reaſons were not capable of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
me, and I was oblig'd to cut ſhort, and
tell her, That I felt no Call to the Religious
State, of what Order ſoever it might be; and
if it ſhould pleaſe God to give me one here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
he was to be Maſter, and that then I
would apply my ſelf, with all my power to
follow it: And ſo deſired her, to talk to me
no more about it.</p>
            <p>I ſtaid about Three Weeks with my Uncles
in the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Johns,</hi> and I ate always
at the Prior's Table in the Hall, where they
entertain their Strangers. A young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who came thither the ſame Day as I did,
only Supt there the Evening after our Arrival;
after which time, becauſe he was come with
the deſign of Entring himſelf into their Order,
they made him Eat in the common Refectory,
together with the other Novices and Monks;
and Eight days after, they gave him the Habit.
The Maſter of the Novices being come one
Day to the Table for Strangers, where I was,
the Prior asked him, How the young Novice
behaved himſelf; who anſwered him, That he
did Wonders, and gave the marks of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Fervor. Amongſt other things, I
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42118:105"/>
remember he ſaid, That <hi>He alone had almost
ſwept the whole Dormitory that Morning, and
that the Nune had already once called him into the
Parlour, from whence he return'd more joyful than
he went thither.</hi> The Monks that were there
Smil'd upon one another, and conceiv'd good
hopes, that he would perſevere, ſeeing he had
made ſo good a beginning, and ſo well taken
his firſt Trial.</p>
            <p>I had a great deſire to go and ſee the
Monks Dine in the Common Refectory; but
they told me, I muſt ſtay till next <hi>Sunday,</hi> for
that it was not permitted to be there any other
Day of the Week, becauſe of the Trials they
made of the Novices. My Uncle informed
me what theſe Trials were, <hi>viz.</hi> to make ſome
of them to carry a piece of Wood, or Gag in
their Mouths; others were commanded, to go
and kiſs the Monks Shoes; others, to continue
upon their Knees, with their Arms acroſs;
others again, to eat their Meals on the Ground,
without either Table-Cloth or Napkin, and an
hundred other ſuch like Fooleries. The higheſt
Trial of all, is the Diſcipline, and they obſerve
a Naſty manner in the giving of it; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in all other Religious Orders, they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
give it on their Shoulders, at <hi>Fontevrault</hi>
they always give it beneath. It was not long
ſince, that two Novices went to complain to
the Abbeſs, That the Prior handled them with
too great Severity; but the Abbeſs having
made them come into her Chamber, gave them
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42118:106"/>
as much more, to make them forbear their
Complaints to another. 'Tis in theſe Fooleries
they make Vertue to conſiſt, and they never
teach their Religious, what it is to be Vertuous
indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> to mortifie, as they ought, their
Appetites, and to be meek and lowly of Heart.
This is that which makes theſe Young Men,
when they are paſt their Novitiate, and have
run through the Courſe of their Studies, to
have their Paſſions as head-ſtrong as ever, and
to lead a ſcandalous Life with the Nuns, whoſe
Directors they are.</p>
            <p>Theſe Nuns have a great deal more Liberty
allow'd them, than thoſe of other Orders;
their Grates are very ſpacious, and are not
double, as in <hi>Italy:</hi> They have the freedom to
enter into their Outward Churches, and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Parlours, which is not permitted to other
Nuns, and with leave from the Abbeſs they
may go abroad too. They will have all the
Publick Exerciſes of Learning to be performed
in their Preſence, as all Latin Declamations
and Diſputations. They have to this purpoſe
a very great Hall, which is call'd the <hi>Diſputation-Hall,</hi>
and is of a great length and breadth,
having the Partition of a curious Iron-Grate
in the midſt of it, all Gilt, the one half being
aſſign'd to the Nuns, and the other to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who maintain the Diſpute. There are
a great many Nuns amongſt them, who do
very well underſtand Latin, yea, and, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
too. It ſeems, that being to Command
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42118:106"/>
Men, they thought it fitting to take upon them
this Manly quality.</p>
            <p>In a Second Journy, which I took about
Twelve years ago to <hi>Fontevrault,</hi> I heard ſome
Nuns Diſputing very prettily upon ſome Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical
Points. They had conceiv'd a deſign
of eſtabliſhing the Study of the Liberal Arts
amongſt themſelves; and indeed being the ſole
Miſtreſſes there, they might do in it whatſoever
they pleas'd. They ſaid, <hi>They would give the
World a ſenſible demonstration, That it is a great
piece of Injuſtice done to the Sex, not to ſuffer
them to Study, only to keep them the more in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and Error.</hi> As for what concerns Piety
and Devotion, theſe Nuns ſhew they have
but little of it, their whole Converſation
being extreamly Worldy and Laſcivious, as
well as their Dreſs and Habit. They are
cloath'd in white, and wear a black Veil over
it: When they appear in the Quire, they wear
a great black Frock. The Monks wear a black
Caſſock, and a Hood, and when they go to
Church they alſo put on a black Frock.</p>
            <p>This is what I had to communicate to you
concerning this Religious Order, tho' not all
that I could ſay concerning them. It was to
great purpoſe indeed, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms Man
to be the Head of the Woman, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe ought to be ſubject and obedient to
him; ſeeing the Popes, who boaſt themſelves to
be many degrees above S. <hi>Paul,</hi> have deciſively
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42118:107"/>
declared on this occaſion, that the Woman is
the Head of the Man, and who upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is bound to yield Obedience to her. I
remember to have read in an Engliſh Author,
that formerly there were ſuch like Abbies
in <hi>England,</hi> where the Women uſurp'd Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over the Men. He mentions (amongſt
others) the Abby of <hi>Repandune,</hi> and that of
<hi>Streneſhaleh,</hi> where the Abbeſſes commanded
the Monks and Nuns, that were in the ſame
Monaſtery. But foraſmuch as this Author doth
affect throughout all his Diſcourſe, to oppoſe
himſelf to the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> who firſt brought
the Monaſtick Life along with them into this
Iſland, and that he racks his Brain to prove,
without any ground of Reaſon, That <hi>Joſeph</hi>
of <hi>Arimathea</hi> (he who Buried our Lord Jeſus)
came and Founded ſeveral Monaſteries here,
Thirty years after the Death of our Saviour,
only to rob them of the glory, of having been
the firſt Founders; there is reaſon alſo to reject
what he ſaith concerning theſe Abbies, which
he pretends to be much more Ancient, than the
Arrival of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but that there were
Communities of Religious Perſons in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, ſeeing the Apoſtles themſelves,
for ſome time lived in Common, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
of both Sexes at that time, in imitation
of them, and by the neceſſity there was of
their being Inſtructed in the Faith and Duties
of Chriſtianity; as likewiſe, that they might
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42118:107"/>
be in a better condition to provide for their
Poor, lived Charitably together, and in the
conſtant practice of all Religious Duties.
Wherefore it may be, that in this ſenſe, and
after this manner, there may have been at the
firſt Preaching of the Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi> ſome
of theſe kind of Communities, which were no
more than the firſt Converts, who lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the better convenience of being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
to the end they might be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
afterwards of Inſtructing others. I ſpeak
now according to the Opinion of thoſe, who
will have it, that the Goſpel was Preached
in <hi>England,</hi> in the Apoſtles time, and by the
Apoſtles themſelves; for according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of others, who maintain, that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
was the firſt that Preached the Goſpel in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it is not improbable, but that he Founded
Monaſteries here after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, as
being a Monk himſelf. But theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
are very different from thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Communities of the Primitive Church,
which were only Inſtituted for the Publick
Good, whereas theſe ſeem only to eye a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Good, and to have abandon'd all the
Duties of Chriſtian Charity towards their
Neighbour, for to live only to themſelves; and
are in fine become to that degree the Scandal
of Chriſtianity, that they are even aſham'd of
their own Names. Let any Man go in <hi>France,</hi>
and deſire to ſpeak with a Monk or Nun, or
let him addreſs a Letter to them with this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42118:108"/>
Superſcription, and they will find them more
offended at it, than if one had call'd them
Rogues and Queans: No, they will be called
<hi>Religious</hi> forſooth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There remains nothing for me at preſent,
but to anſwer a certain Queſtion, which might
be put to me;</hi> Whether I, who have made it my
Buſineſs in my <hi>Italian</hi> Journies, to diſcover and
examine the Defects of thoſe Females that live in
Monasteries, and who have here given a very
plain deſcription of them; whether, I ſay, I would
by this ſeem to aver in Truth and Conſcience, that
generally all of them are in this ſtate of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Malice, Senſuality, and Licentiouſneſs, whereof
I have ſpoken?</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That I have not yet
made mention of another exceſs of Bigotry,
Superſtition, Illuſion and Folly, which predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
in a great number of Convents of
Nuns, and always in ſome one Nun or other,
even in thoſe Monaſteries that are the moſt
Corrupt and Licentious. Their Devotion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
it may be, in Kneeling before ſome little
Saint of Wood they have in ſome Corner of
their Monaſtery, and to continue there in that
poſture two or three Hours together every
day. Another undertakes to mumble over
daily a dozen <hi>Roſaries</hi> for the Souls in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
and if any Siſter come to ſpeak with her
during that time, ſhe affects to turn a deaf Ear
to her, for fear of interrupting her Prayers.
Another will go to the Middle of the Choir,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42118:108"/>
and there lie proſtrate upon the Ground, for a
long time together before the Holy Sacrament,
beat her Breaſt, ſtretch forth her Arms croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
puſh forth great Sighs, and ſtare with
her Eyes, as if ſhe were raviſhed and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in an Exſtaſie. Others undertake to
live on nothing but the Hoſt, which they
receive at the Communion, for two or three
Days, during which time they abſtain from all
manner of Meat, and by this means reduce
themſelves to a pitiful condition. If any one
demands of them, why they pretend to do ſo,
they will tell you, that <hi>it is in hopes of becoming
Saints,</hi> and that this is their higheſt Ambition.
Theſe poor Nuns have their Brains fill'd with
thoſe miſerable Legends of the Lives of Saints,
wherewith their Ears ring continually, and
where a great number of ſuch like Actions are
related, for their moſt tranſcendent Vertues.
And accordingly they believe, that by doing the
ſame they ſhall become Saints likewiſe; and
there is more of a Worldly Ambition in the
caſe than is commonly thought of, to acquire
Reputation in a Church, where after Death
they place the Perſons, that practiſe theſe kind
of Follies upon their Altars, in order to worſhip
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not unlikely, but that a Nun may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
fill her Head with ſuch Imaginations as
theſe;</hi> Go to, after that I have been frequent and
aſſiduous in theſe Actions, from whence the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Holineſs and Saintſhip are commonly taken,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42118:109"/>
when once I am dead, they will make me a
Sainteſs, they'l cauſe a Head of Silver to be made,
in which they will enchaſe mine, they will enſhrine
my Body, every one will ſtrive to get a little bit
of my Skin, to diſpoſe of it amongſt their Relicks;
the Sisters will carry me on their Shoulders in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and come and Kneel before my Relicks, to
Pray to me, as we do to ſuch and ſuch a Sainteſs.
O, the Glory and Honour there is in being a Saint!
My greatest Ambition is to be one of them. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, there be many Nuns in</hi> Italy <hi>that
give way to ſuch Thoughts as theſe, and thoſe
who have not the Talent of the World, do
incline to this Spiritual Ambition. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
inſupportable in their Convents to their
Siſters themſelves, and one may eaſily perceive
in all their Actions a moſt deviliſh Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the other ſort of Nuns I have
taken notice of, and of whoſe Temper and
Actions I have had occaſion fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to be inform'd. But yet I will not be
ſo rigid, as to ſay that amongſt ſo great a
number of Nuns, there ſhould not be ſometime
found ſome good Soul, who with a right and
ſincere Heart goes purely and ſimply to God;
tho' indeed never any one came to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
for whom I could paſs my word, as
far as mortal Men, who do not ſee the bottom
of the Heart, can do, for the Honeſty of one
another; but yet I am willing to believe, that
there are ſome found amongſt them that are
Good indeed, and exempt from thoſe great
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42118:109"/>
Weakneſſes that are found in the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
in like manner as we find ſome white
Crows here in <hi>England.</hi> But and if there
ſhould be a greater number of theſe, yet
would not this enervate my Concluſion, which
is this, <hi>That when a State or Condition hath been
erected, in the hopes of attaining a greater Good;
if afterwards it be found, that contrary to the
good hope that has been conceived, it produceth a
great Evil; tho' it may be true alſo, that it is not
without good effect upon ſome, yet thoſe who are in
Power are obliged in Conſcience to abrogate it;</hi>
Which is that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath
done, in ſuppreſſing the Monaſteries of Men
and Women, wherewith the Country was ſo
miſerably peſter'd: For which GOD be
praiſed.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</head>
            <head>The Fourth Days Journy.</head>
            <p>WE departed from <hi>Fondi</hi> early in the
Morning, with deſign to reach <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi>
that day. The Night before
they had told us many Stories of <hi>Banditi,</hi> who
not contenting themſelves to Rob the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
they met with, moſt frequently took
them Priſoners along with them, and Sold
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42118:110"/>
them to the <hi>Turks,</hi> or the firſt Pirates they
met with, for Slaves. Theſe <hi>Banditi</hi> Swarm
in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> into which we
were entr'd the day before; for <hi>Fondi,</hi> is a
Town belonging to that Kingdom. We were
extreamly affrighted, after that we had Rode
Three or Four Miles, to ſee Four Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrait towards us, croſs a Field, as if they
had a mind to intercept us. The only thing
encourag'd us was, that we ſaw no Arms
about them: But we ſoon recover'd of our
Fears, when inſtead of advancing nearer to
us, we ſaw them kneel down, crying aloud
to us, that we would be pleas'd to give them
our Bleſſing, for they had perceiv'd by our
Habit that we were Prieſts; we immediately
diſpatch'd them a great Sign of the Croſs,
whereupon they return'd to their Labour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone a little further, we ſaw many others
come, who deſir'd the ſame favour. Some
of them approach'd nearer to us, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to kiſs our Boots, or touch our Habits
with their Hands, and afterwards kiſs'd the
parts of their Hands wherewith they had
touch'd them. We were not much in Love
with theſe kind of Ceremonies, as having
the <hi>Banditi</hi> always in our minds. However,
we began at laſt to be accuſtom'd to it, and
admir'd the Superſtition and ſimplicity of
theſe poor People, whom their Prieſts have
well nigh perſuaded to adore them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42118:111"/>
I have already in ſeveral Places made
mention of the Superſtition of the <hi>Italians;</hi> but
there is none to be compar'd with that,
which Reigns in the Parts, that are ſubject
to the Dominion of <hi>Spain.</hi> And I ſuppoſe
the reaſon why the Prieſts command more
reſpect there is, becauſe by their frequent
Converſing with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
themſelves to an air of Gravity,
that makes them very Venerable, and have
taken to themſelves Proud and Lofty Titles,
affecting to be call'd Gentlemen and Knights
of Jeſus Chriſt, which probably may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
much to impreſs this great reſpect upon
the Spirits of the common People.</p>
            <p>Generally throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> the Prieſts
are Maſters, and conſequently are Fear'd, but
(ſetting aſide their Character, which they
have a reſpect for,) not eſteem'd or reſpected.
Yea, there are ſome Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> where they
have ſcarcely any reſpect ſhew'd them at all.
The <hi>Venetians</hi> make a diſtinction between a
Prieſt at the Altar, Array'd in his Pontifical
Habit, when he ſaith, or is about to ſay Maſs;
and a Prieſt in Worldly Commerce and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.
Under the firſt Conſideration, they
beſtow the ſame Adorations upon him, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Perſon, they ſay, he
Repreſents; they approach them to touch
and kiſs their Habit, or their Footſteps, as
they return from the Altar, and fall upon
their Knees to receive their Benediction. But
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42118:111"/>
as ſoon as they have undreſt themſelves, and
are come out of the Veſtry, they do not ſo
much as Salute them, or give them the leaſt
Preference. The moſt part of the Nobility
of <hi>Venice,</hi> have a Prieſt in their Houſes, for
their Chaplains, or to be the Governours of
their Children; but they uſe them with the
greateſt Indignity, they make them to Dine
with their Servants, and uſe them as ſuch;
for they Command them as the meaneſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and make them run up and down on
Errands like Foot-Boys; with a Come hither
Prieſt, Go thither Prieſt; indeed it is a very
ſhame, to ſee how they talk to their Prieſts;
and they have certainly more reſpect for their
Gondoliers or Bargemen, than for them.
When a Prieſt accompanies the Children,
whoſe Governour he is, along the Streets,
they will not ſuffer him to go beſides with
them, but will have them follow them, as
their Lackey; and if the Children go to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
ſome other Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> they are call'd
to come up, to the Dining Room, and the
poor Prieſt muſt ſtay below at the Gate with
the Servants. And in truth, they make uſe
of them purely for Foot-Boys; for if they
had no Prieſts to accompany their Children,
they would be oblig'd to keep Foot-Boys, or
ſome Servants or other to do it, and yet they
give them no Salary neither. 'Tis the Prieſt
that coſts them leſs than any other of their
Domeſticks, for he has never a Farthing of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42118:112"/>
and for his Diet, he is fain to take it
with the Servants, and Gondoliers, as was
mention'd before. All the advantage he has,
is this, that they give him leave every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to go and ſay Maſs in ſome Church or
other, and the Mony he gains thereby, is for
himſelf, and ſerves to maintain him in Clothes.
But as much as the Prieſts are kept under, and
undervalu'd in outward Converſe amongſt the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo much are they Honour'd and
Reſpected in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> the
Title of <hi>Cavalier di Chriſto,</hi> Knight of Chriſt,
gives them entrance to, and acceptance with
the beſt of Companies, and amongſt the
greateſt Lords. Not only at the Altar, but
whereſoever they meet them, they account
it, not only Honourable, but Meritorious, to
touch and kiſs their Caſſocks, as thoſe poor
Country Men did, who quitted their Plows,
and came a great way to kiſs our Boots.</p>
            <p>We came to <hi>Mola,</hi> which is a ſmall Town
upon the Sea Shoar, and from whence we
may ſee <hi>Gaeta.</hi> I will not inſiſt here to give
you a Relation of <hi>Cicero's</hi> Gardens, of the
<hi>Via Appia,</hi> or of thoſe other Curioſities which
we meet with in theſe Quarters, and whereof
the World is ſufficiently inform'd, by thoſe
many Books of Travels, that have handled
them on purpoſe, and alſo becauſe it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
nothing to my preſent Deſign. I ſhall
only here preſent you with a pretty odd Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
which preſented it ſelf to our Eyes at
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42118:112"/>
               <hi>Mola.</hi> We ſaw a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldier, who had
a great Purſe in his Hand, and a Prieſt that
followed him, they went from Houſe to
Houſe, and from Shop to Shop. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
accoſted us in a manner, very Cavalier
like, and which ſpoke him to be what he was.
Gentlemen, ſaid he, put ſome pieces of Mony
into my Purſe, that this Knight of Chriſt here
may ſay Maſs. My Companion gave him
ſomewhat a rude Anſwer. How ſo, ſaid he,
do I hinder him from ſaying Maſs? It is not
enough, repli'd the Souldier, that you do not
hinder him, you muſt help and aſſiſt him;
and taking him by his Cloak, he ſaid, aſſure
your ſelf, that I will not let you go, till you
have given me ſomething; ſo that he was fain
to put his Hand into his Pocket and content
him. The Prieſt who was likewiſe a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
kept himſelf always behind the Souldier, with
his great flat Hat upon his Head, and with all
the Gravity of a Prelate, he neither looked
upon, nor Saluted any one, but March'd
along continually muttering in his Breviary:
Which made my Companion, after that he
had put ſome Mony into the Purſe, to ſay,
methinks he might at leaſt thank thoſe, that
give ſomething. But the Souldier, anſwered
for him; What? would you have him to
take notice of Men, whilſt he is ſpeaking to
God? The anſwer I confeſs was excellent for
a Souldier: Tho' indeed it was but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it was nothing but Pride, which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42118:113"/>
put this Prieſt upon ſaying his Office, after
this manner publickly in the Streets, as if he
could not have found any other place or time
for the performance of that Duty. But I
have obſerv'd, that the moſt part of the
Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeldom put themſelves upon
ſaying their Office, but when and where they
may be ſeen. There are ſome of them, who
make themſelves inſupportable, and who to
exempt themſelves from the Duties of Civil
Society, betake themſelves to their Breviary,
when any one ſtands in need of them. One
might well tell them, what an honeſt Man,
who had buſineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſpoke upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of an Eccleſiaſtical Judge, before whom
his Cauſe was to be Pleaded. Every time he
went to ſpeak with him, this Judge, who
had already been Brib'd by his Adverſe Party,
to avoid the Hearing of his Reaſons, took
upon him always to Read his Breviary, when
ever he came to ſpeak with him, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
gave him no other anſwer, but this,
that their Maſter was ſaying his Office: <hi>Dice
al ſuo Officio.</hi> At laſt this Honeſt Man being
weary of hearing continually the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
told them: <hi>Dice l' Officio? quanto
Sarebbe meglio che lo faceſſe. Saith his Office:</hi>
(quoth he?) <hi>How much better would it be
to do it?</hi> In like manner this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prieſt
would, as it ſeems to me have done much
better, either to have taken his time early
in the Morning, to have ſaid his Breviary
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42118:113"/>
or to have deferr'd it to ſome other time more
convenient, that he might have been in a
condition to have thank'd the Perſons, that
beſtow'd their Charity upon him?</p>
            <p>They told us, That the Souldiers in thoſe
Parts did render this kind Office to all poor
Stranger Prieſts, who could not meet with any
that would pay them for their Maſs, to excuſe
them from the trouble of Begging themſelves.
As for the other Prieſts of the Country, they
are ſure to meet with their Pay in their
Churches. Theſe Souldiers ſometimes gather
a great deal more, than is neceſſary for to ſay
a Maſs; but for all that, they very honeſtly
give all to the poor Prieſts, for whom they
have Collected it, without being willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
one Farthing of it for their pains, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that frequently they are a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of miſerable Wretches, that are ready to
ſtarve; in which caſe I have often admired
their extraordinary Piety, in point-blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the common Proverb; <hi>Nulla Fides
Pietaſque viris qui caſtra ſequuntur.</hi> They are
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers who do this, and not the
<hi>Italian,</hi> nor the Natives of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After having refreſh'd our ſelves at <hi>Mola,</hi>
we went to <hi>Caieta,</hi> which lies on one ſide of it,
and from thence went on Foot, to take a view
of the Rock, which they ſay was rent aſunder
at the Death of our Saviour, when the Rocks
were cleft, and the Graves were opened.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42118:114"/>
We aſcended, winding round the Mountain,
which is on the backſide of <hi>Caieta;</hi> and indeed
a part of the City is built upon the Side, of
that height, where it forms a fair Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater.
They have taken care to make the
Way, that leads up to the Cleft of the Rock,
very eaſie; I can't well ſay, whether it was
half a mile, or a quarter of a mile that we
mounted; but we had no reaſon to repent of
the Pains we had taken, for certainly it is one
of the moſt Lovely Places, and greateſt Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
that can be ſeen. This Rock forms a
Cape, which runs out a great way into the Sea,
and is ſplit from the Top to the Bottom by the
midſt, and the two halves of the Rock are
diſtant from each other the length of about a
Perch, or a Perch and an half. Being on the
Top, we ſee the Waves of the Sea that paſs
under the Rock, and beating againſt the Stones
make a dreadful Noiſe. A great Stone being
looſned from the upper part of the Rock, fell
down with that exactneſs, that it ſtuck faſt
between the Cleft in the lowermoſt part of it,
which is pretty near the Water, and it was
found large enough, and firmly fix'd to build
a Chapel upon it. The Papiſts make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of this, and tell us, <hi>That a Holy Hermit,
who dwelt upon this Mountain, and who almoſt
continually meditated upon the Paſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
near to the Cleft of the Rock, pray'd on a
time very earneſtly to God, That it would pleaſe
him ſo to diſpoſe of things, that a Chapel might
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42118:114"/>
be built in this place, which had expreſt ſome kind of
Senſibility at the Sufferings of his Son, our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt; and at the ſame inſtant, by the
Divine Power, this Stone was looſned from its
place, and fell down and fixed it ſelf in the place,
where he had deſired to have a Chapel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have been ſo often
convinc'd of Falſeneſs, in regard of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
they attribute to themſelves, that we have
reaſon to doubt of all thoſe they have a mind
to make us believe. This Stone, and this
Chapel, in the condition they are at preſent,
ſhew nothing that looks Miraculous; both the
one and the other reſt upon very good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
and if a Miracle was wrought in
looſning it from the reſt of the Rock, and
placing it where it is, this is that which is in
queſtion; and as we cannot prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſo neither can they, what they aſſert.
The Matter of certain Truth is only this, That
there is a Chapel there, and a very fair de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
leading to it. If Men feel Devotion,
when they go down thither meditating on the
Paſſion of our Saviour, as a certain Traveller
in the Relation he has given us of his Travels
doth aſſure us, it is the Meditation it ſelf that
will afford and excite that at all times, and in
all places, where it is done with a well-prepared
Heart and Mind. The Chapel is ſpacious
enough, and very neat, and there are Windows
that look out on both ſides, by which one may
take a view of this great Cleft very exactly;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42118:115"/>
and certainly, it is a Sight that frights Nature,
eſpecially when one looks down into the Sea.
Whilſt we were here we ſaw a Sea-Monſter,
which, as it were in a moment, plung'd it
ſelf again into the Sea, not giving me leave to
view it ſo well, as to give you a deſcription of
it. The Popes have granted Indulgences to
thoſe who go and viſit this Place; and at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
times of the Year, more eſpecially in <hi>Lent,</hi>
they come in Pilgrimage thither from all
Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After that we had ſatisfied our Curioſity, we
remounted again by the ſame Steps, and we
went to ſee ſome Hermits, who abide upon
the Mountain, and are Lodged very neatly.
The Gentleman that Travell'd with me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
preſented them with a Paper of</hi> Bononia
<hi>Snuſh-Tobacco, which without doubt is one of
the greateſt Preſents that can be made to</hi> Italians;
<hi>they Invited us to ſtay and Dine with them, and
ſeeing that they were well provided with Fleſh
and Fiſh, we accepted the Invitation. They
told us,</hi> That tho' they were poor, and lived only
upon Alms, yet, bleſſed be God, they wanted nothing.
<hi>There was one of theſe Hermits that was a
Prieſt, and who went every day to ſay Maſs
in the Miraculous Chapel. Thoſe of them
that are Prieſts, they call</hi> Fathers, <hi>and thoſe
that are not,</hi> Brothers. <hi>The Father Hermit kept
Company with us, to entertain us with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
whilſt the Brothers gave Order about
Dinner. He told us,</hi> That he had not been an
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42118:115"/>
Hermit above Three years, and that he was a
Secular Prieſt before he turn'd Hermit: That the
Hermit, his Predeceſſor died very Aged, and with
an odour of Sanctity; but that about a year after
his Death, they had found a great deal of Silver
hid in an Old Pallet-Bed, on which he lay, tho'
it was not permitted to them to poſſeſs one Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and that this had much leſſened the good
Opinion they had conceived of him, neither was it
known how poſſibly he could gather all that Mony.
<hi>This Hermit entertain'd us with good and
witty Diſcourſe, and had ſeen the World in
his time. He had Travell'd in</hi> France <hi>and</hi>
Germany, <hi>before that he was an Hermit. He
ſeem'd to be of a plain, open, and free Spirit,
and quite different from the ordinary Temper
of the Monks and</hi> Frati <hi>of</hi> Italy; <hi>whence the</hi>
Capucins <hi>alſo had taken occaſion to Accuſe him
before the Biſhop of</hi> Caieta, <hi>that he was not of
an Hermetick Spirit, with intent of thruſting
him out of that Place, and putting in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but fail'd of their deſign. I formerly
was not unacquainted of the</hi> Capucins, <hi>being
irreconcilable Enemies to the</hi> Hermits, <hi>becauſe
of the reſemblance of their Habits, and of
their ſame way of Subſiſtence, which is Alms;</hi>
Figulus odit Figulum; Two of a Trade ſeldom
love one another. <hi>But this Hermit, it ſeems,
had kept his Station in ſpite of all their Efforts,
and had ſo far gain'd the Spirit of the Poor by
his Alms, of the Common People by his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity,
and that of the Great Ones by his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42118:116"/>
unaffected Air, and pleaſant Comportment,
that they deſpair'd of ever gaining their End
upon him. He told me,</hi> That they gave Meat
every Day to above Forty poor People. <hi>I deſired
him to tell me, how it was poſſible for them to
do ſo, ſince they liv'd upon nothing but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
themſelves? He reply'd,</hi> That they had
mnch more bestowed upon them than they could
ſpend; that every Morning they had two Aſſes ſent
to them loaden with Proviſions, and that beſides
this, he went every Evening to demand a Charity
at all the Gentlemens Houſes where he was known;
that when he came there, they led him into their
Cellars where their beſt Wine was, and afterwards
into their Butteries, ſaying to him, <hi>Hermit, if there
be any thing here you like, pray take what
pleaſeth you beſt.</hi> Here it is <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> that I and my
Companion do fill our Knapſacks. When we have a
mind to have ſome Fiſh, we go in the Evening to the
Haven where the Fiſher-Boats come, and they give
us abundantly, and that too which is very good, as
you will find by what you ſhall have for your
Dinner. But on the other hand, alſo theſe Perſons
ſome time or other return the Viſit to us, and we
entertain them with the Beſt that we have. We
are not at all Covetous of that which cost us
nothing, and indeed this is the way for us to have
ſtill more; for, by this means, theſe Perſons do not
know how to make us good Chear enough when
we come to them again. The <hi>Capucins (ſaid he)</hi>
do not take this method, they are inſatiable, and
have a Temporal Father (as they call him) to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42118:116"/>
whom they ſend the Surplus of their Alms, and who
turns it into Mony, to Buy for them whatſoever
they deſire. They touch no Mony, nor buy any
thing; but he toucheth it, and buys it for them.
If they give ſome bits of Bread to the Poor at
their Gate, they are only ſome Scraps of the
Browneſt, which they could not ſell. But as for us,
we beſtow upon them indifferently of all we have;
this is that which hath procur'd us the Affection
of the Poor, and to that degree, that they would
certainly ſacrifice their Lives for us, rather than
to ſuffer the Hermitage to be taken out of our
hands.</p>
            <p>This good Hermit, after having diſcours'd
thus a good while againſt the <hi>Capucins,</hi> order'd
Dinner to be brought up, which indeed was
Order'd and Dreſt very handſomly, tho' in
Wooden Diſhes. My Companion would eat
no Pottage, becauſe they had no other, but
Wooden Spoons. This made the Hermits to
laugh heartily. They asked one another, where
they might get a Silver Spoon for this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
This was a young Prieſt, who never
had Travell'd, and who had always been
brought up in his Father's Houſe: But at laſt,
ſeeing that the Pulſe look'd very well, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
to taſte of them, and finding them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
well dreſt and ſeaſon'd, <hi>Well,</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>I don't matter a Spoon now, I ſhall make a ſhift
good enough, to eat them with my Fingers.</hi> The
<hi>Hermits</hi> and <hi>Capucins</hi> have the gift of Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Meat perfectly well, and it ſeems, as if
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42118:117"/>
they made it part of their Study: Neither
would I have any one to take an eſtimate of
their Mortification by their Wooden Spoons,
but by that which is in them. The Father
Hermit drank to us in moſt excellent Wine,
tho' out of a Wooden Cup: And for his part,
was not ſlack to encourage us to eat and drink
by his good Example. <hi>I am no Hypocrite</hi> (ſaid
he) <hi>as many Hermits are. When one comes to
Viſit them, they will tell you, They have not eat of
Four days, and that they are yet Fasting: For my
part, to tell you Truth, I eat but Four times a day,
and do not think, that Holineſs conſiſts in not Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but in Eating well, (that is, with giving
Thanks) except only on Fast-Days, enjoyned by the
Holy Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſeeing that our Father Hermit was in a
good humour, deſired him to tell me his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning the Miraculous Chapel.</hi>
Alas, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I was not there when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
was done; but if God was pleaſed to work
one for the Founding of it, we have need he ſhould
work another now, for the preſerving of it; for
ever and anon Stones fall down from the Rock,
and much endamage the Roof of it; ſo that all
the Mony of the Pilgrims is ſcarcely ſufficient to
Repair it continually: But as for the Miracles
which are wrought in the Chapel, tho' they ſay
that a great many happen there every Day, we
never ſaw ſo much as One only. Yea, what is
more yet, about Thirty or Forty Miles from hence,
you ſhall hear them talk of Miracles, which they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42118:117"/>
ſay have been wrought here, that we our ſelves
never heard of before. I ſuppoſe them to be ſome
Beggars, who paſs this way, and who go after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
into the Villages, and report there, that
they have been miraculouſly healed of their Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
to induce People to give more liberal Alms
to them. <hi>This Hermit expreſt a great Air of
ſincerity in all that he ſaid, which gave me
indeed a great eſteem for his Perſon; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others of his Coat, are ſo far from owning
any ſuch thing, that they would rather have
been of the Humour to exaggerate all ſuch
Reports, and been ready to invent a thouſand
Falſities to raiſe the Credit of the place of
their Devotion. After Dinner the Hermit
had no leiſure to Diſcourſe us any longer, by
reaſon of the great Numbers of Poor, that
waited at the Gate for his Charity. We
therefore took our leaves of him, after that
we had thanked him for his Civility and
his good Dinner, and ſo return'd to</hi> Cajeta.</p>
            <p>Seeing that an occaſion has been here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
me to ſpeak of theſe Hermits, and
that this hath brought to my remembrance
many things I have obſerv'd in <hi>Italy</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this kind of Life, as well as thoſe that
profeſs it; I ſhall continue to entertain you
therewith ſome longer time. I was aſtoniſh'd
to ſee that the Eremitick State, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
was ſo Flouriſhing in <hi>Italy,</hi> as may be
ſeen, by ſo many antient Foundations, and
Places, which are ſtill at this day call'd Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitages,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42118:118"/>
(tho' no Hermites live in them) are
now fallen into ſo great Decadence, that
ſcarcely are there ſome few of them to be
found here and there. In S. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s time,
<hi>Italy</hi> was full of Hermitages, and he himſelf
profeſt an Hermetick Life, before the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick.
At that time there were Men of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Piety, who retir'd into Hermita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to have the better opportunity, by being
ſeparated from the World, of applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
more entirely to Study and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation;
whereas the preſent Hermites are no
other, but a company of miſerable Wretches,
of the Sink of the common People, who
have neither Learning nor Parts, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the greater part lead a very diſorderly and
ſcandalous Life. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe
the Monks, being in proceſs of time become
very Powerful, have poſſeſt themſelves of all
the beſt Hermitages, that were endow'd with
ſtanding Revenues, and made Priories of them,
which they Incorporated with their Abbeys;
and the Mendicant Orders gleaning after
them, took Poſſeſſion of well nigh all thoſe
which were near to Cities, or great Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,
and there built their Convents: So
that there are none remaining now, but ſome
in Solitary and far diſtant Places, and a very
few, that are near to Cities. The Hermites
that are the Inhabitants of theſe latter Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitages,
have enough to do, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the <hi>Capucins</hi> and other <hi>Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:42118:118"/>
who endeavour to ſupplant, or at leaſt
to decry them, and bring them into Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
Thoſe who live in ſolitary and far
diſtant Places are much ſuſpected, becauſe
there have been frequently found amongſt
them ſome that were the greateſt Villains
imaginable, who Murther'd all thoſe that
came to Viſit their Hermitages, and Robb'd
upon the High-way. This is the reaſon why
Honeſt Men do not care to make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
in any of thoſe Places. Wherefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they are none but poor Men, that
make themſelves Hermites, in hopes, that in
favour of that Habit, they may find a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
from the Liberality of ſome of the
good Country Folks, if they can but once
get the knack of dexterouſly Playing the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here relate to you a deceit that I
my ſelf diſcover'd, of two <hi>French</hi> Hermites,
who lived on one of the Hermitages, which
are on the Mountain call'd S. <hi>Sylvester,</hi> about
a days Journy from <hi>Rome,</hi> but by another
Name, Mount <hi>Soracte.</hi> I was gon from
<hi>Rome</hi> with an intent to take a View of the
Country, which they call <hi>la Sabine,</hi> which is
not above three or four days Journy from
thence, being Famous for having once been
the abode of the ancient <hi>Sabini,</hi> who ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
themſelves by ſo many brave Exploits
againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> I took up my Lodging,
the firſt Night, in a Village, which is near to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42118:119"/>
the Mount S. <hi>Sylvester,</hi> and the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the curioſity took me to endeavour to
get up to it. They told me, there was but
one only Path-way to get up to it, which was
on the other ſide of the Mountain, ſo that
I had a great way to go about to get thither:
Wherefore viewing well the Top of the
Mountain, it appear'd to me, that I might
very well ſave my ſelf the trouble of going
that great way about, in mounting by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
paſſage, which ſeem'd to me as if it had
been a troden Path, and the Stones that were
above it, appear'd to me like Steps, by which
one might get up to the Top. Wherefore
without any further conſideration, I put my
ſelf forward to make an aſſault upon this
high Mountain. I ſcarcely was got up the
one half of this way, but I found I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
miſtaken in my account, and that
thoſe Stones which had appear'd to me ſo
little, and by which it ſeem'd I might eaſily
gain the Top of the Mountain, were indeed
no other than great Rocks heap'd upon one
another, which made the Top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in acceſſible. However, I continu'd ſtill
to aſcend, rather for my Recreation, and to
ſee how far I could get, than in any hopes of
compaſſing my firſt deſign, the execution
whereof did then ſeem to me impoſſible. I
mounted, I clambred, I crept, into the Clefts
of the Rocks, and by the help of certain Roots
of Trees, I raiſed my ſelf up to ſome great
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42118:119"/>
Rocks, whence I perceiv'd that I was come
near to the Top. This added new Spirits to
me, and ſo much the more Courage, becauſe
I ſaw there would be more danger, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to get down again, to the place
from whence I was mounted, than to get up
to the very Top. Accordingly I proſecuted
my intent, and being come up higher, I was
extreamly aſtoniſh'd, to find amongſt the
Stones, great Pieces of brown Bread, and in
very great quantity, ſome of them being
Mouldy and quite Rotten, and others yet
very freſh.</p>
            <p>At laſt after ſome new and laſt Efforts,
which I would not now begin again, I found
my ſelf all on a ſuddain in a very fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
which was Enclos'd on all ſides with
very high Walls, except only on that ſide
where it was thought in acceſſible. This was
the Garden belonging to one of the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
and I deſcri'd in it two Hermits,
who were taking their Recreation in a Bower,
ſhaded with pleaſant Green-Trees. Theſe
Hermits were ſorely affrighted at me, and
taking me for ſome Ghoſt, betook themſelves
to their Heels, and being got into their Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage,
they Barricado'd it againſt me. I was
quite ſpent with the extream pains I had taken,
out of Breath, and in a great Sweat; ſo I
went to reſt my ſelf in the Bower they had
left, to ſee whether I could retrieve my Spirits
again. I found here, the remains of a great
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42118:120"/>
Paſty, and of a large Bottle of Wine; and
upon a Bench, on the other ſide of me a Fan
and a Coiff. The Hermites at laſt being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
a little of their Fright, ventur'd again
into the Garden, and came to accoſt me.
They were aſtoniſh'd to hear, that I had made
a ſhift to get up by the Rocks. I ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
them to be <hi>French</hi> Men, and they told
me, that it was about two years, ſince they
had begun to live in that Hermitage: I ſpoke
to them concerning the Pieces of brown Bread
that I had found, and I took notice that this
brought a freſh Colour into their Faces; and
foraſmuch as they perceiv'd that I had taken
notice of the Gloves, Coif, and Fan, that
were left in the Bower, one of them took the
Word, and told me, <hi>Sir, as you are a</hi> French-<hi>Man,
we hope that you will have the goodneſs,
not to do us any Prejudice. We will hide nothing
from you, but ſincerely Confeſs that it is we, that
have thrown away theſe bits of Bread, in the
place where you met with them; for we never
had the deſign of being good Hermites; we have
always been Souldiers by Profeſſion, before that
we took this Habit upon us. It was a</hi> French
<hi>Hermit, a great Runner of the Countries, and who
made a ſhift to live very well in</hi> Italy, <hi>that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
us to do as much, and to follow the ſame
Courſe, and procured the Habit of Hermits for us
at</hi> Rome: <hi>and having ſome time after found
this Hermitage Vacant, we retired thither, and
we have lived here, as other Hermits do, on the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42118:120"/>
Alms we beg in the Neighbouring Villages. We at
first refuſed to change our brown Bread for other
Neceſſaries, amongſt the poor Peaſants; but when
this came to the knowledge of many Perſons, it
was a great prejudice to us, in our Queſts, and
they began to reproach us for dainty Perſons, that
could eat no Brown Bread; wherefore we now
rather chuſe to caſt it to the Crows, than either to
ſell or give it away. And thus much for the Pieces
of Bread you met with. But ſeeing you have caſt
your Eyes upon ſome Female Ornaments, that are
left here with us, we ſhall tell you the Myſtery
of them alſo, in order to deſire you, to give us
your Advice, in a buſineſs that extreamly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me and my Companion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Hermitage which is joyned to ours,
there lives an <hi>Italian</hi> Hermit of a very bad
Life, tho' he be not known for ſuch. He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
a Roman Gentlewoman, whom he has
kept with him, for ſome Months; and ſeeing he
had no proſpect of keeping her with him long, but
that we must diſcover, becauſe we have ſome
Windows that look out, towards his Hermitage,
and that we go daily to Viſit him, with a great
deal of Freedom; he rather choſe to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Matter to us, than to endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it. He hath made a hole in the Wall of our
Garden, by which his Lady, in caſe of ſudden
Surprize, or of any one coming to Viſit him, might
retire her ſelf into our Hermitage. For the reſt,
we have nothing but the ſight of her; for he is
ſo extreamly Jealous, that he keeps her all the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42118:121"/>
day ſhut up in a Hole, that differs nothing from
a Priſon; and when at any time he brings her to
take a Walk, he continues all the while with her.
And it ſeems ſhe does not think much of it neither,
for ſhe loves him extreamly. 'Tis ſhe that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
all manner of Expences; for ſhe hath
brought abundance of Gold and Silver along with
her from <hi>Rome.</hi> And to ſpeak the Truth, we
have found our ſelves very well, ſince the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
has Diſcover'd all to us; for there is not a
day paſſeth over our Heads, in which we do not
receive ſome Preſent or other from them. He
came and gave us a Viſit this Morning, with his
Lady, and they brought with them the Paſty and
Bottle you have ſeen; it is not much above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour ſince they are gone, and it ſeems
the Gentlewoman forgot to take her Fan and Gloves
with her. It was great good luck for you Sir,
that you did not come whilſt he was here, for he
would certainly have kill'd you, for fear of being
Diſcovered. He carries always a great Dagger
under his Gown, to make uſe of it upon occaſion:
Neither would we adviſe you, to ſtay here any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time, for ſhould he return hither, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he does, and as in all likelyhood he will, to
fetch the things his Lady has left behind her, you
would be in great Danger. We only deſire you
would be pleaſed to aſſiſt us with your Counſel,
how we might beſt diſcover this, without doing
our ſelves a Miſchief. I told them that the
most ſafe, and ſhort way was to acquaint the
Cardinal Vicar, and that they needed not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42118:121"/>
themſelves any further: And that as for my part,
I knew not, whether I ſhould return to <hi>Rome</hi> or
no. They told me that this Hermit was ſo cunning,
that now for ſome time they had not durst ſo much
as to take one ſtep towards <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo narrowly
did he watch them.</p>
            <p>I had been told, that there was a very fair
Abby of <hi>Bernardines</hi> upon the ſame Mountain,
and therefore I asked the Hermits, why they
did not diſcover the matter to the Abbot; but
they repli'd, that they knew they would not
be welcome there with ſuch a Story, becauſe all
the Monks there led a very diſſolute Life, and
had all of them their Miſtreſſes, as well as the
Hermit. Moreover they told me, that they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the Hermit to be a Sorcerer, which
made them the more fearful, to make the leaſt
ſtep towards the diſcovering of him. That
they were of opinion alſo, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd
this Gentlewoman, becauſe that tho'
he had no conſiderable Qualities, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
very deform'd in Body, with a great
ſlovenly Beard, a ſtinking Breath, and rotten
Teeth, yet that ſhe had always loved him
Paſſionately, from the time that ſhe had firſt
receiv'd one of his Letters, wherein was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
a Piece of white-Wax, like unto an
<hi>Agnus Dei.</hi> That they had alſo frequently
had cauſe to admire his knowledge of many
ſecret things, that had hapned at very far
diſtant Places, all which gave them great ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,
that he had to do with the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:42118:122"/>
They were about to tell me more of him;
but the fear into which they had put me,
leſt this Venerable Hermit might return to
give me a Viſit, made me, after that in a few
words I had exhorted them not to follow ſuch
wicked Examples, and to have the Fear of
God before their Eyes, to take my leave of
them, deſiring them to ſhew me the way to the
Abby of the Fathers, where I intended to go
and ſay Maſs, having made a Vow to do ſo,
at the Altar of S. <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> when in clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the Rocks, I found my ſelf in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of my Life. This was alſo the reaſon
why I refus'd to Eat or Drink with theſe Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
becauſe no Man may ſay Maſs except
he be Faſting. So I went a little higher up
the Mountain, by a very pleaſant way, and
I Arriv'd at the Abby, juſt at Dinner time.
I had much ado to get the Church Door
open'd for me, in order to acquit my ſelf of
my Vow. After I had ſaid Maſs, I deſir'd
them to let me ſee the Monaſtery; but they
made great difficulty alſo to grant me this
Requeſt; becauſe the Monks, according to the
Cuſtom of <hi>Italy,</hi> were almoſt all of them gone
to take their reſt. However at laſt one of the
Monks, by order of the Prior, led me into
a ſmall Garden, which he told me was the
place, whither S. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> retir'd himſelf, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Perſecution, which afflicted the
Church in his time, and that there he wrought
that great Miracle, whereof mention is made
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42118:122"/>
in his Life time, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Men being come to look for him, the
Saint had a deſire to entertain them; but
having nothing wherewith, he ſent a Deacon
that ſerv'd him, to Sow ſome Carots in the
Garden; and having about an Hour after or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
ſome of them to be taken up for Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
his Men went in a way of Mockery and
Deriſion to him, but were extreamly ſurpriz'd,
when being come at the place where the Carot
Seed had been Sow'd, they found very fair
and large Carots, of an admirable good taſte,
and which ſerv'd for a Dinner to his Gueſts.
The Monk told me, that this Miracle had
in ſome ſort been continu'd ever ſince; for
that the Carots, that were Sown in that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
retain an extraordinary pleaſant taſte.
Upon his telling of me ſo, I made bold, to
pluck up one of them out of the Ground, and
having ſcrap'd it with my Knife, I taſted of
it, by way of Devotion; but found it of a very
flat taſte: I threw it away; Hold Sir, ſaid the
Religious, they are not to be Eaten ſo, they
muſt be Boyl'd, and dreſt with good Oil, or
good Butter, and good Spices. We have a
Cook that knows how to dreſs them admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
well. You put ſo many good things
to them, my good Father, ſaid I, ſmiling, that
at laſt you make them, if not miraculouſly,
at leaſt admirably good. This Religious, after
having ſhew'd me the Garden only, had the
Civility, according to the Order he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42118:123"/>
to lead me to a Chamber where I was
to Dine: They brought me a Diſh with Fiſh,
and another with ſome of thoſe Holy Roots,
which indeed were extreamly well dreſt.</p>
            <p>After Dinner I apply'd my ſelf to take a
view of the Top of Mount <hi>Soraéle,</hi> from
whence certainly there is the beſt Proſpect
that can be, the whole Country about <hi>Rome</hi>
lying open to it, together with that Proud
City, in its whole extent. This Mountain
ſtands ſingle, and is not joyned to any other,
having on all ſides of it moſt rich and fertil
Plains, that ſurround it, and being very
high and ſteep on all ſides with great white
Rocks, one would take it, at a diſtance, for
ſome very high Steeple, having its Top in the
Clouds; and more eſpecially in the Winter
time, when the Snow covers ſome little Shrubs
of Trees, which have their Roots in the Rocks,
whereof <hi>Horace</hi> makes mention in one of his
Odes;
<q>
                  <l>Cernis ut altâ ſtet Nive candidum</l>
                  <l>Soracte—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I came down the Mountain by a much
more pleaſant and eaſie Way, than that by
which I went up to it. In my way I met
with the Old Hermit, of whom I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before, who return'd from ſaying Maſs
in a Village at the Foot of the Mountain.
He enquir'd of me, Whether I had been to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42118:123"/>
Viſit the Hermitages, or the Abby? I told
him, that I came from the Holy Places, which
S. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> had ſanctified by his Retirement.
<hi>God be praiſed for it, Sir,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>it is very well
done of you. This is the good Pattern which the
other Hermits of this Mountain, and I my ſelf, have
propounded to our ſelves to imitate; and, to ſpeak
truth, he pours forth abundance of Graces upon
thoſe who are devoted to him, and put their Truſt
in him. It is now One and Twenty years, I have
had the Honour of wearing the Sacred Habit you
ſee upon me; and the further I proceed, the more
pleaſure and ſatisfaction do I find in the Ways of
the Lord.</hi> To hear him Talk, one would have
taken him for another S. <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who
was the firſt Hermit. But for all his fine Talk,
I took care to keep my ſelf at a certain
diſtance from him, that his great Dagger
might not reach me, in caſe he had gon about
to make uſe of it. But at laſt, he bid me Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
wiſhing me a Thouſand Bleſſings. He
held a great <hi>Bead-row,</hi> or <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> of Wood
in his Hand, the Beads whereof were as big
as a Nut, and he had a Croſs faſtned to his
Girdle, with many great Medals, which made
a great Noiſe as he went, by ſtriking one
againſt the other; he leaned upon his Staff,
and in all points acted the Hypocrit to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:42118:124"/>
The Eremitical Habit is of a brown Tawny
Colour, conſiſting of a ſhort Tunicle, reaching
a little lower than the mid-Leg; they have a
great Cowl upon their Head of a Pyramidal
Figure, and a little Mantle about their Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
not much unlike to that of the <hi>Capucins.</hi>
Theſe kind of Antick Habits ſeem to have
been contriv'd for no other end, but to make
terrible impreſſions on the Senſes, the better
to diſpoſe the Minds of Men to conceive a
great eſteem and veneration for thoſe that wear
them. He that ſhould go about to vilifie or
undervalue this external Garb in the preſence
of a Papiſt, had almoſt as good profane what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is moſt Holy in his Religion; as if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
there could be no wicked Men in the
garb of Satyrs. I met with my two <hi>French</hi>
Hermits ſome time after at <hi>Venice;</hi> who told
me, <hi>They had accuſed the Old Hermit, but he
having very dexterouſly ſlipt away his Lady, denied
all, and made theſe Poor Men to paſs for Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers;
to that degree had he Charmed the People
by his Hypocriſie. Whereupon they had been forced
to quit their Hermitages, and were then going for</hi>
Hungary, <hi>to take upon them the Habit of Souldiers,
which</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>was every whit as Holy, as that
of a Hermit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſince this, in my Travels, ſeen many
fair Hermitages, more particularly on the
<hi>Apennine,</hi> which are thoſe Mountains that
divide all <hi>Italy</hi> in the length of it. I have
had occaſion to paſs and repaſs them ſeveral
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42118:124"/>
times, in various parts of them, where are to
be ſeen wonderful places in the Woods, and
upon the very points of Rocks, which they
told me were Hermitages. But ſince the time
I knew, that the moſt of thoſe that dwelt in
them were only a Company of baſe Fellows,
I took care not to Viſit them. Many of theſe
wretched Hermits have been publickly Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
from time to time, for committing the
moſt enormous Crimes. There was one of
them taken at <hi>Venice,</hi> who confeſſed at his
Death, that he had killed above Threeſcore
Perſons, as well Men as Women. He had his
Hermitage between <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Buran,</hi> in a
little Iſland of about Two hundred Paces in
Circuit, where is ſtill to be ſeen the Ruins of
his Hermitage, which they demoliſhed. This
wretched Perſon went by Night to Sea in a
Diſguiſe, and Masked, accompanied with three
or four Robbers, to whom his Hermitage
ſerv'd for a Retreat: They went and ſtopt the
<hi>Gondola's</hi> or ſmall Boats that paſt through the
Channels, and murther'd thoſe that refuſed to
ſurrender their Purſes. There had been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
abroad, for a conſiderable time, of great
Robberies and Murthers, that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
about this Hermitage; but who could
ever have believ'd, that a Perſon wearing ſo
holy a Habit, and ſo venerable a Beard, had
been the Head and Captain of theſe Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers?
He was at laſt diſcovered by the
Sons of a Rich Merchant of <hi>Venice;</hi> their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42118:125"/>
Father, who took pleaſure in the Company of
ſuch kind of Hypocrits, went one day out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to Viſit this Hermit, and had acquainted
his Wife and Sons with his intent. He carried
along with him ſome very good Proviſions, to
Preſent him with; but this Impious Wretch
being not ſatisfied with that, after he had got
him to enter into his Cell, took him by the
Throat and ſtrangled him. His Children being
aſtoniſhed at their Fathers ſtaying ſo long,
went with a great many of their Friends to
look for him, and entring into the Hermitage,
they found their Fathers Shoes under the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit's
Bed; whereupon they immediately ſeized
him, and having found the reſt of his Cloaths
in an Old Cupboard, the Hermit at laſt ſhewed
them the place where he had caſt his Body; it
was a great Hole, which formerly had ſerv'd
for a Ciſtern, where they found the Bodies of
above Threeſcore Perſons, that had been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to the Fury and Avarice of this Infernal
Monſter. There is alſo great Talk in the
Country of <hi>Ancona</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> of an Hermit, who
robb'd and murther'd the Pilgrims going to
<hi>Loretto;</hi> and of another between <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nonia</hi> and
<hi>Florence,</hi> that was no better than a Highway
Robber. Theſe kind of Stories coming freſh
to my mind, whenever in my Travels I met
with any Hermits or Hermitages, hinder'd me
from being over-curious to Viſit them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:42118:125"/>
I could not ſufficiently lament (according
to the Principles in which I had been Educated)
that a State, which heretofore had been ſo
flouriſhing in the Church of God, and ſo
fruitful of Saints, was at laſt degenerated to
that degree, that the Hermitages were become
little elſe, but the Dens of Robbers and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.
In former times Learned Men were
ſeen to retire to theſe places, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more uninterruptedly to their Studies,
leading moſt vertuous and holy Lives; but at
preſent that Mode is quite out of date, and
a Man of Wit and Learning would be laugh'd
at, ſhould he think of entring into this kind
of Life. But the Monaſteries, on the other
hand are in more Credit and Repute than ever,
notwithſtanding that the Eremitick Life hath
indeed been the Mother of the Monaſtick;
the firſt Monks have been nothing elſe but
Hermits, who joyned themſelves together to
live in Common, and with this reſpect we ſay,
that <hi>Filia ſuffocavit Matrem; the Daughter hath
devoured the Mother.</hi> The Reaſon whereof may
eaſily be given: This Change did not happen
till after the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was mounted to
that pitch of Pomp and Pride, where we find
her at preſent. The Head and chief Members
that govern it, have affected to make ſhew of
the moſt magnificent and luxurious Court,
that it may be is in the whole World. Now
ſuch a Court as this cannot but ſtand in need
of great Incoms; and for the poor Hermits,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42118:126"/>
they were the leaſt able to contribute any
thing towards it; this is the very Reaſon for
which they have neglected and almoſt quite
aboliſh'd them, to make the more way for the
Monks, who have well-lin'd Purſes, and who
are oblig'd from time to time, to Pay in prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Sums of Mony to the Apoſtolical Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>They are the Biſhops who confer the Habit
upon Hermits within their Dioceſs; but at
preſent there are many Biſhops that refuſe to
admit any, and chuſe rather to leave the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitages
vacant. The moſt part of theſe Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
underſtand no Latin, and ſome of them
can neither Write nor Read. How would you
have theſe Men ſpend their time in this Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?
They become ſoon weary of it; and
then turn Vagabond-Hermits, that run up and
down the Country. They undertake every
Year to Viſit the Holy Places; that is to ſay,
to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Loretto,</hi> to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi>
to S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Bar,</hi> to <hi>Mount Gargan, &amp;c.</hi>
After that they have finiſhed their Round,
either they begin it anew, or they go and
ſpend the two or three remaining Winter
Months in their Hermitages. At their Return,
the good People of the Country receive them
very gladly, becauſe they come ordinarily well
loaden with <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> and <hi>Relicks,</hi> which
they diſtribute amongſt them, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a readineſs ſome pleaſant Story or other
to tell them. Beſides, the Monks think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42118:126"/>
themſelves, to ſpeak to poor People;
whereas the Hermits make themſelves familiar
with them. But a Man muſt have an Eye to
their Fingers, for they are very dextrous at
Pilfering whatſoever they can lay their Hands
upon, which afterwards they ſell for Mony,
or make a Change of it in their Inns, for
good Lodging and Entertainment.</p>
            <p>I hapned to be on a time at an Inn, where
ſome Hermits offered to ſell Children Clouts and
Swadling-Bands, and deſired only to have a
good Dinner in lieu of them. The Hoſteſs
asked them, What way they had come by
them? adding, That ſhe was aſtoniſh'd to ſee
them have ſuch Gear to ſell, and that ſhe was
afraid they had ſtolen them. The Hermits
proteſted before God, they had not, but that a
Country-woman, whoſe Child was Dead, had
given 'em them. Whilſt they were in this
Conteſt, the Woman of whom they had
ſtolen them, came to the Inn, whom the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no ſooner ſaw, but they betook themſelves
to their Heels, leaving the Clouts and Swadling-Bands
behind them. The Woman told us, That
whilſt one of theſe Hermits was telling a Story,
of an Apparition of the Souls in Purgatory,
the other went forth into the Court, and took
away her Childs Clouts, which ſhe had hung up
there to dry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:42118:127"/>
Notwithſtanding the Heremetick State be ſo
extreamly corrupted and degenerated, yet the
Papiſts do not leave valuing themſelves much
upon this account, and making a great matter
of Honour of it to themſelves againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
who (ſay they) have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
profeſt Enemies to all theſe Holy States,
which, as they pretend, were the greateſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of the Churches of the firſt Ages;
and in imitation of the Life which <hi>Elias</hi> and
other of the Prophets did lead in the Deſerts,
which S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> profeſſed, and our
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſanctified, by his
ſo frequent retirings into Solitude; and of
that Life, in a word, which the firſt Doctors
and Fathers of the Church, as <hi>Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,
&amp;c.</hi> have ſo highly cheriſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended:
To be even with them in this, I would
demand of them, what they themſelves make
of it? Who they are amongſt them, that
make profeſſion of this Excellent Life? What
Fruit it produceth? and whether it were not
much better, conſidering all the Diſorders that
have hapned by this means, and do ſtill daily
happen before their Eyes, wholly to cut off
from the Boſom of the Church, a ſort of
Men who are become the Scandal of it, and
who having voluntarily plunged themſelves
into <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> which is the Mother of all Vices,
have, in fine, renounced all Vertues, whether
Civil, Moral, or Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:42118:127"/>
Having thus given you ſome Account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Hermits,</hi> I cannot well avoid giving
you a Relation of ſome very conſiderable
Places, which formerly have been the Retreats
of Solitudinarians, and are now the Abode of
Monks. And foraſmuch as I am here Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> I ſhall
begin with that of <hi>Sublac,</hi> which was the place
S. <hi>Bennet</hi> choſe for his Retreat, when he was as
yet but a young Child.</p>
            <p>In another Journy I made to <hi>Naples,</hi> finding
my ſelf near this place, ſome advantageous
Accounts I had receiv'd concerning it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
me to go and Viſit it. I firſt Arrived
at the Burrough of <hi>Sublac,</hi> where the Monks
of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> have both Temporal and Spiritual
Juriſdiction. There is an Abby of Nuns of
the ſame Order; and a League further in the
ſame Valley, but in a part of it that is Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,
there is a very Fair Abby of Monks,
who are very Civil to Strangers, eſpecially to
thoſe who come with an intent of Viſiting
the Grotto of their Patriarch S. <hi>Bennet.</hi> I
met here with a Father, who was a <hi>French</hi>
Man by Nation, and to whom my Relations
in <hi>France</hi> were not unknown, who was the
cauſe of ſtaying me here a whole Day; and
he himſelf led me to the Grotto of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi>
which is about a quarter of a League further,
in the Narroweſt part of the ſaid Valley.
The Mountains on both ſides are very ſteep,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42118:128"/>
and the Brook that runs between them takes
up well nigh the whole Space of the Valley.
However theſe Fathers have made a ſhift to
find place enough to Build here a Monaſtery
all in length, which can contain Fifty or
Threeſcore Monks, and yet it ſerves but for a
Lodging to Ten only, whom they call <hi>Hermits,</hi>
tho' indeed they be only ſo by Name, becauſe
they live in a Community, and becauſe they
only ſtay there for the ſpace of Two Months;
after which they ſend Ten others thither, out
of the Neighbouring Monaſtery, to relieve
them. Thus they ſucceed by Turns to one
another. The only difference there is in their
Obſervance is this, That thoſe of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
where the Grotto of the Saint is, do eat
no Fleſh-Meat; and in the other (as throughout
all the Order in <hi>Italy)</hi> they eat Meat Four
times a Week, notwithſtanding that the uſe
of it be forbid them by the Rules of their
Inſtitution, which they have Vow'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.
They ſay, It is out of the Reſpect they
have to theſe Rules, that their Abbots have
order'd, That no Fleſh ſhould be eaten in this
Little Monaſtery, no more than in their Great
One of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt Caſſin,</hi> that it might be true at
leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Rule of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> was obſerv'd
in Two of their Monaſteries; which, as they
believe, is ſufficient to quiet their Conſciences
as to this matter. The Fathers pretend, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
That the Bodies of Men are much
changed in their Conſtitution ſince the time
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42118:128"/>
of their Legiſlator; and that they are not ſo
ſtrong, nor conſequently ſo able to undergo
ſuch Rigid Obſervances; and indeed they
Treat all their other Rules much in the ſame
manner, and content themſelves with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of them by Turns, or by Halves.</p>
            <p>In this Little Monaſtery, they ſhewed me
the Grotto of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> upon which they
have built an Altar; and we ſee there alſo a
moſt curious Statue of white Marble, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
this Saint, very young, and upon his
Knees, with a Countenance very humble and
penitent. The Habit wherewith he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
ſerves to condemn that which the
<hi>Benedictins</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> do wear at preſent; they
have ſo amplified and pleated it, for to make
it ſhew fine and magnificent, that it is no
more to be known to be a Copy from this
Original. The Father <hi>Benedictins</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of S. <hi>Maurus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> have taken
the form of their Habit from this Figure, and
retain the ſame to this Day, as believing it
with Reaſon, to be the true Pattern. After we
had ſaid our Prayers in this Little Chapel,
they led me to a little Garden, and they bade
me take notice of a huge Stone at the Top
of the Rock; they wiſhed me to obſerve it
very well, as being no leſs than a perpetual
Miracle, which demonſtrated the viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
God afforded to that Holy Place, and
to thoſe that dwelt there. This Stone, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Talk, was quit looſned from the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42118:129"/>
Rock, and ſuſpended in the Air, by the alone
Divine Power, God not ſuffering it to fall
down, becauſe, if it ſhould, it could not fail
of utterly deſtroying the Grotto, and the
whole Monaſtery. I told them, after that I
had viewed it very narrowly, that I ſaw it ſo
well faſtned to the Rock, that in my thoughts
it would be a Miracle indeed if it ſhould fall,
and that they ought not to pretend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to thoſe that had good Eyes. I ſaw
well enough, that my Anſwer did not pleaſe
them; but I was ſo weary to hear them talk
of ſuch kind of Miracles, which they will
force upon Men contrary to all Reaſon, that
I could not, by times, hinder my ſelf from
expreſſing my reſentment of it. The <hi>French</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that was my Guide, wiſh'd me to caſt
my Eye upon certain Roſe-Trees, which were
in a Corner of the Garden, and told me,
that as ſoon as we were got out of the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
he would tell me the myſtery of them.
And in the mean time he ſhewed me the reſt
of the Buildings. I did not find the place ſo
frightful, as was the Impreſſion they had
given me of it; tho' it muſt be owned, That
in S. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Time it was a very Deſert
place.</p>
            <p>Having therefore taken a View of all, we
return'd to the Great Monaſtery, from
whence we came; where being arrived, the
Father told me as to thoſe Roſe-Trees, which
he had wiſhed me to take notice of, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42118:129"/>
the Monks had not thought ſitting to tell me
of the great Miracle, wherewith they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
entertain Strangers, for fear I ſhould
reflect upon them for it, as I did upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Stone. <hi>It is Related</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>in the
Life of our Bleſſed Father S.</hi> Bennet, <hi>That he
had one day a furious Temptation of the Fleſh in
this place; and that in order to quell it, he went
and rowled himſelf ſtark naked upon Thistles and
Thorns, that were near unto his Cell, and made all
his Body on a Gore-blood, until he found that the
Temptation was quite diſſipated. Now the Hiſtory
tells us, that theſe Thiſtles and Thorns, ting'd
with the Blood of S.</hi> Bennet, <hi>were miraculouſly
changed into Roſes. Wherefore ſpecial Care has
been taken always to preſerve theſe Roſe-Trees, the
Roſes whereof we dry, and being pulverized, do
exhibit them to thoſe that are Sick; for it is an
univerſal Remedy againſt all manner of Diſeaſes,
to thoſe who take them in Faith.</hi> I told this
<hi>French</hi> Father, That the Monks his Confraters
had done very well not to mention this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to me, for I ſhould preſently have put
them in mind of the Fable of <hi>Pyramis</hi> and
<hi>Thisbe,</hi> whoſe Blood changed the colour of
<hi>Mulberries</hi> from white to red. Could they
have ſhewn me Thiſtles, Nettles, or ſome
Blackberry-Buſhes and Brambles that brought
forth Roſes, this would have been ſomething
rare indeed, I will not ſay miraculous (for I
know not whether they have found out the
Art of grafting Roſe-Trees upon theſe kind of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42118:130"/>
Wild Plants) but to ſhew a Man Roſe-Tree
that bears Roſes, this is a thing we ſee every
day, without ever dreaming of a Miracle.
And as to what concerns their miraculous
Operation, in Curing all manner of Maladies,
that they had very adviſedly added this Clauſe,
<hi>If they be made uſe of in Faith:</hi> For if thoſe
that take of this Powder in their Sickneſs
chance to die, 'tis becauſe there was no Faith
in them; but if they eſcape, it is a plain
Miracle.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fathers are extream Rich, and almoſt
all the Country round about, to a very great
diſtance, belongs to them. The next Day I
went up to a Mountain, where they ſhewed
me a Chapel, which S. <hi>Bennet</hi> caus'd to be
built; and about Seven miles further, they
ſhewed me another, Dignified with a New
Miracle, which is, the Impreſſion of the Body
of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> upon a Rock. The Story of it is
this, They tell us, <hi>That this Saint being on a
time Benighted, he was forc'd to beg Lodging of
a Prieſt that lived in thoſe Parts, who very
uncivilly denied him. The Saint being ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
tired, that he could no longer keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſtanding, lean'd againſt a Rock, which
received his Body with the ſame eaſe, as if it had
been a ſoft Bed, where he reſted all that Night;
which impreſſion of his Body</hi> (ſay they) <hi>remain'd
there ever ſince.</hi> True it is, that ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is indeed found there, but who has
made it I cannot tell you, except you will believe
the Miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:42118:130"/>
From this place I took Directions of the
Way to <hi>Mont Caſſin,</hi> which is about Three
ſmall days Journy from thence. Here it is
you may take a view of the Glory of the
Monaſtick State, in all its luſtre. The ſtately
Buildings which theſe Fathers have raiſed
upon this Mountain, make it appear to be the
Head of an Order. The place is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleaſant, ſurrounded on all ſides with
Rich Vallies, and Little Hills, over which
<hi>Mont Caſſin</hi> commands by its height, and by
the Temporal and Spiritual Juriſdiction the
Monks do exerciſe over a great many Towns
Villages which lye round about it. Amongſt
the reſt there is a very pretty City ſituate at
the Foot of <hi>Mont Caſſin,</hi> which is called
S. <hi>Germain.</hi> The Abbot has Epiſcopal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
there, and keeps his Grand Vicar, who
is a Monk of the ſame Order. I went to ſee
him, to get permiſſion of him to ſay Maſs, and
afterwards I went up to the Mountain. They
have made the Acceſs to it very fair and eaſie,
and one aſcends near Four <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, before
one comes to the Monaſtery. A man muſt
not expect here any great Antiquities, this Place
having been ſeveral times ruined by the Wars,
and by Fire, which did not ſo much as leave
one Stone upon another. The only Remain
of Antiquity they ſhew one is, the Remainder
of an Old Steeple, which the Monks have
extraordinarily embeliſh'd within, as ſuppoſing
it to be the place where S. <hi>Bennet</hi> died, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42118:131"/>
that God as by Miracle had preſerved it,
amongſt ſo many Deſolations and Fires, as of
Old he did the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> in the midſt of
the Deluge. They will have every one that
enters it, to put off his Shoes; and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when they go in, make very ſtrange
Poſtures and Faces. They maintain, That
they have the whole Body of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> in their
poſſeſſion, and that what was ſaid of his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
to the Monaſtery of <hi>Fleury</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
is no more than a Fable: According to which
Suppoſition, all the great Miracles which the
<hi>Benedictins</hi> of <hi>France</hi> pretend to have wrought,
at the Tranſlation of it, muſt be very grand
Impoſtures. And we may ſee by this ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
how the Monks make no Bones of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
one another of Fraud and Impoſture,
when their Intereſt is concern'd.</p>
            <p>Several Popes who had a Kindneſs for <hi>Mont
Caſſin,</hi> have been pleaſed to make an Eſſay of
their Infallibility, by declaring, That the
Body, which they never ſaw, is there whole
and entire: Other Popes, on the contrary,
who were more concern'd for the <hi>Benedictins</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> have Thunder'd out their <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's</hi>
againſt thoſe that ſhould ſay, That the
Body of the ſame S. <hi>Bennet</hi> was at <hi>Mont Caſſin.</hi>
So that upon the matter, we do not know who
to believe, for here is Infallibility againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;
and a Papiſt cannot believe what
one Pope hath pronounced about it, without
falling into the Excommunications of another,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42118:131"/>
which you'l ſay, is a very hard caſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it may be, the Fathers of <hi>Mont Caſſin</hi>
tell you plainly, That they have it; and for
proof thereof, they maintain a Race of great
Ravens in their Monaſteries, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to be the Off-ſpring of a Raven, who
render'd a great piece of Service to S. <hi>Bennet,</hi>
by carrying away an empoyſon'd Leaf, which
a wicked Prieſt had ſent him. Theſe Ravens
are very familiar, and the Fathers tell us,
That the Charm which keeps them in that
Place, is the Odour of the Body of S. <hi>Bennet:</hi>
Tho' for my part, I ſhould rather incline to
believe, That it is the Odour of their Fat
Kitchin; for they are continually ſtuffing of
them, and a great many Poor People might
have their Subſiſtence from what they allow
theſe Birds. Theſe Ravens in Colour do well
reſemble theſe Monks, who are Cloath'd all
in Black, and for diſtinctions ſake are called
<hi>Black Fryers, Monachi Neri.</hi> Furthermore,
they ſhew'd me all the Regular Places, the
Cloiſters, Dormitories, the Apartments for the
Officers, the Gardens, and the Backſides: All
which carry a greater ſhew of the Grandure
and Majeſty of a Palace Royal, than of an
Abode for Monks. But the Church above all
things is extreamly well and ſumptuouſly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd,
being embeliſh'd with Marble, Jaſper,
Porphyry, and other precious Stones; and in
particular, the Gilding and Painting you ſee
there, are of an ineſtimable Value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:42118:132"/>
They obſerve ſtill in this Abby, the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Cuſtom of Entertaining all Strangers,
and Pilgrims, according to their Rank and
Quality, and indeed Perſons are very well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
there, tho' it be only with Eggs,
Herbs, and Fiſh. For, as I have ſaid, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, they profeſs to obſerve their Rule,
according to the Rigor of it, in this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
in hopes of excuſing, by this means, the
decadence and failure of all the reſt. But I
have been ſince informed after what manner
they acquit themſelves of their Vow. They
ſend their Religious by turns into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for a Month or two, to Fatten and Plump
them; which time expir'd, they recall them
again to their Obſervance, at which they
are kept the ſame ſpace of time, after which
they ſend them again to be Fatted anew. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner do they mutually ſolace and
relieve one another amongſt themſelves with
an Holy Brotherly Love, whereby they find
themſelves much benefited. One of theſe
Monks, on a time, ſuppos'd himſelf to have
found the Secret, to ſpare himſelf and his
Brethren, the Pains and Trouble of all theſe
Flittings and Removes. He had made his
reflection upon a Hymn of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> which
they Sing on Friday Morning, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Works of the Fifth days Creation,
which were the Fiſhes and the Birds, he hath
theſe words,
<q>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42118:132"/>
                  <l>Qui fertili natos aquâ</l>
                  <l>Partim relinquis Gurgiti,</l>
                  <l>Partim levas in Aera.</l>
               </q>
From whence he inferr'd, that foraſmuch as the
Fiſh and Birds proceeded both from one Matter,
to wit, the Water, they might indifferently
paſs for Fiſh, as being in Subſtance nothing
but the ſame thing. Beſides the Reſemblance
there is between the Fins of Fiſhes, and the
Wings of Birds, helpt to flatter his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as a further Confirmation of his Notion;
he deſired his Brethren to Meditate a
while upon this Myſtery, which being once
unfolded, might be ſo profitable to them.
The Notion was found to be very good, and
they made no more ado but with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
preſented a Petition to the Abbot, that
they might have leave from thence forward,
to Eat the Fiſh that flies in the Air. The
Abbot ſuppos'd that his Religious had taken
up the Holy Reſolution of Reforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to a higher Degree, and that they would
for time to come, abſtain wholly from Fiſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
for if they Eat nothing, ſaid he in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but the Fiſh that flies in the Air, they
will not need any great ſtore of Oil to Fry
them with. Wherefore he very readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Requeſt; but he was extreamly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
when entring the next day into the
Refectory, he found all the Table charged
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42118:133"/>
with good Foul, both Boil'd and Roaſted, as
Woodcocks, Partridges, and all others that
were in ſeaſon. He preſently ſent for the
Steward of the Monaſtery to come to him,
and thoſe who had made theſe Proviſions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to Jobe them very ſeverely: But they
putting him in mind of the Permiſſion he had
granted them, and Quoting the paſſage out
of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the 20, 21, and 22 Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the poor
Abbot, was put to a Nonplus, by the ſubtilty
of their Reaſonings, and allow'd it ſhould be
continued. The matter being divulged ſome
time after, it came to the Ears of their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Protector at <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſent a Letter to
them, by which he exhorted them, either
abſolutely to Eat Fleſh, if they had a deſire
ſo to do, or elſe to Eat nothing but the Fiſh
that lives in the Waters, for that otherwiſe
it was to be feared, the People would learn
by their Example, to Eat cramb'd Capons in
<hi>Lent;</hi> and leaving the Swimming, betake
themſelves to the Flying Fiſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Twelve years ſince, that the Reformed
Benedictins of the Congregation of S. <hi>Marus</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> practiſed much a like thing: They
Eat nothing but Otters and Badgers, as long
as they could get any of them, taking theſe
Animals for Fiſh, becauſe they live along the
Rivers, and feed upon Fiſh; and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they did alſo Eat them in <hi>Lent,</hi> this
extreamly ſcandaliz'd the People in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42118:133"/>
of <hi>France,</hi> where Otters and Badgers
are look'd upon as Meat. Wherefore the
Biſhops were fain to deſire the Fathers, for
time to come, to abſtain from eating of
them, as they do at preſent. By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that all this ſort of People, who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
profeſs to live a Life of Penance, do
it ſore againſt their Will; and could one ſee
all that paſſes in Secret in their Monaſteries,
the World would be no longer abus'd by
their Hypocryſie.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only give you an account of one
famous Hermitage more, which lies in <hi>Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerland,</hi>
and afterwards proſecute my Journy
to <hi>Naples.</hi> This Hermitage is call'd <hi>Encylas,</hi>
and the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Maſters of it, have there at preſent a
very fair Abby. It is Situate upon a very
high Mountain, between the Canton of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,</hi>
and that of <hi>Solure.</hi> The Papiſts Flock
thither in Pilgrimage, from all parts of <hi>France,
Germany, Swiſſerland,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> for the ſake
of a Miraculous Chapel, which is to be ſeen
in that place. The Hiſtory of it runs thus.
An Hermit having caus'd a Chapel to be
Built here, was at a loſs to find a Biſhop, who
would take the pains to come and Conſecrate
it, in a place which was at ſo great a diſtance
from the Commerce of Men: But on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Night as he was at Prayers, he ſaw Jeſus
Chriſt coming down from Heaven, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with his Bleſſed Mother, the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:42118:134"/>
the Twelve Apoſtles, and an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Angels. All this Heavenly Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
entred the Chapel, and Jeſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Sacerdotal Habits to be brought
forth, which the Angels immediately deliver'd
to him, and were all enrich'd with Pearls and
Diamonds. He took them all from their
Hands, and put them on, repeating the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which the Prieſts are oblig'd to ſay, whilſt
they put on the Sacred Habit. Obſerve here
by the by, that in one of theſe Prayers, the
Prieſt Prays, that <hi>God would be pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
in him the Carnal Concupiſcence, that
reigns in his Members,</hi> and apply this if you
can, without the higheſt Sacrilege, to Jeſus
Chriſt, who is the Eternal Purity. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
then having put on his Sacerdotal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
went and Conſecrated the Chapel,
and afterwards the Altar; in performing
which, he obſerv'd all the Ceremonies, made
all the ſigns of the Croſs, perform'd all the
Sprinklings of Holy-Water, diſpatch'd all the
Anointings with the Holy-Oils, and pronou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all the Prayers, which are ſet down in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Ritual, for the Conſecration of
Chapels, and Altars; the Apoſtles all this
while aſſiſting him, and anſwering <hi>Amen</hi> to
all the Prayers, at the ſame time that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
Sang the Muſick, played upon Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in a word, made ſuch a melodious
Conſort, that the poor Hermit, who took a
View of all this, from one of the Corners of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42118:134"/>
the Chapel, was wholly charm'd and raviſh'd
with it. After that the Ceremony of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
was thus finiſh'd, Jeſus Chriſt would
needs alſo Celebrate the firſt Maſs there, and
having put on the reſt of the required Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
he went to the Altar; S. <hi>Peter</hi> and
S. <hi>Paul</hi> Miniſtred to him at the Maſs. The
Hermit took notice that Jeſus Chriſt did not
omit the leaſt Ceremony, Benediction, Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Prayer, that are contain'd in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Miſſal. This done, he took the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
himſelf under both kinds, and afterwards
delivered it to his Bleſſed Mother, and all the
Apoſtles, concluding the Maſs with an <hi>Ite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa
eſt,</hi> to which the Angelical Conſort anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Deo Gratias.</hi> When all this was thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
Jeſus Chriſt together with all this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Society return'd to Heaven, leaving
the Chapel Conſecrated, as it is at preſent.
We are to take notice that this hapned at a
time, when Men believed Hermits upon
their bair Words, and when the living in a
Wood, or upon a Mountain, with a ſwinging
Cowl upon ones Head, paſt for an inconte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
proof of Saintſhip. The Hermit writ
to the Biſhop, that now he needed not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
himſelf to come and Conſecrate
the Chapel, ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf,
had been pleaſed to ſave him that trouble.
The good People, who at that time were the
Inhabitants of thoſe Mountains, and who
would have Swallow'd any thing, under the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42118:135"/>
notion of a Miracle, gulp'd down this alſo.
This Chapel is to be ſeen there to this day,
whole and entire, and the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> who
have taken Poſſeſſion of this Place, have Built
a great Church round about it, ſo that the
Great one, encloſeth the Leſſer.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fathers are very Rich, and have got
together a very great Treaſury of Plate, by
means of this Devotion. And foraſmuch as
they are almoſt on every ſide, ſurrounded
with Hereticks, (ſo they call the Proteſtants;)
they make uſe of abundance of Precaution,
and do not ſhew their Treaſure to all the
World. They have encloſed it within a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Wall, to the end that in caſe of a Civil
War, the Proteſtants, might not be able to
find it. Near to the Abby, there is a fair Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
very well Built, and the outſide of all
the Houſes are Painted, which makes a very
fine ſhew. They are almoſt all Inhabited by
Inn-Keepers, who are furniſhed with excellent
Wine, which is a ſtrong Magnetiſm for the
<hi>Swiſs</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Pilgrims.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of this Country,
glory ſo much in having got ſo convincing a
Proof of the truth of their Maſs, that they
openly declare, that Jeſus Chriſt having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
the fatal Revolution, which of late hath
hapned in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> by the perverſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of <hi>Calvin,</hi> denying the real preſence of
the Holy Sacrament, was pleaſed beforehand
to Condemn this Doctrin, by his own offering
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42118:135"/>
up to his Eternal Father, the Bloodleſs Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Holy Maſs, with all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
the Holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes uſe of.
It is to be ſuppos'd that Jeſus Chriſt was
greatly pleaſed to find in the <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſal,
all thoſe finical Additions, the Popes have
joyned to it; and eſpecially with the invention
of thoſe pretty little Hoſts, to the compoſition
of which there enters more Wax than Flower.
I have frequently ſeen theſe Wafers made,
and I have ſome time for Recreation made
them them my ſelf. They greaſe the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer-Iron,
in which they make the Hoſts, with
white-Wax, to make them the more firm.
This Wax being melted, Penetrates the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
through and through, and ſerves for a
Glew to hold them together. This was it,
our Adorable Lord and Saviour thought not
of, when he inſtituted his Sacrament; but
however approved very well of this new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
in Celebrating the Maſs at <hi>Encylas.</hi>
The <hi>Memento</hi> for the Dead, that is, the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for the Souls in Purgatory, which they
have inſerted into the Maſs, pleaſed him alſo
extraordinary well: And ſeeing it cannot be
doubted, but that his Prayers were aſſuredly
heard; it will follow, that there was not ſo
much as one Soul left in Purgatory that day.
I have forgot to ask theſe good Catholicks,
whether Jeſus Chriſt when he ſaid Maſs at
<hi>Encylas,</hi> gave the Communion to his Bleſſed
Mother and his Diſciples, under both kinds?
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42118:136"/>
Or whether he conform'd himſelf to the
Modern Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
who communicate the People under one kind
only; if they affirm this Latter, I proteſt I
have taken the Reſolution never to believe
them; and I will rather believe, that Jeſus
Chriſt, who is the Eternal Wiſdom, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
all things ſo wiſely, in his Inſtitution
of the Sacrament, that as there wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might be added, ſo neither was
there any thing ſuperfluous to be taken away
from it. He would that all ſhould Eat of the
Bread, and Drink of the Cup. <hi>Bibite ex eo
omnes: Drink ye all of it.</hi> This hath been the
conſtant Practice of the Primitive Church,
for many Ages; and I am ſo far from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon this firſt Church, as being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in all her Practices, as the Papiſts would
fain perſuade us, that I ſhall always conſider
it, as the True and Perfect Pattern and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of the Church, which our Lord and the
Apoſtles have left us, which we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to mend, without ſpoiling it, and from
which we cannot depart without Sin. Some
ancient Churches, even of thoſe that follow
the Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> have in ſome ſort
preſerved the ancient Cuſtom of Celebrating
the Lords Supper, tho' they look upon it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at preſent, as one of the Ceremonies of
the Holy-Week, and they practiſe it only on
Munday and Thurſday, but with ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
and Indecencies, which ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
and put away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:42118:136"/>
I will give you a Relation here of what I
have ſeen practis'd at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> where
I hapned to be for Two years together on
<hi>Holy-Thurſday.</hi> This Day, after Morning-Service,
and the Waſhing of Feet, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,
the Great Canons, and all the other
Prieſts that ſerve in the Cathedral, go in
Proceſſion to a Great Hall, that is near the
Church, which they call the <hi>Chapter-Houſe,</hi>
there to Celebrate the Supper. The Seculars
that are of any Rank and Quality, have leave
to enter with the reſt. There are great Benches
placed round about the Hall, where all the
Company ſeat themſelves, and a great Table
in the midſt, covered with a Table-Cloth,
upon which are placed large Cups or Goblets,
with other Pitchers and Veſſels full of Wine,
and a vaſt quantity of great Wafers divided
into Pounds and half Pounds. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
being Arrayed in his Pontifical Habits,
reads with a loud Voice that part of the
Goſpel, which contains the Hiſtory of the
Supper; and afterwards bleſſing the Bread
and the Wine, he declares, That they are to
take this in memory of the Paſſion of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to be obedient to the
Command he has left us, to <hi>do the ſame in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of him.</hi> Thus after having taken
his part of the Wafers, which is of two or
three Pounds, becauſe of his Dignity, he goes
and diſtributes the reſt, to all thoſe that are
preſent, a Service of one Pound to every
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42118:137"/>
Grand Canon, and of half a Pound to all
the reſt, the ſame ſhare being given to me
alſo. They ſpread a great Napkin before all
thoſe that aſſiſt at the Supper, and every one
applies himſelf to eat theſe Wafers, which are
very thick, and of another ſort than thoſe
are, that they uſe at Maſs. Formerly they
gave to all the Company pieces of Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
Bread; but theſe Wafers were in
After-times found more pleaſing to the Palat,
and more fit to be Preſented. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,
in the mean time, takes the Cup, or
rather, it is held to him, whilſt he drinks;
for it is ſo large and ſo full of Wine, that
two of the Canons are ſcarcely able to ſupport
it. After he hath drunk, he ſends it to be
preſented to the Great Canons, and then to
all thoſe that ſit on the Benches. They don't
amuſe themſelves with letting down a little
Gulp only, as is done at the Sacrament; but
they drink in good earneſt, and fetch the
greateſt Draughts they can: And there be
ſome of theſe <hi>German</hi> Gentlemen, that drink
above a Quart at a Draught; ſo that the
Cup, as big as it is, is nevertheleſs ſoon
emptied, and muſt be filled anew. The Wine
that is uſed on this occaſion, muſt be of the
beſt Rheniſh Wine that is to be got in all
the Territory of <hi>Mentz;</hi> and the Officers of
the Cathedral, have power to go and chuſe
it that Day with great Ceremony in the
Electors Cellars. They pierce all the Veſſels
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42118:137"/>
one after another, and take the Judgment of
ſome Learned Palats upon them. It is the
high Opinion they have conceiv'd of the
goodneſs of this Wine, that makes theſe
Gentlemen drink ſo heartily. The Great
Cup takes its Round five times, and ſo oft
every one of the Company drinks. But if
any one ſhould chance in theſe Intervals, to
be tormented with Thirſt, he needs only to
make a ſign to the Prieſts, who are near to
the Table, where other Veſſels ſtand ready,
in which they are preſently ſerved: Whilſt
the Cup goes round, the Singing-Men and
the Muſicians ſtrike up their Notes and Sing,
(ſtanding near the Table which holds the
Cups and the good Wine) that which the
Papiſts call <hi>Improperia,</hi> which are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
our Saviour made to the <hi>Jews</hi> for
their Ingratitude, in Abuſing him to that
degree as they did, notwithſtanding all the
Benefits they had received of him.</p>
            <p>I obſerv'd, that the Company kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a great degree of Reſtraint and
Modeſty at the firſt and ſecond Round the
Cup made; but at the third Turn, when the
good Wine began to diſplay its virtue, every
one began to Talk and Laugh; and the
Singing-men, who were willing to take their
ſhares of the good Wine, made Stops ever
and anon, to refreſh themſelves with the
pleaſing Liquor; ſo that towards the end of
the Ceremony they were quite gon, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42118:138"/>
knew no longer what they ſung. I was pretty
near one of the Grand Canons, and told him;
<hi>In truth, My Lord, I am aſtoniſhed to ſee them
ſuffer theſe Singing-Men, to act all theſe Fooleries they
do in the midſt of the Hall, and in your Preſence;
and at a Function, which requires a great deal
of Modeſty and Seriouſneſs.</hi> He Anſwer'd me
very fiercely; <hi>We do not concern our ſelves with
thoſe Men; they are a Company of pure Rogues,
they deſerve indeed, to have their Legs and Arms
broke; but all that can be ſaid for them is, that
they are drunk, and to ſpeak truth, I am ſomewhat
engag'd that way my ſelf.</hi> I found that he
ſpoke Truth, for the good Wine had ſeiz'd
his Capitol, as well as thoſe of the reſt of the
Company. My Hoſt, with whom I lodged,
who was one of the Officers of the Grand
Chapter, return'd from thence very much
out of order, and own'd to have drunk above
ſix Quarts for his own ſhare. He often call'd for
Wine extraordinarily, under pretence that the
bits of the Wafers which he eat, ſtuck in his
Throat. At laſt, when the Ceremony was
ended, which laſted about two Hours,
every one returned to his own Home, ſtaggering
as they went, and running their Heads againſt
the Walls. The Gentlemen certainly would
be highly diſpleaſed, if they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Cup that Day; and I queſtion
whether the Pope, with all his Authority
would ever be able to bring it about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:42118:138"/>
Now if we ſet aſide the Exceſſes, the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies,
and ſome other Improperties theſe
Men did commit in this Solemnity; ſure it is,
that this is the true way of Adminiſtring the
Holy Supper, which has been continually
preſerv'd in this Church. It ſeems probable,
that ſometime or other they were in the belief,
that they could not ſatisfie the Command of
the Supper, by celebrating the Maſs, and
Communicating in the manner as they do;
and therefore to remedy this in ſome degree,
they retain'd this Ceremony, which they call
the <hi>Lord's Precept;</hi> but ſurely they then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it with more modeſty and reſpect than
they do at preſent. Indeed, I know no Function
the Papiſts have, throughout the whole courſe
of the Year, that repreſents the Holy Supper;
for what I have now ſaid of <hi>Mentz,</hi> is not
practis'd in any other of their Churches. I
know they commonly aſſign <hi>Eaſter-Day</hi> for
this purpoſe; but I can find nothing in the
whole Office of that Day, that repreſents any
thing of it: For the Maſs hath no confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
at all with the Supper; and beſides, the
People do not Communicate whilſt the Maſs
is celebrating, but after the Maſs is ended,
and then the Prieſt, without making any
Prayer, and without declaring what he is
about to do, goes and puts into the Mouths
of all thoſe that preſent themſelves, a ſmall
Conſecrated Wafer, and ſaith to every one
of them; <hi>The Body of Jeſus Chriſt preſerve thy
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42118:139"/>
Soul to Life Eternal.</hi> Every one that has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, retires to a Corner of the Church,
to Pray in private; and then every one goes
home, without the leaſt Prayer made in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Where therefore is the common Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Communion in all this? They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay, that they partake all of one Bread,
for all the little Wafers they give are diſtinct,
ſome Old, and others New; ſome of them
bought at one Shop, and ſome at another,
and all of them (as was ſaid) are ſo pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
with Wax, that it is hard to ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Bread or Wax. They do not ſo
much as once know, for the moſt part, that
this Action is to be performed in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Paſſion and Death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jeſus Chriſt, neither is there ſo much
as one only word mention'd to put them in
mind of it. For my part, I muſt acknowledge
that I knew nothing of it, before that I
began to ſtudy Divinity; and I believed,
that to Communicate, was only to Receive
the Body of our Saviour, without being
obliged to call any thing to Remembrance.
And yet, this is that which is moſt expreſly
declared in the Commandment of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
in the Inſtitution of the Holy Supper;
<hi>Do this in Remembrance of me.</hi> And thoſe who
Adminiſter the Sacrament, have an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lying upon them, <hi>to declare the Death of
our Lord,</hi> to make us remember it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:42118:139"/>
Notwithſtanding that theſe various Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Obſervations that I give you here,
ſeem to have no great Connexion with my
Journy to <hi>Naples;</hi> yet they do very well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with the General Subject I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to my ſelf, and which I may well call
the main ſcope and aim of my Work; which
is, to diſcover to you the reſt of the Corrupt
and Superſtitious Practices of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which are come to my knowledge.
I produce them one after another, according
as I find occaſion; and in this regard, I
readily acknowledge this Treatiſe not to be
very Regular: For, becauſe the moſt part of
theſe Matters have no great Connexion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that they cannot make out a whole
Chapter, or a Days Entertainment, I have
been obliged to follow this Method, tho'
ſomewhat Irregular, not being able to order
things better.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Days Journy with an
Obſervation I made in my Journy from <hi>Mola</hi>
to <hi>Capua,</hi> which is this: Having ſtruck out of
the High-Way, we entred into ſome Little
Villages, to refreſh our ſelves. Whilſt they
were Watering our Horſes, we took a Turn
to ſee the Houſes, and after what manner the
Poor People liv'd there. Their Houſes are a
Company of Little Holes, I believe the
largeſt of them was not above twelve Foot
in length, but kept very Neat. We were
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42118:140"/>
aſtoniſh'd at the prodigious quantity of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
we found in them; but we ſaw no Men
there, except only ſome few that were very
Ancient, the reſt being gone to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>All the Old Women came out of their
Houſes, carrying in their Hands Sauſages,
and little Loaves of a kind of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Corn,
which they call <hi>Fromenton,</hi> and ſome dry
Figs. They deſired us to give them our
Bleſſing, and to accept of their Preſents.
We took ſome of their Figs, and theſe good
People took this for a great Favour at our
Hands. Some of them amongſt the reſt,
pray'd us to come into their Houſes, that
we might Bleſs ſome of their Wine, Water,
or Goats-Milk. We asked what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to do with it afterwards? They told
us, It was to give their Husbands to drink,
when they return'd from their Labour all
on a Sweat, that it might do them no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>I ſaid to my Companion, That I could not
but admire the Faith of theſe People: Who
reply'd, That he took them all for Saints.
One of theſe good Women that over-heard
him, ſent forth a deep Sigh, ſaying, <hi>That
for her part, ſhe was no Saint; but as for her
deceaſed Mother, that certainly ſhe had been one:
For ſhe Prayed to God from Morning to Night,
for the Souls of Purgatory, and always kept her
Houſe well-ſtor'd with good Proviſions, for the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42118:140"/>
Monks and Prieſts that paſſed by that Way.</hi>
I queſtion'd them about ſome other Duties of
Chriſtianity, and ſome Chief Articles of our
Faith, wherein I found them very Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
and ſome of them Anſwer'd me, <hi>That
their Curate was a very Learned Man, and
that he would ſatisfie us concerning theſe Points.</hi>
I found by this, that theſe Poor People were
arrived at that Bleſſed Ignorance and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
to which the Prieſts of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſo fain reduce the whole
World, if it were in their Power. So we
returned to our Horſes in the Inn, which
we found had been well look'd to; we were
ſerved alſo with very good Wine, and when
we demanded what we had to Pay, they
would take none of our Mony, our Hoſt
telling us, <hi>That we were Knights of Jeſus
Christ, and that we had too much honoured him,
by coming under his Roof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt as we were Mounting on Horſe-back,
a Foot-Boy came to deſire us to ſtay one
Moment; for that Count <hi>Ludovica</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
deſired, if it might be acceptable to us,
to have our Company to <hi>Capua.</hi> Our Hoſt
aſſured us, That he was a very vertuous
good Lord. So we ſtay'd for him, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
together to <hi>Capua.</hi> We told him of
the Simplicity and Charity of the Poor
People of the Village where we Baited. He
ſaid, That <hi>they were us'd to it, and that in all
the Villages at any distance from the High-Way,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42118:141"/>
they were all of the ſame Temper; and that
the Monks and Prieſts took care to direct their
Courſe that Way, when they Travell'd, to ſpare
their Mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being Arrived at <hi>Capua,</hi> the Count Invited
us to accept of a Lodging with him, where
we were very Nobly Entertain'd, with a
Generoſity and Open-heartedneſs, which is
not very common amongſt the Noblemen of
<hi>Italy.</hi>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</head>
            <head>The Fifth Days Journy.</head>
            <p>THis Day, which was the laſt of our
Journy, was the moſt Troubleſom
to us of all the reſt, becauſe it was
a Faſt of the Church. We return'd our
Acknowledgments to our Noble Count, who
had ſhewed himſelf ſo generous and ſplendid
in his Entertainment of us; and proſecuted
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42118:142"/>
our Journy to <hi>Averſe,</hi> which is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and delicious City, ſituate between <hi>Capua</hi>
and <hi>Naples.</hi> We met with nothing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
on the Way, with relation to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
only we caſt our Eyes upon ſome Little
Chapels, which we found almoſt at the End
of every Field. Theſe Chapels are no more
than ſo many Little Vaults, four or five Foot
long, and three or four Foot broad; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in, we found they contain'd the Picture
of a Crucifix, or of ſome Saint or other, who
are ſuppos'd to be the Tutelar Saints of thoſe
Grounds, on which the Chapels are built.
We ſaw in moſt of theſe Chapels, Little Stones
hanging upon the Walls, being faſtned with
Thred; as alſo Little Bones, ſmall Tufts of
Hair, bits of Wood, ſhreds of Cloth, and an
hundred other things of like Nature. We got
ſome of the Peaſants, who quitted their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
to come and receive our Benediction,
to unfold to us the meaning of theſe things.
They told us, <hi>That they were the Vows of ſome
of the good Country People, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernt
Occaſions or Dangers they had been in.</hi>
Some of them that had caught Falls, as they
were going on their Way, had gather'd up the
Pebbles, or Flints, at which they had ſtumbled,
and carried them to the Chapel: Others had
brought thither the Sticks wherewith their
Maſters had beaten them: Women that had
Quarrel'd and Fought together, very devoutly
carried thither the Hair they had plucked
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42118:142"/>
from one anothers Heads. Theſe good People
believing, by a Superſtition, whereof I had
never before ſeen an Inſtance, that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Inſtruments of their Miſhap to
ſome one of theſe Chapels, they prevent the
hapning of the like Accident for time to
come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be ſome will Object to me here,</hi>
That I have been very diligent, in my Travels,
to take Notice of ſome inconſiderable Trifles, which
were not once worth the obſerving; and now
make uſe of them, to reproach and mortifie the
Papists.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That if it may paſs
for a kind of Excuſe, to produce the Example
of others that have done the like, I can aſſert,
there are ſome who have made Remarks of
much leſs Importance, than is this I have laſt
mention'd. Father <hi>Mabillon,</hi> that Famous <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictin,</hi>
in the Hiſtory of his Travels, gives us
a Relation of certain Women in <hi>Rome,</hi> who
creep up the Steps of the Portal of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Church on their Knees; and makes this goodly
Reflection upon it, <hi>That this is ſome Remainder
of the Piety of the Emperour</hi> Theodoſius, <hi>and of
his Veneration for that Auguſt Cathedral.</hi> In the
mean time we find, that it is not only in their
Approaches to this Magnificent Temple, that
theſe Women put themſelves into theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures;
but that they alſo uſe the ſame in their
Drawing near almoſt to every Place, where
any Superſtitious Worſhip is in Vogue; for I
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42118:143"/>
have ſeen both Men and Women ſhuffling on
their Knees, to theſe little Chapels built in the
Fields, whereof I am now ſpeaking, where
there is nothing conſiderable, that deſerves
any Veneration. Should a Papiſt be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
of theſe Actions, he would not fail to
exalt them to the Clouds, and ſet them forth as
moſt Signal Inſtances of an extraordinary Piety
and Devotion, and as Actions very Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the ſight of God; whereas, a Proteſtant
in giving an Account of them, would rather
deplore the Blindneſs of this Poor People, who
are ſo ignorant of the true Ways of Salvation,
as to believe, that by employing themſelves in
this kind of Practices, they go ſtrait to Heaven,
and that by this means their Sins are blotted
out, without having recourſe to ſerious Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The ſame Father <hi>Mabillon</hi> makes mention
of the Cloſe-Stool, or Chair, with a Hole in
it, called <hi>Sedes Stercoraria,</hi> on which formerly
the Popes were carried, after their Exaltation
to the Throne of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> He puts an Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
upon it, which I ſuppoſe was ſcarcely
thought of at that time. He ſaith, <hi>This Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was made uſe of, to put the Popes in mind,
after their Election, that they ought to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
humble in the midſt of that Greatneſs, to
which God had been pleaſed to raiſe them, as from
the Duſt and Dunghil, alluding to that of the
Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 113. 7. <hi>De Stercore erigens Paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi>
Some Writers, whom this Author terms
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42118:143"/>
               <hi>Hereticks,</hi> give a very different account of it,
and ſay, <hi>That this kind of Chair was made uſe
of in the Ceremony of the Papal Exaltation, ever
ſince they had been Impos'd upon by Pope</hi> Joan,
<hi>as a neceſſary Precaution, to prevent the like
Miſtake for the time to come: For they made the
Pope to Seat himſelf in this Chair, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they held Lifted up on High, till all the
Cardinals had perform'd their Scrutiny concerning
the Holy Father, Whether he was furniſh'd with
all the Conſtitutive Parts of a Perfect Man.</hi>
'Tis hard to determine, whether of theſe two
Explications be the true one. However, the
Abolition they have ſince made of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
might make one ſuſpect, that there
was indeed ſomething in this Action, that
did not comport with the Glory of the Heads
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or elſe, that the
Popes have renounced thoſe humble Thoughts
of themſelves, which this <hi>Cloſe-Stool</hi> might
ſerve to inſpire them with. I have Read in
the Books of Travellers, many other Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
which in dignity do not in the leaſt
out-vy thoſe which by times come to my mind,
and which I hear relate to you, rather for
the Conſequences which may be drawn thence,
or for the Reflections they may occaſion, than
for the importance of the Matters of Fact
themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:42118:144"/>
After having taken ſome time to view theſe
Chapels, and obſerve the Superſtitious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of theſe poor People, we have juſt now
related, we at laſt Arriv'd at <hi>Averſe,</hi> where
we were Witneſſes of a very pleaſant Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is well worth the relating in all its
Circumſtances. For the better underſtanding
of it, I muſt put you in mind, that the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Dames are kept up, worſe than Slaves, to
that degree, that they have not ſo much as the
liberty of the Rooms of their own Houſes.
In the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Cuſtom is to
lock them up in the Garrets, which for that
reaſon, they call the Womens Apartment.
Whenever they have a mind to buy any
thing, that is Cry'd along the Streets, or to
give an Alms to any poor Body, they have
Baskets, which they faſten to a great Rope,
and let them down to give or receive what
they pleaſe. A Fryer <hi>Carmelite</hi> who was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Queſt (a genteel word to expreſs Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging)
in honour of the little <hi>Scapulary,</hi> was
waiting under the Window of a Dame of
Quality, for the deſcent of ſome Alms; the
Gentlewoman it ſeems having too great a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for him, to ſend him away empty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd
down to him in her Basket a great
white-Loaf, which the good Fryer was reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out his Arms to receive; when two <hi>French</hi>
Men coming by, that were almoſt Famiſh'd,
prov'd more nimble than he, and diſappointed
him of his Prey, for the one of them having
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42118:144"/>
rudely thruſt the Fryer to the over-ſide of
the Street, the other laid hold upon the Basket,
and having taken out what was in it, they
both betook themſelves to their Heils. The
<hi>Carmelite,</hi> who was ſenſible of his Guilt, and
was therefore very deſirous of getting the
Loaf into his own hands, fell a running after
them with all his might, Crying out, Stop
the Thieves, ſtop the Thieves. Whereupon
the People ſoon ſtopt them, as ſuppoſing that
they had Robb'd ſomething conſiderable; but
theſe poor Wretches gave good Evidence, that
it was nothing leſs than Neceſſity had put
them upon this Piece of Thievery, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being mov'd or skar'd at the Uproar
made about them, he who had Stolen the Loaf;
broke it in two, and gave the one half of it
to his Companion. As this was doing, ſome
Papers dropt out of it upon the Street, which
an <hi>Italian</hi> immediately ſnatch'd up, and the
<hi>Carmelite,</hi> who till then had expreſt ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
to have his Loaf back again, ſlipt away
through the Crowd, without making any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquiries concerning it.</p>
            <p>Every one of the Spectators, were curious
to know the Contents of theſe Papers, and the
<hi>Italian</hi> to avoid the Throng of People, retired
to one of the Chambers of the Inn, where
we were, for to read it. After that he had
read it by himſelf, he was willing to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
it to all, for a notable Piece of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
that deſir'd to hear it. There were
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42118:145"/>
two Letters, the one enclos'd in the other,
whereof the one was the Fryer <hi>Carmelite</hi>'s
Letter, and the other contain'd the Ladies
Anſwer. We heard both of them read, but
I am not able to repeat the Contents of them
to you word for word; therefore ſhall only
mention thoſe Expreſſions I more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took notice of, for the Amorous Gallantry
they contain'd. Their Cuſtom in <hi>Italy</hi> is to
demand Alms, for the honour of the Mother
of God, that is, the Holy Virgin, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this Devout Fryer began his Letter with
theſe words: <hi>Anima devota della grand Madre</hi>
Venere, <hi>fatemi la Carità povero Fraticello, deh per
pietà datemi un ſquárdo, un riſo, un bacio, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehe
coſetta, par l' amor del Dio</hi> Cupido. In
Engliſh thus: <hi>Devout Soul of the great Mother</hi>
Venus, <hi>give an Alms to a poor Fryer; vouchſafe
to me I pray you for Charity, a Look, a Smile,
a Kiſs, ſome little thing or other, for the ſake of
the God</hi> Cupido. At the bottom of his Letter,
he deſir'd the Lady, that ſhe would be pleas'd
to honour him with a word in Anſwer, and
to ſend him back his own Letter, as well to
ſet his Heart at reſt, in that regard, as that
ſhe might not be expos'd to a Surprize of her
Husband. The Letter had no Name to it,
and concluded with theſe words, <hi>the poorest
of all your Lovers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:42118:145"/>
               <hi>The Ladies Anſwer had an Air of Galan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
no whit inferiour to that of the Fryers;
ſhe told him,</hi> That if he had demanded any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of her, ſhe would before have deſired him
to inform her of his Rank and Quality; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he only demanded an Alms, every one
might without abaſing themſelves afford that to
the moſt poor and miſerable. That tho' ſhe had
had no opportunity of taking a view of him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than from the Garret Window, where ſhe was
Impriſon'd, yet that her ſight was good enough to
diſcern he had a very good Countenance under his
Hood, and that ſhe allow'd him from that very
moment, to ſtudy the beſt means of getting to her,
provided that it were done with all poſſible Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That ſhe might indeed have Burnt the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had ſent her, but that ſhe ſuppos'd it would
have been an ill Preſage, to Condemn to the Fire
the firſt Fruits of his Love towards her; and that
ſhe doubted not, ſince he had been ſo circumſpect
in the ſecuring of his own Letter, but he would
be at leaſt as careful for the Anſwer ſhe ſent him,
that it might never fall into the hand of her Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<hi>(meaning her Husband:)</hi> She concluded
with the moſt tender Expreſſions, that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the moſt ardent Affection, and deſired
the Fryer not to fail of returning the next day, at
the ſame Hour, to make his Quest; aſſuring him,
that he might build upon her Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:42118:146"/>
Tho' theſe Letters ſeem'd to be Pleaſant
enough, yet the moſt Underſtanding and
Virtuous of thoſe who heard them read, could
not but expreſs ſomething of Horror, to ſee
Wickedneſs covering it ſelf with the pretext
of Godlineſs, and Stalking up and down in
the Diſguiſe of a Habit ſo Holy in outward
appearance. They ſent out ſome Perſons by
ſeveral ways, to look for the Fryer, but they
could not meet with him; only they Learnt,
at a Houſe where he had Lodg'd, three or
four days before, that he was one of the great
Convent of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> and
that he had been ſent to make Queſt in the
Countries round about. My Companion, who
had ſome Letters to deliver to the Fathers of
the ſaid Convent, took upon him to inform
the Prior of the whole matter, as ſoon as we
ſhould be Arriv'd there, if they would deliver
to him the Letters of this Fryer Queſtor.
The Letters were accordingly deliver'd to
him by the <hi>Italian,</hi> after that he had firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a Copy of them. That which favour'd
the Lady in this Buſineſs, was, that the two
<hi>French</hi> Beggars, who had minded nothing but
the Prey they long'd for, and who after they
had ſeiz'd it, had run three or four Streets
to ſave themſelves from the Purſuit of the
<hi>Carmelite,</hi> could by no means find out the
Houſe again of this Charitable Creature, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there any <hi>Italian</hi> found, that was in
the humour to own it for his Wives hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:42118:146"/>
This Honeſt Gentleman my Companion did
not fail two or three days after his Arrival at
<hi>Naples,</hi> to acquit himſelf of his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but he received nothing but Frowns and
Diſpleaſure for his Pains; for having acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Prior of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> with it, they
flatly denied that any Fryer of their Convent
had been ſent upon the Queſt to <hi>Averſe</hi> at
that time; yea, they abuſed him with ill
Language, asking him by what Authority he
had charged himſelf with this Commiſſion,
as if it were the Office of Prieſts to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of the doings of Fryers? That they
were ſure, the Prieſts had no reaſon for their
parts, to reproach their good Manners, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they themſelves led ſuch very Looſe and
Scandalous Lives.</p>
            <p>The good Gentleman, ſeeing that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
began to be in a great Paſſion, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſt the Religious might think fitting
to give him the Diſcipline for his Pains,
made his humble Excuſes to them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himſelf, ſaying, that what he had done
in this Matter, was not in the leaſt done with
any intention to Inſult them; but only becauſe
he thought himſelf bound in Charity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize
them of a thing for which they were
ſo much reproached at <hi>Averſe,</hi> and which
probably they might find out ſome means to
remedy. The Prior accordingly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the bad Humour he was in, did not
fail of ſending the very ſame day, the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42118:147"/>
of the Convent to <hi>Averſe,</hi> with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
dexterouſly to divulge there, that the
Fryer Queſtor, who had plaid theſe gallant
Tricks, did not belong to their Monaſtery,
and that in all probabilty, it muſt have been
ſome Secular, that had made bold with their
Habit, the better to act his Part.</p>
            <p>It is true enough, that ſometimes Seculars
Diſguiſe themſelves in the Habits of Fryers,
to accompliſh their Ends, as knowing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be invented more proper to give
them a free acceſs to all Houſes: For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that the Men of the World are
daily Trappand by theſe wretched Monks,
yet for all that they retain as great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
for their Habit, as for the moſt Sacred
thing in the whole World; and the Monks,
that on their ſide, they may not be wanting
to the daily encreaſe of this Veneration,
ſcarcely Preach up any thing elſe but the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs
of their Habits. Therefore it is
that theſe Habits, by the great eſteem Men
have of them, are ſo very Proper and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
to Cloak all manner of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Treaſon, and conſequently are made
uſe of, to facilitate the eſcape of Criminals,
to Murther People in their Houſes, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſecret Correſpondencies in Cities, for to
Burn and betray them; and in a word, to
commit Adulteries, Inceſt, all manner of
Cheats, and Perſidiouſneſs, Murthers, and
Sacriledge; yea, what is more, to attempt the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42118:147"/>
Sacred Lives of Kings, whereof we meet with
too many fatal Inſtances in Hiſtory. A <hi>Turk,</hi>
to whom the Prince of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> gave a
Relation of the different Religious Orders,
there were in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and who
(as he ſaid) were the Ornament of it; Reply'd,
That if there was but one of them, they
would be ſufficient to exterminate all the
Princes of the Earth. It ſeems he had Read
ſomething of our Hiſtories. So many dreadful
<hi>Cataſtrophes</hi> which daily happen by theſe pieces
of Cloth, ſhap'd after an Antick manner, and
ridiculous Figure, one would think might be
ſufficient (if there were no other Reaſon for it,
but the Conſervation of their States) wholly
to cut them off from the Church; for Religion
and the State ought to be ſo perfectly united,
that the one may not betray the other, nor
give occaſion to any Diſſenſion or Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
therein. Whereas it is true in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they would ſooner
trample upon a Royal Robe, than upon the
Frock of a Monk; becauſe this Habit in it
ſelf, tho' it may be he that wears it may be
oft-times worſe than the Devil himſelf, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
moſt ſuperlatively holy.</p>
            <p>They call <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Country of Monks,</hi> not
only upon the account, that <hi>Monks</hi> (under
which Word I comprehend all the Religious)
do live very happily there, and have made,
as it were, their Paradice of it; but alſo
becauſe all the <hi>Italians</hi> are in ſome degree
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42118:148"/>
Monks. Thoſe who have not been of their
Number during their Lives, will at leaſt be ſo
after their Deaths. They ſpecifie in their Laſt
Wills, the Religious Habit in which they will
be Buried; One will be dreſt up like a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin,</hi>
another like a <hi>Carmelite,</hi> and ſo for the
reſt. When the Bodies of any of theſe are
Carried to the Ground, their Biers and Coffins
are uncovered, that every one may ſee them
dreſt in their Monaſtick Habits, whereas the
Biers of other Perſons are always covered.
The Monks tell us, That it is an Honour due
to their Habits, that nothing can interpoſe
betwixt them and Heaven; becauſe they have
the virtue of immediately uniting to that place
of Bliſs.</p>
            <p>A Wax-Merchant at <hi>Venice,</hi> who had Cut
his own Throat, becauſe having bought up a
great quantity of Wax, the Price of it
chanced to fall ſome Days after, had Breath
enough left him, after the Wound given, to
declare, That he would be Buried in a <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin</hi>'s
Habit; and ſoon after died thus in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.
His Relations therefore executed his
Laſt Will, and I ſaw this Wretch carried
through the Streets in his <hi>Capucin</hi> Dreſs, with
his Throat Cut: Now I would fain know,
Whether his Accoutrement had the virtue of
immediately uniting him to Heaven. Externals
have to that pitch gain'd the Aſcendant in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that true Vertue ſeems wholly
baniſhed from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:42118:148"/>
We departed from <hi>Averſe,</hi> as ſoon as we had
Dined, and we Arrived (without putting our
ſelves or our Horſes much to it) timely enough
in the great Suburbs of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with whom I was in Company, did
not think himſelf in an Equipage good enough,
to enter the City that Day; and I, becauſe I
would not leave him, took up my Lodging in
an Inn of the Suburbs with him. The Hoſt
was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the firſt thing he demanded
of us was, Whether we were Faſting? We
told him, That we had Dined at <hi>Averſe;</hi> and
the Gentleman's Servant had acquainted him,
that we had been very well Treated. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my Companion, who was not us'd to
Travel, and who found himſelf weary with
his Journy, gave Orders for a Supper to be
made ready, and under the pretext of his not
being very well, he would have them get ſome
freſh Eggs for him. The Hoſt very obligingly
promis'd to get all things ready; but when
Supper-time was come, we found nothing but
two bits of Bread upon the Table, and ſome
Fruit. My Companion ſent word to the Hoſt,
to have the reſt of the Supper ſent up, with
the freſh Eggs; who came himſelf to return
him an Anſwer, which was to this purpoſe,
<hi>That he wiſh'd the Gentleman to call to mind, that
it was a Faſt-Day, and that being a Clergy-Man,
he was oblig'd (more than any one elſe) to give a
good Example; and that in keeping his Faſt, he
would at the ſame time perform two Duties, the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42118:149"/>
firſt in keeping the Fast; and the other by not
offending any one.</hi> This Clergy-Man, that was
not uſed to be reprov'd by Seculars, who ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
dare not Reproach Men of their Coat,
came to great Words with the Hoſt, and told
him, that he had good Friends enough at
<hi>Naples,</hi> that would make him repent of his
Inſolence: The Hoſt, on the other ſide, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him with the Inquiſition, ſaying, <hi>That he
knew no reaſon why he might not be put there, as
well as his Wife, who had lain there already three
Years, for having eaten a little piece of Cheeſe on
a Faſt-Day, when ſhe was Big with Child; and
that ſhe had been Inform'd against by two Prieſts,
who had Lodged in his Houſe, and had committed
there all manner of Exceſſes.</hi> We perceiv'd very
well, that our Hoſt was tranſported with a
very violent Paſſion, and therefore we thought
fit to change our Inn, notwithſtanding that it
was very Late. Foraſmuch as I had had no
manner of Quarrel with him, he did in a
manner Excuſe himſelf to me; proteſting to
me, <hi>That for the ſpace of Twenty two Years that
he had kept an Inn, he never had ſeen ſo much as
one Prieſt or Monk that kept the Fasts of the
Church; tho' they made a great Crime of it, to
thoſe poor Seculars that were Convict of that
Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:42118:149"/>
Becauſe this Adventure has put me upon
mentioning the Faſts of the Papiſts, I ſhall take
occaſion truly to declare to you, after what
manner they obſerve their Faſts in the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and enquire, Whether their Practice
be ſo evident a Mark of the Purity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Communion, as they pretend.
The Faſts Commanded by the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> under the Penalty of Mortal Sin, and
other Chaſtiſements Corporal and Pecuniary,
are, <hi>Lent,</hi> the <hi>Quater Temps,</hi> or <hi>Four Times,</hi>
and the <hi>Vigils</hi> or <hi>Eves.</hi> As for the time of
<hi>Advent,</hi> they leave it to every ones liberty, to
Faſt or not, according as their Devotion or
Inclination ſways them. The Abſtinence from
Meat is inſeparably joyn'd with all their
Faſts; for the Papiſts do not believe, that
any Faſt can be truly kept without abſtaining
from Fleſh-Meat; and they ſuppoſe this to be
the moſt Eſſential part of a Faſt. In thoſe
Countries where the Inquiſition is eſtabliſhed,
thoſe who break their Abſtinence, may fall
under the Rigor of that Tribunal; but in
other Countries, the Biſhops of every Dioceſs
have Power to puniſh Spiritually and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
thoſe that Tranſgreſs this way. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
every Prieſt in particular is obliged, at
Confeſſion, to impoſe upon them ſome Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
equivalent to the Breaking of their
Faſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:42118:150"/>
Now theſe for the moſt part are Pecuniary
Mulcts, becauſe by this means they ſerve two
Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Mortifying their Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
and of Greaſing their own Fiſts. As
for Example, They will order a Perſon, who
hath fail'd of Faſting in any one Day of
<hi>Lent,</hi> to put a Crown into the Pariſh Trunk
or Cheſt, and ſo proportionably if they have
Tranſgreſt oftner. The Prieſts from time to
time take care to empty the Trunk, and
divide the Mony amongſt themſelves. Infants
and Old Men, at a certain Age, are exempt
from Faſting, but not from the Abſtinence
from Meat; and none are excuſed from Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
and from Faſting, ſave only ſuch as
are Sick; and they alſo muſt have an Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Writing, under the Hand of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
that they are really and truly ſo; and
upon this Atteſtation, they grant them a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to Eat Meat, and conſequently not
to Faſt. There be ſome Butchers particularly
Appointed to ſell Fleſh on thoſe Days, with
ſtrict Orders, Not to ſell any Meat, except
to thoſe only who have ſuch a Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Here it is we may take Notice, how hearty
the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are in the Obſervance
of their Faſts, whereof they boaſt ſo much;
for it may be aſſerted of a Truth, that above
three Fourth Parts amongſt them get theſe
Permiſſions from their Phyſicians and Curates,
without any real need, and only for ſome
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42118:150"/>
pretended Sickneſſes, which indeed they are
not afflicted with; or elſe, they make the
moſt of ſome little Indiſpoſitions they are
ſubject to by times, to excuſe them from the
trouble of Faſting. The Phyſicians are obliged
to take their words for it, and the Curates
refer themſelves to the Phyſicians. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
are aſſured, That the more there be
of ſuch Perſons, who in this regard burthen
their Conſciences, the more Mony they ſhall
put into their Pockets at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> when their
Pariſhioners come to Confeſs to them. Thus
we may well ſay, That tho' theſe People
have paid their Butchers for the Meat they
had of them; yet it is not all paid, till they
have Talk'd with their Confeſſor, and ſatisfied
his After-reckoning. As for what concerns
the Prieſts and Monks, they take their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
from themſelves; and there be but
few Clergy-Men to be found, that keep <hi>Lent;</hi>
or in caſt they do, it is with ſuch Profuſion
and Dainties of Fiſh, that makes their Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from Fleſh much more grateful, than the
<hi>Shro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etide,</hi> which uſher'd it in. True it is,
that amongſt the Seculars, there be found
many Poor People, who are not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of making theſe Expences, and who,
fearing to be too high Taxed by their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
at <hi>Easter,</hi> are fain to Faſt the whole
<hi>Lent</hi> out, not without a great deal of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Which is the Reaſon of that Common
Saying among the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42118:151"/>
               <hi>Lent is only for the Poor.</hi> Laſtly, to ſay the
moſt, If amongſt the great Number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
that enjoy Plenty, there be ſome whoſe
Conſciences are tender enough, to put them
upon a Reſolution of Faſting, it is ſtill only
after the manner of <hi>Rome,</hi> which imports,
that they muſt eat no more than Twice aday.
They take their Chief Meal at Noon, and
they may then without ſcruple Eat as much
as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>A Doctor of Phyſick, who had been at
Dinner in a Monaſtery, upon a Faſt-Day,
told me merrily, That theſe Monks had made
him lay in Proviſions enough for Three days,
he had ſo ſtuft his Belly amongſt them. At
Evening they make a Collation, at which
they eat Fruits, Sweet-Meats, and other ſuch
like things; and Fried-Fiſh, amongſt other
things, paſſeth for a Diſh that may be uſed at
Collations.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Cuſtom of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> in their Faſts, was to Eat but once
aday, after Sun-ſet, when Even-ſong was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
but foraſmuch, as this Practice did not
agree with the Delicateneſs of the Clergy,
the Eccleſiaſticks lighted on a pleaſant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
to illude it; They formed an Office,
or Set of Prayers, which they called <hi>Veſpers,</hi>
or <hi>Even-ſong:</hi> And to the end they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Rule of not Eating till after Even-ſong,
they celebrate their Evening-Prayer in
the Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:42118:151"/>
Now if this be not very ridiculous, and if
this be not impudently to Mock at all manner
of Honeſty and Sincerity, I leave you to
judge. Juſt as if the Miniſters of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> ſhould go about to perſuade the
People, That for to eat their Suppers betimes
in the Morning, they need only to ſay their
Evening-Prayer very early.</p>
            <p>The Faſts, as to the quality of the Viands
that are eaten, are very differently obſerved
amongſt the Papiſts: In ſome Countries they
abſtain from Eggs, Butter, and Cheeſe; and
in others, they make no ſcruple of Eating
them. In ſome Countries they expreſs a
very great diſtaſte of <hi>Lent.</hi> I Sojourned two
whole Years at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the
Electoral Archbiſhop, the Firſt Year diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
with the Obſervance of <hi>Lent</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all his Dioceſs, except only the Holy-Week,
or Week before <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Year he Ordered, they ſhould only Faſt
three times a Week. They have a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
way of Faſting in <hi>Germany:</hi> After that
they have eaten a good Dinner in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they may (if they pleaſe) Eat and Drink
all the reſt of the Day, as long as they eat no
hot Meat: They may eat Broth, Fiſh, Eggs, &amp;c.
ſo they be but Cold before they fall upon them;
which is the Reaſon, why in <hi>Germany</hi> they
always take care, to have their Cupboards
well provided with Cold Meats in <hi>Lent</hi> time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:42118:152"/>
Again, there are other places where they are
as ſtrict and ſcrupulous in the obſervance of
<hi>Lent,</hi> eſpecially in the Countries that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dominion of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Prieſts are
bound at <hi>Milan</hi> to Preach a Sermon at the
beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> to take away thoſe Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that may ariſe in the minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
about Faſting and Abſtinence. This
Sermon is always compos'd of Queſtions and
Anſwers, much like the <hi>Athenian Mercury</hi>
we have here in <hi>London,</hi> and every one ſends
his Doubts to the Preacher, who reſolves
them the beſt he can. I once heard one of
theſe Caſuiſtical Sermons in the Church of
S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> where abundance of very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Doubts were propos'd. Amongſt other
things, the Queſtion was asked, <hi>Whether it
were lawful to eat Figs?</hi> And the difficulty
was, becauſe this Fruit contains a ſort of Milk
in it, whilſt it is green, which is turn'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
into that ſweetneſs which is found in
them, when they are fully Ripe; now all
ſorts of white-Meats, that is, things made of
Milk are forbid in <hi>Italy:</hi> The Queſtion was
very Learnedly Reſolv'd in favour of the Figs,
and they were happily incorporated amongſt
the <hi>Lent</hi> Viands, becauſe the Milky Juice in
the Figs contain'd no Cream or Fatneſs,
and becauſe neither Butter nor Cheeſe could
be made of it: And he added this Corollary,
that upon the ſame account, Almond-milk
was a good and lawful <hi>Lent</hi> Meat, and that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42118:152"/>
with it they might prepare their Rice-milk.
I lived for ſome time in a Monaſtery at
<hi>Milan,</hi> where three times a Week, we had
Rice-milk dreſt after this manner, which was
much more delicate, than if it had been
prepar'd with Cows-milk. The Learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at laſt concluded this Queſtion, with
this ſhameleſs Expreſſion, That it was lawful
alſo to eat Mandrakes, notwithſtanding theſe
Fruits did very lively repreſent the Members
of Man and Woman. I beg my Readers
excuſe for making uſe of his own words.</p>
            <p>Another Queſtion was, <hi>Whether at their
Evening Collations, they might dip their Bread in
Wine?</hi> The reaſon of the difficulty was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
according to the Rules of their Faſts,
they are not permitted to eat any <hi>Meneſtre,</hi>
that is, Pottage, at Night; and many believe,
that by dipping their Bread in Wine or Water,
they change the nature of Bread, and make
a kind of Pottage of it. I my ſelf have
ſeen many Perſons, who otherwiſe were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſenſible underſtanding People, who made
no difficulty of eating Bread and Fruit in
abundance in the Evening at their Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to waſh them down with two or
three Bottles of good Wine, who yet in the
mean time made a great ſcruple to dip a bit
of Bread in Wine, and to eat it. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Queſtion was decided in favour of
theſe who did dip their Bread in Wine. He
back'd his Deciſion with an Example very
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42118:153"/>
convincing to a Papiſt, and ſuch as hit the
Nail on the head: When you receive, ſaid
he, the Body of Chriſt in the Communion,
the Prieſt puts a little Wafer into your Mouth,
which immediately is penetrated throughout
with your Spittle; and yet the Faith teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
there ſtill, and that none of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
are corrupted by the humectation
or penetration of the Spittle: In the very
ſame manner (ſaid he) when you Sop your
Bread in Wine, this makes no change at all,
in that which you take, not a jot more than
if you ſhould eat the Bread, and drink your
Wine ſeparately, ſo that you may for time
to come ſafely do it without any ſcruple.
In a word, this Father reſolved a vaſt
number of Difficulties, that had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to him, and which for the moſt part
were of the ſame Stamp with thoſe I have
given you a taſte of.</p>
            <p>Becauſe we are ſpeaking of the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Lent</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> you may take notice,
that <hi>Lent</hi> begins there four days later, than
in all the other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> by a Priviledge
they pretend to hold from S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Now
for theſe four days, a vaſt quantity of People
from all Parts of <hi>Italy</hi> repair thither, to enjoy
this Priviledge; and I have known Perſons
that came above one hundred Leagues;
which ſhews that there is a ſtrange Avidity in
the Papiſts, to eat Fleſh at the time it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42118:153"/>
them. Now theſe days are no ſooner
ended, but all this Crowd makes as much
haſte to get away from thence, as before
they made haſte to get thither; the reaſon is,
becauſe afterwards the <hi>Quadrageſimal</hi> Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
is obſerved with much more rigour
and exactneſs at <hi>Milan,</hi> than in any other
part of <hi>Italy,</hi> excepting only thoſe, that have
Licences, which, as I have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are always in great Numbers. If any one
be found that tranſgreſſeth the Rules of the
<hi>Lent</hi> Faſt, they are ſent immediately to the
Inquiſition, and proceeded againſt as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> will allow of no ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Point, in thoſe Countries that
are ſubject to them. In the time when
<hi>Burgundy</hi> was under <hi>Spain,</hi> they obſerved
the Faſts of the Church much more rigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
than they do now, ſince it is under the
Dominion of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Officer of the great Chapter of <hi>Mentz,</hi>
gave me the Relation of a troubleſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
tho' the paſſages of it be very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
which hapned to him, and three of
the great Canons of <hi>Mentz,</hi> with relation
to Faſting. They had taken a view of the
greateſt part of <hi>France,</hi> and they returned to
their own Country through <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in time
of <hi>Lent.</hi> As they were Travelling from <hi>Dola</hi>
to <hi>Beſançon,</hi> this Officer hapned to kill a
great Hen in the Fields, and the Gentlemen
Canons having Congratulated his good Luck,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42118:154"/>
reſolved to eat it at the firſt Inn they ſhould
come at. Being Arriv'd about Dinner-time,
at the firſt Village they met with, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
a great Fire to be made in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and the Officer commanded them to
bring up a Kettle, without ſaying what he
intended to do with it: Their Hoſteſs brought
them one, but being ſeiz'd with a curioſity
to know what uſe they would put it to; ſhe
ſpi'd them ſo well, that ſhe found they were
Boyling a Hen. Whereupon ſhe preſently
ran out of Doors and told her Neighbours,
who came all running away in Throngs, no
otherwiſe than if the Houſe had been on
Fire. The Hoſteſs led them the way to the
Chamber of theſe Gentlemen, and in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Tranſport, demanded her Kettle again;
they deſired her to have Patience a little, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her that what they had put into it,
was almoſt Boyled; but the Woman in a
great rage, ſnatch'd the Kettle from off the
Fire, and the Officer forc'd it from her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
to have his Hen.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Neighbours all
came up at the Noiſe, and belching forth
the moſt execrable Oaths, (which were far
worſe than the breaking of the Faſt,) threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Gentlemen to kill them immediately,
if they did not render themſelves Priſoners.
Theſe Grand Canons, who were all of them
Lords of great Quality, in vain call'd up for
their Foot-Boys, dreſt in their rich Liveries,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42118:154"/>
and put off their Riding Coats, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their rich Silk Habits, and ſhewed
them their Golden Croſſes and the fair Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
hanging about their Necks. Theſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous
Peaſants, in ſpite of all they could ſhew
or alledge, made them get on Horſe-back,
and having bound them with Cords, in a
moſt ignominious manner, they Conducted
them with a ſtrange Hue and Cry, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Par-boil'd Hen ty'd to the top of a
Staff, before them, till they came to the City
of <hi>Beſançon,</hi> which was about Eight Leagues
from the Village, inſulting over them with
a thouſand Affronts all along the Way, as if
they had been Hereticks.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were come into the City,
a vaſt Throng of People came from all Parts
to ſee them, flinging Dirt and Stones at them,
and crying aloud, Burn them alive; Burn them
alive. They brought them in this Poſture
ſtraight to the Archbiſhop, who being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
inform'd who they were, brought
them into one of the Dining-Rooms of his
Palace, and had very much ado to appeaſe
the Rabble. After that he had ſignified to
them the Humour of the People of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and the extream Danger to which they
had expos'd themſelves, he expreſt to them
the ſenſible Regret he had for the Affront
they had received, and ſhewed them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Civilities, in Token of the Reſpect he
bore to the Canons of the moſt Noble
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42118:155"/>
Chapter, that was in the whole Empire. And
the next day very early in the Morning,
he let them eſcape by a back Door, for fear
of their being Torn to pieces by the Rabble.
See here what an Extravagant Zeal for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Obſervances is capable to produce;
neither Civility, nor Virtue, nor Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to gave Check to the furious Effects
thereof. Jeſus Chriſt certainly never left us
any ſuch Spirit, or any ſuch Religion. It
wanted but very little of our falling into the
ſame Trouble, by the Imprudence of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
the Evening we Arriv'd in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
of <hi>Naples;</hi> and had they put us into
the Inquiſition, it would have been much
worſe with us.</p>
            <p>I do not in the leaſt diſapprove of Faſts;
but on the contrary think them to be both
commendable and uſeful for a Chriſtian to
Exerciſe them, eſpecially when accompanied
with Prayers and Alms-giving, for the humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of our Souls, and the ſubduing and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
our Bodies to the Spirit; that is, for
the Mortifying our Brutal Paſſions, which
commonly owe their force and vigour to a
healthy pamper'd State of the Body, and too
great Repletion; and to give the Spirit a
greater liberty and agility in the practice of
Virtue. Nay, what is more, I could wiſh
with all my Heart, that Chriſtians would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
themſelves by times alltogether, in this
good Practice, to the End of Encouraging
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42118:155"/>
one another by their good Examples, and by
their Union in ſo good a Work, to draw
down upon themſelves the Heavenly Bleſſing.
But I cannot by any means approve the
going about to force People to this Duty, by
the Confiſcation of all their Goods, by Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Fire, and by a moſt pitileſs and
cruel Inquiſition. I don't believe, that God
ever gave ſuch Power to Men over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as to proceed to ſuch barbarous and
inhuman Conſtraints; and thoſe who pretend
to ſuch a Power, ought not to be called
<hi>Paſtors,</hi> but <hi>Robbers</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi> who are
got into the Sheepfold only, to rob, deſtroy
and kill.</p>
            <p>The next Morning betimes we Entred the
City of <hi>Naples,</hi> where I made a Stay of
Three Weeks. I went to Viſit the Great
Hoſpital for the Sick, which without doubt
is very well Adminiſtred; neither is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of it in the Hands of Monks and
Prieſts; but the Nobility of <hi>Naples</hi> have the
whole ordering of it. I was extreamly edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to ſee a Score of Gentlemen, Knights,
Earls and Marqueſſes, who ſerved there in
their Turns by Weeks, and who themſelves
carried Broth and Meat to the Sick, having
their great Rapiers by their Sides, after the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mode, with a Neatneſs and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
capable of alleviating the Maladies of
theſe poor Patients. The Apartment for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42118:156"/>
was up Stairs, who were ſerved in the
ſame manner by Noble Matrons. I have
Viſited many other Hoſpitals in <hi>Italy,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Sick-People, which were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by Fryers, whom they call <hi>Brothers of
Charity;</hi> but never met with any thing that
might be compared with that of <hi>Naples.</hi>
Theſe Monks are commonly very peeviſh and
croſs, and frequently Abuſe the Sick with
Words and Stroaks, after having taken to
their own ſhare, the beſt part of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
that are ſent to the poor Sick. I could
not keep my ſelf, upon a time, from ſaying
to one of theſe Monks, who had Beaten one
of the poor Sick, That that Action of his
ſtruck me with Horrour. To Excuſe himſelf,
he told me, <hi>That I did not know that Sick
Perſon ſo well as he did, and that he was one of
thoſe, who notwithſtanding that they are perfectly
Cured, do yet complain continually, only that they
may remain ſtill in the Hoſpital; and that to
make them weary of it, they were forced to Abuſe
them in this manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had none of all theſe baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Conſiderations in this Great Hoſpital of
<hi>Naples;</hi> on the contrary, they took Methods
quite oppoſite to thoſe now mention'd, to
incline thoſe that were recovered to leave the
Hoſpital. Whilſt they are Sick, they are
kept ſtrictly to the Rules the Phyſicians Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
concerning them, who direct the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and quality of their Meat and Drink;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42118:156"/>
which they execute with a punctuality that is
to admiration. Afterwards, when the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
declare that they are wholly Cured, they
continue them there ſtill for Three Weeks,
and they are Treated Morning and Evening
with all ſorts of delicate Viands, boyl'd and
roaſted; and ſerv'd with the choiceſt Fruits
and beſt Wine, in ſuch a quantity, as may
moſt contribute to the ſtrengthning and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
of them, without doing them any
prejudice. At the end of the Three Weeks,
thoſe that want Cloaths have them beſtow'd
upon them, and a piece of Mony beſides;
and ſo are ſent away. By this means there
is never a Poor Patient in the Hoſpital, but
wiſheth, that this Three Weeks time were
come for him too, to be ſo Nobly Entertain'd:
And by this means, they are put to no trouble,
to diſcharge their Hoſpital of thoſe who are
Recovered.</p>
            <p>The Great Hoſpital of <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſome
others of <hi>Italy,</hi> are almoſt Adminiſtred after
the ſame manner. I could wiſh the <hi>Italians</hi>
would be adviſed, not to truſt their Charities
to Prieſts and Monks, ſo much as they do,
who, for the moſt part, have the moſt pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and inhuman Hearts that can be: For
indeed this is a Curſe which God pours forth
upon them, for being the Authors of ſo
many Idolatrous Practices and Profanations
they are guilty of; to give them a Heart as
herd and unrelenting, as that of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:42118:157"/>
They would do much better, to take the
pains of diſtributing their Alms themſelves;
becauſe we find, that in thoſe Places where
they do ſo, things are managed in ſo noble
and generous a manner.</p>
            <p>Having taken a View of the Hoſpital of
<hi>Naples,</hi> I ſpent ſome part of my time to go
and ſee the Fair Churches of that great and
ſtately City; which indeed are ſuch, that
nothing can be ſeen more Rich, Magnificent,
or Beautiful: There is ſcarely the leaſt Pariſh
Church, which is not all Gilt and Painted
from the top to the bottom. All the Altars
and Chapels are built of Precious Stones; and
there is never a Church, but hath Silver-Candleſticks,
Baſons, and Lamps in great
numbers, without counting the Shrines and
Caſes for their Relicks and their Croſſes,
that for the moſt part are of pure Gold:
Which made a Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> ſay, <hi>That
if all the Churches of that City were made into
One, and that all their Riches made up but One
Treaſury, it would by far ſurpaſs in Beauty and
Riches the very Temple of</hi> Solomon; <hi>and that
by this means, there might be ſeen at this Day,
to the Honour of the</hi> Neapolitans, <hi>ſomething more
glorious, than was that which in past Ages had
been the Admiration of all the World.</hi> For my
part, I do truly believe, that in making this
Imaginary Union of the Churches of <hi>Naples,</hi>
it would by far ſurpaſs in ſumptuouſneſs the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42118:157"/>
ſame Union we might conceive of all the
Churches of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet muſt we not conclude
from hence, that therefore the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> are
the better Men; God having made it appear
two or three years ago, that he cares little for
theſe Material Temples, by permitting the
moſt part of all thoſe fair and ſumptuous
Churches, to be overthrown by a dreadful
Earthquake.</p>
            <p>It would be much better in my Opinion,
to take away all the ſuperfluous Ornaments of
Churches, and to turn them into a Stock,
for the Entertainment of the Poor of the
Pariſh, who are the Temples of the Holy
Ghoſt, than to ſtudy Night and Day, to
embeliſh Pillars and Dead-Walls. This with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt would be much more pleaſing to
God, than all the fair and ſtately Fabricks
that could be built. It is ſufficient, that the
Places where we Meet to worſhip God, be
decently Adorn'd, without any thing of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
Coſtlineſs, and convenient for the
Faithful that Aſſemble there; but it is the
holding forth of a falſe Notion of Religion,
to go about to perſuade Chriſtians, as the
Popiſh-Prieſts endeavour to do, <hi>That the more
luſtrous and dazelling their Churches are with
Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones; the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
the Holy Ghoſt pours forth of his Graces
and Bleſſings on them.</hi> One of the faireſt and
moſt ſumptuous Churches of <hi>Naples,</hi> was that
of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> ſave only that the Length of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42118:158"/>
it was not anſwerable to the Breadth of it;
and yet all Rich and Beautiful as it was, we
ſee the late Earthquake took no pity of it,
but in a manner totally overthrew it. This
probably will give an occaſion to the Fathers,
to build another more proportionable, and
probably alſo more Rich and more Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent.</p>
            <p>All manner of Monks and Religious live
generally very richly and plentifully at <hi>Naples,</hi>
and all of them have many Monaſteries and
Convents there of their own Order; but
none of them all are more Rich and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> they are they that have
all the Nobility at command, who do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without them: 'Tis by their means
Men get into Places and Offices: There are
no Matches made, which they have not a
hand in; yea, they ſtoop ſo low, as to take
care of furniſhing them with Men and Maid-Servants.
And indeed there is more Policy
in this laſt Point, than one would imagine.
We muſt not be ſo weak to think their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
puts them upon theſe kind of Services,
but rather their own Intereſt; for by this
means they have conſtant Intelligence of
whatſoever paſſeth in all Families, and are
ſure of a Party, who will diſpoſe all things
in favour of them, upon occaſion. But if the
Perſons thus placed, ſhould chance in the leaſt
to diſoblige them, as they have found the
means of getting them in, ſo they will ſoon
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42118:158"/>
find a way to turn them out again: Which
makes, That theſe Servants, for the moſt
part, had rather betray their own Maſters,
than to hazard the diſpleaſure of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi>
as being aſſured, That if their Maſters, at the
worſt, ſhould come to diſcover their Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> will either make their
Peace, or do their endeavour to ſeek out for
them another Condition, that may be more
for their Advantage. But if they ſhould
chance to offend the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> they had as
good go out of the World. All the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
of <hi>Italy,</hi> for ſome Years ſince, have followed
the Model the Fathers of <hi>Naples</hi> have given
them, to place Servants and Maids; and
generally all thoſe that have a mind to enter
upon any Service whatſoever. Inſomuch,
that People go and Addreſs themſelves to the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> there, as here in <hi>London</hi> they go to
the Offices of Intelligence, with this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
only, That inſtead of giving a piece of
Mony, they oblige themſelves, to be their
Slaves for ever.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this great Acceſs
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have every where, and that they
are ſo Rich and Potent; yet it may be alſo
with Truth affirmed, that they are at this
day generally hated of all the World. The
Princes and Grandees have no further eſteem
for them, but as they fear to hazard the
ruining of their Affairs, ſhould they once
offer to diſoblige them; but at the bottom,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42118:159"/>
and in truth, they love them not. The
Common People alſo are very weary of
ſeeing themſelves reduced to Slavery, under
the inſolent Domination of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who
Command them in the moſt Imperious and
Servile manner that can be: And generally
all ſorts of Prieſts, Monks, and Religious, hate
them mortally, as being their greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and a ſort of People, that carry it
towards them with Loftineſs and Diſdain,
who have already deprived them of a great
part of their Temporal Revenues, and who
probably will find themſelves ſtrong enough
one day, to invade all the reſt. Some very
Intelligent Perſons have Caſt the Account,
that they have already uſurped near one half
of the Goods belonging to the Order of
S. <hi>Bennet.</hi> They make Kings and Princes
to grant them whatſoever they pleaſe, and
they are continually begging ſome Abbies
or Priories of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> either to make Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of them, or to unite them to their
Profeſt Houſes. What is more, they make
themſelves Maſters of, and invade them with
the extreameſt Inſolence.</p>
            <p>I had a Letter ſhewn me once, which the
Father Rector of the College of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
of <hi>Clermont</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> writ to the Father
Prior of the Abby of S. <hi>Benignus</hi> of <hi>Dijon,</hi>
upon account of the Priory of <hi>Laris,</hi> which

               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:42118:159"/>
and which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had a mind to
get for themſelves; which runs thus:</p>

as it is at preſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are like to Drones, who enter
upon the Labours of others, and eat the Bees
Hony: They are the laſt come into the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42118:160"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet they are the firſt
in Power, in numbers of Houſes, and in
Riches. The great number of Colleges they
have, ſurpaſſeth all belief.</p>
            <p>And now I am ſpeaking of their Colleges,
it brings to my mind a very ingenious Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram
which one of their Scholars made at
<hi>Dola</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> upon occaſion of their
taking Poſſeſſion of a College which they
have there, and is called <hi>l' Arc,</hi> or <hi>the Bow.</hi>
The <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who was the Rhetorick Regent,
told his Scholars, That they knew very well
that the Famous College of <hi>la Fleſche,</hi> in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> belonged to the Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
and that now, by a wonderful and
Divine Providence, the Magiſtrate of <hi>Dola</hi>
had beſtowed upon them the <hi>Piazza</hi> and
fair Buildings of <hi>l' Arc;</hi> wherefore his Will
was, That they ſhould endeavour every one
of them, to make an Epigram upon this ſo
happy an Encounter, propoſing a Reward to
him that ſhould beſt acquit himſelf of the
Task. They accordingly, all of them, ſet
their Wits upon the Rack to produce ſomething
more than ordinary upon ſo rare a Subject.
Some flatter'd them, That with this their
<hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Arrow</hi> (for this is the Engliſh of
<hi>l' Arc &amp; la Fleſche)</hi> they would ſooner or later
ſubjugate the World: Others applying it to
their Doctrin, ſaid, That the <hi>Bow</hi> by its
ſtrength repreſented the Solidity of it, and
the piercing Point of the <hi>Arrow,</hi> the Subtilty
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42118:160"/>
thereof: Others, that were greater Liars than
the reſt, or it may be alſo to Laugh at them
in their Sleeves, ſaid, That the Piety and
Vertue of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> lifted them up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as the <hi>Bow</hi> doth the <hi>Arrow.</hi> But the
moſt happy and lucky Wit of all was his,
who made this moſt excellent pat Diſtick:
<q>
                  <l>Arcum <hi>Dola</hi> dedit Patribus, dedit Alma Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Gallia;</hi> quis Funem quem meruere dabit?</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Fair <hi>France</hi> the Arrow, <hi>Dola</hi> gave the Bow;</l>
                  <l>Who ſhall the String, ſo well deſerv'd, bestow?</l>
               </q>
It's without Controverſie, that the Scholar
who made this, had beſt deſerved the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Recompence; but inſtead thereof he
was ſhamefully expell'd the College. For my
part, I wiſh neither Halter nor Death to
theſe Fathers, only I could wiſh, from a
Spirit of Chriſtian Charity, that they would
once ſeriouſly think of changing their Evil
Ways, and that they would not drag along
with them, as they do, ſo many Thouſands
down the way of Perdition. Or at leaſt, I
could heartily wiſh, they would give over the
Profaning the Holy Name of JESUS, by
appropriating it to themſelves. Of all the
Popes that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has had, there is
not one to be found, that ever durſt take to
himſelf the Name of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> out of the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42118:161"/>
reſpect they had to that Apoſtle; and yet
theſe Wretches have had the Effrontery, to
take to themſelves that of our Adorable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
inſomuch that I cannot name the
Name of JESUS, but theſe Wretches imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
come to my mind. Yea, they are
the cauſe, why many People whom they give
occaſion to Curſe them, pronounce that Holy
Name moſt Irreverently, mingling it with
the wicked Words and Revilings they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon.</p>
            <p>I don't pretend to any thing of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
yet durſt I almoſt venture to Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate
thus much, That like as this Order
of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> hath in a very ſhort time
raiſed it ſelf to a prodigious Greatneſs, ſo it
won't be long, before it take a Fall equal
to its Elevation. Its own weight ſhall ſink
it, <hi>Mole ruet ſuâ,</hi> and its Ruin ſhall drag the
Diſſolution of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> along with
it. For then Peoples Eyes will be opened, to
ſee how ſhamefully they have been abuſed
and gull'd by a Company of Men, who
pretending to be the Pillars of the Church,
and profeſſing the outſide of Vertue, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the Subſtance thereof. God grant that
Atheiſm may not thrive by the approaching
Wreck of that Church; but that all at that
time may terminate in a holy Reformation,
whereof the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath already
given ſo perfect a Model.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:42118:161"/>
The Jeſuits are they who have the faireſt
and richeſt Churches not only at <hi>Naples,</hi> but
alſo throughout almoſt all the other parts of
<hi>Italy;</hi> and they are alſo the beſt Men of the
World, according to the Senſe I have already
explained. After having taken a view of
their Colleges and Churches in this Noble
City, I had a favourable occaſion offered me,
of ſeeing the Relicks of S. <hi>Januarius,</hi> which
are kept in the Cathedral, and where the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks boaſt of having a perpetual
Miracle: For they ſhew you a Vial full of
Blood, averring it to be that of S. <hi>January,</hi>
which as ſoon as it is brought near to his
Body, turns to Liquor. The Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Burnet,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> has, in
his Letters, given us his Opinion concerning
this Relick, which is very probable. As for
my part, tho' I was a Prieſt of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they did not ſo far Honour me,
as to let me handle the Vial, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Blood, notwithſtanding my earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to obtain that favour. This indeed
made me ſomewhat Suſpicious of the Relick;
for if a Prieſt hath the Power and Authority
of handling the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the
Euchariſt after Conſecration, he may very well,
I ſhould think, be allow'd to touch all other
ſorts of Relicks, which are ſo far inferiour to
that. I imagined therefore, and not without
reaſon, that there might be ſome Concavities
in the Glaſs, which contain'd a reddiſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42118:162"/>
which the Prieſts, who knew the Trick
of it, could when ever they pleas'd, cauſe to
be diffuſed over the middle of the Glaſs.
They declare to all Perſons that come to ſee
this Relick, that a Heretick was once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
at the ſight of this Miracle; ſo
that here is now a Second Miracle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
to confirm and prove the firſt.</p>
            <p>I ſaw ſince at <hi>Milan,</hi> a Miniſter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
who was turned Papiſt at <hi>Turin,</hi> and
after that he had Travelled over all <hi>Italy,</hi>
and amongſt the reſt had ſeen the Relick
of S. <hi>January;</hi> I asked him, What he
thought of it? He deſired me in the Name
of God, not to ſpeak to him about it, for
fear it ſhould raiſe thoſe thoughts in him,
that might encline him to turn Heretick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
For he told me, that when the Prieſts
were about to ſhew it him, they fell into
the greateſt Confuſion imaginable, becauſe
the Spring of the Machin, would not Play;
but at laſt they ſhak'd the Bottle ſo long,
till they made a ſhift to ſhew him ſomething,
that was Reddiſh and Liquid. He added
that another Miniſter, who had abjur'd with
him at <hi>Turin,</hi> and who was there at the ſame
time preſent with him, proteſted to him, at
their coming out of the Church, that for
his part he had ſeen enough, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to return to <hi>Geneva.</hi> So that we ſee
here a Saint that is an Ambo-dexter, and
Works Miracles both ways, by making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42118:162"/>
turn Papiſts, and the Papiſts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
The ſame Gentleman proteſted to
me, that if he had no other Reaſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, that
Miracle would never have had the Efficacy,
to perſuade him of the Truth of it, as they
pretended it had done others.</p>
            <p>I had alſo another Queſtion to ask of this
New-Papiſt, which was, <hi>How the Hereticks
liv'd at Geneva?</hi> Becauſe being a New-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
and having been a Miniſter there, I
hoped he would diſcover ſomething Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
concerning their Practices. He told
me, that he could not tell me of any Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtititious
Practice that they had, nor of any
Fraud or wicked Action, that they Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to Engage the People to their Party;
and that almoſt all their publick Acts of
Religion, conſiſted in theſe four things; the
Reading of the Holy Scripture, the Singing
of Pſalms, Preaching, and Celebrating the
Lord's Supper. I prayed him alſo to tell me
ſincerely, <hi>Whether what I had heard reported
of them, from my firſt Youth, were true or no?</hi>
viz. <hi>that they have the Figure of a Devil in
their Churches? and that as ſoon as the Sermon
is Ended, all the</hi> Hugonots <hi>went and Prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelves before it, and Worſhip'd it?</hi>
(This is that Story the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſo often tell
to their Scolars, in their Schools, to inſpire
them with Horror againſt the Hereticks;)
His Anſwer was, that it was a very great Lie,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42118:163"/>
and that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had ſo great an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for all ſorts of Images in their Churches,
that they never ſuffer'd any to be there;
neither of God, nor of the Angels, nor of
the Saints, nor of the Devil. So that it ſeems
he could tell me nothing, that might give me
any Diſeſteem for the Proteſtants; but on
the contrary, he very much Diminiſhed the
falſe Idea, they had given me of them. He
only declared, that the ſole Reaſon that
had inclin'd him to leave them was, becauſe
he believed their Doctrin not to be Sound,
and that they put a falſe Interpretation on the
Scriptures. In a word, he did not believe,
ſaid he, that their Divinity was good. But
indeed he could not ſay leſs, to make Men
believe he was a Papiſt.</p>
            <p>I have ſince made this Reflection, that it
is ſome kind of Proof of the true Religion,
when thoſe who leave it, have nothing to
object againſt the Manners or Practices of
thoſe who profeſs it. I defie a Proteſtant that
leaves the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to turn Papiſt,
to Ridicule or Diſapprove the leaſt Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that is practiſed in the ſame; for ſhould
he do this, he muſt either Scoff at the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, or the Common Prayers,
or the ſinging of Pſalms, or at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and this is that they cannot do, becauſe
theſe are Acts of Religion, which are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the ſaid Church, with an Exemplary
Devotion, and without any Superſtition at all.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42118:163"/>
But the Caſe is not the ſame, with thoſe who
Abandon the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for they can
tell you a thouſand things that are in Vogue
there, the bare Relation of which, without
any the leaſt change or exaggeration, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but excite the Diſeſteem or Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of honeſt and good Men.</p>
            <p>But to return again to <hi>Naples;</hi> after having
Viſited the Churches and Relicks, I had the
Curioſity one Evening, to go and take a
Walk before the Haven, where three of the
Pope's Gallies were Arriv'd that day, and I
entred into all three of them, to ſee how
the poor Gally-Slaves were treated there.
I muſt acknowledge that my Heart was not
Stanch enough to reſiſt the Motions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
at ſo pitiful a Spectacle. The Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Cruelty of the Maſters that beat them,
ſurpaſſeth a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y thing I can tell you of it.
I could not conceive how Chriſtians, could
have the Heart, to handle with ſo much Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
thoſe who were their Brethren in
Chriſt. 'True it is, I repreſented to my
ſelf, that all theſe were miſerable Wretches,
that had been Condemned for their Crimes,
and that Crimes were to be Puniſhed.</p>
            <p>As I was entertaining my ſelf with theſe
ſad Thoughts, I caſt my Eyes upon Three
of them, who ſeemed to me to be New-Comers,
and who were all faſtned to the
ſame Bench. One of theſe Three hid his
Face with his Hands, and another of them
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42118:164"/>
Beckned me to come to him. As ſoon as I
was come near, he asked me, Whether I did
not know him? I could not of a ſudden call
him to mind, becauſe they had cut his Hair;
and beſides, his Gally-Slaves Habit had much
diſguis'd him: But having Ey'd him with
more attention, I knew him to be a Perſon,
who had been the Steward of a Cardinal at
<hi>Rome.</hi> He told me, <hi>That the two others, who
were of each ſide of him, were Monks, who had
left their Monaſteries, and had lived ſometime at</hi>
Rome <hi>Incognito, under a Secular Garb.</hi> The
Steward told me, <hi>He had been Accuſed, of
having wiſh'd for the Death of his Maſter; and
the Cardinal ſometime after having found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a little Indiſpoſed, he firmly believ'd, That
his Steward had Poyſon'd him.</hi> They aſſured
me, all Three of them, That they had been
diſcovered, or rather betray'd by means of
their Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>No Body at <hi>Rome</hi> knew, that theſe Two
unhappy Wretches were Monks; only the
Humor took one of them, to go to diſcover
himſelf in Confeſſion, and to make mention
alſo of his Companion; and the very next
Day they were both of them ſeized and ſent
to the Gallies, withou telling them why, or
for what. As for the Steward, he told me,
<hi>It was but a few Days ſince, that he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
the ſecret Hatred he had against his
Master; and his Confeſſor, who was always
very Welcom at the Cardinal's Houſe, had Informed
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42118:164"/>
him thereof; which made him interpret a ſmall
Fit of the Colick, he had ſoon after, to be an
effect of the Poyſon his Steward had given him;
and that upon this Cruel and Ill-grounded-Suſpicion,
he ſent him, whom he ſuppoſed to be the Author
of it, to the Gallies.</hi> They all Three of them
wiſh'd earneſtly, That the Gally in which
they were, might be ſhatter'd to pieces
againſt ſome Rock or other, or ſink-down to
rights in the Sea, foraſmuch as Death would
prove much more acceptable to them, than
the Slavery to which they were reduc'd: But
they proteſted, That if by any other more
happy Accident they ever came to be ſet at
Liberty, they would never hear of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
any more, nor of a pretended Secret,
which was never kept, and for which they now
paid ſo dearly.</p>
            <p>This had led us to a Point which is of a
very large extent, and wherein the Papiſts
make one of the chief Parts of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Confeſſion of Sins.</hi>
Of all the Practices that in proceſs of time
have been introduc'd into the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> there is none at which I am more
aſtoniſhed, than at this, and wherein the
Artifice of the Monks and Prieſts hath been
more ſubtilly employ'd. There is nothing
more pleaſing to the World, than to know
the moſt ſecret Thoughts, and the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of Mens Hearts; but on the other hand,
neither is there any thing which Men are
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42118:165"/>
more loath to impart to others, becauſe of
the Ill uſe may be made of it. The Angels
take an unutterable pleaſure mutually to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
their Thoughts, and reciprocally
to receive this knowledge from each other;
foraſmuch as being confirmed in Grace, they
cannot hurt one another. But the Nature of
Man, ſince the miſerable Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſo
extreamly corrupted, and his inclination to
Evil is ſo great, that a man that ſhould ſpeak
all he thinks, and all that he does, would
expoſe himſelf to a thouſand Dangers: Which
is the Reaſon why Secrecy, which in the
ſtate of Innocency would have prov'd very
uſeleſs, is at this time, in this ſtate of
Corruption, become a neceſſary Vertue;
as being a main ground of his ſecurity and
ſafety.</p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe, that a Perſon had the
power to penetrate into the Thoughts and
Hearts of others, how great an Advantage
might he draw thence, to further his own
Affairs? For if this Perſon were of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Humor, it would be enough for him,
by his knowledge of other Mens Thoughts,
to Addreſs himſelf to ſuch Men, as he knew
might be eaſily gain'd to endeavour his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
If he was Covetous, he would only
Converſe with thoſe whom he knew to be
of a Liberal Heart, and whom he might
eaſily perſuade to gratifie him. If he were
addicted to ſenſual and infamous Pleaſures,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42118:165"/>
he might, without ever fearing a Repulſe,
confidently apply himſelf to thoſe who had
the moſt Luſtful Inclinations. A Revengful
Perſon needed only to betake himſelf to thoſe
who were of a Bloody and Inhuman Temper,
to make them the Executors of his Revenge.
A General of an Army would not ſtand in
need of Spies; but knowing all the Deſigns
of his Enemy, he would be thereby Inſtructed
how to order his own Actions and Conduct;
he might always be ſure of his Blow, and
could never be taken at a Surprize. Beſides,
what a pleaſure and diverſion it would be to
him, to tickle his Fancy with a thouſand
Maggots and fooliſh Thoughts, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
flutter in the Heads of moſt Men, and
which would be no leſs divertizing, than
the moſt merry Comedies and ridiculous
Farces.</p>
            <p>In a word, having conſidered all, we may
well aſſert, That nothing would either be
more pleaſant or profitable, than this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Knowledge of the Thoughts of Mens
Hearts. And this is the very thing the Prieſts
and Monks of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have in
ſome ſort procur'd to themſelves by means of
their <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> as they are pleas'd
to call it. To bring about this Advantagious
Deſign, they make uſe of the 23th Verſe of
the XXth Chapter of S. <hi>John; Whoſoever Sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Sins ye retain, they are retained:</hi> And
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42118:166"/>
of Verſe <hi>16th</hi> of the Fifth Chapter of the
Epiſtle of S. <hi>James; Confeſs your Faults one to
another:</hi> The former of which Texts they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
concerning the Power, they pretend
to have been given them, to pardon Sins; and
the other, of that Auricular Confeſſion, which
they pretend muſt be made to the Prieſts.
At the firſt, they Confeſſed their Sins only in
General; or if they ſpecified any, they were
ſuch as had been Publick, and had given
Scandal to others; but, by little and little,
they have obliged Perſons to Confeſs their
moſt Secret Sins, and that with all the moſt
particular Circumſtances thereto belonging.
Nay, beſides all this, they will have Perſons
Confeſs to them, all their Evil Inclinations;
that is to ſay, they will know where the
Strength or Weakneſs of a Perſon lies, before
he ſhall get out of their Hands.</p>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion they make to you at
Confeſſion is, Who you are? Your Quality,
Condition, and Way of Living? Afterwards,
they ask, What you have done; the Place
where you committed the Sin; the Means and
Inſtruments you have made uſe of, to put it
in execution; the End you had in doing it;
the Manner of your Committing it; at what
Time, and with whom you have Sinned; and
how often you have Committed the ſame
Sin? In a word, a dextrous Confeſſor knows
ſo well how to ſearch and ſift his Penitent,
that nothing ſhall eſcape his Scrutiny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:42118:166"/>
I ſhould certainly make the Papiſts Bluſh,
ſhould I begin to relate here the Confeſſion
of their Whores, and what Queſtions the
Prieſts put to them; but I bleſs God, I have
not Impudence enough to undertake it; and
I ſhould be very loath, to blot the Paper with
what the Prieſts and Monks of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> make no Bones to mingle with their
Sacrament of <hi>Penance.</hi> I ſhall only tell you,
That the avidity and eagerneſs wherewith the
Prieſts ſhew themſelves carried, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
of thoſe that are of the Female Sex,
make it very apparent, how much Pleaſure
they take in putting Queſtions to them, and
Hearing of their Anſwers. They will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
a Man's Confeſſion in leſs than Half an
Hours time; but if they have got a Handſom-Woman
to Task, they will keep her in a
Confeſſional-Chat two or three Hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I ſhall never forget a Stratagem, ſome
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> Scholars made uſe of, to Tole their
Father Confeſſor to the Confeſſing-Chair.
The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> oblige their Scholars, to Confeſs
themſelves every Holy-day or Feſtival in the
Year, and that under the Penalty of being
Whipt, in caſe of Neglect; ſo that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this Duty rather out of Fear of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than from any Spirit of Penitence and
Devotion. In the mean time the Confeſſors,
who are appointed to take their Confeſſions,
are not at all earneſt to diſcharge that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42118:167"/>
Function; but let their Penitents lie often four
or five Hours on their Knees in the Church,
before ever they come at them. The Scholars
had agreed to Play a Match at Tennice, as
ſoon as they ſhould be diſmiſt from Confeſſion,
but did not know by what means to get
themſelves diſpatch'd. The Fathers Confeſſors
were all Playing at Bowls in their Garden,
and as often as any of the Scholars came to
ask for them, they were ſent away with this
Anſwer, That <hi>the Fathers were engaged in
Meditation.</hi> At laſt, as they were pumping
for ſomething that might relieve them, they
call'd to mind, that a pretty young Woman,
called <hi>Aliſon,</hi> ſpent almoſt every Day three or
four Hours in the Confeſſional with the Father
Rector; whereupon they deputed one of their
Company, to go and tell him, <hi>That Madam</hi>
Aliſon <hi>waited for him at the Confeſſional.</hi> The
Father immediately left his Game at Bowls,
and ran all in a Sweat to his Confeſſional;
where he found none but this Troop of young
Scholars, whom he did not much care to
Confeſs. Wherefore to rid himſelf of them,
he diſpatch'd them a Great Benediction,
telling them, <hi>That he knew already what they
had to ſay, and that they had nothing but ſome
Scholars Sins to Confeſs to him, which did not
once deſerve a Formal Abſolution;</hi> and ſo ſent
them away very well ſatisfied with his quick
Riddance. However, conſidering with how
much Expedition he had diſmiſt them, they
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42118:167"/>
ſaid to one another; <hi>Well, certainly we have
great Reaſon to Bleſs God, that we have not ſo
many Sins to Confeſs, as Madam</hi> Aliſon <hi>has;
for otherwiſe he would not have made an end
of Confeſſing us all, till to Morrow Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis in theſe Confeſſionals, that the Prieſts
and Monks do Court their Miſtreſſes. I once
chanc'd to find in one of the Sides of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional,
an Amorous Letter, which an <hi>Italian</hi>
Monk had writ to his Lady. An Old Woman,
who was come on purpoſe to Confeſſion, to
receive the ſaid Letter, had by Miſchance
dropt it, as ſhe came out of the Confeſſional.
The Letter was full of Wit: He told her,
<hi>That the greateſt Sin ſhe ever had committed in
her Life-time was, that ſhe had not been ſo good
as her Word in coming to Confeſſion that Week:
If this Neglect did proceed from the difficulty ſhe
found to Love him, he had a Penance ready Cut
out for her; which was to Command her to Love
him better.</hi> I don't remember the reſt of the
Letter; only thus much I can tell you, that
it was ſtuft with nothing but Flouriſhes and
Love, and there was no Name ſubſcrib'd to
it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have a quick Ear, and draw
near to theſe Confeſſionals, do often hear
pretty Stories. There ſometimes happen great
Tumults in the Convents, and amongſt the
Prieſts, upon the account of young Women
Penitents: For if any of them do chance to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42118:168"/>
change their Confeſſor, this Alteration cauſeth
great Jealouſies, which many times are not
extinguiſh'd, but by Poyſon, or with the
Blood of one of the Competitors; for they
preſently interpret it, as if the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
had by his Artifices allured, and (as it
were) debauched his Penitent.</p>
            <p>A Father <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> very Famous for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> deſired me to
make his Peace with a Gentlewoman of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who, for ſome time, had left off coming
to Confeſſion to him. The Lady told me,
<hi>That ſhe was astoniſhed, to hear the Father talk
of making his Peace with her; that for her part,
ſhe had never had any the leaſt Quarrel with
him; and that the only Reaſon, why ſhe had not
Confeſt to him of late was, becauſe it was more
for her Convenience to go to the</hi> Carmelites, <hi>as
being nearer to her Houſe.</hi> When I return'd
this Anſwer to the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> his Colour chang'd
of a ſudden, and he appear'd to be in a
ſtrange agitation of Spirit. In a word, a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeiz'd him the ſame Night, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Lady, for fear of giving any occaſion
to his Death, ſent him word, <hi>That ſhe would
come and Confeſs to him for time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt Secret they have to allure La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to Confeſſion is, to be very Complaiſant
to them, to ſooth them with a company of
ſweet Words, to teſtifie their loving of them
Tenderly, and from the Bottom of their
Hearts. Sometimes they find it very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42118:168"/>
at firſt, to make them Confeſs as
they ought, that is, Clearly and Plainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mincing of the Matter, and with all
the Circumſtances of ſome ſhameful Sins, and
eſpecially thoſe of the Fleſh. They are fain
to take a great Compaſs, to bring them to
the Point, they would have them at; but by
little and little, and a great deal of Pains-taking,
they at laſt weather the Point, and make
them Impudent enough. Then it is they
aſſure them, that they are Arriv'd at that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
Purity, and Faithfulneſs, which are
of ſuch abſolute Neceſſity, for the well Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of the Duty of Confeſſion. Hence
it is that thoſe Women who moſtly frequent
the Confeſſionals, and who are Arriv'd to
that degree of Perfection, I juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that is, to be leſs ſhamefac'd than the
reſt, become alſo the moſt bold and ſhameleſs
in all Companies. They are got paſt Bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at any thing, and with a great deal of
Freedom, make uſe of thoſe Terms their
Confeſſors have taught them at their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I upon a time expreſt my ſelf not over
well ſatisfied with the Diſcourſe, which ſome
Devout or Bigotted Young Woman, had in
the Preſence of two Young Counts of the
Empire, whoſe Governour I was. I took
the liberty to tell them, that it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them; but they with a terrible Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which yet was accompanied with
ſome little Smartneſs of Wit, anſwered me,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42118:169"/>
that they did not believe that they had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſo unhandſomly, but that they were
ready to repeat the ſame Words in Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Indeed they have made it a School of
Impudence and Laſcivious Diſcourſe, where
thoſe that ſpeak Broadeſt, and call a Spade,
a Spade, receive the greateſt Praiſes. They
are not afraid to tell them; Courage Madam,
the more clearly, and in the more proper
Terms you do expreſs your Self, by ſo much
the more will you ſhew your Sincerity to
God, who hears you, and the better I ſhall
like you. To Facilitate this the more, they
have theſe Words writ on their Confeſſionals
with great Letters, <hi>GOD HEARS THEE.</hi> It is
a thing that will Surprize a Man to ſee young
Girls amongſt the Papiſts, that know thoſe
things which they ought, by right, to be
ignorant of all their Life time, and all this
by means of Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of great Advantage to be the
Confeſſor of Ladies, and the more one can
get of them, the more Charitable Nurſes one
may be aſſur'd of, who will never ſuffer a
Man to want any thing, they can furniſh him
with. They from time to time ſend Preſents
to their Confeſſors, which do make them full
amends for all their Pains, they have taken in
hearing their Confeſſions. Moreover the
Confeſſions are very gainful to the Prieſts, by
reaſon of the Pecuniary Penances they impoſe
upon them, for their Sins. There is always
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42118:169"/>
a Trunk or Box at the lower end of their
Churches, whereof they are the Turn-Keys,
and according as they know the Perſon to be
Stocked with Riches, they command him
for his Penance to go and put ſuch a Sum
into the Trunk. We gather'd once five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns on one of the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holy-days,
in a Pariſh at <hi>Venice,</hi> and the next day we
divided the Mony amongſt Eight of us, who
had been the Confeſſors. The Cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them is, when any Covetous Man
comes to Confeſſion, to repreſent to him his
Sin, in the blackeſt Colours they can Poſſible;
and afterwards to give him good Words, to
Sweeten him, and incline him to Liberality;
if thereupon he Teſtifie great Sorrow for his
Sin, they never give him Abſolution, till he
have given ſome Sound Marks of his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
by dropping a very plentiful Alms into
the Trunk: And if he ſhew any hardneſs of
Heart, yet they Abſolve him nevertheleſs,
for fear of Diſtaſting him altogether with
Confeſſion; becauſe they are in hopes to find
him another time in a better Humour, and
better diſpos'd for Repentance. When
Thieves and Robbers, Uſurers, and thoſe
that uſe falſe Weights and Meaſures, come
to Confeſſion, they oblige them, as they
ought, to make Reſtitution, as far as it lies in
their Power ſo to do. They enjoyn thoſe
who are not able to make a Perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
that is, to the Perſons they have
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42118:170"/>
Defrauded, either becauſe they are Dead,
or becauſe they do not know where they
are; theſe I ſay they enjoyn to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
to the Church, that is, to put an
Equivalent Sum into the Trunk. As for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Reſtitutions, they are commonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by the Hand of the Confeſſor, to the
End that the Penitent, who muſt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
may not come into any Danger, as
he would, ſhould he do it himſelf, of falling
into the Hands of Juſtice. And in this caſe
there always comes a conſiderable part of the
Sum to the Churches ſhare, which he that
was Robb'd can never recover.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Knight was Robb'd of two
Thouſand Crowns in Coin, at the time of a
<hi>Jubilee,</hi> granted by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the XIth. He
who had committed the Robbery, went and
Confeſt himſelf to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and put all
the Mony into the Hands of the Father
Rector, who had heard his Confeſſion, to
reſtore it to the Gentleman to whom it did
belong. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> put Five hundred
Crowns of it into their Trunk, and carried
the reſt to the Knight, but he refus'd to take
the One Thouſand Five hundred Crowns, and
would have the whole Sum reſtor'd to him.
The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> after ſome Endeavours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
him to receive his Mony, declar'd to
him, that in caſe he would not take it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
twice Twenty Four hours came about,
they would caſt the reſt into the Trunk alſo,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42118:170"/>
and that he ſhould not have one Peny of
it. And they were as good as their words.
But the Knight repenting himſelf ſome days
after, came and told them, that ſince it could
be no otherwiſe, he would content himſelf
with the One Thouſand Five hundred Crowns
of his Mony. But the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> flowted at
him, telling him, That he was come too late,
and there was no Remedy, becauſe the
Church was in actual Poſſeſſion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
thus it was impoſſible for the Gentleman
to recover any part of it. This word <hi>of the
Church,</hi> which they make uſe of, when they
ſay, the Mony is given to the Church, the
Church is in Poſſeſſion of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is only a
fine word to deceive the Simple: For the
Church in the Senſe, they take it, is a thing
in the Air, and indeed they are the Prieſts
and Monks only that poſſeſs the Mony, and
make uſe of it for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Some believe that Confeſſion, as it is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
means to remedy many Diſorders, and to
prevent a great many Sins, which if that
were Abrogated, many would make more
bold with: For, ſay they, many are reſtrain'd
from committing a bad Action, from the
ſhame they have to Confeſs it afterwards
The Papiſts will tell you, that the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
reject this Sacrament, becauſe they
love Libertiniſm, and hate all manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
and any thing that may ſerve to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42118:171"/>
them. As for my part, who have tried
both States, without flattering the Party I
have choſen, I do profeſs, That I have obſerv'd
more of Honeſty, of Conſcience, and of
Vertue, in the External part of a Civil Life,
amongſt the Proteſtants, than ever I found
amongſt the Papiſts, with all their Confeſſions.
As for that which is Internal, 'tis God alone
that can judge of it: And I hope, that the
Fear of God, and of his Judgments, does
bring forth far more Noble Effects in their
Hearts, than a Human Shamefac'dneſs doth
produce in thoſe who follow the Communion
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides, I conceive that Auricular
Confeſſion may be rather prejudicial, than
any way advantagious to a Chriſtian Life,
which I prove thus: Bad Company and Vain
Converſation are prohibited, becauſe they
are commonly known to corrupt good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
<q>Corrumpunt bonos mores Colloquia prava.</q>
Now we may truly ſay, That the Prieſts and
the Monks of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are every
day, whilſt they are in their Confeſſionals, in
very lewd Company, as where they hear
nothing but Blaſphemies, lewd Practices, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
Treaſons, Robberies, Murthers, Revenge;
In a word, whatſoever is ſuperlatively Wicked
and Infamous. They in ſome ſort familiarize
themſelves with ſuch abominable Filthineſs, by
the continual hearing of them, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42118:171"/>
Examples thereof, which they have
almoſt continually before them, makes the
Confeſſors accuſtom themſelves by degrees with
them, and to have leſs horrour for them, and
commit them with leſs reluctancy. The
Clergy being thus corrupted by the Seculars,
do as it were in Revenge influence a double
Corruption upon the Seculars, and by the
perpetual circulation of their ſecret Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
or Confeſſions, they miſerably infect
and ſpoil one another. We may conclude
then, that the Confeſſionals are rather worſe
than Bad Company; and for the little good
which ſometimes by chance they may be the
cauſe of, they give occaſion to far greater
Evils, which without there would never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we muſt add to this the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and falſe Doctrin, that is Taught and
Preached in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with relation
to this Subject; which is this, <hi>That Attrition
being joyn'd with Confeſſion, is ſufficient to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
to thoſe who after Baptiſm are fallen into
Mortal Sin.</hi> This Attrition, according to them,
is a Sorrow for having offended God, only
for fear of the Eternal Puniſhments of Hell,
which are due to Sinners, without which they
would never have had any Sorrow for having
offended him. They ſuppoſe therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Doctrin, that a Man who is
altogether deſtitute of Charity, or the Love
of God; and, what is more, who hath a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42118:172"/>
formal Hatred againſt him, as he conſiders him
abſtractedly in the effects of his Juſtice, may
nevertheleſs be ſaved, when he fears God only
as an Avenging God; ſo he do but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add
to this ſervile Fear, the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
This is that which gives a wonderful
preſumption to Sinners, and encourageth them
to ſpend the chief part of their Lives in the
ways of Iniquity: For there is no Man, be he
never ſo profligately Wicked, who will not be
ready to promiſe for himſelf, when he is at the
Point of Death, he ſhall doubtleſs be ſeized
with the fear of falling into the hands of the
Living God, and yet have time enough to ſend
for a Confeſſor, to whom he may declare his
Sins; Which done, he is as ſure of going to
Paradice, as the good Thief was on the
Croſs.</p>
            <p>This Doctrin was invented by the Prieſts
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to exalt the force
and virtue of Auricular Confeſſion, which is
ſo pleaſing and profitable to them, tho' with
the loſs of ſo many Souls, who periſh by this
unhappy Perſuaſion. Probably, after having
deceiv'd a great many others, they at laſt
deceive themſelves alſo; for many of theſe
Confeſſors Dye like Dogs, and make deſperate
Ends, endeavouring to perſuade themſelves,
that their Confeſſion, and their fear of falling
into Hell with ſave them. I never found, that
the Prieſts and Monks were ever very ready
to go and confeſs themſelves: They love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42118:172"/>
more, than to Confeſs others; and hate
nothing worſe, than to Confeſs themſelves.
A Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> told me, <hi>That before the
Publiſhing of a certain Order by the Patriarch,
by which he enjoyn'd all Prieſts to Confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at leaſt once a Month, upon Penalty of
Interdict from Maſs, and Suſpenſion from all
Sacred Functions, there was ſcarcely a Prieſt to
be ſeen at</hi> Venice <hi>that went to Confeſſion. One
might ſee them often going directly from the Stews
to the Altar, and to Confeſs others; but as for
themſelves, they did not think it worth the
pains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But at preſent they are obliged every Three
Months, to bring their Atteſtations to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
in Writing, that they have Confeſt
themſelves according to Order. The ſame
Method is obſerv'd at</hi> Milan, <hi>and in ſeveral
other parts of</hi> Italy. <hi>As for the Hearing of
Confeſſions, and eſpecially thoſe of the Fair
Sex, alas, the Caſe is altered with them, and
they run to them very greedily! You'l ſee them
Walking in their Churches about their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion-Chairs
from Morning to Night, to
watch for a Bird to be ſnar'd in their Net.</hi>
How happy am I, <hi>(ſaid once a Curate to me
of a great City in</hi> Italy) I have no Family to
put me to Charge, and I have much more Mony
than I know what to do with: I have often
most Raviſhing Concerts of Muſick in my Church,
in which I take unutterable Pleaſure: When I
have nothing elſe to do, I walk under the ſumptuous
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42118:173"/>
gilded Roofs of this Magnificent Temple, of which
I make (as it were) my own Houſe: I never
want Company at my Confeſſional, where I meet
with the ſatisfaction of hearing a Thouſand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Stories and Adventures: God grant me the
Grace only, that after having enjoy'd my Paradice
in this World, I may afterwards go and poſſeſs it
in the other.</p>
            <p>This is what I had to declare to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the practice of Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
amongſt the Papiſts; I ſhall only add,
that the Secrecy, which is as it were the Seal
of it, is not ſo faithfully obſerv'd as they
would fain have us believe it is: For many
things are diſcover'd by theſe Confeſſors, and
thoſe poor Gally-Slaves, I but juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and who 'tis likely to the very Hour
do Groan under that Dreadful Task, are a
ſad, but certain inſtance of it. A Confeſſor
that reveals a Confeſſion, according to the
Law in that caſe Provided, ought to be Burnt
alive: But tho' many Confeſſions be every
day reveal'd, yet don't we find ſo much as
one only Confeſſor, that has this Sentence
Executed upon him; foraſmuch as it is in a
manner impoſſible to Convict them thereof.
A Prieſt is always believed upon his Oath,
and if he can but reſolve to Swear that he
hath not revealed the Confeſſion, there is no
going any further; ſo that at preſent Fire
and Fagot are only made uſe of againſt Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers
and Hereticks. I could here have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42118:173"/>
to you many gallant Stories, as well as
ſome very Tragical ones, which have been
depoſited with me in Confeſſion, but I find
no inclination to do it; not becauſe I fear
the Papiſts Fire, but becauſe I am of the
mind, that an honeſt Man, who hath charg'd
himſelf with a Secret, is oblig'd in Honour to
keep it, as far as poſſibly he may. Indeed
this is the very Reaſon, why I have only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
you here with ſome common things,
which are known to all thoſe who will take
the pains to be a little inquiſitive, and which
I have obſerv'd out of Confeſſion, or which
have been told me by Perſons of Credit, and
who have put me under no Engagement to
conceal them.</p>
            <p>Some it may be will be deſirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
what kind of Penances the Confeſſors
impoſe upon their Penitents in Confeſſion.
According to the Doctrin of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' God
doth pardon Sins as to the Guilt, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and tho' he remits to Penitents the
External Puniſhment due to their Sins; yet
nevertheleſs his Will is, that they ſuffer here
for the ſame Sins ſome petty temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and this he has left to the Judgment
and Diſpoſal of the Prieſts of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who may do in it what they pleaſe
themſelves. Conformably to this they order
ſome to Faſt on certain days, to others to ſay
a Set of Prayers, and to others to pay ſo
much Mony, and to ſome other to receive
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42118:174"/>
Diſcipline or Penance. There have been
found ſome of the New Saints of the Popiſh
Church, who out of Humility (ſo they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
themſelves,) have made their Confeſſors
to give them Diſcipline; S. <hi>Roſe,</hi> S. <hi>Thereſa,</hi>
and Siſter <hi>Margaret</hi> of the Holy Sacrament,
were of this Number. The Confeſſors, to
give them their due, are not wanting to
give Credit to, and to extend theſe holy Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Humility, upon which they beſtow
continual Elogies; yet in the mean time, we
ſee that the generality of People are not
much affected with theſe kind of Examples,
and there are but ſome few of the Confeſſors
whoſe Perſuaſions, as to this Point, prove
Effectual.</p>
            <p>The Penitentiaries or Confeſſors of the
Churches of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> of S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi>
of <hi>Lorette,</hi> of S. <hi>January</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
of <hi>Boulogn,</hi> and of many other Places
of Devotion in <hi>Italy,</hi> have great white-Rods
in their Hands, as they ſit in their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onals,
wherewith they ſtrike not only thoſe
that come to be Confeſſed, but alſo all ſorts
of Perſons, be they Men or Women, that
preſent themſelves before them to receive
their Bleſſing, giving them ſmall Stroaks upon
their Head, their Shoulders, and their Ears;
which done, the Perſons ſo Struck, make a
very low Bow to them by way of Thanks for
that Favour. An <hi>Armenian</hi> once demanded
of me, <hi>What was the meaning of this Practice?</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:42118:174"/>
I told him that it was a Practice of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by which the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks expreſt
their readineſs to receive all the Chaſtiſements,
which the Church thought good to inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; to which he Anſwered, Smiling;
<hi>Do you believe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that if theſe Black
Men who Beat them,</hi> (he meant by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
the Jeſuits, who are the Confeſſors
of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and who are dreſt in Black) <hi>ſhould
make good Sound Stroaks upon them, that the
People would expreſs as much Earneſtneſs to be
favoured with them, as now they do?</hi> I was not
able to anſwer him as to that Point: But
this I know, that upon a time a Proteſtant
of <hi>Geneva</hi> received ſuch Stroaks from them,
that inſtead of Complimenting them for the
Favour, he run away from them as faſt as ever
he could. This Proteſtant, it ſeems, who
was not Inur'd to the Ceremonies of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had the Curioſity to enter
the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> at the time that Maſs
was Saying, and was either ſo Neglectful or
Ignorant, as not to fall down on his Knees
when they Sounded the Bell at the Elevation
of the Hoſt: Moreover, his Curioſity led
him to draw near to a Statue of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
which is on the Right ſide of the Church,
near to the High Altar: This Statue is of
Braſs, and Repreſents S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſitting in a
Chair; He hath one of his Feet ſtretched
outward, and the People out of Devotion, and
to ſhew their Submiſſion to the Holy See, come
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42118:175"/>
and kiſs his Toes, and put heir Heads under
his Foot. The Proteſtant ſeeing them in theſe
Poſtures, could not forbear Laughing; but one
of the Jeſuits, who had his Confeſſional near
that place, and who had obſerved him, came
to him with his great Wand, and ſtruck him
as hard as ever he could upon his Head and
Shoulders: The Proteſtant betook himſelf to
his Heels, without ſo much as ever looking
behind him; the Jeſuit all the while purſuing
and beating him till he was got out of Church.
The great Noiſe this made, occaſion'd much
Diſtraction to thoſe that were Hearing Maſs,
and every one ſaid, it was a Heretick, whom
the Jeſuit had had the Zeal to bang out of the
Church. There was no Body that expreſt the
leaſt Compaſſion for him; and the Jeſuit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
glorying in the Act he had performed,
ſaying, <hi>That tho' he had a good strong Arm, yet
he found that Hereticks Bones were ſtronger and
harder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time I ſaw a Proteſtant Abus'd
after the ſame manner in the Cathedral Church
of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> which could not
but be the more ſenſible to theſe Gentlemen,
becauſe it was but a little before, that they
had voluntarily ſubmitted themſelves to the
Domination of <hi>France,</hi> and that they began
already to uſe them like Slaves, having ſcarcely
the free Exerciſe of their Religion allowed
them, in thoſe few Churches, the Papiſts were
pleas'd to leave them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:42118:175"/>
GOD grant that others may become Wiſe
by their Example: This is one of my moſt
ardent Deſires, wherewith I conclude theſe
Obſervations, made upon occaſion of my
Journy ot <hi>Naples.</hi>
