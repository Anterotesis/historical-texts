         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Factious and Unchriſtian Temper of our Age has ſo unhappily ſpread it ſelf thro' all Ranks of Men, that even thoſe, whoſe buſineſs ought to be the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety, have not eſcap'd it's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Influence.

            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Hiſtorical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Images,</hi> 'tis the Profeſs'd Doctrin and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to have the Pictures and Images of Holy Things and Paſſages both in <hi>Houſes and Churches,</hi> for the inſtruction of the Ignorant in the knowledge of the Hiſtory of both the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament; that ſo they may be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe Sacred Perſons of Patriarchs, Prophets and Apoſtles, and be inform'd of the Wonderful Works wrought by God in Mans <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption.</hi> This appears in the Council of <hi>Trent Seſſ.</hi> 25 and in the <hi>Catechiſm ad Parochos</hi> part. 3. <hi>de Invoc. Sanc.</hi> par. 40.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100730:3"/>
Both which agree, that Holy <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> are made, to inform the People of the Hiſtory of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> and that for this end they are ſet up in Churches and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places.</p>
            <p>This ſame <hi>Hiſtorical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Holy Images</hi> is conform like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Doctrin and Practice of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as is evident in Mr. <hi>Montagu</hi>'s <hi>Appeal to Caeſar,</hi> who declaring the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s <hi>Own, Proper, True and Antient Tenets, (Ep. Ded. to the King) ſuch as be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any doubt or queſtion, Legitimate and Genuine, ſuch as ſhe will both acknowledge and maintain for her own,</hi> in this Book <hi>Authoris'd</hi> and <hi>Publiſh'd</hi> by Expreſs order of King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> l. and approv'd as <hi>containing nothing in it, but what was agreeable to the Doctrin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline eſtabliſh'd in the Church of</hi> England <hi>(Ib.)</hi> ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>c.</hi> 20. that <hi>Images were improv'd unto an Hiſtorical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe in St.</hi> Gregory<hi>'s time,</hi> and then adds; <hi>Had the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>gon no farther in Practice or Precept, than that which St.</hi> Gregory <hi>recommends, our Church</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I ſuppoſe (for ſo our Doctrin is) would not blame them, nor have departed from them about that Point.</hi> And agen <hi>chap.</hi> 23. <hi>Doth the Engliſh Church condemn the Hiſtorical or Civil uſe of Images? It do's not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in Practice; all the World knows that; nor yet in Precept or Doctrin, that I know.</hi> And at the end of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſays, <hi>Images may be had and made—ut Ornatui ſint, ut Memoriae, ut Hiſtoriae; For Ornament, for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, and for Hiſtory; and that they may be made for ſuch Ends, No Law of God forbiddeth, ſays our</hi> Gamaliel, <hi>pa.</hi> 203. <hi>ad Apol.

to any, that will but put his head into any Church of this Communion, where preſently <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhew themſelves to the Beholder, and let him know the concern they had in Thoſe <hi>Commandements,</hi> which they there guard betwixt them. This may be ſeen with great advantage in the Church at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe Two Saints of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, the <hi>Four Evangeliſts</hi> have their place in full proportion between the ſide Windows, with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles</hi> in twelve Niches on the Front of the Gallery. But above all, the <hi>New</hi> Church in St. <hi>James</hi>'s in the Fields commends this Practice in a Rare Piece of Workmanſhip, where the hand of the Artiſt has ſet forth to the Life upon the <hi>Font,</hi> the Hiſtory of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and it's <hi>Cure</hi> in the <hi>Water</hi> of Baptiſm. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſtand beneath, Confeſſing the guilt of that <hi>Sin,</hi> for which <hi>Infants</hi> are brought thither to be cleans'd. Round the Baſon is ſeen <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the hand of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> authoriſing the Inſtitution of that Salutary Laver: And over it is an Angel, as it were deſcending to <hi>move the Waters,</hi> and to ſignifie that the efficacy of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is from above. Then if you turn towards the <hi>Altar,</hi> in <hi>one Figure</hi> is repreſented the Inſtitution of the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> at the <hi>Laſt Supper:</hi> The very ſame which is over the <hi>Altar</hi> at his Majeſties Chappel at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal,</hi> and for the very ſame intent, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Pellican</hi> feeding her <hi>Young ones</hi> with her <hi>Blood;</hi> to ſignifie what Chriſt gives to the Faithful, his Children, in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that he <hi>feeds</hi> them with his <hi>Blood.</hi> Much more may be ſeen in <hi>Cathedral</hi> and <hi>Collegiate</hi> Churches of this kind, not only in relation to the Old, but New Teſtament, even the Crucifixion of our Saviour, but eſpecially in the New Common-Prayer-Books, interleav'd with Pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</p>

               <hi>2ly.</hi> As to the <hi>Commemorative <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Images,</hi> 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and approv'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> above cited, where 'tis ſaid; That the Uſe of <hi>Holy Images</hi> is Beneficial to the People, becauſe by them they are put in mind of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Bleſſings receiv'd from Chriſt; and by ſeeing the Wonderful Miracles wrought by the Power of God, and the Exemplary Lives of the Saints, they are excited to give God Thanks for ſuch Favors, to love him, and compoſe their Lives according to the Exemple of ſuch Holy Men. The ſame is declared in the <hi>Catechiſm ad Parochos, ut ſup.</hi> where the <hi>Pariſh Prieſt</hi> is directed to inform the People; That <hi>Holy Images</hi> are plac'd in Churches, to put them in mind of the Divine Myſteries and Bleſſings, that ſo they may be more Zealous and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive in the Love and Service of ſo Good a God. And that by beholding the <hi>Repreſentations</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> they may be admoniſh'd, to conform their Lives to ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Thus teaches the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> likewiſe agrees with her in the ſame <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> allowing of <hi>Images,</hi> as helps to Piety, and for the affecting the minds of the Beholders with Pious Cogitations, and encouraging them to a Vertuous and Exemplary Life. This is moſt apparent in the <hi>Injunctions</hi> given by King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. to his Clergy and Miniſters, wherein they are order'd to Inſtruct the People in their Circuits, that <hi>Images ſerve for Remembrance, whereby Men may be admoniſh'd of the holy Lives and Converſation of them that the ſaid Images Repreſent.</hi> Which is the very Doctrin now mention'd in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Catechiſm ad Parochos.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Montagu</hi> explicates more at large, in his Book call'd <hi>A New Gag, &amp;c.</hi> where treating of <hi>Images,</hi> he ſays to the <hi>Papiſts: Images have theſe uſes aſſign'd by your Schools</hi>—

            <p>In this the Reader may behold, how little Difference, or rather how great an Agreement there is between the <hi>Legitimate</hi> and <hi>Genuin Doctrin</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to theſe two firſt Points mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Hiſtorical and Commemorative <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Sacred Images.</hi> Now when a Member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has endeavor'd to ſhew, that this Doctrin as to the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and <hi>Commemorative <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of Holy <hi>Images</hi> is

               <hi>4ly.</hi> He ſhews <hi>pa.</hi> 22. that the having <hi>Pictures in Churches,</hi> is contrary to an <hi>Expreſs Canon of the Council of</hi> Eliberis, held <hi>An.</hi> 305. by the Fathers of the Primitive Church.

               <hi>5ly.</hi> From the Example of an Antient Biſhop renting a <hi>Veil</hi> or <hi>Hanging,</hi> whereon was the Image of Chriſt, he declares, <hi>pa.</hi> 25. in the words of the Biſhop, ſuch Pictures to be <hi>contrary to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures.</hi> Which is plainly to tell the World, that the Uſe of <hi>Hangings,</hi> ſuch as have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Saints</hi> Repreſented on them, as may be ſeen in many Houſes, in <hi>Cathedral</hi> and <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate</hi> Churches, are all <hi>contrary to the Word of God.</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100730:6"/>
Theſe are ſome of the Severe Reflections he makes upon his <hi>own Church,</hi> while he's blindly knocking down <hi>Popery.</hi> Who could deſire a better condition'd Antagoniſt than this, who is ſo Good-natur'd, as never to ſtrike at his Adverſary, but he gives himſelf a Blow over the Face at the ſame time? Has not he fairly defended his <hi>own Church,</hi> while he thus expoſes her under the Guilt of being <hi>Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, Heretical, going contrary to the Primitive Church, to Councils and Scriptures,</hi> which is the Blackeſt of that Dirt, he has done his beſt to caſt upon the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Hitherto the Reader has ſeen the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> as far as concerns the Two Firſt Points, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and <hi>Commemorative</hi> Uſe of Holy <hi>Images;</hi> and how this Worthy Anſwerer, with ſome wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miſapply'd Paſſages of Antiquity, ſtrikes moſt raſhly at Both Churches; not caring, ſo he can but overthrow the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> what other Church, tho' his own, falls with her. Now we will conſider the Third Point, which is of the <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> due to theſe <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And as to this,</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, that the Images of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be kept, eſpecially in Churches, and DUE Honor and Veneration given them: Not for that any Divinity or Vertue is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be in them, for which they are to be Worſhip'd; or that any thing is to be Asked of them, or any Confidence to be placed in them, as was done by the Heathens; but becauſe the Honor ſhewn to them is referr'd to the Prototypes, or Things Repreſented by them: So that by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100730:7"/>
we Kiſs, and before which we Kneel, we Adore Chriſt and Reverence his Saints, whom the ſaid Images Repreſent. So the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers this Doctrin, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 25. The like is ſhewn in the Catechiſm <hi>ad Parochos, ubi ſup.</hi> And the whole meaning of it is nothing more, than what was given at large by <hi>Leontius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who flouriſh'd <hi>An.</hi> 620. that is, above a Thouſand and threeſcore years ago; who thus makes his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for the Chriſtians againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who charg'd them with the breach of the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in giving honor to <hi>Images.</hi> 
               <q>The Pictures and Images, ſays he, of the Saints are not ador'd amongſt us, like Gods. For if I Worſhip'd the Wood of an Image, as God, I might as well do the like to any other Wood: If I honor'd the Wood as God, I would never throw it into the fire, when the Image is once disfigur'd.—As therefore he that has receiv'd a Commiſſion from his Prince, and kiſſes the Seal, dos not reſpect the Wax, the Paper or the Lead, but gives the Honor to the King; ſo we Chriſtians, when we ſhew Reſpect to the Figure of the Croſs, do not honor the Nature of the Wood, but the Sign, the Pledge, the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt; through this beholding him, who was Crucified on it, we reſpect and Adore him. And as Children, full of a dear Affection to their Father, who is Abſent from them, do kiſs with Tears, and with all Tenderneſs embrace his Stick, his Chair, his Coat, which they ſee at home; and yet do not adore theſe things, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Deſire and Honor they have for their Father: Juſt ſo do all we Faithful honor the Croſs,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100730:7"/>
as Chriſts Staff; the moſt Holy Sepulcher, as his Chair and Couch, the Manger and <hi>Bethleem</hi> as his Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not that we honor the Place, the Houſe, the Country, the City or the Stones, but Him that was Converſant amongſt them, who appear'd in our Fleſh, and deliver'd us from Error, Chriſt our Lord; and for Chriſt we honor thoſe Things, which belong to him, deſcribing his Paſſion in our Churches, in our Houſes, in the Streets, in Images, upon our Linen, in our Chambers, upon our Cloths, and upon every Place, to the end that having theſe continually before our Eyes, we may be put in mind, and not like thee (O Jew) forget our Lord and God. As you therefore expreſſing a veneration for the Book of the Law, do not Honor the Paper or Ink of which 'tis compos'd, but the Word of God contain'd in it: So I, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reverence to the Image of Chriſt, do not Adore (no, God forbid) the Wood or the Colors; but having an Inanimate Repreſentation of Chriſt, by this ſeem to be poſſeſs'd of, and to Worſhip Chriſt himſelf. As <hi>Jacob</hi> having receiv'd the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-color'd and Bloody Coat of his Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> kiſs'd it, full of Tears, and put it to his Eyes; not doing this for any Love or Honor he had for the Coat; but by this ſeeming to kiſs <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and hold him in his Arms: So all Chriſtians, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or kiſſing any Image of Chriſt, of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or Martyrs, do the like to Chriſt himſelf, or his Martyrs, in the affection of their Souls.</q> By all which 'tis evident, that all the <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> paid by Catholics to any <hi>Picture</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt or his Martyrs, is only to expreſs the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100730:8"/>
Love and Honor they have for Chriſt and his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; and that in thus doing, they no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or make Gods of thoſe Pictures, than that Woman is <hi>diſloyal</hi> to her Husband, who in affection to him, reſpects and kiſſes his <hi>Picture;</hi> than that Subject is a <hi>Traytor</hi> to his Prince, who Honors his Portraiture; or than all thoſe, who pay a Reverence to the <hi>Chair of State,</hi> for the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it has to the King, make a <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Chair,</hi> in ſo doing. This then is the Doctrin and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> ſeems to concur with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all this Point. This may be gather'd partly out of the Eccleſiaſtical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons agreed to <hi>An.</hi> 1603. in the Firſt year of King <hi>James</hi> I. where <hi>Can.</hi> 30. 'tis ſaid, That <hi>the Holy Ghoſt did ſo Honor by the mouths of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the very NAME of the Croſs, that it did not only comprehend even Chriſt Crucified under that Name, but likewiſe the efficacy of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. In which words this Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the Giving <hi>Honor</hi> to the <hi>NAME</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> to have been the Practice of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as they were inſpir'd by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And that the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> was not only to put them in mind of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> whom they were to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (as a Modern Doctor ſays of the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,)</hi> but that the Holy Ghoſt did by the Apoſtles, <hi>Honor</hi> the very <hi>NAME</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Spiritus S. per Apoſtolorum ora, ipſum Crucis Nomen uſque adeo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noravit.</hi> And in honoring that <hi>Name,</hi> did honor Chriſt Crucified; <hi>Chriſtum ipſum Crucifixum ſub eodem comprehenderet.</hi> Which is the very Practice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100730:8"/>
and Senſe of <hi>Catholics,</hi> both as to the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and of <hi>Pictures; Names</hi> or <hi>Words</hi> being <hi>Pictures</hi> to the Ear, as Pictures are <hi>Words</hi> to the <hi>Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it comes nearer our Caſe, what is added in the ſame <hi>Canone</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Honor ac Dignitas Crucis Nomini acquiſita, etiam &amp; SIGNO Crucis, vel ipſa Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum aetate (neque enim contrarium oſtendi poteſt) exiſtimationem peperit Honorificam. The Honor and Eſteem ſhewn to the NAME of the CROSS, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce even in the Age of the Apoſtles, an honorable Eſteem likewiſe for the SIGN of the Croſs; neither can any thing contrary to this be prov'd.</hi> What can be plainer, than that according to this <hi>Canon,</hi> 'tis the Senſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Primitive Chriſtians were taught by the Apoſtles, not only to Honor the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>SIGN</hi> of the <hi>Croſs?</hi> And certainly, if according to <hi>this Church,</hi> the Apoſtles taught their Followers, to <hi>honor</hi> in their Hearts and Souls the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> it can neither be contrary to the Apoſtles, nor this Church, to do ſo now, and to expreſs this <hi>Honor outwardly,</hi> which they are thus taught to conceive <hi>inwardly,</hi> and entertain in their <hi>hearts.</hi> 'Tis an Abſurdity ſure too great, to fall upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> thus abſolutely to approve the Affection of <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Eſteem</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Chriſtians Hearts, as both a Chriſtian Duty and an Apoſtolical Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin; and then afterwards, to condemn the ſame <hi>Honor</hi> and Affection of the Soul, as <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> when 'tis expreſs'd <hi>Outwardly,</hi> either in Words or Geſture: For how is it poſſible, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100730:9"/>
what is <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> ſhould, by being expreſs'd <hi>outwardly,</hi> become <hi>Idolatrous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrin is deliver'd more expreſly by Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> who in his Book call'd a <hi>New Gag,</hi> thus declares the Expreſs Tenet of <hi>Catholics</hi> and of his own Church, <hi>p.</hi> 318. <hi>You ſay the Pictures of Chriſt, the Bleſſed Virgin and Saints, muſt not have Latria; So We. You give them Dulia; I quarrel not the Term, tho' I could. There is a Reſpect due unto, and Honor given Relatively to them. If this you call Dulia, We give it too. Let Practice and Doctrin go together, We agree.</hi> Nay he ſhews farther, 'tis impoſſible to keep or ſet up the <hi>Pictures</hi> of Chriſt or his Saints, without having a <hi>REVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE</hi> and <hi>HONOR</hi> for them, in <hi>due kind.</hi> Hear him in his own words, in his <hi>Appeal to Caeſar,</hi> c. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it has diſtaſted ſome</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPECT and HONOR ſhould be given unto them</hi> (Images of Chriſt.) <hi>Strange it ſhould diſpleaſe any, that can approve of any, be it but a Civil uſe of them.

Can a Man have the True Repreſentation of his Prince, Parents, Patrons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without Awe, Reſpect, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, Love, Reverence, moved by Aſpect, and wrought in him? I profeſs my Imperfection, or what they will call it, it is ſo with me. Unco impacto in Latrinas,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100730:9"/>
               <hi>in Gemonias, in malam Crucem, the Pictures, Statues, Paintings, Repreſentations, of Chriſt, the Virgin, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Holy Men and Women; unleſs the very having and preſerving of them, do in ſome ſort imply RESPECT, REGARD and HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOR done unto them, without offence juſtly given, without Scandal, or Inclination to Impiety.</hi> Then he urges the Truth of this Doctrin with the words of <hi>Junius. Junius,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was no Papiſt; not in your opinion, I hope. He in his Animadverſions upon</hi> Bellarmin <hi>de Imaginibus,</hi> ſays, <hi>Hoc nemo NOST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M dicit, non eſſe COLENDAS, nec ullo modo. Suo modo COLI probamus, velut Imagines; at non religioſo cultu, qui aut ſuperſtitioſus eſt, aut impius; nec cùm aliorum ſcandalo, ſive Cultus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus ſive conjunctus cum eorum Cultu intelligatur, quorum ſunt Imagines. None of us ſay, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are no ways to be worſhip'd. We prove that they are to be worſhip'd in a way peculiar to them, as Images, but not with a Religious Worſhip, which is either Superſtitious or Impious: Neither to the ſcandal of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether the Worſhip be underſtood the ſame, or different from that which is given to the things Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this Learned Man delivers and defends the Doctrin of his Church in relation to the <hi>Images</hi> of Chriſt and his Saints, againſt the Arguments of ſome <hi>Informers,</hi> which he thinks to be no other than <hi>Puritans,</hi> and at beſt, ſome <hi>F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ONES</hi> of his own Church, or <hi>SING<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LAR ILLUMINATES,</hi> as he terms them, <hi>ib. c.</hi> 20. And now what great difference here in this Point between the Two Churches? The Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100730:10"/>
ſays, that <hi>Images of CHRIST,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ought to be ſet up in Churches, and D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E HONOR and VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERATION given them.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> (by Mr. <hi>Montague)</hi> ſays, that <hi>the Images of Chriſt, the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>and Saints, may be ſet up in Churches; RESPECT and HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOR may be given them in Due kind; The uſing them for helps of Memory, of Affection, of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration cannot be abſtracted from REVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE and HONOR ſimply, in D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E kind.</hi> The Catechiſm <hi>ad Parochos</hi> ſays, Theſe <hi>Images</hi> are ſet up in Churches, <hi>ut Colantur,</hi> that they may be <hi>Honor'd</hi> or <hi>Worſhip'd;</hi> that is, in <hi>due kind.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay (by <hi>Junius) None of us deny, but they may be Honor'd or Worſhip'd in their kind:</hi> Nay more, <hi>We prove, They are to be Worſhip'd in ſome manner,</hi> that is, <hi>as Images.</hi> Both Churches then agree, that <hi>Sacred Images</hi> may be ſet up in Churches; that a <hi>Reſpect, Honor</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> is <hi>due</hi> to them, in their kind; and both concur in terming this <hi>Honor</hi> or <hi>Reverence, Cultus</hi> or <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, i. e.</hi> in it's kind, <hi>Suo modo.

            <p>Beſides this, 'tis agreed by both Churches, that this <hi>Reverence</hi> ſhewn to theſe things, is founded purely upon the <hi>Relation</hi> they have to God, and is terminated finally upon him. This as to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> appears from what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted out of the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> And as to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the words of

            <p>The two Churches thus agreeing in the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of placing <hi>Images</hi> in Churches, and that an <hi>Honor,</hi> or <hi>Reverence,</hi> or even <hi>Worſhip</hi> in it's kind, is neceſſarily due to them, as they ſerve for helps to Piety; of Affection or Rememoration, and have Relation to God. The Anſwerer of theſe leaves of <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> lets fly at all this, like one of <hi>Montagu's F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ONES,</hi> or <hi>SING<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR ILL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MINATES.</hi> He runs it down, under the Name of <hi>IMAGE-WORSHIP;</hi> and is ſure, with this very <hi>Word</hi> alone, ſo far to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100730:11"/>
upon the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi> at leaſt (with whom, by his looſe arguing, he ſeems chiefly concern'd) as to gain their Votes, in crying down the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for <hi>Idolaters;</hi> and then his Buſineſs is done. Upon this ſtrain he runs to the end of his Pamphlet, proving that <hi>Image-Worſhip</hi> is contrary to Fathers, to Antiquity, to Councils; <hi>Image-Worſhip, Image-Worſhip,</hi> is all the Cant: But never tells, what this <hi>Image-Worſhip</hi> is; and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects, that his <hi>own Church</hi> is for an <hi>Image-Worſhip</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Thus unhappily in the midſt of Duſt and Noiſe he manages the Controverſie with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> without ever <hi>Stating the Queſtion,</hi> or declaring what the Papiſts hold, unbecoming a <hi>Scholar;</hi> and multiplying many Needleſs Contentions, unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>If he had examin'd the Doctrin of his <hi>own Church,</hi> and underſtood what <hi>Catholics</hi> teach, he would have ſoon diſcover'd the vanity of this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and found, that after ſo much buſtle upon this matter, there's but little more in't, beſides Fighting about <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Words;</hi> and that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tolerable this may be in a School for a <hi>Logic</hi> Diſpute, 'tis unworthy of a <hi>Divine,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a Preacher of the Goſpel of Peace.</p>
            <p>'Tis already here made out to any unprejudic'd Conſiderer, that, according to the Doctrin of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis impoſſible to ſeparate even the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Uſe of <hi>Holy Images,</hi> from a <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> which neceſſarily follows them: Much leſs can they ſerve as <hi>Helps to Piety,</hi> for the <hi>exciting Devotion,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100730:11"/>
bringing <hi>to mind the Perſons Repreſented,</hi> but they force from the beholders an Interior <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honor;</hi> ſo that, as 'tis impoſſible, for a <hi>Good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to have by him the <hi>Picture</hi> of his <hi>Prince</hi> and of a <hi>Traytor,</hi> without being <hi>differently</hi> affected in his Soul towards them, even in the very ſame manner, as he is to the Perſons they Repreſent. So neither can a <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Good Chriſtian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Pictures</hi> or other <hi>Repreſentations</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Judas,</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but his Soul will be different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mov'd towards them with <hi>Love, Reſpect, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Veneration,</hi> on the one ſide; with <hi>Indignation</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> on the other, as he finds himſelf affected to the <hi>Perſons</hi> Repreſented by them. Thus far is acknowledg'd by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and may be gather'd from what is above cited out of <hi>Montagu</hi> and <hi>Junius. Catholics</hi> ſay the ſame, and ſo cannot be cenſur'd or condemn'd for this. What then is their Crime? The Charge urg'd againſt them is, that they ſhew this ſame Honor and Veneration outwardly to theſe Holy Images of Chriſt, the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They <hi>kiſs</hi> them, <hi>pull off their Hats,</hi> they <hi>Bow,</hi> they <hi>Kneel, Burn Tapers, Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> before them: This is the Crime, this the <hi>Image-Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Catholics.</p>
            <p>And here, in their behalf, and to bring this Voluminous Controverſie into a Narrower Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, I muſt ask of the <hi>Anſwerer;</hi> If it be <hi>lawful</hi> for <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Catholics</hi> to have an <hi>INTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOR Reſpect, Honor</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> for Holy <hi>Images,</hi> as appears evidently confeſs'd above; how comes it to be ſo <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> and <hi>Abominable</hi> for <hi>Catholics</hi> to ſignifie and expreſs <hi>outwardly</hi> this ſame <hi>Reſpect,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100730:12"/>
               <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> which is ſo Commendable for all Chriſtians, both <hi>Catholics</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to have <hi>Inwardly</hi> in their Souls? Certainly, That <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> which in the <hi>Heart</hi> is <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> cannot but be <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in the <hi>Expreſſion:</hi> And 'tis very abſur'd, to think a <hi>Duty</hi> can become <hi>Idolatry</hi> by <hi>profeſſing</hi> it. If a Chriſtian has a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Reverence</hi> in his <hi>Soul,</hi> for the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> than for any other Book whatſoever, may not he lawfully <hi>expreſs</hi> this Reverence by <hi>Kiſſing</hi> it? If the <hi>Woman</hi> in the Goſpel, reſpects and Honors in her <hi>Heart</hi> the <hi>Hem</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Garment; is the <hi>Kiſſing</hi> that <hi>Hem,</hi> any more <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than was that <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> ſhe had in her <hi>Soul</hi> towards it? If a Chriſtian has a <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> even for the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> or Church, above other Houſes, that are not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to his Service; may not he <hi>ſhew</hi> this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi> by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovering his Head?</hi> If a Chriſtian <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> the <hi>Communion-Table</hi> above other Prophane Tables; may not this <hi>Honor</hi> be <hi>exteriourly</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, by ſetting <hi>Candles</hi> on it, and <hi>Plate,</hi> and adorning it with <hi>Hangings,</hi> and then <hi>Bowing to it,</hi> without a Crime?</p>
            <p>If a Chriſtian Reverences and Honors in his Heart the <hi>NAME</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays the Apoſtles did; can it be Idolatry <hi>outwardly</hi> to profeſs this <hi>ſame Honor,</hi> by <hi>Bowing</hi> or <hi>Bending the Knee?</hi> And if he Reſpects the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> may not he ſhew this <hi>exteriorly,</hi> by receiving it <hi>Kneeling?</hi> And if theſe <hi>Exterior</hi> Profeſſions and Acknowledgments of the <hi>Interior Reſpect, Honor and Reverence</hi> that is due to theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100730:12"/>
things, may be thus commendably ſhewn, by <hi>Kiſſing, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovering the Head,</hi> by <hi>Tapers, Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Bowing</hi> and <hi>Kneeling,</hi> without any Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the ſight of God, or juſt Scandal to our Neighbor; why may not the like <hi>Interior Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Honor,</hi> acknowledg'd due to Holy <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of Chriſt or his Saints, be profeſs'd <hi>outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> by the ſame <hi>Viſible</hi> Expreſſions of Reſpect and Reverence: Eſpecially ſince what is done to all theſe things, is upon no other account, than the <hi>Relation</hi> they have to God, and as appertaining to him and his Service?</p>
            <p>Neither let the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> think to take Sanctuary, in calling this <hi>Veneration</hi> ſhewn to <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of Chriſt, a <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as an <hi>Image-Worſhip:</hi> For however this may work upon the <hi>Mobile</hi> and Unthinking Crowds, and fill their heads with a Notion of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> yet every Man of Senſe and unbiaſs'd Judgment knows, that this word <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> is <hi>equivocal,</hi> and that 'tis not every thing is preſently made an <hi>Idol</hi> of, which is any ways ſaid to be <hi>Worſhip'd:</hi> As is ſhewn at large in <hi>The Pap. Miſrep.</hi> 2. <hi>Part. c.</hi> 5, 6. For 'tis not only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which <hi>Catholics</hi> ſhew to Holy <hi>Images,</hi> is call'd a <hi>Worſhip;</hi> but likewiſe that is a <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> give; as is own'd by <hi>Junius</hi> above; ſo that in this Senſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may be ſaid and prov'd to be <hi>Image-Worſhipers</hi> too. The <hi>Reverence</hi> likewiſe ſhew'd by <hi>Proteſtants to</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is call'd by <hi>Jewel (Rep. to Hard.)</hi> a <hi>Worſhip:</hi> The <hi>Honor</hi> given to the <hi>Bible</hi> he ſtiles a <hi>Worſhip.</hi> In the ſame way of ſpeaking, the Reſpect to the <hi>Communion-Table</hi> may be term'd a <hi>Worſhip; Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100730:13"/>
in Reverence to the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> may be ſtyl'd a <hi>Worſhip.</hi> And in this Senſe, 'twill not only be laid to the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s charge, that ſhe teaches and approves <hi>Image-Worſhip;</hi> but likewiſe <hi>Bread Worſhip, Book-Worſhip, Table-Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Name-Worſhip:</hi> And 'twill not be very difficult, by the equivocation of this <hi>word,</hi> and the help of a little <hi>Pulpit-Sophiſtry,</hi> to paint out This Church as Black with <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to the People, as ſhe has done the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it do's not at all reflect upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or her Doctrin, that ſome of her Divines <hi>call</hi> this Reſpect, Honor, Veneration or Worſhip paid to Holy Images a <hi>Religious</hi> Reſpect, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this is only a Diſpute about a Word; and let it be call'd by what Name they pleaſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Honorary, Religious,</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> this alters not the Nature of the thing; for 'tis but the ſame thing, by whatſoever Name it be expreſs'd. If ſome will have every Reſpect or Veneration, ſhewn to Holy Things, as to the <hi>Bible,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for the Relation they have to God, to be call'd a <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> let 'em call it ſo in God's Name. And if others will have no Veneration or Worſhip to be <hi>Religious,</hi> but that which is directly and immediatly given to <hi>God;</hi> let 'em have their way. Theſe are fine Notions, and pretty Entertainments for School-debates; but are no concern of our Religion or Conſcience. For as long as 'tis own'd, that there's a <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> due to ſuch <hi>Holy</hi> things, as in ſome particular manner have <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100730:13"/>
to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Service,</hi> and we only expreſs this Reſpect <hi>outwardly,</hi> which <hi>interiorly</hi> we feel in our Souls; let this be call'd an <hi>Honor,</hi> a <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> an <hi>Adoring;</hi> let it be ſaid to be <hi>Honorary, Religious</hi> or <hi>Divine;</hi> let it be deem'd <hi>Abſolute</hi> or <hi>Relative,</hi> 'tis equally alike to us; ſince we are ſatisfied, the wrangling of the Learned about <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> has no influence upon the Acts of our Souls; and cannot make that to be <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> which in it ſelf is not ſo.</p>
            <p>Here then may the Reader ſee, how ſtands this Controverſie between <hi>Catholics</hi> and the Church of <hi>England Proteſtants.</hi> Both Churches acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that there's an <hi>Honor,</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> that may be lawfully given to the Holy <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> of Chriſt. Both Churches expreſs this Honor outwardly: <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by uſing them in their <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Prayer-books,</hi> which (as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu</hi> ſays) cannot be abſtracted from giving them Honor and Reverence. While Catholics go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, that 'tis lawful to expreſs this <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> and <hi>Reverence due</hi> to them, as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, by Kiſſing them, pulling off the Hat, Bowing, Setting of Tapers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before them, in the ſame manner, and with no more juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Scandal, and no more breach of any Commandment, than the Church of <hi>England</hi> do's expreſs the <hi>Veneration</hi> She ſhews to the <hi>Bible</hi> in <hi>Kiſſing it;</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>pulling off the Hat;</hi> to the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by <hi>Bowing;</hi> to the <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> by ſetting <hi>Candles</hi> on it. Which being ſo many Actions intended to ſignifie the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100730:14"/>
               <hi>Interior</hi> Sentiment and Affection of the <hi>Soul;</hi> there can certainly be no more of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in them, or <hi>Superſtition,</hi> than there is in the <hi>Intention,</hi> or in the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> the one being the ſame <hi>outwardly,</hi> what the other is <hi>inwardly.</hi> And, however ſome Divines and Leading Men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are in love with wrangling, and thro' the Influence of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Temper, ſeem to be afraid of a better Underſtanding coming amongſt Chriſtians, take pains to blow up this Controverſie with ſome School and Empty Notions; yet 'tis not to be thought, there's any great difference between the <hi>Two Churches,</hi> were they to Speak their Senſe in a <hi>Cool</hi> and <hi>Moderate</hi> Temper, where they might be free from the Suggeſtions of ſuch <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Fiery</hi> Spirits, who ſeem to be rather Men of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> than of <hi>Religion.</hi> For, can it be imagin'd, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who confeſſes, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> inſtructed by the Apoſtles, <hi>Honor'd</hi> the <hi>NAME</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and had an <hi>Honorable Eſteem</hi> for the <hi>SIGN</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> can be in good earneſt againſt thoſe, who expreſs <hi>outwardly</hi> this <hi>Honor,</hi> which in it ſelf is thus acknowledg'd of <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> and to have been the Doctrin of the Apoſtles? If the Apoſtles too, as ſhe owns above, did <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> the <hi>NAME</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> by their <hi>Mouths</hi> and <hi>Words;</hi> can ſhe condemn thoſe, who do the like with their <hi>Hands,</hi> their <hi>Heads</hi> or <hi>Knees?</hi> If it be the Doctrin of the Holy Ghoſt, to have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100730:14"/>
this <hi>Honor</hi> for the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in our <hi>Hearts;</hi> and the Apoſtles, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of that Holy Spirit, did <hi>expreſs</hi> this by their <hi>Words;</hi> may not <hi>We</hi> do ſo too? And if We may do this in <hi>Words,</hi> may not we do it in any other way of <hi>Expreſſing</hi> our Senſe, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given us, and are anſwerable to <hi>Words? Words</hi> are nothing more than for their <hi>Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> and if we <hi>ſignifie</hi> our thoughts by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, as by <hi>Signs,</hi> by any <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>Geſture</hi> of our Body; theſe <hi>Actions</hi> being to expreſs the <hi>ſame affection</hi> of our Soul, which we other ways do by <hi>Words,</hi> they are as Innocent as our <hi>Words;</hi> and 'tis impoſſible the <hi>Actions</hi> ſhould be <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Words</hi> are <hi>Orthodox:</hi> Since be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught by the Apoſtles, to have an <hi>Honor</hi> in our <hi>Hearts</hi> for the <hi>SIGN</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> 'tis the ſame thing before God and Men, whether we ſignifie this outwardly by our <hi>Tongues,</hi> or by our <hi>Lips,</hi> or by our <hi>Hands,</hi> or by our <hi>Heads,</hi> or by our <hi>Knees;</hi> theſe being only ſo many different kinds of <hi>Speaking,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> ſenſe of our hearts. And whilſt they are ſo, there can be nothing juſtly charg'd upon any one of theſe <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>Expreſſing,</hi> but will as certainly fall upon all the reſt; for they being all upon the ſame inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſign, of ſhewing outwardly the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> we are taught by the Apoſtles to have in our <hi>hearts,</hi> and this <hi>Honor</hi> thus ſeverally expreſs'd, being but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame,</hi> founded upon the <hi>Relation</hi> the <hi>Sign</hi> of the Croſs has to Chriſt; if it be a <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> when 'tis ſignified by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100730:15"/>
the <hi>Knee,</hi> 'tis <hi>Religious</hi> too when ſignified by the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and alike <hi>Religious</hi> whilſt 'tis in the <hi>Heart;</hi> if it be <hi>Idolatrous</hi> to expreſs it by the <hi>Knee</hi> in <hi>bending,</hi> 'tis <hi>Idolatrous</hi> too, to expreſs it with the <hi>Tongue</hi> in <hi>Words;</hi> and moſt of all <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Point turns the Greateſt part of this Controverſie, which of it ſelf is very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. But our Anſwerer takes little care to ſee how the Queſtion ſtands; He's for expoſing the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as long as he has the knack of doing this by <hi>Ridiculing,</hi> and <hi>Drolling,</hi> what ſhould he trouble himſelf with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, as are <hi>ſtating the Queſtion,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking to the Point?</hi> He's ſatisfied the word <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> will do the work, without much need of longer Proofs; and therefore waving all ſuch kind of <hi>Controverſial Drudgery,</hi> he falls to the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> part, in which, from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent account of Hiſtorians, the diſagreement in <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> and other Circumſtances, he eaſily fills all with Confuſion and Uncertainty. A tedious work he makes about the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> and ſets it out in ſuch abuſive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with ſo much contempt and ſcorn, that he ſeems, at his writing this Character, to have come freſh from a <hi>Billings-gate Lecture.</hi> Hear how he attacks that Venerable Synod: <hi>They were a Pack of Greeks</hi> (ſays he <hi>pa.</hi> 38.) <hi>that were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wiſeſt, nor the honeſteſt Men in the World.</hi> Then having undervalued the Proofs of that Council as <hi>Senſeleſs</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> he adds, <hi>pa.</hi> 39.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100730:15"/>
               <hi>Now you may judge, whether theſe were not rare Greek Wits. Yet we might forgive their want of Brains, if they had been Men of Integrity; but they were diſhoneſt too.</hi> In this manner do's he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement this great Synod with the Honorable Titles of <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Knaves.</hi> Certainly he muſt be a wiſe Man in his own conceit, who makes ſo bold with three hundred and fifty Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Popes Legates, and the Vicars of the Oriental Patriarchs. But I leave him in this Buffoonry, wiſhing him only much joy of his Admirable Talent in this kind. The Chief thing he urges againſt this Council, is their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he pretends, <hi>Superſtitious Errors,</hi> the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> or <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> ſuch as our Author judges to be nothing elſe than <hi>Idolatry;</hi> in this, doing altogether like himſelf, who quarrels with every thing; but how unlike the more Learned and Moderate Divines of his own Church, who vindicate this Council from all ſuch imputations! Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> freely confeſſing, that he <hi>muſt maintain as unqueſtionable, that the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>injoyns no Idolatry,</hi> Epil. 3. pa. 363. And Dr. <hi>Field</hi> affirming, that the Nicence <hi>Fathers mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe by Adoration of Images, but embracing, kiſſing, and reverently uſing of them, and like to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor we do the Books of Holy Scripture. (Of the Church</hi> l. 3. c. 36.) Thus do theſe Eminent Men deliver their Senſe of this <hi>Council</hi> and it's <hi>Doctrin,</hi> which our Author has thought fit to render ſo <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to the World. He catches at <hi>Words,</hi> and without Examining or Underſtanding them,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100730:16"/>
makes <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> of the moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and Chriſtian Doctrin: And this I look upon the occaſion of his letting flie ſo furiouſly at this <hi>Venerable Synod,</hi> and of all his Rallery againſt it. But I proceed to conſider his other Arguments.</p>
            <p>The principal thing he inſiſts on, and which runs thro' his whole Pamphlet, is, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it appear, even as a thing probable, that <hi>Images</hi> were ſo much as ſet up in Churches in the Primitive Times; and upon this Practice, now ſo common in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes her with the Guilt of <hi>Innovation.</hi> An Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Argument, well becoming a Leader of the People! But this is the Motive of <hi>Reforming.</hi> And do not ſome other Reformers, upon the ſame grounds, prove the uſe of <hi>Organs,</hi> in the <hi>Divine Service,</hi> to be an <hi>Innovation;</hi> ſince it cannot be made appear, even as probable, that there were any ſuch things known to the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the firſt three or four hundred years? And do not others, ſtill treading over the ſame ſteps, make the uſe of <hi>Cathedrals</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> of <hi>Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Prebendaries,</hi> an <hi>Innovation</hi> in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; ſince in the <hi>Primitive times</hi> there were no ſuch things heard <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

After this rate ſome Men are pleas'd to argue; and at this pace the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may go on improving every day, till there's nothing of Chriſtianity left, if ſuch Principles and Reaſons of ſome <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Reformers</hi> are but follow'd, as Juſt and Convincing.

and Paſſionate Men. Others, who weigh things duely, know that the Circumſtances of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, their being under Severe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> their living and converſing in the middle of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp;c. did make many things <hi>inconvenient</hi> and <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> at that time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch as related to the <hi>Solemnity</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the Church, which otherwiſe were <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Montagu,</hi> a Wiſe and Learned Man, throughly conſider'd; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in relation to <hi>Images,</hi> which, he ſays, in the firſt Ages were but few or none in publick, not becauſe they were then <hi>Unlawful,</hi> or <hi>contrary</hi> to the Doctrin of the Apoſtles; but becauſe they were inconvenient in thoſe times of Perſecution and Paganiſm. I'll here ſet down his own words to ſatisfie the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> and to let him ſee the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Spirit of Peace and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that of Bitterneſs and Wrangling. Thus then that Worthy Divine argues in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Caeſar,</hi> c. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As the Ancient Fathers of the Primitive Times had very few or no Churches at all, at leaſt of Note, Dignity or of Receipt, becauſe they liv'd in Times of fierce Perſecution, and were ſeldom, or Few of them Stationary, but compell'd <hi>ſubinde mutare ſedes;</hi> ſo had they very few, I grant, or no Pictures at all in public uſe amongſt them, not ſo much as for Ornament ſake. And the reaſon was, becauſe they lived continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Pagans, and were themſelves, for the moſt part, ſuch as had abandon'd and come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100730:17"/>
from Paganiſm unto Chriſt; that were bred in, brought up in, inur'd to, and faſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto Idolatry in Image-worſhip. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſpoke againſt them with ſome tartneſs and inveighing ſort, leſt haply by converſing with, or neighboring upon Pagans, or thro' former uſe of being miſ-led by thoſe Pagans, the Novel and tender Shoots of Chriſtianity might receive hurt, and learn to worſhip Idols, as thoſe Pagans did.</q> In which words this Author plainly declares, that tho' there was not the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic uſe of <hi>Images</hi> in the firſt Ages; yet the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance of them afterwards into Churches was no <hi>Innovation,</hi> as our Anſwerer pretends; but the practiſing of a thing, which in all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Ages had been <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> but not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> for the reaſons here aſſign'd by him. Which thing the ſame Author has thus clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in the foregoing Chapter, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the uſe of <hi>Images: Before</hi> St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I know no ſuch confeſt employment for them. He was the firſt that gave ſuch public approbation unto them DECLARATORILY, tho' it was TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E DOCTRIN IN IT SELF, before he ever profeſs'd it ſuch.</hi> Can any thing be more clearly expreſs'd? Is it not evidently here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d by a <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Divine,</hi> that the Uſe of <hi>Images,</hi> as approv'd and allow'd by Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was for giving <hi>Reverence and Reſpect unto them,</hi> as this Author confeſſes in the ſame Chapter, was a <hi>True Doctrin in it ſelf;</hi> tho' it was never <hi>profeſſedly declar'd</hi> before this

time? And yet our <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> unacquainted it ſeems with the Doctrin of his own <hi>Church,</hi> and with the Circumſtances of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> comes here with the full Cry of <hi>Innovation,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the World and me a needleſs trouble of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Controverſie, which has been ſo long ago decided, as to this Point, by a Divine of his own Church. But alas, ſome Men, who have for a long time from their <hi>Caſtle of Priviledge,</hi> with a <hi>Noiſy,</hi> but <hi>Empty</hi> Controverſie, peeviſhly declaim'd againſt all ſorts of Adverſaries; and there boaſtingly triumph'd, where they know no body dar'd contradict or queſtion them, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think they may do the like in <hi>Print,</hi> and that they may as eaſily impoſe upon all <hi>Readers,</hi> as upon their <hi>Hearers.</hi> And I deſire our Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to conſider, how far he is here concern'd, who thus dares to venture abroad, with theſe <hi>Raw</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconnected</hi> Notions.</p>
            <p>But the Anſwerer is reſolv'd however, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Reader of the Unlawfulneſs of <hi>Images;</hi> and in order to this tells him, as before, that the <hi>Antient Heretics</hi> were Friends to <hi>Images.</hi> I wont ask here; Why then do's the <hi>Church of</hi> England uſe them in her Places of Worſhip? But, I'll tell him in his own Words, that this is a <hi>Silly Artifice;</hi> and that every thing is not to be condemn'd, which was us'd by ſuch a ſort of People. He knows, I hope, that the <hi>Antient Heretics</hi> us'd the <hi>Bible</hi> too, as likewiſe <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> and yet ſure all theſe are not to be rejected upon this ſcore. I have here ſhew'd him already out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100730:18"/>
of his own Authors, who firſt <hi>declaratorily</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd the uſe of Holy <hi>Images,</hi> giving Reverence and Reſpect unto them; and that this was a <hi>True Doctrin in it ſelf,</hi> before he ever profeſs'd it: And what matter then, if ſome <hi>Heretics</hi> admitted of the ſame, who are wont to abuſe even the beſt of things, as the Anſwerer ſays, the <hi>Gnoſtics</hi> did, <hi>pa.</hi> 57. who rankt <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Image with thoſe of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> As to what he ſays before, <hi>pag.</hi> 53. that <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> I. and II. contradict each other in this Point, he would do well to explicate this fuller in his next; for Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> II. is no more for <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> than <hi>Gregory</hi> I. as appears in that Letter of his to <hi>Leo Iſaurus</hi> cited in <hi>Nubes Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, pa.</hi> 183. Where writing to the Emperor: <hi>You charge us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with the Adoration of Stones, and Walls, and Pictures. But 'tis not ſo as you affirm, O Emperor! What we do is only to refreſh our Memory, to raiſe our minds to Heaven,—and not, as you urge, to Worſhip them as Gods; no, God forbid, we place no hope in them.</hi> How then do's he contradict <hi>Gregory</hi> I. while he's no more for Worſhiping Images than he was? But he that has Forehead enough to charge me with a Notion of <hi>Invocating of Images,</hi> as he do's, <hi>pa.</hi> 66. when I have no ſuch Word or Hint, muſt not be call'd to an account for every thing he ſays.</p>
            <p>I have little more to conſider in this <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> beſides his great Kindneſs and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who, with his Good
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100730:18"/>
Friend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> is ſo favorable to them, as in a manner to excuſe them from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſo the better to fix this Crime upon the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> Tho' the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in this Point, is ſo like what the Church of <hi>England</hi> teaches, that (as is ſhewn above) there's little difference betwixt them, beſides about <hi>School Terms</hi> and <hi>Words.</hi> The World knows the good underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there was between <hi>Sultan Solyman</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther,</hi> and how friendly the Followers of this <hi>New Prophet</hi> were taught to be to the <hi>Turks;</hi> but why our <hi>Engliſh Reformers</hi> upon <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſhould be at this day ſo kind to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> muſt be left to every one to gueſs. The <hi>Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> aſſures the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Quality, pa.</hi> 11. to whom he writes, that to charge the Heathens with <hi>Worſhiping Stocks and Stones as Gods,</hi> is to <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent</hi> them. And yet how many times has this very thing been inſtill'd into the Peoples Heads, as True of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which now, as we are inform'd, is a <hi>Miſrepreſentation,</hi> when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd of the <hi>Pagans?</hi> Are not the <hi>Pagans</hi> here deeply indebted to theſe <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Men,</hi> in their owning them to be <hi>Miſrepreſented,</hi> whilſt the ſame Abomination is ſo liberally charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and yet no <hi>Miſrepreſentation</hi> there, if you'l believe 'em? This is to make the <hi>Papiſts</hi> worſe than Heathens; and without either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Good manners,</hi> to advance even <hi>now</hi> that <hi>Plot-Divinity,</hi> which was Preach'd by a Doctor before the <hi>Houſe of Commons, April</hi> 11. 1679. Who ſetting out <hi>Popery</hi> in ſuch colors, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100730:19"/>
might be moſt effectual to excite that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to the Drawing of Blood, after ſeveral Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Characters, at laſt <hi>pa.</hi> 30. thus concludes; <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it is a Religion, that will engage you in a more Unnatural Idolatry, than ever the Pagans were guilty of.</hi> Is not this a rare Character of one Chriſtian from another? Nay from <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Chriſtians too,</hi> ſuch who pretend to ſo much <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> above their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; and yet to caſt forth ſo much <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,</hi> that could be expected from none, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Julian,</hi> or a <hi>Lucian?</hi> But I take no advantage here, I conſider this was deliver'd in a time of an <hi>Epidemical Madneſs;</hi> and what wonder, if the <hi>Pulpits</hi> did not eſcape the <hi>Contagion?</hi> But why at this time of the day ſhould <hi>this Lecture</hi> be read to the People? Is not the <hi>Plot</hi> out of ſome People's heads yet? Is the Infection ſo laſting? But what ſhall we ſay; the Encloſure of ſome Men's Religion, is only <hi>to be againſt Popery.</hi> They raiſe a monſtrous Notion in their own <hi>Brains;</hi> and while they expoſe this to the People, they make the <hi>Innocent</hi> ſuffer for their <hi>Deluſion.</hi> They'l joyn hands with the <hi>Turk</hi> or the <hi>Pagan,</hi> ſo they can but make a Devil of the <hi>Papiſt.</hi> And in this ſome of their <hi>Furioſo's</hi> are ſo blindly raſh, that they care not how <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> they make their <hi>own Church,</hi> ſo they can but ſet out the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> for <hi>Idolaters.</hi> For here I deſire any ſerious Man to conſider, if the Papiſts were thus really <hi>Idolaters, as bad or worſe than the Heathens,</hi> as theſe Men ſuggeſt, what Advantage would this be to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100730:19"/>
the <hi>Church of</hi> England? What kind of Church muſt the <hi>Church of</hi> England be, who has no <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Succeſſion,</hi> or <hi>Authority of Preaching,</hi> but what ſhe has receiv'd from theſe <hi>Idolaters?</hi> What kind of Church muſt ſhe be, whilſt ſhe owns <hi>her ſelf</hi> and <hi>Theſe Idolaters</hi> to be <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>ſame Church?</hi> What kind of Church muſt ſhe be, whilſt ſhe acknowledges, that all her Members for a Thouſand Years before <hi>Henry</hi> 8. were in Communion with theſe <hi>Idolaters;</hi> and in all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rites and Worſhip, were comprehended in the <hi>Papacy?</hi> Muſt not ſhe have been a very <hi>Diſſembling</hi> and <hi>Adulterous</hi> Church; whilſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>internally</hi> the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Pure</hi> Faith of Chriſt, ſhe did for ſo many years <hi>externally</hi> practiſe all the <hi>ſuppoſed Superſtitions</hi> and <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſhe judg'd to be moſt Wicked and Damnable? Is not this an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Character of a Pretended Church of Chriſt, to have play'd the <hi>Hypocrit</hi> for ſo many Ages, committing Adultery with the Suppoſed <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> and partaking in all her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Abominations? What greater Blow could an Enemy give to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than ſome of her <hi>Divines</hi> do thus with their own hands, who, like <hi>Spiritual Janizaries,</hi> deſtroy their <hi>own Mother Church</hi> of which they are <hi>Members?</hi> For is it not evident, that whilſt they endeavor to make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> they prove their own Church for ſo many years to have been <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> to have been a <hi>Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Church, a Church denying Chriſt and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>

            <p>And what more Forcible Argument need any <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to juſtifie their <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church of <hi>England?</hi> For ſince the greateſt part of thoſe things upon which the <hi>Diſſent</hi> is founded, are ſuch as have been inſtituted and commanded by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> why ſhou'd they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them from the <hi>Church of</hi> England, whilſt theſe ſame <hi>Church-Guides,</hi> who preſs the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, take ſo much pains to prove thoſe from whom they receiv'd them, to be <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and a ſort of Chriſtians worſe than <hi>Heathens?</hi> What reaſon has any Man to joyn in ſuch a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>Divine Service,</hi> when he is aſſur'd, that Thoſe from whom the greateſt Part is <hi>borrow'd,</hi> are <hi>Idolaters?</hi> Why ſhould any be tied to ſuch <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> if thoſe that inſtituted them were <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters?</hi> 'Tis but Rational for every Man to think, that if the Papiſts are ſo <hi>Stupid,</hi> ſo <hi>Sottiſh,</hi> ſo <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> ſuch <hi>Idolaters,</hi> ſo <hi>worſe than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> as every <hi>little Church-Divine</hi> is pleas'd to render them, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who retains ſo much of their <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be ſo far like them in <hi>Sottiſhneſs, Ridiculoſity, Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm;</hi> and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to become a <hi>Pure Chriſtian,</hi> muſt be to ſhake off, even that which She has retain'd.
