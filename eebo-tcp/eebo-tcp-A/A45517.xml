            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

No City-conſuming Fires, no ſweeping-Plague lays waſte our Dwellings; no Civil War hath vext of late the Land. Theſe Mercies much exceed our Merits; but the Cauſes of all theſe Calamities, and far greater (Groſs Errors and Miſtakes in Opinions and Practice, with wicked Contrivances of dreadful peril to Princes and to the Church) ſtill remain in a fuller Conflux than in former Times. Good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God, and ſpread before him the Letter that expreſt the Churche's, ſeeming unexpreſſible, Sorrows
<pb facs="tcp:58931:3"/>and Snares of Death. So I ſhall ſpread a Liſt of no leſs perilous Evils before your Sacred Majeſty, and this Honourable Senate (God's Subſtitutes), that ſo this Nation may timely foreſee and ſhun them; And (to that end) I count it my indiſpenſible Duty to God, to his Majeſty, and You, to tender this Treatiſe to you, becauſe it may much concern your Safeties, eſpecially in this juncture of Time. My humble Deſign therein is (by God's help, and your aſſiſtance) to remove thoſe many and moſt dangerous Opinions that hinder the Agreement of all Church-Societies, Sects and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So God may come (not to ſmite the Earth with a Curſe, as he lately ſeemed to be about to do, but) with healing in his Wings: So the ſubtil Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of ſecret Enemies may be turned into Amity, and Death be diſarmed: For, miſtaken wild Gourds were called Death; becauſe their Effects were like thoſe of the Waters into which the Star fell, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came bitter and deadly; but Miſtakes in Opinions and Manners are much more, in Men and to the Church the poiſoned Arrows of Death, which cannot be drawn forth, nor poſſibly removed, but by the <hi>Dictamnum</hi> of Truth made manifeſt: All other means, without this, may ſeem invalid; nor will the moſt vigilant care avail much, till this Work be firſt done or well begun. Difficult it muſt be, and not without danger, for the moſt powerful Efficient to work with much ſucceſs, where the Subject (the People almoſt generally) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uncapable through many miſtakes. Howbeit, as the Ark had no ſtay till the Waters abated, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on <hi>Ararat;</hi> So the Church; and the Nations of this World, can never find footing of any firm ſtability, till theſe floods of falſe Opinions (that daſh upon the
<pb facs="tcp:58931:3"/>Church and States with Storms and Tempeſt) decreaſe, or be dried up. As oft therefore as the beſt Founders build upon no better Foundations in Men; ſo oft muſt their Fabrick fall, and they, as oft renew their labour without effectual ſucceſs; For, Effects (their Cauſes continuing) muſt continue. That this moſt needful Work, of higheſt concern to You and to all Men, may ſucceed in your Majeſties hand, and in the hands of this Honourable Houſe (that you and they may be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Builders of laſting Peace and Proſperity to this and all Nations) is the inceſſant Prayer of</p>

            <head>READER,</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received a Paper by the hand of a Perſon of great Worth, but not compoſed (as he faith) by him, but by ſome other, whoſe Name (which ſeems a note of no fair dealing) is not ſubſcribed. The ground of the writing of it was this; I maintain, (in my Treatiſe Intituled, <hi>What is Truth?</hi>) That the Texts in the 17th and 18th Chapters of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> hold forth <hi>Rome</hi> literal, not only as Pagan or Heterodox, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as Chriſtian and Orthodox, but faln from her firſt Obedience; And not <hi>Rome</hi> Papal properly, nor otherwiſe, than as Primitive Literal <hi>Rome</hi> (faln as aforeſaid) ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed forth the Papal grand Apoſtacy, which is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome of the beſt Proteſtant Writers: And by their Authority, Reaſon, and chiefly from Scripture, I have, I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently proved the Truth of this Aſſertion. Howbeit, many Doctors and Divines of Note, take no notice of their own perilous Deceptions, in miſtaking (a thing almoſt incredible) two whole Chapters together; and have not ſpared to charge me (becauſe I therein diſſent from them) with dangerous Error, to my very great dammage, and no leſs danger to the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Nor have I them to deal with, but the Learned Dr. <hi>Fulk, Jewel, Whitgift, Pareus, Mede,</hi> and many thouſands more, are conſentient in the ſame Opinion with my Opponent. I muſt humbly confeſs, I am inferior to many of them; therefore my task, and the difficulty to do it, muſt be the greater; But I muſt (as a Duty indiſpenſible) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb facs="tcp:58931:5"/>to refel theſe <hi>Magnatum Errores,</hi> Errors of great Writers, moſt dangerous to the Church, by turning (in very many places of it) even the Scripture it ſelf into a contrary ſence. Nor need I wiſh I had the Conſubſcriptions of all Writers that defend what my Opponent maintains; for, I ſuppoſe, I have that already, or what is equivalent to it, in theſe Objections, which contain (ſo far as I find) more, and ſome of them more ſeeming ſubſtantial Arguments, than I ever found in all Writers that defend my Opponents Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; therefore all their Arguments, in the refutation of his, muſt be refelled. But my Opponent comes (as in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>) diſguiſed, with many groſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, as if he were ſome Man of mean Abilities; which makes me think that ſome able Divines (joining with that Perſon of great Learning that gave me this Paper) might give him his ſtrongeſt Arguments, and leave the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of ſome of them to him. That he ſhould conceal his Name, thereby to falſify the Scriptures, and affirm anything without controul, is unjuſt in my account. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might count it a Crime in me, to conceal that Perſon of eminence and worth (Mr. <hi>Joſeph Caryl</hi>) that gave me this Paper, who (ſatisfied with theſe Anſwers before he died) did it, no doubt, to promote the Truth, and make it appear. Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> therefore (whom I knew, and from whoſe hand I had this Paper) muſt ſtand inſtead here of my other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Opponent. I ſhall not detein my Reader with a long Anſwer to his Objections, but only make my Anſwers be a brief Introduction to a general Refutation of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errors and Miſtakes in all Sects, Saints, and ſorts of Profeſſors, that would actuate them into inevitable (at leaſt temporal) Perdition, if God in great mercy (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them) prevent it not.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58931:6"/>in the, 17th and 18th Chapter, is intended by the Holy Ghoſt of <hi>Rome</hi> Papal only; And yet he (contradicting himſelf in this eleventh Objection) ſaith expreſly, <hi>That five of the ſeven Heads of the Roman Monarchy (as it was</hi> Rome <hi>Pagan) were fallen.</hi> Of which ſeven Heads we find no mention at all in any part of the whole Scripture, but only in the 12th and 17th Chapters: Therefore the Texts in the 17th and 18th Chapters, hold forth (contrary to what my Opponent affirms, and, in all his Objections, undertakes to maintain) the Roman Monarchy under its ſeven Heads, as alſo my Opponent himſelf (groſly forgetting himſelf) fully grants in his ſaid eleventh Objection; And (having granted that) hath granted all, and yeelded up the entire ſtate of the whole Matter. I ſhould make, by right, no further reply at all to any of my Opponent's Objections; For, <hi>Pugna ſuum ſinem, cum jacet hoſtis, habet.</hi> All my work with my Opponent is done, for me, by him: For, the Objections (being fully anſwered from his own Confeſſion, and from Scripture exactly concurring therewith, and with my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) put a final period to all further diſpute: But becauſe that Perſon of great Worth that gave me this Paper, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd me to make Replies to each Objection, (for ſome of them ſeem far more ſubſtantial, and deſerve an Anſwer) and becauſe the proſecuting of them to a full refutation, may be a great bleſſing to all Ages and Nations, I ſhall make ſome anſwer to each. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We find, in his tenth Objection, a ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction more abſurd than the former; <hi>The ſeventh Head</hi> (ſays he) <hi>was Papal</hi> Rome; His words are theſe, <hi>Now Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Rome <hi>was the ſeventh Head, and he is the eighth;</hi> and, to prove it, falſly quotes <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.11.</p>
                  <p>Here my Opponent will needs ſhew himſelf to be ſome ſelf-contradicting <hi>Euripus</hi> of contrary Winds and Tides;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58931:7"/>for he, in his Preface, pretends to make it appear, That what is treated of in the 17th and 18th Chapters, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to, and is intended only, by the Holy Ghoſt, of Papal <hi>Rome;</hi> then he, in his eleventh Objection, contradicts all that, and ſaith, <hi>Now the Roman Monarchy, as it was</hi> Rome <hi>Pagan, was aſcended and had continued long, and five of the ſeven Heads of that Monarchy were fallen;</hi> where he makes thoſe ſeven Heads (all Papal in his Preface) all Pagan: And then</p>
                  <p>He, in his tenth Objection, contradicts all in his Preface, and all his own gain-ſayings of it in his eleventh Objection, and ſaith, <hi>Now the ſeventh Head was Papal</hi> Rome. Papiſts may well grow proud, and perſiſt impenitent to the Death, when they ſee Proteſtants of Note no better armed to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them: But ſuch ſelf-contradicting Abſurdities as theſe, are common with thoſe that liſt to be contentious; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſs blame my Opponent, and come to ſee, what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtuff he offers to the Reader.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, That my Opponent falſifies the Scriptures; <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is the eighth,</hi> and quotes the Text above-ſaid for it. This is Scripture of my Opponent's own making, for there is not one word in that Text to any ſuch purpoſe; to wit, <hi>That he</hi> (the <hi>ſeventh Head) is the eighth;</hi> But the Texts ſay expreſly, That <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> verſ 11. <hi>and ſhall aſcend and go into Perdition,</hi> verſ 8. <hi>even he is the eighth;</hi> in which words, not one word is found (as my Opponent aſſerts and pretends to find) that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head is the eighth. Thus my Opponent caſts Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon the Sacred Scripture, makes it hold forth ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Abſurdities, and contradict it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this my Opponent's (by him immediately contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58931:7"/>and yet owned) Opinion only, (that the ſeventh Head was Papal <hi>Rome</hi>'s power ſecular) but it's the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unparallel'd Abſurdity of moſt Apocalyptick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and of many Men of great Abilities: We ſhal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (leſs minding my Opponent's ſayings and unſayings) make reply to this common miſtake of confident Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Five are fallen and one is;</hi> Theſe ſix (as all Writers, my Opponent not excepted, confeſs) were the Heads of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Rome:</hi> We have now ſix to one odds to evince the Reader, that the ſeventh Head alſo (was not <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, but) appertained to <hi>Rome</hi> Literal, when partly Heathen, partly Chriſtian, but Hetrodox, and partly Orthodox, but beginning to apoſtate in practice. But how ſhall we fully prove it? We need not go far from the Text to prove it; <hi>And I saw a Woman</hi> (ſays <hi>John) ſit upon a ſcarlet-coloured Beaſt, having ſeven Heads,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ch.</hi> 17.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Having ſeven]</hi> That is, <hi>habens, tenens ſeptem,</hi> owning, poſſeſſing ſeven; Therefore, that Scarlet-Beaſt (the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Red Dragon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.3.) had (owned, poſſeſſed) all the ſeven; They were his Heads, and belonged to none beſides; and therefore, his ſeventh Head (was not <hi>Rome</hi> Papals Power ſecular, but) was the ſeventh Head of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Rome</hi>'s Scarlet Beaſt, becauſe he had not only ſix, but <hi>he had</hi> (owned) <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> ſaith the Text; and his eighth (his dying, ſcarce perfect, laſt Head, and therefore ſometimes not numbred with the ſeven; was alſo the Head of the ſame firſt Dragon, or Scarlet Beaſt, becauſe <hi>he was of the ſeven,</hi> Chap. 17.11. That is, He was an eighth, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſick power of the ſame politick Body, who (both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) went into Perdition (expired together for ever) about the year 412. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.8, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There was a Man of great Stature, that had, on each
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58931:8"/>hand, ſix Fingers, and ſix Toes on each foot,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.20. But how ſhall, we prove it, that he had ſix Fingers on each hand, and ſix Toes on each foot? And what need is there of any ſuch enquiry? The Text it ſelf ſays expreſly, that he had ſix, and that's proof enough. So the Roman Red Dragon in the 12th Chapter, or the Scarlet-coloured Beaſt in the 17th Chapter, had ſeven Heads, and alſo an eighth, which was of the ſeven: But how ſhall we fully prove it? And what need is there of any ſuch Queſtion? The Texts ſay expreſly, that he had ſeven, and an eighth alſo; <hi>And I ſaw a Scarlet-coloured Beaſt having ſeven Heads,</hi> Chap. 12.3. Chap. 17.3. and an eighth alſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. and that's proof enough, proof expreſs from Sacred Scripture, there needs no more. All my Opponent's Objections are therefore, the third time, perfectly, and fully refelled, and the undeniable refutation of all Writers, conſentient with him, made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly concludent: For no Man living, that is ſober, can pretend to expect any further or fuller proof from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than the expreſs words of Texts, where they, are lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally intended. Therefore neither could that Scarlet Beaſts ſix Heads, nor his ſeventh, be (as my Opponent ſays and unſays, he and they were) the ſecular Repreſentatives of Papal <hi>Rome.</hi> Why then do ſo exceeding many great Writers thus gainſay the Truth in Scripture ſo undeniably manifeſt? Here's their miſery, and the miſtake of all Apocalyptick Expoſitors (I can ſcarce exclude any, except Papiſts, whom it concerns not) that they ſeek not the ſeven Heads of the Papal Power ſecular, under the ſeven Trumpets, and ſeven Vials, where only they may be found: But they ſeek that ſucceſſive Heptarchy, and its ſeven Heads, among the eight Heads of the Scarlet Beaſt, where they can never be found, becauſe that Scarlet Beaſt of Literal <hi>Rome,</hi> with his eight Heads, periſhed for ever before that Papal Repreſentative,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58931:8"/>or any of his ſeven Heads could poſſibly exiſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. For it was impoſſible that the Papacy ſhould ariſe up in Power, till Imperial <hi>Rome</hi> (that letted her riſing) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; Her final Removal began about 407 in <hi>an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> (a daſhing of Nations) after the opening of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seal, and about the time when the firſt of the ſeven Trumpets (which reſpect the Papacy) began to found, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.5. I have alſo given, in my firſt Treatiſe, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Series of the performances of theſe Prophecies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps conform to the true intent of their Predictions: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if we may believe Sacred Writ, or the Records of Goſpel-Witneſſes, and it proud Profeſſors, minding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, will not ſtill perſiſt to add to, or diminiſh from the words of the Book of this Prophecy to their own <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>) there's Proof enough (Scripture-proof abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant) to make it fully concludent, that the Tests in the 17th and 18th Chapters, hold forth Pagan Imperial, and alſo Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> Apoſtate in Manners, as my firſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe ſhews at large, and that they do not reſpect Papal <hi>Rome</hi> ſolely and alone (as my Opponents ſeeks to prove, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it himſelf) nor Papal-<hi>Rome</hi> at all, otherwiſe than as <hi>Rome</hi> Literal (chiefly under her eighth Head) held forth (as a figure of it) the Papal grand Apoſtacy.

                  <p>That the Viſions of the Vials begin in the fifteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that they reſpect the ſtate of Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> I deny not: That the full account of their being poured forth, is begun and ended in the 16th Chapter, and not continued in the 17th and 18th Chapters (as my Opponent ſays they are) I affirm: For, we find the 7th and laſt Vial poured out in the 17th Verſe of the 16th Chapter, and the firſt poured forth in the ſecond Verſe of the ſame Chapter: But that Text in the 17th Verſe (concurring with the ſame Record upon Oath by the Living God, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.6, 7.) ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>It is done,</hi> Chap. 16.17. And, What was done? The Viſion of the ſeven Vials, and of the ſtate of Papal <hi>Rome</hi> under them, was done or ended in the 16th Chapter, and therefore is not continued (as my Opponent ſays it is) in the 17th and 18th Chapters; <hi>It is done</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.17. Theſe two Texts (that in the 10th Chapter, and this in the 16th) aſſert the ſame thing done at the ſame time: For, that Prophetical Record upon Oath by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God in the 10th Chapter, was to be performed after the end of the firſt ſix Trumpets, and about the beginning of the ſeventh, when the Witneſſes ſhould finiſh, or be about to finiſh, the 1260 Years of their Sackcloth-Propheſie: And this Text in this 16th Chapter, correſponds exactly therewith, witneſſing that the ſame thing ſhould be performed at the ſame time; to wit, After the firſt ſix Vials, and at the beginning of the ſeventh; ſo exactly congruous are the ſeven Trumpets, and ſeven Vials, in what they hold forth: <hi>There ſhall be no longer time</hi> (no longer time of the Papal grand Apoſtacy ſtanding firm, or without any effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſtroke tending to its diſcontinuance, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.6.) <hi>It is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58931:9"/>done</hi> (ſaith the Text expreſly) <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.17. And thus my Opponent's firſt Objection (and in that all the reſt) falls to duſt with one ſtroke from the very words of the Text (beſides thoſe upon Oath by the Living God, in the 10th Chapter) expreſly gainſaying it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is my Opponent herein faulty alone, but all Writers and Teachers, conſentient with him, muſt be (like him) at a loſs in miſtaking the Matter of ſundry Texts ahd Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not knowing where it begins, nor where it ends, nor what they hold forthe Nor are ſuch miſtakes peculiar to him or them alone, but incident (as an Epidemick Diſeaſe) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to all Writers: For, the moſt able and Orthodox (I can except very few) are not free from many miſtakes, that work ſetled habits of Error againſt Truth and: Reaſon: My Progreſs thereſom (till ſuch falſe Foundations be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved) may give great offence to ſuch, and ſatisfie few; For, ſo many miſapprehenſions work (as it were) an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal incapability; and, where the Subject is uncapable, the Agent cannot operate: I am driven therefore here, by ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent conſtraint and unavoidably (as the Reader may plainly perceive) to a brief Digreſs, that I may remove thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes that obſtruct them in reading, and my ſucceſs in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; for, otherwiſe they muſt needs read both the Scriptures and thoſe Books that beſt unfold them, with little profit, if they are not firſt well informed where the Matter in the Texts and Chapters begins, where it ends, and what they hold forth; Theſe <hi>Remora's</hi> therefore muſt be firſt removed: Such an Intendment (provided it be effectual) do all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages call for, and the preſent claims to refel Errors, to reform Manners, to heal the Churche's almoſt deadly wounds made wide (beſides no few failings of her own) by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ignorance of ſundry ſubdiviſions; and to procure the Peace, Converſion, and Reviction of all Sects and Nations.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58931:10"/>Something hath often been pretended, but not effectually and in earneſt intended to theſe ends: I ſhall therefore (with humble, ſubmiſſion to the Judgments of Men more able) endeavour (as a duty indiſpenſable to God and to his Church) to ſhew briefly what ſundry Texts and Chapters (not only in the Scriptures counted plain, but) in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and in this compendium of Propheſies (the <hi>Apocalyps</hi>) hold forth, and where the Matter in them begins, and where it ends: I promiſed to explain more fully, ſome Texts han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in my firſt Treatiſe, and it falls in moſt fit here to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Promiſe: Nor let any grudg at this brief Digreſs; for it may, perhaps, prove (not only uſeful, but) needful for all that read the Scriptures, (both the Prophetical, and thoſe called plain) and for all that ſhall hereafter Preach or Write upon either.

               <p>The Serpent brought Sin and Death upon all Men by beguiling <hi>Eve:</hi> That Cauſe and thoſe Effects are ſince grown into an exceſs of greatneſs; but we find in this laſt Book, an <hi>undefiled Company that ſhall be without guile, and

I need not, I ſuppoſe, proceed further upon this Subject to prove, that this laſt Book of Holy Writ, (wherein mention is ſometimes made of the the whole World, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) was not intended to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> only; I therefore deſiſt from further enlargement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt three Chapters (whoſe Propheſies had reſpect chiefly to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and were long ſince fulfilled) and come to the fourth Chapter.</p>

                  <p>THis Chapter holds forth an Hiſtorical Deſcription of the Primitive Church, chiefly, in the Apoſtle's Times: That Church (as here deſcribed) was a tranſient adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or figure of the Goſpel-Church revived and returned (after the 1260 years of the laſt grand Apoſtacy) out of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58931:12"/>the Wilderneſs; For, we find, in this Chapter, <hi>a Throne, and a Sea of Glaſs like unto Cryſtal, before it,</hi> verſ. 6. That Throne and Sea of Glaſs was the Primitive Church; And we find her returned-Antitype (the Church in future) ſet forth <hi>by a Sea of Glaſs mingled with Fire,</hi> Chap. 15.2. That is, the Primitive Saints and Profeſſors were a knowing and diſcerning People; and ſo ſhall their Antitype (the Goſpel Church convinced and returned) be much more for ever: For, the Primitive Church ſoon (in about 400 years) paſſed away and fled into the Wilderneſs (into ſecret ſubterfuges of obſcure latency) for 1260 years, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.6, 14.

                  <p>That Throne, in this fourth Chapter, was the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents of the Primitive Church, whereon God ſat ſupream; And <hi>the Sea of Glaſs before it was</hi> that Church; So, by <hi>the Sea of Glaſs</hi> in the 15th Chapter, is meant the Church in future times; and thoſe Victors born up by it, and ſtanding upon it, ſhall be (under God) the Superviſors over it.</p>

                  <p>That we may more certainly know what Book this is, and how long it was to continue ſealed, we muſt ſearch <hi>what God declared to the Prophets concerning the Antitype My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God, and the Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> then oppoſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the time of the laſt grand Apoſtacy, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Figures and Fore runners in the Primitive Times; For, <hi>this is the Book of what God declered to his Servants the Prophets,</hi> concerning the two firſt, and thoſe two laſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. to <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.6, 7. And firſt, This Book began to be ſealed in the Primitive Times about the Year 70, when <hi>Flavius Veſpaſian</hi> began to Reign, the <hi>Jews</hi> to be rejected, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be deſtroyed: It continued ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that time to 407, when the Primitive Church <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs,</hi> and the Orthodox (but Apoſtate) Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire departed or began to paſs away: Then the Papal grand Apoſtacy ſucceeded, and the Book became doubly Sealed.</p>
                  <p>This Book therefore beginning to be ſealed in the Year 70, contains the Preſages of the ſtate of the Primitive Church, and of the Bloody proceedings of her proper An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, or Myſtery of Iniquity, from that time to 407, when ſhe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> as aforeſaid; Then the Antitype Myſtery of his Iniquity, or Papal grand Apoſtacy, invaded the Chriſtian World for 1060 Years, before any effectual means of its
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58931:13"/>diſcontinuance was made manifeſt: And this laſt grand Myſtery of Iniquity with its effects, and the time of its continuance, and the deplored ſtate of the Wilderneſs-Church under it, is alſo much more the Matter of this ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book, <hi>which God declared to his Servants the Prophets.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>How does it plainly appear, That the Myſtery of God, and the Myſtery of Iniquity, in the time of the Primitive Defection, and in the time of the Papal Apoſtacy, with what one did and the other ſuffered, is that in this ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book, <hi>which God declared to his Servants the Prophets?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, (though more fully afterwards) That we muſt mind what the chief Matter in the Myſtery of Iniquity was, and what its Prefigurations were; For, the Myſtery of God was paſſive under them, whiles they were in Power, and therefore, in that time, did not, or not much, appear.</p>
                  <p>The chief Matter, or Subſtance prefigured, was the Secular Power of the Papacy; it was ſhadowed forth by its firſt Figures, and its immediate fore runner: And firſt,</p>
                  <p>There were many firſt figures of the Matter of this ſealed Book; I ſhall here briefly inſtance but in one, which is that of the four Beaſts in <hi>Daniel</hi> the 7th. By which four, by what they did, and by the ſtate of the Church under them, God did declare to <hi>Daniel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet his Servant, what the Matter of this ſealed Book ſhould be in the Primitive Times, and in the time of the Papal grand Apoſtacy. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God declared to his Servant <hi>John</hi> (the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prophet) by four Beaſts alſo, by their bloody Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in the Primitive Times, and the Churches Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by them, what the matter of this ſealed Book ſhould
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58931:14"/>be in the time of the Papal grand Apoſtacy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. to the end of the Chapter. And</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God declared to his Servant <hi>John</hi> (by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſignatures of thoſe four Beaſts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſet upon the ſecular beaſt Papal, and by the unparallel'd evil practices of that Beaſt) what the Matter of this ſealed Book was to be under the Papacy for 1260 Years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2, 3, 4, 5. to the 9th verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe four Beaſts in <hi>Daniel</hi> ſucceeded each worſe, and leſs Noble than his Predeceſſor.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe four Beaſts in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. ſucceeded alſo one worſe than another. And</p>
                  <p>Thoſe four Signatures upon the ſecular Beaſt Papal, were the Marks of the four Beaſts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that ſucceeded each worſe than other, which alſo undeniably denotes, that Papal Beaſt to be the fifth <hi>Monarch,</hi> and the Papacy to be the fifth <hi>Monarchy.</hi> I might give many other Inſtances, but this in this place is ſufficient, and clearly demonſtrates, That this ſealed Book, in its Antitype, or Subſtance prefigured, is the Book of what God hath declared to his Servants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, concerning the finiſhing of the Myſtery of God, and the ſuppreſſing and final ſubverting of the Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſhews how both muſt be effected: But that this Book is ſo, and what the time of its continuing ſealed is, is confirmed by Chriſt upon his Oath, <hi>By the Living God,</hi> Chap. 10. For.</p>
                  <p>When the firſt ſix Angels had ſounded their ſix Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets for 1260 Years (which time runs parallel with the Witneſſes Sackcloth Propheſie, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.3.) then we find the Angel of the Covenant, (<hi>who took this Book ſealed out of his right Hand, that ſate upon the Throne,</hi> Chap. 5.7.) <hi>having it open in his Hand,</hi> Chap. 10.2.

The Prophecies under that Seal, are held forth to the 7th verſe of that Chapter, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances extend to the Year 407, when the Church fled for 1260 Years, and the Empire fell (began to fall) for ever. But we find no mention at all of this Book being opened when that ſeventh Seal was opened, nor until 1260 Years after, when the firſt ſix Trumpets had founded, the firſt ſix Vials were poured forth, and when the Witneſſes had finiſhed the 1260 years of their Sackcloth Prophecy, as we have proved ſufficiently before in the Texts aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There ſhall be no longer time;</hi> There's the firſt part of Chriſt's Oath by the living God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But in the days of the ſeventh Angel, when he ſhall begin to ſound, the Myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed;</hi> There's the ſecond
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58931:15"/>part of Chriſt's Oath by the Living God. The firſt part terminates the time of this Book being ſealed, or until it ſhould begin to be opened; For we find it open in Chriſt's Hand immediately before he made this Oath, and open in <hi>John</hi>'s hand immediately after he had made it. This firſt part of Chriſt's Oath terminates alſo the progreſs of the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt, or until there ſhould be ſome thing materially tending to its diſcontinuance, which might be (as will after appear) about the year 1666, or ſoon after.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of Chriſt's Oath, ſtates the beginning of the Antitype-Myſtery of God to be finiſhed, or till ſomething ſhould effectually tend to the finiſhing of it, which might appear at the ſame time aforeſaid, or ſoon after. Thus Chriſt himſelf, upon his Oath by the Living God, fully confirms the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> of the Myſtery of Inquity, or the time when it ſhould begin to fall; And likewiſe the <hi>Terminus a qus</hi> of the Myſtery of God, or the time when it ſhould begin to be finiſhed; and therefore he muſt of neceſſity confirm alſo, by the ſame Oath, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Book being ſealed, and ſtate the time when it ſhould begin to be opened. For it were abſurd to think, and a thing impoſſible, that the Myſtery of Iniquity can begin to fall, and the Myſtery of God begin to be finiſhed, till this Book (the only means, under God, to thoſe ends) ſhall begin to be opened. For, All the powers of the Sword, and policies of Church and States, the wiſeſt Counſels, and moſt careful circumſpection of Men and Saints (without that means to thoſe ends) ſignifie nothing. Therefore, the time of all the three (of the firſt beginning to fall, of the ſecond to be finiſhed, and of the beginning of this Book to be opened) is fully confirmed (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the inſedulity of ſleepy Inadvertiſts that mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58931:15"/>by the Teſtimony of Chriſt upon his Oath by the Living God. But</p>
                  <p>If this Book be the Book of <hi>what God declared to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets,</hi> concerning the Myſtery of God prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, and the means to the finiſhing of it, what then is meant by that (by the Prophets foretold) Myſtery of God? How or where ſhall we find it, or know what it is?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, This laſt Book of holy Writ holds forth that alſo, and further declares the time when it ſhould begin to be finiſhed; For, we find after 666, (Chapter 13. the laſt Verſe, and in the firſt Verſe of the 14th) theſe words, <hi>Then I looked, and lo, a Lamb ſtood on Mount Sion,</hi> &amp;c. That Lamb upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſhall be this Antitype <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God whom he declared to his Servants the Prophets:</hi> And who ſhall that Lamb, or ſo declared Myſtery of God, be?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That Lamb ſhall be the Secular and Spiritual Repreſentative of Chriſt Myſtical (the Goſpel-Church) revived and returned out of the Wilderneſs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.9, 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.6, 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.24, 25. For, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Myſtery of God</hi> in a Figure, who (when God had formed him, and breathed into him the breath of Life) became a Prophetick Adumbration of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (Chriſt Incarnate, dead and riſen from Death) he was the Root of that firſt, and of this Antitype-Myſtery of God in the Text: The firſt had, and this ſhall have their being and denominations from him. The firſt Man, or Myſtery of God, was a Prophet; The ſecond Man was the Patriarch of all Prophets; and both prophetically foretold (the firſt by his Sleep, the ſecond by his Death and Reſurrection) this <hi>Antitype-Myſtery</hi> of God, who alſo lay dead, and ſhall be revived <hi>by the breath of Life from God entering into him,</hi> Chap. 11.9, 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.14. And this Prefigured My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God (the chief end of Chriſt's coming and dying
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58931:16"/>in order to God's Glory) is the <hi>Myſtery of God</hi> in the Text, <hi>whom God declared to his Servants the Prophets,</hi> and who is the principal ſubject of this ſealed Book till he be finiſhed, and after ſhall be (when the ſame Book ſhall be opened) for evermore. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If this Book be (as the Text fully imports) the Book of <hi>what God declared to his Servants the Prophets.</hi> then it might ſeem to be the whole Scripture; which alſo ſome of the beſt Expoſitors (not rightly diſtinguiſhing) ſay in effect, as I noted before: For, the <hi>whole Scripture was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God</hi> to his Servants the Prophets <hi>by Inſpiration,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. All the Scripture therefore, might ſeem to be this ſealed Book, if it be the Book of <hi>What God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to his Servants the Prophets:</hi> which a Man may be the more apt to believe, becauſe Men, Saints, and Sects, ſo live, and ſo know and do, as if there were no Scripture, or as if all the Scripture were indeed ſealed: But, in order to the opening of the Seals of this Book, we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. For,</p>
                  <p>Some Scriptures are not ſealed in ſome reſpects, and, in others, ſealed.</p>
                  <p>Some are more, ſome leſs ſealed. And</p>
                  <p>In ſome reſpect, the whole Scripture may be ſaid to be ſealed. And firſt,</p>
                  <p>Some Scripture is not ſealed in ſome reſpects, and, in other, ſealed: For, the Hiſtorical part of Scripture (as Hiſtorical) is not ſealed; But much of that that is Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, is alſo Prophetical; And ſo it is or may be ſealed: For example; The Hiſtory of the Creation (as it is Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical) is not ſealed: But that Hiſtory is alſo a Prophecy, and holds forth the loſt and ſupreme end of the Creation, or the Antitype thereof, which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>a new Heaven, and a new Earth,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.13. A Man that is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58931:16"/>not unlearn'd, may reade that God, <hi>in the Beginning, created Heaven and Earth,</hi> and the things therein; The Hiſtory of them (as it is Hiſtorical) is not ſealed; But, that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory (as alſo Prophetical) points forth <hi>that promiſed new Heaven and new Earth,</hi> and ſo it is or hath been ſealed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 66.72. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1, 5.</p>
                  <p>So the Hiſtory of the fall of the firſt Old World (as it is an Hiſtory) is not ſealed; But that Hiſtory is alſo a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and that World prefigured the fall of this preſent Old World: The Hiſtory holds forth the Cauſes of the fall of the firſt World; and (as that Hiſtory is alſo a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy) ſo it foretells the ſame Sins in effect, ſhould be the Cauſes of the fall of this ſecond Old World: The Cauſes of the fall of the firſt were theſe in the Hiſtory; The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thoughts of his Heart was only evil continually; All Fleſh had corrupted his way, and the Earth was filled with violence, ſo that God repented that he had made Man, and it grieved him at the Heart: <hi>Mutato nomine tantum;</hi> Change but that Hiſtory (as Chriſt himſelf doth) into a Prophecy, and the ſame Sins are the Cauſes (but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant and dreadful in the Antitype) of the fall of this preſent evil Old World. As the days of <hi>Noah</hi> were, ſo likewiſe ſhall the coming of the Son of Man be, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.37. Out Saviour adds, that they knew nothing till the Flood came, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. Inadvertency was the Univerſal Flood-gate of all wickedneſs to that Old World, and is to this, That minded nothing, and therefore knew nothing; and this as much. The Hiſtory of the firſt, we ſee, is not ſealed; But, as it is a Prophecy of this ſecond, it ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſealed; inſomuch that Sects, Saints, and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors rather ſay, <hi>We are Rich, and increaſed with Goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> than believe that the Sins of the Old

                  <p>We find the ſame Prophecy, further cleared in another Hiſtory, <hi>Exod.</hi> Chap. 14.

                  <p>The Hiſtory of the ſeven years Famine in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in all Nations (denoted by <hi>ſeven lean Beaſts</hi>) is ſufficiently legible; but thoſe ſeven Beaſts held forth prophetically the ſeven Heads of the ſecular Beaſt-Papal, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. And thoſe ſeven Years of Famine prefigured the ſuperlative ſcarcity of Faith and Good Manners in all Nations for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58931:17"/>above 1260 Years, whiles thoſe ſeven Heads have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence: For, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream <hi>was doubled, to ſhew the certainty of it,</hi> ſo ſeven Years Prophetical (counting thirty Days to each Month) are 1260 Days doubled: And <hi>forty two Months</hi> Prophetick (the time of that Beaſts duration) are 1260 Years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.2, 3. which time we find doubled in that Prophetick Hiſtory, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 41.) to ſhew the certainty of it: So long it ſeems (for 1260 Years) ſhould an exceſſive Famine of Equity in the actions of Men and Saints, ſuperabound in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and confident Ignorance, Avarice, and evil Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, overſpread the World: The Hiſtory is not ſealed, but (as that Hiſtory is alſo a Prophecy) it is and hath been dangerouſly ſealed.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s being in the capacity of a Beaſt <hi>till ſeven times pas'd over him,</hi> is not ſealed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.

But he fell through Pride, and <hi>became as a Beaſt of the Field, and a Beaſts heart was given unto him, till ſeven times paſt over him,</hi> then (for then and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Book began to be opened in a Figure) <hi>he lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, and his Underſtanding return'd;</hi> then he <hi>bleſſed, praiſed, and honoured the moſt High.</hi> There is nothing ſealed or hard to be read in the Hiſtory, but this Hiſtory holds forth Prophetically, and <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> prefigured, the Powers Secular of the Primitive
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58931:18"/>Church chiefly from about 292 to 407, when ſhe and they fell away from Faith and Manners, and fled into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for 1260 Years; ſhe and they had their Habitation, ſo long with Beaſts, and they ruled her with a Feral mind till ſeven times (the time aforeſaid) paſt over them. For the ſeven lean Beaſts in <hi>Egypt,</hi> prefigured the ſeven Heads of the Secular Beaſt Papal, whoſe laſt ſix Heads ſucceeded each more hungry, leaner, and worſe than its Predeceſſor, and the ſeven times of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> being in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a Beaſt adumbrate the ſame things with the ſame time of the duration of them; to wit, 1260 Years. For that time is ſhadowed forth by ſeven times, or ſeven years, in which the Prophetick time is repeated or doubled, to ſhew the certainty of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.16, 23. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32.</p>
                  <p>The ſame time is, ſometimes, held forth by ſeven half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, or half-years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſeven-half-days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.9, 11. for thoſe three days and an half (being days Annual) are the ſame time, with a time, times and an half aforeſaid.

                  <p>The ſame time is ſometimes held forth by 1260 Days expreſly, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.6. Sometimes by ſeven Months, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.1. Sometimes by ſeven Days. Sometimes by ſeven Trumpets ſounded by ſeven Prieſts for ſeven days together, and ſometimes by ſeven Trumpets ſo ſounded in one day, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15. I might men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, but theſe are ſufficient; all which prefigured theſe 1260 Years, which were the principal time of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58931:18"/>Secular Beaſt Papal, being in the deplored ſtate of a Beaſt. But after that time, that Beaſt ſhall begin to ceaſe to be a Beaſt, and a Mans heart ſhall be again given unto him with greater Majeſty and Glory than ever he had before: For, at the end of that time, he (as his Type did) ſhall begin to lift up his Eyes to Heaven, and his Underſtanding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; his Beaſtial Nature ſhall paſs away, and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his Secular Power ſhall be reſtored with far greater brightneſs to all after Ages, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.34, 36. Then may Men and Magiſtrates be rightly ſaid to lift up their Eyes to Heaven, and to have their Underſtanding reſtored, when they begin to bend their Minds effectually to the practice of Right in a fourfold conformity. But they that, in Prayer, lift up their Eyes to Heaven, without due regard to do Right, pray not to God, but take his Name in vain.</p>
                  <p>His Counſellors and Lords ſought unto that Prophetick reſtored King; but what right Counſel can come from his Antitype, whiles he retains the habit of a Beaſt? No Man needs to be curious in as king the Queſtion, what whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws that Apoſtate King, ſo diſtracted, put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? What diſcreet Counſels, grave Precepts and good Examples he gave unto his People, whiles the wild Aſſes were his Senators, and brute Beaſts his Counſellors and Companions, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.21. He was free enough all that time, from all ſuch Attainments: Much more muſt his Antitype (the Secular ſucceſſive Heptarch of the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt) be far from giving or receiving any right Counſel, and from all practice of Square Right: For, a Band of Iron and Braſs bound the ſtump of the Root of the Tree that ſhadowed this forth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 23. And was not a Band of Iron of ſufficient ſtrength to keep that Root from bearing Fruit, and from growing up? It need not be doubted: But a band of Braſs is added to denote a double
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58931:19"/>incapability in the Tree prefigured to ſend forth Branches, that it may bring forth good Fruit; and, ſo long as it ſends forth evil Fruit, It remains as dead, or hewen down: But Sects, Saints, and Profeſſors, that exiſt in the Root of this Antitype Tree, will by no means, believe that its Root, and they themſelves therein, are bound with a band of Iron and Braſs, and thereby lie under a double incapability (of Inadvertency and Ignorance) that they cannot mind to learn to practiſe Right in a four-fold Conformity, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know what that means. Its a Miſery that never can be too much lamented, that the practice of Sects and Profeſſors is, and that of Saints ſeems to be, a never ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathering of miſtaken wild Gourds for good Potherbs, and dead Works for good Fruits: For that Right, and thoſe Works which they practice, and earneſtly preſs upon others as true Obedience to God and Right to Men, are miſtaken wild Grapes of Deceit, incongruous to God's Command and Goſpel-Rule, or are but half performances which God abhors. For this cauſe, ſtrong Confidence in falſe Opinions and evil Manners, is almoſt all the Fruit they bring forth; and that the rather, becauſe they mind not to ſeek to open the Seals of this Book, that they might come to the Word and to the Teſtimony, to try their Works; but they (like this wild <hi>Caldean</hi> Monarch) mind nothing, or next to nothing of thoſe things that are of higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. But this Book, by degrees, ſhall be opened (though little appears from any Saints or Sects, that tends thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) and, by the ſame degrees, ſhall thoſe bands of Iron and Braſs be looſed: Then Saints, Sects, and the Nations of this World ſhall, in deed, lift up their Eyes to Heaven, and ſober Underſtanding ſhall fill the Earth; and then ſhall this Antitype Tree grow up in ſhort time, to a far
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58931:19"/>greater Height, Procerity, Glory and Fertility, than ever it had before.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Hiſtory of all the Plagues upon <hi>Egypt</hi> is eaſie and unſealed; But we find almoſt every one of thoſe Plagues holding forth (as an actual Prophecy) the ſame Plagues in Spiritual ſenſes, under the ſeven Trumpets and ſeven Vials, <hi>Revel. Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.2. to the end.</p>
                  <p>We read of a Redemption in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of a Plague (of the Redemption of the Church in a Prophetick Adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, and of the Plague of the death of the Firſt-born) and both at the ſame time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.12, 13, 29, 30, 51. The Hiſtory is not hard to read; but that Hiſtory holds forth a double Prophecy, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in a Figure, was an actual Prophecy of its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nultimate, and ultimate, or laſt Antitypes. And firſt,</p>
                  <p>It was an actual Prophecy of its Penultimate Antitype, or laſt Redemption but one; and ſo it ſhadowed forth that Redemption which Chriſt wrought by his Blood and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6, 9. But the Church and Saints fell away from Faith and Manners, and fled into the Wilderneſs for 1260 Years, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, 14. Then Chriſt's Redemption ſeemed to ſignifie little, or to be invalid at that time, eſpecially towards the latter end of it; For, Saints, Sects, and Profeſſors ſo live as if Chriſt never died, and ſuch is their Obedience to God and Right to Men, as if they never had been Redeemed. Therefore, we find mention made of another Redemption after that (the laſt Antitype or Subſtance of that in <hi>Egypt</hi>) <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3, 4. which ſhall be of the Church and Saints Redeemed from the Earth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. And from among Men, to be the Firſt-fruits unto God and to the Lamb, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. That is, The virtue and power of Chriſt's Redemption (ſeeming
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58931:20"/>to lie under reſtraint and in difuſe all the foreſaid time of the Witneſſes Sackcloth-Prophecy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.3.) ſhall be then put forth; then Life ſhall be found in Chriſt's Death, and Power, and Efficacy in his Redemption: For this laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is, or rather ſhall be (in order to God's Glory) the ſupreme end of that Redemption, which Chriſt wrought upon Earth, the chief end of his Birth, Death, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and of the Scripture being given by Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And thoſe 144000 Redeemed, ſhall be the Firſt-fruits of that <hi>Myſtery of God finiſhed, as he hath declared to his Servants the Prophets,</hi> Chap. 10.7. And, in reſpect, principally, to theſe ſupreme ends the whole Scripture may be ſaid to be ſealed, becauſe the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Redeemed from the Earth:</hi> That is, the Church and Saints ſhall be redeemed from dead Works, from Sloth, Avarice, Inadvertency, Ignorance, and evil Manners. For, They cannot be truly ſaid to be viſibly Redeemed, till the virtue of Chriſt's Redemption be viſibly applied to them, and operate in them to the Manifeſtation of it: But, <hi>vae Soli,</hi> wo unto the impenitent World, when the Church and Saints ſhall be Redeemed from the Earth, and from among Men; for then its fall (like that of the Churches Adverſaries in <hi>Egypt</hi>) ſhall come faſt on, as we ſee in this 14th Chapter, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8, 10, 11, 14. to the end of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.18, to the end. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.1. This (though I might give almoſt innumerable other Inſtances) may ſerve to ſhew, that the Hiſtorical part of Scripture is not ſealed, but the Prophetical part therein is much ſealed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:58931:20"/>SEcondly, Some Scriptures are more, and ſome leſs ſealed: Moſt of the Scripture is either Moral or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, and both ſeem to be ſealed in reſpect to their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ends: But which of the two (the Moral or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical part of it) is moſt ſealed?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. If we leave it to Formaliſts (and Saints ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom recede in this much from their Opinions) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, we may (moſt probably) have an account by them, thus given; <hi>The Prophetical Scriptures were (no doubt) written within the Book, and moſt ſealed, becauſe leaſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (if at all uſeful) to be read or underſtood.</hi> Thus they commonly blaſpheme thoſe fundamental Scriptures, in which the Promiſes, that are the grounds of Faith, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly found; and Faith is the root of Hope and Charity. <hi>But</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Moral part that directs to good Manners, might be writ on the backſide of the Book, and be moſt eaſie to be read and underſtood, becauſe its moſt uſeful and neceſſary to Salvation:</hi> This is the account, in effect, they give. But here we muſt enquire, whether this determination of Formaliſts be true or falſe, and which of the two (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick or Moral part) is moſt ſealed and hardeſt to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. If we well conſider both, we may find the Prophetick Scriptures, almoſt generally, leſs ſealed, and more eaſie to be underſtood than the Moral Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are, which Formaliſts and Hypocrites cry up as moſt neceſſary to Salvation, plain and eaſie: Therefore, they begin (but in vain) with them (excluding the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical) to open the Seals of this Book, and to underſtand the Scriptures, which is dreadfully prepoſterous to that end; for, <hi>Noah</hi> was a Prophet and a Preacher.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58931:21"/>A Prophet, to ſhew to the World the penalties of her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence.</p>

                  <p>A Prophet, to forwarn the World.</p>
                  <p>A Preacher of Righteouſneſs, to fore-arm that World. We ſcarce need to enquire which of thoſe two parts (the Prophetical part, or the Moral part) of his ſacred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was moſt eaſie to be learnt, or which of the two was moſt neceſſary to be firſt taught and underſtood: For, <hi>Noah</hi> muſt needs ſhew to the World the dreadful peril of her perſevering Impenitent; And this Prophetical part was ſo eaſie to be learnt, that (had <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf ſaid nothing) thoſe mighty preparations to build the Ark, and the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it, had been as the loud ſound of many Trumpets, to proclaim to the whole World the Prophetical part of his Miniſtry. But, they would not believe it, and could not therefore learn Righteouſneſs by the Moral part of his Miniſtry, becauſe Obedience is the fruit of Faith, and they believed not. We find therefore, not one Man in all the World (beſides thoſe of his own Family) that repented or learnt Righteouſneſs: Both therefore (both the Prophetical and Moral part of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Miniſtry) were ſealed; but the Moral part of it was moſt ſealed, becauſe it could not be unſealed, but by the Prophetical part, which they believed not. Therefore, becauſe they hated to hear his Prophetical Miniſtry (though ſome might be, like <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> ſomewhat better diſpoſed to little purpoſe) it was altogether impoſſible (though <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf was a Preacher of it for 120 years) for them to learn Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for, the duty of doing Right was more difficult in it ſelf, but impoſſible to be done, when they had forſaken the foundation of it (his Prophetical Miniſtry) that held forth the Promiſes and Threatnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58931:21"/>The Promiſes; That, if they did repent, they ſhould not be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>The Threatnings; That, if they did not repent, they ſhould univerſally periſh: This Miniſtry therefore was the means to work Faith, which is the foundation of all Moral Obedience, that makes it Genuine and Evangelical; But Faith, Hope, and Charity (the only three Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and Fruit-bearing Graces) are wrought (as the means under God) by the Prophetical Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Moral Scriptures (or thoſe which Formaliſts falſly call, moſt Profitable and Plain) have little or no ſhare: For a Man may read the Moral Scriptures, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, that are not alſo Prophetical, all the days of his Life, and never learn what Faith, Hope, and Charity mean. They therefore, that would open the Seals of this Book, or glorifie God, and profit Men by their good Converſations, muſt begin that Work (not excluding the Moral and Hiſtorical) in the Prophetical Scriptures, which are (for that end) uſually leſs Sealed, and more eaſie to be underſtood, than the Moral Scriptures are, and therein Men and Saints ſeem to be univerſally miſtaken. I ſhall only add, briefly, this example: All the chief Prieſts and Scribes could readily tell <hi>Herod</hi> (when he enquired of them) that Chriſt ſhould be born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is written by the Prophet, <hi>And thou</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>in the Land of</hi> Judea, <hi>art not the leaſt among the Princes of</hi> Judah; <hi>for out of thee ſhall come a Governour, that ſhall rule my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Iſrael, Mat. 2.5, 6. Mich. 5.2. This was a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which they all underſtood: I might give many Inſtances of the like eaſineſs in other Prophecies: But our Saviour ſaid unto them, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice; go learn what that meaneth,</hi> Mat. 9.13. <hi>Now ſpeakeſt thou</hi> (might the Phariſees ſay) <hi>plainly, and ſpeakeſt no P<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58931:22"/>nor are theſe words any unprofitable and unintelligible Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but a plain and eaſie Moral Precept: We all underſtand what Mercy means, and are not now to learn this Leſſon:</hi> But it was in them a ſignal and univerſal Miſtake; For that Leſſon was ſo ſealed, that none of them could right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand it, or learn what it meant; and it remains ſtill ſo firmly ſealed, that Saints themſelves cannot yet open the Seals of it, nor read it: For, by Mercy, in that Text, is meant all Righteouſneſs to all Men (to a Man's ſelf, and to all Church-Societies, Sects, and Nations) but it principally intends (not that ſleepy, ſpurious or at beſt weak and imperfect practice of preſent, or former times, but) that true future quadriform Righteouſneſs of Goſpel-Promiſe, which ſhall be the ſupreme end of Chriſt's Death, in order to God's Glory, and the good of Men.</p>
                  <p>There was no need that any Man ſhould ſay to the Scribes and chief Prieſts, <hi>Go,</hi> learn what that Prophecy in <hi>Micha</hi> meaneth, for they all knew what it meant, and could readily unfold it: But there is great need that God and Men ſay to all Saints and Profeſſors, <hi>Go,</hi> learn what the Moral Scriptures mean, and what their chief uſe and ſupreme end is: For they have a depth in them which few Men can fathom, and are much more ſealed than uſually the Prophetical Scriptures are; he therefore that would reduced them into right action, muſt learn to perform what they hold forth in a fourfold Conformity grounded upon true Faith, and ſo their Fruits become Evangelical obedience to God, and right to Men: But the practice of Right in a fourfold Conformity, is, or at leaſt hath been (notwithſtanding the raſh repugnances of perverſe gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers) as much ſealed, even to Saints, as was <hi>Sampſon's</hi> Riddle For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58931:22"/>Thirdly, The whole Scripture may be ſaid to be ſealed, Firſt, in reſpect to inadvertency almoſt univerſal in Men and Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In reſpect to the adequate and ſupreme end of it. And firſt,</p>
                  <p>Inadvertency (the moſt common Mark of the Beaſt) is the almoſt univerſal means that this Book remains ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher (but without profit to them) to the old World; and we read not of one Man in all the Univerſe (ſome few of his own Family only excepted) that repented; What was the reaſon of it? The Book was ſealed in a Figure; not that there was any evident obſignation upon, or great obſcurity in, the ſacred Oracles which God gave (by the Mouth of <hi>Noah</hi>) to the whole World, but their Minds were univerſally ſealed through Sloth: <hi>They knew nothing,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.39. And no marvel, becauſe they minded nothing of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Admonitions, nor duly regarded what he ſaid, or did.</p>
                  <p>The ſame inadvertency in her Daughter, ſeals this Book by little leſs than an univerſal unmindfulneſs; For the Book, of late, is perhaps open, in a great meaſure, to ſome (but very few) and the Prophecies therein are performed to the beginning of the ſeventh Trumpet and ſeventh Vial; and yet it remains ſtill almoſt univerſally ſealed with ſeven Seals (very few excepted) to the whole World: For, <hi>De non apparentibus, &amp; non exiſtentibus, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ratio;</hi> Things that appear not, and things that are not, are of like capacity: But when things moſt neceſſary and of higheſt concern, are ſealed through ſloth or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfulneſs, it manifeſts the moſt unexpreſſible Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ignorance that Man can be capable of; nor does it ſignifie any thing to the (ſo beſotted) World, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58931:23"/>the Book is open to ſome few, but ſealed with ſeven Seals to all the reſt, as the old World (to whom the Book, by a general unmindfulneſs, was ſealed in a Figure) was no better at all that it was open, only to a very few; for that was the cauſe of their greater Condemnation: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this way of the Book being ſealed (whereby Sloth is added to brutiſh ignorance, and the cauſe of it) is the moſt deſperate and dreadful of all Ways, whereby it is, or can be ſealed: For, <hi>This is Condemnation</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkneſs.</hi> So it may be now ſaid (which is the ſame) This is the Condemnation of this World, and will be the chief Cauſe of its ſpeedy paſſing away, that the Book of holy Writ (having been ſealed, for many Ages, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Seals) begins to be opened, and Men, almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, love to mind nothing. But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The whole Scripture is, or hath been, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſealed in reſpect to its ſupreme end; And what is that?</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, <hi>The whole Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable to Teach, to Convince, to Correct, and to inſtruct in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, being made perfect unto all good Works;</hi> 2. Tim. 3.16, 17. Good Works of Men, and Saints made perfect, are the ſupreme ends of the whole Scripture (in order to God's Glory) as theſe Texts expreſly teſtifie: But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the whole Scripture to thoſe ends aforeſaid, muſt needs be ſmall whilſt the Book is ſealed, and it ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſerve to make Schiſms, to create Diviſions, to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Sects, to frame Factions, and to form falſe Opinions, Miſtakes, and evil Manners; for Saints, Sects, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, do all this, and think they have good ground for it from the Scriptures, becauſe they are ſealed, and they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58931:23"/>ſee no better, but when their Seals ſhall be opened, all thoſe dreadful evils ſhall ſoon vaniſh as Darkneſs, when the Light appears.</p>
                  <p>Good works of Men made perfect are the ſupreme ends, for which the whole Scripture was given by Inſpiration of God, in order to his Glory and the good of Men. The ſame account is given by our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, <hi>So let your Light ſhine before Men, that they</hi> (ſeeing your good Works) <hi>may Glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Mat. 5.16. And is this all (may Formaliſts and Hypocrites ſay? and Saints are apt to ſay almoſt as much) then we know already the ſupreme end for which the whole Scripture was given by Inſpiration of God; we know that we muſt make our good Works ſhine before Men, that they may glorifie God. And how have their good Works (even of Saints) ſhone before Men, all the time of the Witneſſes Sackcloth-Prophecy for 1260 Years? How do they ſhine at preſent? And what Glory have they brought to God, or Temporal Good to Men? I anſwer, They have ſhone, and do ſhine, <hi>as the Sun when it was black is Sackcloth of Hair,</hi> Rev. 6.12. There was ſincerity in the good Works of Saints all that time, and ſtill is, but Men could ſcarce ſee them or it, they were ſo dark, and did not ſhine to bring any great Glory to God, or Temporal good to Men, becauſe they were and are ſo diſguiſed (like the Prophet) in contrary Habits, and ſo corrupt and mixt with evil Manners: But when this Book ſhall be opened, they ſhall ſhine, and Men ſhall ſee them, and glorifie God. Then the whole Scripture ſhall be, much more effectually, profitable to teach, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to correct, and to inſtruct in Righteouſneſs, and Men and Saints be made more perfect unto all good Works; and that's the ſupreme end of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58931:24"/>in order to God's Glory. And what ſhall the good Works of Saints made perfect be? I anſwer, They ſhall be the practice of Right in a four-fold Conformity ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon true Faith. What that Practice is, or rather ſhall be, I have ſhewn at large in my former Treatiſe, and it will further appear in this. And have not ſome Saints, Sects or Profeſſors, attained to this ſupreme end of the whole Scripture, or ſquare practice of Right, in the time when this Book was univerſally ſealed with ſeven Seals?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. The Book was ſealed in the Primitive Times, and ſealed, or rather doubly ſealed, in the time of the Papal Apoſtacy, whoſe principal time of continuance was to be 1260 Years, and that's the time of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Sackcloth-Prophecy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.6.14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.5. Wherefore, as the Prophets had leave of <hi>Eliſha</hi> to ſeek for the Body of <hi>Elijah,</hi> give me leave to ſearch firſt thoſe 1260 Years (the principal time of the Papal Apoſtacy) to ſee if, poſſibly, any foot-ſteps of this practice of ſquare Right (the ſupreme end in order to God's Glory, of the whole Scripture) may be found in all that time, or under that Diſpenſation; and, if we find none there, we ſhall ſearch for it in the Primitive Times, and then proceed to ſhew further what it is, or what thoſe good Works (which are the ſupreme end of the whole Scripture, and in reſpect to which principally it is ſealed) are, or rather ſhall be. And firſt,</p>
                  <p>We find the ſtate of the Papacy under the firſt ſix Trumpets, and firſt ſix Vials, ſtanding; and, under the ſeventh Trumpet, and ſeventh Vial, falling: We muſt therefore ſee if we can find this ſupreme end of the whole Scripture held forth under the firſt ſix Trumpets, and firſt ſix Vials, and under the Witneſſes Sackcloth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; for they all run parallel in 1260 Years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:58931:24"/>Under the firſt, ſecond, and third Trumpet and Vial, we find no mention at all of it; nor under the fourth Trumpet and fourth Vial, but that Men repented not to give glory to God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.9. Not but that ſome true Repentance was wrought in Saints all that time, but it was ſo ſmall, weak, undiſcernable, and inſignificant, that God was not much, if at all, glorified thereby: Therefore, to ſuch Repentance (though ſome truth be in the performers of it) God gives not the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but ſaith expreſly, <hi>They repented not,</hi> &amp;c. And who were they that repented not to give Glory to God? They to whom the Witneſſes were ſent to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for 1260 Years, repented not, in all that time to give Glory to God. who were they to whom the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were ſent? They were the Saints and Church fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from Faith and Manners, <note n="*" place="margin">Aſſemb. Annot.</note> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3. that is, to thoſe, firſt and chiefly: For the Prophet was ſent directly to Apoſtate <hi>Iſrael,</hi> fallen from Faith and Manners, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.1. That Prophet, ſent to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the other who dwelt there, prefigured the two Sackcloth-Witneſſes ſent to the Goſpel-Church and Saints (fallen as aforeſaid) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie 1260 Years, but it was without much ſucceſs, <hi>For they repented not all that time, to give Glory to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God ſent the Prophet (not to the dead Bones of <hi>Gog,</hi> but) to the dead and dry Bones <hi>in the open Valley,</hi> which repreſented the ſtate of the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and prefigured the whole Houſe of Goſpel-<hi>Iſrael,</hi> who (for 1260 Years, repented not to give Glory to God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.11.) For, it were a Maſter-piece of incredible abſurdity, to ſay, That dead and dry Bones (without Fleſh, or Sinews, or Skin, to cover them) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented vigorouſly, and glorified God by their good Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:58931:25"/>
                     <hi>Go not</hi> (ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour) <hi>into the way of the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>and into the Cities of the</hi> Samaritans <hi>enter ye not; But go rather to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, Mat. 10.5, 6, 7. He ſent his twelve Apoſtles (not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but) to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And, <hi>I am not ſent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.24. So the Goſpel-Witneſſes were ſent of God (principally and in the firſt place) to the loſt Sheep of Goſpel-<hi>Iſrael</hi> (the Goſpel-Church and her Saints) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in Sackcloth for 1260 Years: For, She and they (fallen from Faith and Manners, as aforeſaid) were the prefigured loſt Sheep all that time: That is, they were (and are not yet free from thoſe dreadful Perils) in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſtate (to ſee to) of loſt Sheep, ſubject to all ſorts of Calamities, Conſpiracies, and contrivances to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their Temporal and Spiritual well-beings, and (which is worſe) they bring themſelves into ſuch great Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by their rebellious diſobedience, in not repenting to give <hi>glory to God,</hi> not greatly minding to learn to know what that meaneth. For, all other ſick, ſleepy, barren, trivial (but ſomewhat true) Repentance (whereby they are ſcarcely, and with great difficulty, hazard, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, ſaved) brings no Glory to God, but (by provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Wrath) the greateſt Diſtreſſes and Plagues upon themſelves, and upon all Men, that Men can be well ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, as it's undeniably evident from the Plagues of the Wrath of God, poured forth under the firſt ſix Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and the firſt ſix Vials, and under the Witneſſes Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth-Prophecy for 1260 Years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.1, 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.2. And likewiſe from the Figures of them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.10, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18. Thus it's evidently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the Goſpel-Witneſſes were ſent (chiefly, and in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58931:25"/>the firſt place) to the Goſpel Revolted-Church and Saints, to Prophecy 1260 Years; and it was the ſame Church and Saints that repented not, all that time, to give glory to God: Howbeit, the ſame Witneſſes ſhall Propheſie (but not in Sackcloth) to the ſame Church and Saints in ſucceeding times, and thereby bring them to become <hi>the firſt Fruits redeemed from the Earth,</hi> Rev. 14.3, 4. And then the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (by means of their, but far more powerful, Miniſtry) ſhall come in (as a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harveſt) following the Firſt-fruits aforeſaid, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.11, 15.</p>
                  <p>Under the fifth Trumpet, we find nothing concerning this ſquare practice of Right, which ſhall be the ſupreme end of the whole Scripture, but under the fift Vial, we read that <hi>they repented not;</hi> which is directly contrary to the practice of Right in a four-fold conformity.</p>
                  <p>Under the ſixth Vial, nothing is ſaid of it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, it is ſaid, at the end of the ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, <hi>That the Men that were not killed, yet repented not of the works of their Hands,</hi> &amp;c. Nor of their Murther, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, Fornication, and Theft, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20, 21. And here ends the 1260 Years of the Witneſſes Sackcloth-Prophecy, with the end of the firſt ſix Trumpets, and firſt ſix Vials, in all which time there is not the leaſt mention of the ſupreme end of the Scripture appearing, or of this quadrate Right in Practice being known, or held forth; ſo long therefore the whole Scripture was ſealed in reſpect to its ſupreme end: <hi>But in the days of the Voice of the ſeventh Angel, when he ſhall begin to ſound, the Myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed,</hi> Chap. 10.7.

We ſhall now turn back to ſearch the Seals in the Primitive Times, to ſee if we can find the chief end of the Scriptures manifeſted under them, from the Year 70, to 407. And firſt,</p>
                  <p>We find no Foot-ſteps of it under the firſt five Seals; but ſomething like it under the ſixth Seal ſeems to appear, where we find the Primitive Church's triumphant and thankful acknowledgment, in theſe words; <hi>Now is come Salvation and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Chirſt,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>This 144000, in the 14th Chapter, ſhall have the Name of God written in their Foreheads, a Mark more manifeſt, which both the Learned and Unlearned, may ſee and reade, <hi>Ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>That 144000 was a Figure of the Myſtery of God fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: This 144000 ſhall be the Antitype Myſtery of God finiſhed, and, by that, prefigured, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.7.</p>

This Myſtery of God ſhall get the Victory over the Secular Beaſt Papal with ten Crowns, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.2.</p>
                  <p>That firſt 144000 was finiſhed in a Figure about the Year 323, were ſealed about the Year 400, and about ſeven Years after, <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs for</hi> 1260 <hi>Years,</hi> Chap. 12.6, 14. But this 144000 ſhall have <hi>the Name of God written in their Foreheads above</hi> 1260 <hi>Years</hi> after, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1. For,</p>
                  <p>Literal <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſealed, in each family, by the Blood of a Lamb in a Figure, immediately before their ingreſs into the Wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.9, 22.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58931:27"/>But theſe 144000 in the fourteenth Chapter, ſhall have the Name of God written in their Fore heads, and be the Myſtery of God finiſhed, ſoon after their egreſs or coming out of the Wilderneſs, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.7. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.18. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.1. Therefore that firſt 144000 in <hi>chap.</hi> 7. was a tranſient Adumbration of this, and was in principal power but about ſixteen years; but this Myſtery of God (by thoſe prefigured) ſhall remain for evermore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.22.

Nor do we find un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeven Seals in the Primitive Times, nor under the firſt ſix Trumpets, and firſt ſix Vials, in the time of the Papacy, that ſquare Righteouſneſs, which ſhall render and denominate theſe future 144000 to be, that <hi>Myſtery of God finiſhed, and the Firſt-fruits redeemed from the Earth,</hi> chap. 14.3, 4. We ſhall therefore ſearch the Apoſtles Times, to ſee if we can find there the principal end of the Scripture, and that Righteouſneſs aforeſaid, for they might have ſome glimmerings of it, though they did not perhaps attain to the true and clear knowledg of it. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>But we look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, according to his Promiſe, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.13. If <hi>Peter</hi> knew what thoſe new Heavens, and that new Earth were, and what that Righteouſneſs in them was to be, why did he not preach both to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches? why did he look for them and it to come in future, <hi>according to his Promiſe,</hi> if that Promiſe of God was at that time, or had been before performed? Therefore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58931:27"/>this Righteouſneſs of Goſpel-Promiſe was not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but much ſealed, and hid from the Primitive Saints, and Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Chriſt taught his Diſciples, and teacheth us to pray, ſaying, <hi>Thy Kingdom come; thy Will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi> But the Will of God ſo done on Earth, is the Practice of that future quadrate Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Goſpel-Promiſe, which only or principally is according to the Will of God, and well-pleaſing to him; for all other Righteouſneſs cannot but be faulty <hi>before the Throne of God,</hi> Rev. 14.5. Not but that there will be Sins in Saints then, but Sins in ſubjection, or ſlain Sins; as the Ark, and <hi>Dagon</hi> (with his Head and Hands cut off) were in one Temple.</p>

                     <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth,</hi> &amp;c. This is a prophetick Prayer, which hath not been anſwered (that I find) in any Ages, nor ſhall be, until the Seals of this Book be opened: for until then the <hi>Will of God cannot be done in Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> becauſe Man's Direction ſo to do it (though not with like degrees of Perfection) can be found by no other means. Chriſt therefore had not (no doubt) taught his Diſciples and us to pray, ſaying, <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> if it was then actually ſo done on Earth (by any but himſelf only) at that preſent time, or otherwiſe than by a prophetick Adumbration, or Figure. The ſupreme end therefore of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in order to God's Glory, or that Righteouſneſs which ſhall denominate the <hi>Myſtery of God finiſhed,</hi> and be the Means of Mens principal Concerns and Safeties, was much ſealed, or did not clearly appear to the Apoſtles themſelves. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John wept much,</hi> Rev. 5.4. And why did <hi>John</hi> weep much? Becauſe he had much cauſe to weep; the Book was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58931:28"/>ſealed in reſpect to its ſupreme end, and that was cauſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to him of much weeping. Nothing can be more lamentable than the ſealing of that Book, nor more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and full of joy, than that opened. For the ſealing of it opens the Flood-gates of all Evils, Miſeries, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs:</p>
                  <q>Hoc ſolum omnigeni fons &amp; origo mali.</q>
                  <p>It is the cauſe of an Inundation of all Evils to Princes, and to their People. They complain of Plots, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deſigns to ſubvert their Eſtates, Lives, and Religion it ſelf, as if the World were again (and ſo it is indeed) filled with Violence. Therefore they labour hard, (and ſo they do well) to prevent, every Man, his own utter Ruine: But it is (not much unlike the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſtriving againſt the Stream of the involving Waters) to very little purpoſe. <hi>Hydra</hi>'s adverſe Heads ſpring up faſter than they can be cut off. Why then do they not ſeek to open the Seals of this Book, and their Work is done? The Wolf, the Lamb, and the Lion agreed well enough in one Ark, and ſhall agree (this Book being opened) to better purpoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.25. <hi>Saul</hi> among the Prophets, propheſied with them. So Papiſts, Proteſtants, Sects, and Turks, (if that Work be once done) will agree to ſay and do the ſame things; Enmity and Hoſtility ſhall ceaſe; and the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſhall ſtay his hand, as he did when he was ſeen in <hi>Arannah</hi>'s Threſhing-Floor, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17, 25. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly; <hi>The whole Creation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>groaneth, and travaileth in pain; and not only they, but our ſelves alſo, which have the Firſt fruits,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8.22, 23. And what moved even the Apoſtles themſelves, and with them the whole Creation, ſo to groan, and travail in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58931:28"/>pain? It was (ſaith the Text) <hi>for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God,</hi> verſ. 19. And what is that? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It is, or rather ſhall be, the Name of God written in their Fore-heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1. For what more manifeſts a thing than the Forehead? and what ſo much manifeſts the Sons of God, as the Name of God written in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads? And what is that Name? It's that Power of Godlineſs, or that Practice of Right, which ſhall be the ſupreme end of the whole Scripture, in order to God's Glory, and in reſpect to which principally it hath been long ſealed. All that work not, at leaſt, to that end aforeſaid, are like Clocks, that go not, or go wrong. Wherefore, ſeeing that promiſed Righteouſneſs in Practice, which ſhall be the Will of God done on Earth, (though not with equal degrees of perfection) as it is in Heaven, ſhall be (in order to God's Glory) the ſupreme end of the whole Scripture, and the moſt effectual means to Men of their entire Safeties, and higheſt Concerns, we ſhall (with ſome diligence examine what thoſe Works or that Practice of Right aforeſaid (in reſpect to which principally the Book is ſealed) are. And firſt, we muſt diſtinguiſh:</p>
                  <p>Evil Works are either viſibly evil, or, But ſeeming good.</p>
                  <p>Good Works are ſubordinate; or, Supreme. And firſtly</p>
                  <p>Works viſibly evil, are the <hi>Works of the Fleſh,</hi> (Gal. 5.19.) <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Idolatry, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strofe, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murthers, Drunkenneſs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings, and ſuch like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such like are thoſe Multitudes of Oaths, which make the Land mourn; and (the Cauſe of them) Atheiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58931:29"/>Witchcraft is mentioned among theſe Works of the Fleſh; which are manifeſt; but I never read or heard of any Witch, that durſt, or did ſwear, or ſay, <hi>God damn me.</hi> This Age is grown hardy in unheard-of Wickedneſs: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Hatred, Variance, are in the ſame Liſt: Schiſm there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be of the ſame <hi>Radix.</hi> Sloth and Inadvertency are the Root and Foundation of all manifeſt evil Works, and of thoſe that are moſt myſterious. The Doers of thoſe more manifeſt evil Works, are High-way-Hearers, or the High-way ground (Inadvertiſts, Atheiſts) that give no growth to the Seed of Grace. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Works but ſeeming good are much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and difficult to be diſcerned from ſubordinate good Works. They ſoon grow, and ſoon ceaſe from growing. Hearing, Reading, Praying, ineffectual Alms, and pieces, or half Performances of Right, are ſeeming good Works: And, ſubordinate good Works are the ſame; only theſe perſevere, when the other deſiſt. The ſtony and thorny Grounds are lively delineations of the Doers of ſeeming good Works. The Apoſtle ſaid to the fooliſh <hi>Galatians, Ye ran well, who hindred you?</hi> chap. 5.7. So the Doers of ſeeming good Works ſeem to run well, or rather better at firſt, than they that perform ſubordinate good Works; but before they run far, they are hindred; and (having no depth of knowledg,) cannot perſiſt in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forward; or (if their Knowledg be competent) much Buſineſs and worldly Cares choak their good Works, and makes them be but dead Works. Therefore ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate good Works ſeem to fall ſhort, at firſt, of thoſe that are but ſeeming good: they are not ſo ſplendid, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo much, when they are firſt held forth; but they perſevere, when the other periſh.</p>
