            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>, the ſame may I, with better reaſon, ſay of your Honourable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, It ſeemed unto me to looke like a little Common-wealth of Kings. When firſt I underſtood you had deſigned me (the unfitteſt in many reſpects you could have thought upon) unto this ſolemne ſervice: I reſented it truely no otherwiſe than <hi>Jonah</hi> did his meſſage to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> with much trouble and emotion of ſpirit, not to ſay diſcontent: and as forward ſhould I have beene as he (had not a ſtrong band of reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience held me backe) to flye to <hi>Tarſus</hi> or any whither elſe, rather then undertake the Province you had called me to: Not out of any diſaffection to the worke, or the Authority that ſummoned me to it, which I ſhall alwayes honour, and next to that of Gods, eſteeme ſacred; but being ſenſible of nothing more in all this world, then mine owne defects: and knowing well how hard a matter I finde it to ſatisfie my ſelfe, I held it impoſſible for me to bring forth ought that might ſatisfie others (eſpecially ſuch a grave Court of great Stateſmen) either in the Pulpit or the Preſſe. However ſince you are pleaſed out of your ingenuity and candor, not onely to owne this worthleſſe piece, but to over value it ſo far, as to call it forth into the publique light, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſway with me, beſides the obedience I owe to your commands, I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all humility preſent it unto your honourable acceptance, ſuch as it is it glorieth to be yours, and were all the body of this ſimple diſcourſe, like <hi>Solomons Lineae aureae cum punctis argenteis, Cant. 1.11.</hi> wrought with lines of gold and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameled with pearles, I ſhould not hold it too rich a preſent, for ſuch unparalleld Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, which have honoured God ſo much, and are ſo much honoured by him.

ſo glorious a prize as you have to contend for, or ſo many potent adverſaries, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and difficulties, to encounter with: but this may ſerve as a more then ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent encouragement to hearten you on, that you have a good God, a Noble Cauſe, an Honourable Reward, and what could you wiſh more? See what you have done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and let your former, many and precious experiences of divine favour and aſſiſtance, animate you to waite upon God, with an unwearied patience, till he ſhall make all your enemies of the Synagogue of Sathan, to come and worſhip before your feete, and to know that he hath loved you. Conſider how many great and ſtupendious workes God hath already made you inſtruments to bring about. How many mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> have you cut down? how many yoakes of oppreſſion and tyranny have you broken? how many dying Saints have you revived? The Lord hath made darkeneſſe light before you, and crooked things ſtreight, he hath levelled mountaines, and raiſed vallies; what enterprize have you taken in hand, which hath not in the Iſſue proſpered beyond your expectations? You have ſprung a myne under the walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> unſetled the Throu of the Beaſt. Behold how the Antichriſtian faction languiſheth, the Pontificall chaire reeles, the Miters wither, the triple Crowne ſhakes: that which the Lord threatned ſometimes againſt one of the worſt of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> the ſame he ſeemes to doe now againſt the great Monarch of <hi>Babylon, Remove the Diadem, take away the Crown, I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, untill he come whoſe right it is, and I will give it him, Ezek 22.26, 27.</hi> Me thinkes I ſee the proud turrets, and battlements of Rome falling, and Sion riſing up faire as the morning, <hi>cleere as the moone, terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi> Howſoever this is certaine, God hath promiſed, and he will no doubt in due time make it good, which we have in the Prophet. Eſay <hi>24.23. The moone ſhall be confounded, and the Sunne aſhamed, when the Lord of Hoſts ſhall reigne in Mount Sion, and before all his ancients gloriouſly.</hi> I hope the happy time is at hand, which God hath appointed for the full working out of his Glory and our deliverance, and that this dawning of our hopes may break forth into a perfect day of joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, It is and ſhall be the earneſt and conſtant prayer of</p>

            <p>But now this Evangelicall ſtate of the Chriſtian Church, called the Kingdom of heaven, it is either Militant or Triumphant, the State of Grace or the State of Glory, which for kinde and nature are both one, and differ but onely in degrees; for the State of grace what is it elſe but glory begun: the way to the Kingdom is not without ſome firſt fruits of the Kingdom, ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">Non eſt via ad regnum ſine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiis regni.</note> 
               <hi>Bernard.</hi> And the State of glory on the other ſide, what is it elſe but grace fully perfect and conſummate. It is the former of theſe which is here principally meant, to wit, the Militant Eſtate of the Chriſtian Church, in which men are brought to live under the gracious and milde government of Chriſt; their minds being inlightned, guided, and powerfully moved and over-ruled. 1. To repent of all their ſins, and then, 2. To accept of the pardon and remiſſion of them in ſuch ſort as it is offered in the tenor of the New Covenant. 3. To render back as a Tribute of thankfulneſſe a free, cheerfull, univerſall and conſtant obedience to all the revealed Will of God.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be cleered is how this Kingdom may be ſaid to ſuffer violence? And here Interpretors varie, I ſhall give a touch of their ſeverall deſcantings. It may be the very diſcords will help to make the Muſick better and the harmony more pleaſing; the ſum of all or moſt of the tendries I have met with, is reducible to theſe three heads. The violence here ſpoken of may be taken either as it is oppoſed, 1. To Natures, 2. To Juſt and right, or 3. As it is oppoſed to temper and moderation.</p>

            <p>However becauſe I delight not to to recede from the beaten tract, unleſſe it be upon urgent neceſſity, therefore chooſe whether ſence you pleaſe, the difference will not be materiall in reſpect of the obſervations ariſing hence, which before I enter upon, there is yet one thing more to be explained in a word or two, and that is, Why from the dayes of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt this Kingdome of the heavens doth thus violently come in, or if you reliſh the former notion bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Why it ſuffered ſuch violence in his dayes more then in former times.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are 1.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. Its yet more to be lamented, that we are clogged and cumbred with others, who in ſtead of promoting and carrying on, do indeed retard and ſet back the proceedings of the Goſpell and Kingdom of Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

It generally concerns us all of what degree or condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we be, to helpe forward as much as lyeth in us, the powerfull preaching and receiving of the Goſpell, which is the onely meanes by which the Kingdome of heaven comes in and gets poſſeſſion: Indeede we cannot all be Chriſts Scepter bearers that is, an Office peculiar to ſome few that are deſign'd to it by ſpeciall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we cannot all promote the affaires of the Kingdom of

heaven by Preaching, but there is ſomewhat which we may all doe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may prepare and make way for the erecting and ſetting up of Chriſts Throne in our owne hearts and in our families and dependants; we may do much, if we put our ſtrength to it to do our utmoſt. If Chriſt raigne in our own conſciences by the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Word and Spirit, <hi>and the Kingdome of God be within us,</hi>

We ſhall then ſtraine our indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with all violence, to make our houſes <hi>Bethels</hi> little Temples, and Sanctuaries, and courts for Chriſt to keepe reſidence in, there ſhall be roome for no ſwearers, drunkards, ſcorners of Religion or any other children of <hi>Belial,</hi> that turn the broad ſide againſt Chriſt, and will not have him reigne over them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may hold faſt what we have got already, not ſuffering any enemy to take our crown and Kingdom from us; there is a holy art of violence if we could hit on it, by which <hi>the King may be detained and held in our galleries</hi> by the chaines of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and well pleaſing captivity, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.5.

            <p>It may be we cannot prevaile to advance the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a further extent and progreſſe, and to the achieving of new acquiſitions; but we may, if we be zealous and reſolute, make good the ground, which it hath already won, maintaine and defend all the Forts and ſtrong Holds, which it hath already taken in and conquered. We cannot be all Souldiers to fight the Lords battels in the field, but there is an holy war which we all may and muſt wage againſt Chriſts and our enemies, which would if they knew how, plunder him out of his Imperiall Soveraignety, and us out of our Salvation.

There was an honourable deſign on foot ſome few yeeres ſince, for the buying out of Impropriations, and the redeeming of the Churches patrimony; it was a worke of as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent piety and charity as ever any this Age hath produced, and the ſtopping of it by ſome execrable inſtruments, was an act of as pure Sathanicall malice againſt, the glory of Chriſt, and the Soules of men, as ever iſſued out of Hell; and were there no other exception againſt ſome great Incendiaries but this, it were enough to render their perſons hatefull, and their memory infamous to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>

The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall complaint is from every corner of the Land, That the people have been for a long time almoſt quite <hi>without the true God, and without a teaching Prieſt, and without the Law,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15 3. No Miniſtery, no Worſhip, no Ordinances, or that which is little better then none; and the generall requeſt and deſire is like to that motion of the man of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> That you would ſend ſome over to helpe them. If therefore the glory of

Jeſus Chriſt and the Salvation of his people, bought with his own blood, be deare and precious unto you, as we know they are. If ever you deſire to have the honour of being the chiefeſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to plant a new heaven and a new earth in this Land, Helpe every Congregation to faithfull Paſtors, and pure Ordinances; you are as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> the two Olive-branches, or the two anointed ones, which ſtand before the Lord of the whole earth; Oh let the golden Oyle ſtill ſtream out in abundance from you to feede <hi>the Lamps of the golden Candleſtick, Zach.</hi> 4.12, 14.<note place="margin">Hi ſunt duo ſilli magnatum qui ſtant coram Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino totius ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae.

            <p>There is indeed a violence, nothing praiſe-worthy, held out in Scripture, which is either, 1. In generall, when men put forth themſelves to the uttermoſt, and draw out their ſtrength in any ſinfull way, be it what it will, As the Prieſts and people when <hi>Ahab</hi>-like they ſold themſelves over to Idols, and the full bent and ſway of their ſpirits was unto ſin, here was a violence, ſuch as it was,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Their courſe was evill and their force not right.</hi> Or 2. There is a violence taken in a more ſpeciall and reſtrained fence, which is all one with oppreſſion and rapine pillaging, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, plundering, and other ſuch practiſes which <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> that wicked Prince is branded for <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.17. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt reads a Lecture to the Souldiers that came to his Baptiſme,<note place="margin">Luk 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>to beware of this violence,</hi> it being ſuch a character as leaſt of all ſuits with thoſe that pretend towards the Kingdome of heaven, S. <hi>Paul</hi> is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that <hi>none ſuch ſhall ever come there,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.</p>
            <p>It is a violence quite of another nature and ſtraine, which is here hinted unto and commended. An honeſt and juſt violence, an holy Rapine, a lawfull and heavenly Robbery, a divine Sacriledge, which to give you in a word a rude and curſory deſcription of it, is nothing elſe, But a vehement bent of deſires, affections, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, intenſively aſpiring, and reaching after the Kingdome of God, and greedily laying hold of all helpes, meanes, and advantages which may conduce and tend thereunto.</p>
            <p>We have ſundry inſtances in Scripture of ſuch a violence as this. The woman of <hi>Canaan, Mark</hi> 7.27. ſhe was ſo obſtinate in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111758:20"/>
on her deſign, that ſhe could not be beaten off, no not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, the more Diſcouragements ſhe had, ſo much the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and violent ſhe grew, taking a ſtrong hold-faſt of Chriſt, and cleaving to him like a bur, and never giving him over till ſhe had got what ſhe came for. So the blind man which ſate begging by the high-way-ſide, you may enter him into ſame Liſt, <hi>When he heard that Jeſus paſſed by, he cryed after him with a loud voyce,</hi> and when the Diſciples diſcouraged him, he cryed yet <hi>out the more a great deale,</hi> and clamored after him, <hi>Jeſus thou ſon of David have mercy on me, Luke</hi> 18.35. And were not thoſe Auditors of Chriſt exceeding violent who thronged after him in ſuch crowdes <hi>that they trode upon one another, Luke</hi> 12.1. and thoſe alſo no leſſe, who forced their acceſſe unto Chriſt by digging through <hi>ſtone walls, and uncovering the roofe of the houſe where he was? Mark.</hi> 2.4. What ſhould I neede to ſtand upon particular Inſtances, the Scripture is full of them every where. The Souldiers, Publicans, and Harlots,<note place="margin">Surgunt Indocti &amp; caelum rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt &amp; nos cum doctrinis noſtris ſinc corde ecce ubi volutamur in carne ac ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> in thoſe dayes, they roſe up in great numbers and took the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven by force; whiles the Phariſees and Scribes and thoſe profound Schollers were left behind. Thoſe that ſeemed firſt were the laſt, and they that were laſt proved firſt. This violent Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtraine of Spirit, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew wherein it conſiſts, how it workes and wherefore it is ſo requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore this violence conſiſts in earneſt and vehement deſires. 2. In ſtedfaſt purpoſes and Reſolutions. 3. In ſtirring and impetuous indeavours.

               <hi>and ſtir up our ſtrength to lay hold of him, Eſay</hi> 64.7. He lookes for what we can, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. And if we offer him leſſe than all, we might as well offer nothing. When our intentions in his Worſhip, are not ſcrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to this height, its a ſign that our hearts are divided and cloven, and therefore hypocriticall: when the Jewes were careleſſe and perfunctory in their devotions, and put God off with any ſacrifices which came next to hand, he accounted this as a diſhonour to him, and as a derogation to his Majeſty and greatneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thundred out a dreadfull curſe againſt them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>If ye offer the blinde and the lame for ſacrifice, is it not evill; offer it now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy governour, will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, verſ.</hi> 8. This carriage of theirs bewrayed plainely how little reſpect their hearts bare him.

            <p n="2">2 And as this violence is juſt and neceſſary in reſpect of God, who requires and calls for it at our hands, ſo is it alſo in reſpect of the prize it ſelfe, which is here contended and ſtriven for, it being the Kingdome of heaven, and therefore well worthy of all the violence which we can uſe for it: to be eager and earneſt in other things of an inferiour allay <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111758:25"/>
the courage, zeale, and reſolution that we have; where can we lay them out better, or ſo well, as for the atchievement of a kingdom. The heathen man could ſay, <hi>Imperia pretio quolibet conſtant bene:</hi> A kingdom cannot be over bought, the crown Imperiall of a mortall Prince, it is a radiant and ſparkling object; whatſoever a man payeth for it,<note place="margin">Occidat, modo imperet, <hi>Suet.</hi> in vita <hi>Ner.</hi>
               </note> it is held a rich purchaſe notwithſtanding. <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> thought the Romane Empire a good penni-worth, though ſhe bought it for her ſon <hi>Nero,</hi> a very wretch, with the loſſe of her own life. What violent running, wreſtling and ſtriving was there of old in the Olympique games? what combates and contentions? yet all was but <hi>for a corruptible crown,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25. The greateſt reward they could looke for, was but a crown of Lawrell, a chaplet of flowers; and beſides, they all ran in thoſe maſteries, and yet it <hi>was but one onely that could receive the prize:</hi> but we ſtrive for an Incorruptible crown, and if we ſtrive <hi>violently,</hi> as we ought, we ſhall all obtaine the prize we ſtrive for; and when it is obtained, it will be more worth then all the crownes and diadems in the world.</p>
            <p>The Crownes of the greateſt earthly Monarchs, though the pearls in them be never ſo gliſtering, yet they are ſtuffed, for the moſt part, with ſuch thornes, attended with ſo many piercing cares and ſorrowes and diſcontents, that a wiſe man, if he ſhould meete with one of them lying before him in the way, he would ſcarce thinke it worth the taking up; but the crowne of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which we ſtrive for, if by all the violence we can uſe in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuffering we may win it at the laſt, it will ſuper-abundantly make amends for all.</p>
            <p>Its poſſible that we may, nay its certaine that we muſt endure much, if we will ſet our ſelves with obſtinacy and violence to run this courſe; tis a Law enacted in heaven, <hi>That we must all through many tribulations, enter into the Kingdome of God, Act.</hi> 14.22.

It may be, whiles we are zealous for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, we ſhall be in danger to loſe all our owne reſpect, and reputation among men; the black mouth of Calumny may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe the loyalty of our intentions, and ſully our Names with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid imputations of treaſon and Rebellion; <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put down unjuſt uſurpation, and to ſet up the right heire in this throne, and to draw the people into a Covenant with God, and yet <hi>Athalia</hi> cryed Treaſon, treaſon.

            <p n="2">2. This may let us ſee what we are to judge of temper and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in matters of Religion. In other things it is a vertue and worthy of much praiſe, and it is not to be denyed, That even in Religion too, there are ſome things, in which it may have place. When there was too much heate in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> about ſome matters of indifferency, not much importing any way, the Apoſtle to calme both parties, and to compoſe them unto mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and mutuall bearing with one another; <hi>The Kingdome of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not meate and drinke, but righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14.17. All truth carries Gods ſtampe, and is pretious, but not alike; there be ſome truths of ſuch moment and conſequence, as that they cannot be over violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtriven for; but there be others of an inferiour alloy which need not be held, much leſſe preſſed upon others, with ſo hard a hand, ſuch are not a few ſpeculative opinions and rituall practiſes, in matters of externall Worſhip; in contending about which, if the exceſſes of zeale, were corrected and allayed, with a little coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of moderation, no doubt it would be much better then now it is with the Church of God.<note place="margin">Bonum eſt mel rum favo Sapor Scilicet devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis cum modera mine diſcretionis, <hi>Gerſon.</hi>
               </note> Its a good rule to this purpoſe, that of the famous Chauncellour of <hi>Paris: Honey is good with the honey comb, and ſo is the Savour of Devotion, when it is ſeaſoned with a diſcreete mixture of moderation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although it be true, that in theſe punctilioes, as it were, in Religion, moderation is a Jewell, yet in the profeſſion and practiſe of thoſe maine fundamentalls of Faith, and Worſhip, with other ſuperſtructions, neerly bordering and coaſting thereupon, it is far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. In theſe things its eaſie to be too moderate, but impoſſible to be over violent.<note place="margin">Non legimus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſos qui ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium de ſonte aquae vitae hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerint, <hi>Cal.</hi> praef. ad Inſtitut.</note> If we ſeeme to be tranſported into an extaſie, ſo as the world judgeth us to be beſides our ſelves, it matters not much; <hi>If we be beſides our ſelves, it is unto God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a tender buſineſſe, and of great concernment; the glory of God, and our Salvation, depends on it; and as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid, of drawing too much water out of the well of life; ſo may I, of drawing out our Spirits in too much violence for the honour of God. I do not know where any man is blamed in all the Scripture
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111758:29"/>
for ſuch a fault. If it were poſſile that in hearing the Word, a man were all eare, if in prayer he could be rapt up into an extaſie in mourning for ſin, if he could melt out his ſoule at his eyes; in all the other parts of worſhip and practiſes of piety, could he be all devotion, and pure, pute zeale, it would become him well, and there ſhould be no danger of exceſſe; How is it poſſible, that we ſhould have too much of that whereof we can never have enough?</p>
            <p>The world is generally of another minde, a little violence in matters of Religion, a very little upon the knives point will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a dram or two is enough of all conſcience; but for moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as much of that as you will, the more the better; This is the opinion of Politicians, Court-Divines, and all the reſt of that ſtampe, they cry up that boſome-Idoll of diſcretion, as the onely fit temper, for a wiſe and well-compoſed Chriſtian; and if ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of zeale, breake out, and diſcover themſelves, If any violence appeare, this they cry down as faction, folly, frenzie. It hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede beene ever ſo with this wiſe world in all ages.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour was ſo wholly taken up with the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Kingdome of God, riſing up early to Preach, and continuing often whole nights in prayer, ſo as he had no leaſure, no not to eate; his friends out of meere pitty, good folkes, <hi>ſent to lay hold on him; for they ſayd, he was gone beſides himſelfe, Mark.</hi> 3.21. The like cenſure paſt upon Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he was earneſt and zealous in the cauſe of God, it was thought he was gone mad, the man ſure had loſt his diſcretion. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.24. And Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> when he was paſſionately eager againſt the <hi>Arrian</hi> faction, then prevalent at Court, this was interpreted a ſymptome of dotage. If men will not be baffled out of their Religion, the wiſe world counts them fooles, and furious zealots, and complains ſore of them, for want of moderation. The leſſe wonder it is that our Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Senate, which hath ſhewed ſo much zeal for God, ſhould meete with the ſame meaſure, from Malignant and ill-affected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.

            <p>I know not whether it be true, but the <hi>Vox Populi,</hi> the Common opinion and voyce of the people is, That in Country, City, Armies, I hope not in the Parliament, there are and have beene too many, who in publike places of Imployment, at the publike charge, drive their private deſignes; enjoying both at once, and improving the miſeries of the times by dilatory proceedings, dead pay, falſe muſters, betraying of advantages, and letting opportunities of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſlip, with other ſtratagems and feates of pollicy, <hi>very depths of Sathan,</hi> profound as hell, which I have not wit enough to reach.

In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

of this Parliament, when the Lord tolled us on with freſh mercies, and allured us into the wilderneſſe as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>that there he might give us the valley of</hi> Achor <hi>for a doore of hope;</hi> when every day we were <hi>paſti miraculis</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeakes, feaſted with miracles in ordinary, the Lord ſetting himſelfe on purpoſe to ingage us firmely in his worke, by divers rare and aſtoniſhing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, that all bridges might be cut off, and that we might never thinke to retire backe againe; At that time, many that were not ſound at the heart-roote, joyned with us, and who more reſolute then they, but when the wheele of Providence ſeemed to turne, and many ſad clouds began to gather and threaten a ſtorme, now they tacked about, and ſet their ſailes backe; they were willing to follow us out of <hi>Egypt</hi> when they had ſeene the wonders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God at our departure thence; but when they came into the wilderneſſe, and met with Scorpions and fiery Serpents, and great afflictions, then their hearts fainted, and they fell on murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the unbeleeving <hi>Jewes,</hi> and that mixed multitude did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.4.

Bleſſed be God, he hath given us his Word, and if we could but adde what is next in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.11. <hi>Great is the multitude of them that publiſh it, Sathan would ſoone fall downe like lightning,</hi> and we ſhould have an heaven upon earth. We are zealous againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and its well that we are ſo: I will ſhew you a way how to ſtorme downe the proud walls and battlements of it without any Petards or Cannon ſhot or Engines of warre, not ſo much need of theſe; <hi>The ſound of Rammes hornes will ſerve the turne.

If you would have a learned conſciencious miniſtry, do as <hi>Hezekiah, Command the people to give the Prieſts and Levites their portion, that they may be incouraged in the Law of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.4. Let there be due proviſion of oyle, for all the Lamps of the Sanctuary, and let there be worthy incouragements for all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall profeſſions of learning, eſpecially the ſacred. If learning ſhould decay, as ſome (I hope without ground) feare it will, what can we looke for but an Inundation of Popery, Atheiſme, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, ſects, hereſies, with all manner of Barbarity. In the memory of our Fathers, when it pleaſed the Lord to raiſe up <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Melancton, Calvin,</hi> and many other choyce ſpirits; it was unto the Churches, even like unto a <hi>reſurrection from the dead:</hi> the Reſurrection of learning brought with it a reſurrection of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a freſh ſpring of the Goſpell, which, bleſſed be God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſtill, and flouriſhes to this day.</p>

The common complaint is, That the two breaſts, though they be not quite dryed up, yet they yeeld neither ſo much milke, nor ſo wholeſome now of late, as in former times; that it is now adulterated, and brewed with mixtures, its eaſie to know whence; The way to heale all, were to plant more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, heavenly, and powerfull preaching there: St. <hi>Baſil</hi> tells, That when men were deſirous, in his dayes, to ſtore themſelves with Doves in their houſes, they tooke ſome of a milke white colour, and perfumed them with odours and ſweete oyntments, and they flying abroad, allured home, with their ſent, all they met withall: oh that we had a brood of ſuch Doves richly perfum'd with Myrrhe, Aloes, and Caſſia, men anoynted, I meane with the ſpirit and graces of Jeſus Chriſt, which are more ſweet and odoriferous then all the unctions elſe in the world.
