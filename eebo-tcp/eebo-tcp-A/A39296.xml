         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Account from WICKHAM,
(Lately published by Iohn Raunce and Charles Harris)
Examined, and found False:</head>
            <head type="sub">And a warning thereof given to all such well-meaning
Persons among the People, called Quakers, as through
Personal Affection, want of Consideration, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Judgment have been betrayed, or may be in
danger to be betrayed by them, or any other in the same
dividing Spirit with them, and led aside from the Way
of Truth, into a Separation from the People of God: for
whose Recovery and Preservation this is written.</head>
            <p>FOr your sakes it is, O ye much pitied Ones, more than for any Weight in the
Account it self, or Worth in the Authors of it, that I have thus taken notice
of it. For indeed as soon as I had perused it, I felt a compassionate Concern
spring in my Heart on your behalfs, and a direction in Spirit to open some passages
therein, and relating thereto, to you, that ye might be preserved from being
taken, or, if in any measure taken, might be rescued and delivered from the snare
which the Enemy of your Souls, and of all Righteousness, hath made use of these men
to set, to intangle, entrap and catch you by. And to the true Witness of the holy
God, in every one of your Consciences, who retain any honest breathing after the
Lord, and the way of Holiness, do I recommend this my undertaking, and the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of my Intention herein.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore with the beginning of their Account, they say, <hi>The Differences
amongst Friends in these parts, did not arise amongst our selves, but were brought in by such,
who have largely endeavoured to cause Division amongst us.</hi> Now I affirm, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and fear of the holy God, and upon my own certain knowledge, that <hi>these men
themselves</hi> were the chief Instruments of bringing the Differences in amongst Friends
in these parts; and They with their Associates, have largely endeavoured, yea, and
laboured hard for many Years to cause Divisions amongst us. The Lord knows this
is true, and many of his faithful Servants in these parts know this is true; yea, and
these men themselves also cannot but know this is true, which makes their Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the greater.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>It is a Comfort to us, that we can say in the presence of God, we have not been the
cause thereof</hi> (but then, being conscious of their own guilt, they add, for a <hi>Salvo,</hi> these
words) <hi>by bringing into the Church any new Doctrine, or any sort of unscriptural Discipline.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93895:3"/>
Were I now to deal directly with them, I would not grant them that: But since the
end of my present writing is for your Information, not to contend with them, that
which I shall observe to you is, that were they indeed never so free from bringing into
the Church any new Doctrine, or (as they term it) unscriptural Discipline, yet might
they notwithstanding, <hi>by other ways and means,</hi> have been the Cause of the Divisions
amongst Friends in these parts, as <hi>indeed they were.</hi> They travelled to and fro and traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Countries, <hi>gleaning up Stories</hi> and evil Surmises from such as were in the work
of Division in other parts; and what they had so picked up, They privately whispered
and insinuated into the minds of such simple ones whose Ears were open to them, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them with fears, doubts and jealousies of an <hi>Apostacy</hi> entring among Friends, &amp;c.
whereby they begat in some a Dis-esteem of many antient Friends, and faithful Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in Truth's service, preparing and fitting them thereby to joyn with themselves, to
<hi>oppose,</hi> in an ignorant Zeal, the Care and Counsel which, in the openings of Life, the
God of Life conveyed, through his Servants, to the Meetings, for preventing that
Apostacy which they said was entring. And having espoused the Cause of <hi>I. S.</hi> and
<hi>I. W.</hi> who had headed a <hi>Separate Meeting</hi> in the North, they endeavoured to make a
Party for them amongst the Friends of this Country, and for that end did bandy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and having got <hi>I. S.</hi> over to <hi>Wickham,</hi> brought him to our Meetings <hi>to Preach
over us,</hi> though he was known to be <hi>out of the Vnity of Friends,</hi> and to be one of the <hi>cheif
Heads</hi> of the Division, to the great grief and heavy burden of many an upright ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hearted Friend.</p>
            <p>They add, that they <hi>have only stood for their own and others Liberty in Christ, that all might
walk as they had received from Him, and not otherwise.</hi> But the Truth of the matter is
otherwise. Neither their own nor others Liberty in Christ was infringed, nor were
any desired to walk otherwise than as they had received from Christ. <hi>But they stood for
a Liberty out of Truth,</hi> out of Christ who is the Truth, for a fleshly liberty, a self-willed
liberty, a corrupt liberty, a liberty to mix in Marriages with such as were not
of us. Scandalous persons were brought to our Meeting upon account of Marriage,
and countenanced and abetted by these very men, and such others as they could get
to joyn with them, against the mind and life of the Meeting. One Couple especially
(whom I forbear to name, being unwilling to mark out particular persons) whereof
the Man was not reputed a Quaker, and the Woman charged by her Neighbours
with having lain with her own Father to the great scandal of Religion. Yet that
Marriage these men promoted, and highly contended for, to the great grief and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Friends, whose Life stood against it, and to the great disquieting of the
Meeting; <hi>I. R.</hi> alleadging that the Man had been an Absenter from the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for more then twenty Years, and that though he had not frequented the Quakers
Meetings, yet he had not joyned to any other People. And when that gave no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to Friends, he plainly told us, <hi>It must be passed;</hi> and that there was a necessity for
it, otherwise things would be worse: which made it more uneasy to Friends to
meddle at al with them. But after long debate, and many Moneths contending
about it, having got the Woman to sign a Paper under the notion of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her misbehaviour (which Paper was then understood to be drawn up by
<hi>C. H.</hi> for her, and was so favourably worded, that it rather seemed to palliate
and excuse her Offence, than condemn it, pretending that her Father, when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93895:3"/>
she lay with him, was sick unto Death, though it was known he was able to walk
abroad) they carried on the Marriage with such an high Hand, that the most Friends
could do to clear themselves of it, was to declare they did not consent to it, but only
by way of condescention, for Peace-sake, permit it to pass, and that too with this
caution, that they should not take each other in any publick Meeting of Friends, but
among their own Relations, that Friends might stand clear of them afterwards. To
which, though <hi>I. R.</hi> and themselves agreed, yet were they afterwards brought to a
publick Monthly-Meeting of Worship, where they took each other in Marriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Friends, and as Friends, <hi>I. R.</hi> being there to preach on that occasion. And
when some Friends being grieved and offended thereat, arose and departed in Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against it, <hi>I. R.</hi> in reflection upon them, and to abet the Marriage, publickly
said, <hi>Let him that is without Sin cast the first Stone:</hi> And this Couple soon after they
were married there, went and were <hi>married again by a Priest:</hi> Plenty of Instances
might be given of <hi>corrupt Marriages</hi> promoted and carried on by them over the Heads
of Friends. But by this one it may appear what sort of Liberty they stood for, and
what it is they call their Liberty in Christ. And it is to be observed, that the Contest
between Friends and them about this Couple, was before any Marriage had gone to
the Womens Meetings, and was indeed it self the immediate Cause that Friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Womens Meetings might, for the future, be also concerned in Inquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Peoples clearness upon Proposals of Marriage. By which it may also appear how
false and insincere these Men are, who would lay the rise and ground of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in these parts, upon Marriages going to the Womens Meeting. But after that
Friends (having been fain to use the help of the Womens Meeting to examine that
unhandsome Carriage of the fore-mention Woman towards her Father) found need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to desire and advise such as afterward came to propose Marriage, to lay their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
first before the Womens Meeting, it was truly lamentable to see (and hardly
credible by any but those that did see) what <hi>shameless</hi> Marriages were obtruded upon
the Meeting, and by these Men and their Party vigorously animated and backt against
the Meeting, under pretence of Conscience in not going to the Womens Meeting.
The Instances whereof, too many to be here inserted, lie ready for a future Service,
as further Occasion may be given for it. Ah, had these Men, and others whom they
joyned with, and who joyned with them, stood only for their own, and others Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in Christ, had they walked as they had received from Christ, and not otherwise,
they had not let up that <hi>Spirit of Loseness,</hi> nor made these <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> in the
Church of Christ, which they have, nor lost that Savour which once, in some measure,
some of them had, to become, as at this day, <hi>unsavory-Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next they say, <hi>That which hath seemed to draw People to please Men, and to force them to
practice things wherein they have not Faith, we have no Fellowship with, as knowing God owns
it not.</hi> See here on how <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi> a Ground they have laid the Foundation
of their <hi>wretched work of Separation,</hi> which they have run, and have drawn others (more
simple than themselves) into. That which they have taken such great Offence at, and
declare they have no Fellowship with, they durst not say did <hi>positively draw</hi> people to
please Men, or did <hi>realy force</hi> them to practice thigs wherein they had not Faith; but
they say, that which hath <hi>Seemed</hi> to draw, and to force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had they indeed
been any whit tender of the Honour of God, the Prosperity of Truth, the peace of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93895:4"/>
the Church of Christ, the Salvation of Souls, could they (think ye) have made so
great a bluster, have proclaimed such <hi>open War</hi> as they have done, and set up such open
Ensigns of Opposition, and Flags of Defiance, against the Standard of the Lord of
Hosts, as their <hi>Separate</hi> Meetings are, upon no sure Ground, no better Bottom, than
an Apprehension that something <hi>Seemed</hi> to draw People to please Men, <hi>Seemed</hi> to
force them to practice things, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again, in their second Page they say, <hi>We clearly saw, That if their Orders were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on such terms, that all were to be rendered of a dark and bad Spirit that did not conform,
then,</hi> &amp;c. Here ye see, they cannot say that those things which they call Friends-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were proposed on such terms; but <hi>If</hi> they were. Accordingly they say, <hi>they
did withstand them that in effect, did so propose them:</hi> They know if they had said they
had been proposed <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>positively</hi> on such terms, they should have been immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
convicted of a direct and positive Lye. Therefore they use these <hi>shifting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> to <hi>hide</hi> themselves and <hi>deceive</hi> you. In like manner they go on there, and
say, <hi>We had great cause to be jealous, several things proposed were not from Heaven, but of
Man.</hi> So here ye may see, they don't pretend to have had a <hi>certain</hi> Knowledge, a
grounded <hi>Assurance</hi> that the things proposed were not from Heaven, but a <hi>Iealousie</hi>
only. And consider, I pray, what was this <hi>Iealousie</hi> of their's grounded on? a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
ye will see, sutable to it self and to them. <hi>We had great cause,</hi> say they, to
<hi>be Iealous, several things proposed were not from Heaven, but of Man; for in their Birth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church they <hi>Seemed</hi> not to bear the Heavenly Image, neither shake hands with Holy
Scriptures.</hi> Here's their <hi>Iealousie,</hi> and the great Cause of it, a <hi>Seemed</hi> not to
bear the heavenly Image. But sure it had <hi>beseemed</hi> them to have gone past <hi>Seeming,</hi>
beyond <hi>Iealousie,</hi> and to have had a <hi>certain,</hi> sure, indubitable, <hi>positive</hi> Knowledge of
what they <hi>Seemed</hi> to be Jealous of, before they had made a certain <hi>positive</hi> Rent,
Breach, Division, Separation from the Church of Christ, as they have done. Ah,
how hath the Lord abandoned them to <hi>blindness,</hi> who have resisted his Light in the
manifestations thereof, that they might discover their own <hi>Nakedness?</hi> The Lord
make every one of you wise, to improve these discoveries of their Folly and Falseness,
to the advantage of your own Souls, that hereby ye may <hi>see,</hi> and seeing <hi>shun</hi> that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing</hi>
Spirit, which hath led them into these <hi>pernicious</hi> ways, and would through their
means lead you in after them. And for your further Information and Satisfaction in
this matter, I (who, I think, may reasonably pretend to know as much what has been
done in the Meetings of this Conntry, as any other, having seldom been absent from
them) do <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> declare, in God's Presence and Fear, that I did never
hear or know any of those things which they call Friends-Orders, proposed on such
terms as they suggest, as that all were to be rendered of a dark and bad Spirit, that
did not conform. But I do certainly know, the things they contend against, have
been gently and <hi>tenderly</hi> proposed, and in a Christian Spirit <hi>recommended to the Witness
of God</hi> in the Consciences of those, to whom they were proposed; and while there
has not appeared a rugged, harsh, <hi>prejudiced mind,</hi> resolved before hand, in a <hi>heady
will,</hi> to break the Order, and thwart the Proceeding of the Meeting; but Friends
have found any measure of <hi>tenderness</hi> in the Persons concerned, though not come to so
clear an understanding as, with satisfaction, to comply with what was proposed, the
Meeting has <hi>condescended to their weakness,</hi> not desiring any should act without Sight,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93895:4"/>
or without (muchless against) Faith. Of which I could give many Instances. But
those who have been justly noted for dark Spirits, have been such as have declared
they did not see, and yet have set themselves to <hi>oppose, revile</hi> and <hi>vilifie</hi> that, which
themselves confessed they had not a sight whether it was of God or not.</p>
            <p>To what <hi>I. R.</hi> and <hi>C. H.</hi> say concerning <hi>Endeavours to bury them alive, and take
away their good Name, and destroy their Labours and Services for God and his Truth,</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
need, I think, be said, plain it is, and too apparent, that their Labour and Service,
of latter years, have not been for, but <hi>against God and his Truth.</hi> And more their
Friends, than they are aware of, have some been, who have endeavoured to destroy
those Labours and Services of theirs, which (unless they repent of, and forsake) <hi>will
assuredly destroy them.</hi> But for their being buried alive, I am (and always was) so far
from desiring they should be so, that I wish, at least, they were now capable of being
so. Ah, what <hi>Savour of Life</hi> can any of you taste? What <hi>fresh Spring</hi> can any of you
find? What <hi>green Leaf</hi> can any of you see throughout their whole Account? The
Lord give every one of you, who are in any degree Favourers of them, or inclining
towards them, <hi>a true Savour of Life in your selves,</hi> that ye may forsake the <hi>Tombs,</hi> and
and not seek the Living among the Dead.</p>
            <p>They speak, Page 1. <hi>Of what several Friends have suffered from such who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
for the Form, and have made it the Measuring-Line;</hi> And Page 4. they mention
<hi>Formality being made the measuring-Line of Fellowship and Vnity.</hi> That any Friends have
made the Form the measuring-Line, I neither know nor believe, but take it for a
<hi>Slander.</hi> But if these Men think the Form ought not to be contended for, they are
<hi>Ignorant.</hi> If they cannot distinguish between <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Formality</hi> they are <hi>Weak.</hi> In
every Dispensation. Truth hath always appeared in some Form, and that Form which
God appoints for Truth to appear in, ought to be contended for (if any rise up to
contend against it) so long as the Dispensation continues, to which that Form is
adapted. Would these Men have <hi>a Religion without Form?</hi> Or would they have <hi>a Form
not worth contending for?</hi> Consider, I intreat you, ye who have been at their Separate
Meetings, <hi>Have they no Form?</hi> Do they pretend to none? Are they slid back into such
a <hi>Choas</hi> of <hi>Confusion,</hi> that they are, or would be, as the Earth was, while Darkness
was upon the face of the Deep, <hi>without Form?</hi> If they have <hi>no Form,</hi> they have <hi>no
Order;</hi> and how then is <hi>the God of Order</hi> their God? If they have a Form, but such
an one as they think <hi>not worth contending for,</hi> they had as good have none. If they
have a Form which they do think worth contending for, nay, if they have contended,
<hi>even unto Separation,</hi> that they might <hi>impose a Form</hi> of their own invention upon us, how
can they, <hi>without the greatest Injustice,</hi> blame us for contending for the Form which, we
believe, the <hi>Power of Truth</hi> has led us into? But making the Form the measuring-Line,
is a Phrase of their own, not of Friends, by which they endeavour to <hi>cloud</hi> your
understandings, and <hi>prejudice</hi> your minds against Friends. The Spiritual measuring-Line
is the Spirit of God, by which the Spiritual-minded measure Spiritual things.
And by this measuring-Line, They, that oppose the Form of Truth, are certainly
known and discovered not to be acted and guided by the Power of Truth; And yet
the Form is not made the measuring Line. Is there not a <hi>Form of sound Words, 2. Tim. 1
13?</hi> And if any, who profess Truth, should not only <hi>depart from</hi> the Form of sound
Words, but should <hi>reject, despise, oppose,</hi> contend against it, would ye not blame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93895:5"/>
condemn such persons? But would ye have it from hence infer'd, that ye make
the Form the measuring-Line?</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>When the Womens Meetings were set up, the People were told, that was set up
to keep things sweet and clean, forgetting the fear of the Lord, which can only effect that work.</hi>
Thus they pretend to <hi>exalt</hi> the Fear of the Lord, but it is that they might <hi>debase</hi> and
destroy those means which the Lord hath made useful in his Church, for the <hi>stirring
up of the pure Mind,</hi> and keeping in a <hi>Watchful</hi> state of Subjection to the Lord <hi>in his
Fear,</hi> and reclaiming or <hi>calling back to the Fear</hi> of the Lord those, that by the Wiles
of the Enemy may at any time be drawn from it, and for the denying and testifying
against such as <hi>harden themselves</hi> against the Lord's Reproof, such as <hi>oasting his Fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
their Backs,</hi> persist in Evil, and will not be reformed, who by the judgment of
Truth, arising in the heavenly Power in the Hearts of the Faithful, are to be <hi>swept out</hi>
of the Family of God, as by the Besoom of the Lord. And is not that a proper way
and means to keep things <hi>sweet and clean?</hi> Did <hi>Paul,</hi> think ye, <hi>forget the fear of the
Lord;</hi> or knew he not, as well as these men, the <hi>vertuous Efficacy</hi> of it to keep <hi>sweet
and clean,</hi> when he took so great Care and Pains to <hi>watch over</hi> the Churches for that
end? When he gave particular direction for <hi>the aged Women to instruct and teach the
younger,</hi> Tit. 2. 3, 4, 5. Was not the end of this to keep things sweet and clean?
And might'not <hi>Hymenaes</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> or some other Apostate in that day, have ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villed
with as much Reason as these men now do, and have said; the Apostle <hi>forgot
the Fear of God, which can only effect that work?</hi> But the Children of Light, who abide
in the Light, do, in and by the Light, see through and over all these <hi>empty Cavils.</hi>
And in true and tender Pitty, and Christian Compassion to your Souls, are these things
briefly opened unto you; that ye may <hi>see,</hi> and seeing may <hi>believe,</hi> and believing may
be <hi>saved</hi> from the snare the Enemy hath laid to catch you.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>I. R.</hi> and <hi>C. H.</hi> complain of some crying, <hi>Make no Bargain with that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and feed it with Iudgment,</hi> &amp;c. And of <hi>Sitting with Hats on in the time of their Prayer,
as a Testimony before all sorts of People against their Spirits;</hi> with much more of like kind,
which ye may see in pag. 2. of their Account. This I say, is <hi>deceitfully</hi> written by
them to <hi>beguile</hi> the simple, and make the Ignorant believe that these Carriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them were the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Occasion</hi> of the Differences between Friends and them
in these parts: for they immediately add, <hi>Now these things are repeated, that none may
be so ignorant as to think we begun these Quarrels with our Neighbours, and Friends.</hi> Now
the God of Heaven knows, and they know in their own Consciences, that in this
they <hi>deal deceitfully.</hi> For the plain and naked Truth is, that these things appeared
not in any of our Meetings in this Country, not a Hat kept on in the time of their
Prayer, nor any <hi>open</hi> shew of dis-union with, or dislke to their Testimony (how
much so ever some of us were then grieved and burdened by them) until they had <hi>first
joyned themselves</hi> to the chief <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Fomenters</hi> of <hi>Division</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> in other
parts, abetting their Cause, espousing their Quarrel, and having made a Party for
them amongst Friends in this Country, brake forth into an <hi>open Opposition</hi> to the way
and order of Truth, and by their continual <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> had done their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to <hi>break</hi> our Meetings to pieces, and by their unruly and <hi>turbulent</hi> behaviour,
had given unquestionable proofs, that they were <hi>departed</hi> from the Fellowship of the
Gospel of Peace, and of Friends were become Enemies to Truth. And surely they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93895:5"/>
had no reason to expect to be owned by Friends in their Preaching and Praying, after
they or their party had published Friends to the World to be <hi>Apostates, Innovators, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducers
of Popery,</hi> and the like. As for the Papers they mention, advising Friends to
<hi>make no Bargain with that Spirit, and feed it with Iudgment,</hi> &amp;c. Those Papers declare
what Spirit that was that was not to be bargained with, but fed with Judgment,
namely, that which was <hi>gone out of Truth,</hi> and had led into Division and Separation;
and if these men had not known themselves <hi>guilty,</hi> and, That they were <hi>joyned to that
Spirit,</hi> and to those that by that Spirit were led into Division and Separation in other
parts, what need it have troubled them to hear such Papers read amongst Friends
for a warning and caution to Friends to beware that they were not entangled by that
Spirit? Why should these men have taken offence at the reading of such a Paper, any
more than any other Friend in the Meeting where it was read, if they had not then
been <hi>in the Strife,</hi> Contention and work of Division, and so <hi>felt a stroke reach them</hi> in
the reading of these Papers, that were designed as a Caution to all?</p>
            <p>Their charging Friends, pag. 2. with <hi>endeavouring to leaven the Minds of convinced
People from House to House, to increase then Party, and to defame such as were not of it;</hi>
is so exact a description of <hi>their own Courses,</hi> that I am perswaded there are few Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of Friends in this Country but can convict them of it; And I dare appeal to many
of you, if ye have not found it so your selves. Nay, does not <hi>I. R.</hi> still continue to draw
some Patients of his, to come to speak with him at his separate Meeting-place, that
so he may engage them, who else would not come there, to help increase his number?
But their charging Friends with <hi>writing, approving and printing Books against several
whom they call antient Friends by Name, wherein</hi> (they say) <hi>are several Falshoods and
Scandals,</hi> is so notoriously known, and has been so openly and unanswerably proved,
to be <hi>the guilt of their own party,</hi> that it argues an extream degree of <hi>hardness</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi>
in them to mention it. Let them produce, if they can, any one Book to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their Charge, before <hi>W. R.</hi> writ his <hi>foul Invective</hi> against Friends, under the
Title of <hi>The Christian Quaker distinguished from the Apostate and Innovator, in five Parts.</hi>
Which <hi>infamous piece,</hi> if my Memory fail me not, I have heard <hi>I. R.</hi> say remained
some considerable time in his hand before it was printed; so that he could not be
ignorant of it: Nay, he was a Promoter and Spreader of it, after it came abroad.
Judge ye now, how great a piece of <hi>Deceit</hi> it is in them to blame Friends for that,
which their own party first went into, and necessitated Friends to answer, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and Vindication of the Truth and themselves.</p>
            <p>After the same manner they cry out of <hi>Envious Reflections,</hi> pag. 2. <hi>Base Reflections, and.
Hellish Names,</hi> pag. 3. When as, besides what they utter by Word of Mouth in their
Preaching and Discoursing, what Reflection, that is envious and base, is not to be
found in their printed Books and Pamphlets against Friends? How full is that Book
of <hi>W. Rogers,</hi> and other Books writ since by him, of abusive Language, bitter
Words and <hi>base Reflections!</hi> What is there else in <hi>Bug's</hi> and <hi>Bullock's</hi> Writings! And
for <hi>envious Reflections and Hellish Names,</hi> what Sheet of Paper ever contained more
than those of <hi>Susan Aldridge!</hi> in forming of which how great an hand these very men
had, is not unknown to some: But if ye look no further than the Account they have
now published, there ye shall find they say, <hi>When the Womens-Meetings were first set up,
many was so elevated with it, that they ran like</hi> Gehazi, &amp;c. <hi>Gehazi</hi> ye know, was Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93895:6"/>
to the Prophet that cured <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Assyrian</hi> of his Leprosie; and when the
Prophet had refused to take a Reward from <hi>Naaman</hi> for the Cure, <hi>Gehazi</hi> ran after
him in the Prophet's Name, with <hi>Lyes</hi> of his own inventing <hi>in his Mouth,</hi> on purpose,
and to no other end but to <hi>get Money and Clothes of him, 2 Kings</hi> 5. Now for these men
to say of any Friends, that they were so elevated with the Womens-Meeting, that
they run like <hi>Gehazi,</hi> what <hi>baser Reflection</hi> could they have cast! yet here ye fee they caft this base and envious Reflection upon <hi>many.</hi> What more <hi>foul</hi> as well as <hi>false</hi>
Slander could they have vented or invented! Yet these men, ye see, in that very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
wherein they have thus basely reflected on others, are not ashamed to tax others
with envious and base Reflections; whose <hi>Injustice</hi> here'in I represent to your view,
and serious consideration, that ye may weigh, and duly consider what Spirit it is
they were guided by in writing that Account: That so ye may not give your selves
up, through an <hi>affectionate fondness,</hi> to an <hi>implicit belief</hi> of what they say or write;
but may examine and try them by the true measuring-Line, the Spirit of Truth, which
uncovers their <hi>Deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They reject Truth's order upon pretence, pag. 2. that <hi>Several things proposed have
not proved a Blessing to the Church, in such things, they were pretenended for,</hi> viz. <hi>to keep things
sweet and clean.</hi> The truly-sensible Ones, the faithful and honest-hearted, know the
contrary, not-withstanding the pains these men have taken, by their Oppositions, to
prevent the Blessing, and make things unsavoury and unclean. But, I pray consider,
what hath their <hi>Disorder</hi> done? how <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>clean</hi> have things been kept <hi>amongst them?</hi>
So far has their <hi>Division</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> been from being a <hi>Blessing</hi> to the Church, that it
hath proved a <hi>grievous Curse</hi> to many of them that have run into it; And hath led
some of them utterly to part from the very profession of Truth, and sit down again
<hi>under the preaching of a Parish-Priest?</hi> of which Examples might be produced in several
parts. But, not to seek Examples far from home, what <hi>shattering work</hi> has been
among them, since their <hi>Seperation</hi> from Truth and Friends, even in their own Meeting
at <hi>Wickham!</hi> One that was a <hi>bold Champion</hi> in their Quarrel, a great <hi>Contender</hi> for them
against Friends and Truth's order, and <hi>went into the Separation with them,</hi> hath since
turned Papist, and gone openly to <hi>mass.</hi> I forbear to name the Person, or publish
(at present) the <hi>miscarriage</hi> which drove him from the, being unwilling to expose
persons or things, unless necessitated thereunto. Another, that had got up to be a
<hi>pert Preacher</hi> among them, hath of late <hi>deserted</hi> both them and his Profession, and is
now said to hanker after the Baptists. Divers others of their party in that Town
are <hi>gone off</hi> from the very Profession of Truth, and are gone to the <hi>Priest,</hi> or the
<hi>Top-Knot,</hi> or both, as I have been credibly informed. The Lord make these Examples
<hi>warnings</hi> to you, that ye may not <hi>tempt God,</hi> as some have done, and by him be given
up to a <hi>reprobate sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They strike also at the order of Truth, under the phrase of <hi>unscriptural Discipline,</hi>
page 1. and of <hi>unscriptural Orders,</hi> page 2. as if they thought, and would have you
believe the way and method of acting and managing the Affairs of the Church now,
were as <hi>expresly</hi> set down, and plainly to be read in the writings of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Discipline of the Church under the law was, in the wirtings of the old:
not considering, or not seeming to regard, the Difference between the Dispensations
of Law and Gospel; wherof the one was expresly <hi>limitted to a litteral Prescript,</hi> the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93895:6"/>
other left to the Direction of the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unlimitted</hi> Spirit of God, which is never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the true church, and by which the true Church ought to be, and is guided.
They should do well to distinguish between <hi>unscriptural</hi> and <hi>Anti-Scriptural,</hi> between
that which is <hi>contrary</hi> to the Scripture, and that which is <hi>not contrary to it,</hi> though
not expresly and fully set down in it: And ye would do well to put them to speak their
sense plainly in the case. If their meaning be, that the order and Discipline of the
Church of Christ, is expresly, particularly, invariably and fully <hi>in term</hi> set down in
the Scriptures of the New Testament, let them assert it, and they, or others, shall
soon, by God's assistance, be made sensible of their <hi>Error.</hi> Or, if they will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
and undertake to prove, that the order, way, or method of managing the
Affairs of the Church of Christ, now used amongst Friends, is <hi>contrary</hi> to the
Scriptures of Truth, it shall not be long before they shall be convicted of <hi>Falshood</hi> and
<hi>Slander</hi> therein. In the mean time it will not be a miss to observe, what <hi>Scriptural
Orders</hi> they have brought forth, either during their <hi>jangling Contention</hi> with Friends,
or since their <hi>Separation</hi> from us. They, who so tartly twit Others with <hi>unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Orders,</hi> should (one would think) be very exact in squaring their own Orders by
the Letter of the Scriptures. How Scriptural their Practices are, in the case of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
in their <hi>Separate</hi> Meetings, I refer to your own impartial Observations, who
have been present at any of them. What they have laid down in their late printed
Account, and which they say they desired, is, <hi>That the Men and Women might meet
together, whilst we sate to wait upon God, and also whilst all Marriages were proposed, and
that Men might take care concerning their Sex, and the Women of theirs, against the next
Meeting; and then, if the Women had any mind to be together, about any other Matters,
that they thought they could do best by themselves, they might take their Liberty, &amp;c.</hi> I earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
press you to consider, and wish ye would as earnestly press them to shew where
this Order which they propose is <hi>exprest</hi> in the holy Scriptures, Is there any <hi>plain
Direction</hi> of such a method there? Is there any <hi>Intimation</hi> there that the Saints so
practised? Have they any, either <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Precedent</hi> in the Scriptures of Truth for
this Proposal of that, more then we have for our practice which they reject? They
say, <hi>It is a Comfort to them that they can say in the presence of God, They have not been the
cause of Division, by bringing into the Church any sort of unscriptural Discipline,</hi> and yet in
the same breath (as it were) they propose the bringing in a Discipline no whit more
Scriptural then they which that oppose? O Consider these things, I beseech you, all
ye well-meaning Ones, who have been and are in any measure <hi>beguiled</hi> by the fair
Speeches and smooth Insinuations of these, and such like men. Bring their work to
the Light of Christ, examin it by the Light, weigh it in the true Ballance, try
it by the true <hi>Touch-stone,</hi> and take not every thing for Gold that doth a little
glister.</p>
            <p>They add, that they desired <hi>Our Meetings might consist of qualified chosen Friends,
from each particular Meeting, and not be filled up with Youths, and Girls, and Strangers from
other Countries, to busie themselves, to head and make Parties among us, and then carry Tales
form place to place, to increase difference.</hi> Surely none, whether, Strangers from other
Countries, or others, should <hi>head</hi> and <hi>make Parties</hi> in Meetings, or <hi>carry Tales</hi> from
place to place: yet this, I certainly know, was <hi>their practice</hi> in our Meetings, while
they continued amongst us, and by that means <hi>the Difference was much increased in</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93895:7"/>
these Parts. But if they would have Strangers (by which I suppose they mean Friends)
of other Countries <hi>wholly excluded</hi> from our Meetings, I say Distance of place, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteness
of outward Habitations; ought not to make any such <hi>Distinction</hi> among us.
None are Strangers to us, to our Meetings, or to the service of Truth in our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
who are not Strangers to that divine Life and Power, but dwell in it, and are
subject to it, by which we have been gathered to be a people to the Lord, and our
Spirits engaged to his service. The Spirit of Christ is an universal, free, unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Spirit, and both teaches us how to behave our selves towards Friends that come
from other Countries, to sit, <hi>in the Vnity of the same Spirit,</hi> with us in our Meetings
and them how to behave themselves amongst us. But I fear these men are <hi>no more just</hi>
in this cavil than in the former. Don't they, think ye, when they go into other
Countries, help fill up the Meetings of their own Party? Ask them if they have so
done, and busied themselves to head and make Parties, and help make Division,
where Meetings have not been actually divided. And whether <hi>Strangers from other
Countries,</hi> such as are <hi>confederated</hi> with them in their wicked work of <hi>Separation,</hi> come
not to their <hi>separate</hi> Meeting in this Country, I appeal to your own observation and
knowledge, who sometimes resort thither. Judge you then of <hi>their Sincerity</hi> in making
this Cavil. And as to their other Cavil about <hi>Youths,</hi> and <hi>Girls, filling up our Meetings,</hi>
if thereby they mean that the Meetings <hi>consist</hi> of such, 'its <hi>false:</hi> If they mean not
so, but only that some young ones are sometimes there present, 'tis <hi>idle.</hi> The Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
it is well known, consist of the most <hi>antient, grave, weighty Friends,</hi> of either
Sex, in the Country. And if any <hi>young</hi> people, or <hi>old</hi> either, that have been little
amongst us at our other Meetings, and whose deportment and behaviour hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suered
their Profession, have stept in, such have been taken out, and desired to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.
But if they except against all that are young in Years, meerly because they
are young, their exception is to be excepted against as not according to Truth; And I
question whether they obseve their own methods in the <hi>separate</hi> Meetings they have
set up. But if they do not, it is then without question that they urge these things,
not from a conscientious tenderness, and with a sincere mind, but as a ground of
<hi>Contention</hi> and occasion of <hi>Quarrel.</hi> So also they say, they desired <hi>that our Meetings
might consist of qualified chosen Friends, from each particular Meeting.</hi> But I pray now,
do their <hi>separate</hi> Meetings consist of such <hi>qualified chosen</hi> persons. Ye that have been
amongst them, deal <hi>faithfully</hi> with your selves, and if ye find them <hi>false</hi> in these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
urging those things in <hi>pretence,</hi> which they do not practice in <hi>reality,</hi> suffer
not your selves to be <hi>deceived</hi> by them. As for our Meetings, they do consist of <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified</hi>
Friends, from each particular Meeting, such as are <hi>chosen</hi> by him who best knows
their <hi>Qualifications,</hi> God, who <hi>qualifies</hi> them for the service he engages them in, and
enagages their Spirits in an holy Concern to undertake the work he <hi>qualifies</hi> them for.
But is it not strange that these men, who seem ready to <hi>startle</hi> at the very Name of
<hi>Form,</hi> and cry out so fearfully against <hi>Imposition,</hi> should on a sudden so far forget
themselves, as thus to <hi>contend for Form</hi> in choosing the Members of their Meeting,
and <hi>impose upon all others,</hi> that should not be chosen and qualified as they think
fit, <hi>to absent themselves from those Meetings?</hi> What Confusion do these Men run
into?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93895:7"/>
Now, having told us what they desired, they go on to tell us what they have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked,
as that <hi>when Persons have declared, that they could not go to the Womens Meeting with
their Marriage, for Conscience sake, several have declared to this effect, That the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Iudgment concerning such Consciences belong'd to them, and that they had power to judge
Spirits and Consciences, and that they had not only power to desire, but to require Marriages
before the Womens Meeting, and that they could have no Vnity with, neither stand Witness to
any Marriage, but what went first to a distinct Womans Meeting, and that such ought not to
proceed in Marriage, but wait till the Cloud was over; telling them, it was not Conscience, but
Stubbornness and Wilfulness;</hi> and would say, <hi>They knew it by an inward Sence, without any
outward Demonstration,</hi> Thus they fill your Ears with <hi>noise:</hi> and endeavour to <hi>prejudice</hi>
your minds with <hi>Reports</hi> of what they say others have said, whose Sayings perhaps
they may have <hi>mis-reported,</hi> or <hi>perverted</hi> their <hi>meanings</hi> in giving their <hi>own Sence</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
words; for, if ye observe it, they do not say several have declared <hi>these very
words</hi> which they have there set down, but this <hi>in Effect,</hi> which depends upon <hi>their
Construction</hi> of the words spoken, the true Sence of which too cannot be so clearly
understood, without knowing the Occasions and Circumstances of the Discourse; Yet
even as these Men have related them, they will not sind, upon a due Examination,
any great advantage accrue unto their Cause, not will you, I hope, find cause of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
from any of these fore-going Expressions. As for the <hi>authority of judging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Conscience,</hi> which I take to be the main thing here they carp at, before it can
be rightly understood, with relation to be the present Case, the occasion and intention
of the Words must be considered. A Couple that profess Truth, lay their Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Marriage before a Meeting of Friends, The intent of their doing this is, not
<hi>barely</hi> and only that their Intention may be made known, but that the Friends of that
Meeting, if no just cause of Obstruction appear, may <hi>own them, joyn with</hi> them, <hi>Act
for</hi> them, and <hi>stand by</hi> them in the carrying on and consummating of their Marriage.
Now if this Couple shall refuse to proceed in that Method, for the accomplishing
their Marriage, which the Meeting uses on the like Occasions, and shall pretend a
Conscientious scruple for such <hi>Refusal,</hi> hath not that Meeting Authority to <hi>inquire</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Grounds and Reasons of such a pretence, and upon that Inquiry, power also
to <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Insincerity</hi> of such a Pretence or Plea of Conscience, <hi>so far
as concerns their own Satisfaction,</hi> in order, <hi>to their owning</hi> or not owning, <hi>acting for</hi> or
not acting for, <hi>joyning with</hi> or not joyning with, <hi>standing</hi> by or not standing by such
Persons in their present Procceedings? How else shall a Meeting be capable to act
with <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Safety?</hi> shall a Meeting of Friends be obliged to acquiesse, and
submit to <hi>every bare Plea of Conscience</hi> from others, <hi>contrary to the firm Perswasion</hi> of their
own Consciences; and not be allowed a Liberty, Ability, Capacity, Authority to
Examine, Try, Judge a Plea of Conscience, whether it be sincere or no, especially
<hi>in a Case wherein themselves are to be concerned?</hi> Worse then would the Condition of
a Meeting be, than that of a single Person We have been told indeed by some of
them, when we have asked, of the Parties refusing, <hi>a reason of their refusing</hi> to let
their Proceedings be lookt into by the Womens Meeting, that <hi>we ought not to ask them
such Questions;</hi> but that, <hi>when they have declared it to be matter of Conscience to them, we
ought to be satisfied with that Answer, without inquiring further.</hi> But this has not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
our Consciences, nor our Understandings. We believed that, <hi>in a Case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93895:8"/>
they desired us to be concerned,</hi> we might reasonably desire to be <hi>further satisfied</hi> th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
so. Their excepting against any Friends, saying, (if any did say) they had <hi>power to
judge Spirits,</hi> shews how short they are of the state of the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> who, the
Apostle testifies, <hi>Iudges all things, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 15. Consider, I intreat you, wherefore
was the Gift of <hi>Discerning Spirits</hi> given to the Church, as we read it was, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10.
If it was not to be used in the Church? And wherefore were the Saints exhorted,
1 <hi>Iohn 4. 1. To try the Spirits whether they were of God or no,</hi> if they have not received
from God ability to <hi>Try,</hi> and power, upon Tryal, to <hi>Iudge,</hi> whether those Spirits
are of God or not; at least <hi>so far as relates to their own satisfaction,</hi> in receiving or not
receiving, joyning or not joyning or not joyning with them? If any Friend, being sensible that a
Couple was clouded and muddled in their minds (as some have been in our Meeting
by the Oppositions and Gain-sayings of these Men and their Party) and thereby made
uncapable at present of seeing what the Lord required of them, should advise them
not <hi>hastily</hi> to proceed in Marriage, but <hi>wait till the Cloud was over,</hi> what hurt was
there in that to any? If it were said to some, that <hi>their Refusal proceeded not from
Conscience, but from stubbornness and willfulness;</hi> What then! was that impossible to be
true? Or impossible to be known? or, being true, and being known, was it unfit to
be spoken? If any knew it by an <hi>inward sence,</hi> they had the better ground to speak
it on. And though it is not probable any Friends exprest themselves as these Men
have set it down, <hi>viz.</hi> by an inward sence <hi>without any outward Demonstration;</hi> yet I do
not believe that to be <hi>impossible.</hi> And if these Men hold otherwise, ye would do well
to put them to speak plainly, that you and all may see how far they are <hi>degenerated.</hi>
However, this is certain, that in those controverted Cases which came before the
Meeting in this Country, during this Disturbances that these Men made there, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>inward sence</hi> any Friends had of the <hi>Stubbornness, wilfulness,</hi> and <hi>insincere</hi> Pleas of
Conscience made by any whom they abbetted, the Lord never suffered us to want
<hi>Outward Demonstration</hi> thereof also, sufficient to confirm that inward sence, and
convict the Opposers.</p>
            <p>They proceed in discovering their Dislike, saying, <hi>Also we have not liked to send
Men from the Country to the Yearly-Meeting, to sign Papers against Ministers of the Gospel
for Non-Conformity.</hi> For my part, I never knew any sent for that purpose, nor any
Papers signed at the yearly-Meeting against any Ministers of the Gospel for Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
These are but false <hi>Insinuations,</hi> by which they endeavour to fill your
minds with prejudice against Friends, that thereby <hi>they may bind you</hi> the faster to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But the Lord I hope, will <hi>break their Bands of Iniquity,</hi> and open your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
to see and discern between Truth and Falshood, that ye may reject the one,
and cleave to the other. Therefore take not their Stories upon trust, but examine
and try them. Here, ye see, they suggest as if Friends of the Country were sent to
the Yearly-Meeting to sign Papers against Ministers of the Gospel for Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
This is false. Those Friends that go from the Countries to the Yearly-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
go, as in the general Love of God, so on the general Service of Truth, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the general state and condition of Friends in the several Counties they go
from, and to consider and advise together, in the openings of Life and heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
from God, how to be servicable one to another, and to the whole body, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Liberty Ease &amp; Relief to those Members that are in Sufferings by Persecution,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93895:8"/>
or Labour under Necessities and Wants, whether in this Nation or any other; And
to be Instrumentally helpful to open the way, as the Lord opens their Hearts and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
thereunto, that Truth may have a free and open passage, to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
and spread in other Nations, either by Books or Preaching, as the Lord shall stir
up the Spirits of his Servants thereunto; whereby <hi>the Body edefies it self in Love.</hi>
But these Meetings, I know, this sort of Opposers have long disliked and reproached;
nor are they, <hi>in reality,</hi> for any <hi>settled</hi> Meetings for Business, either Monthly, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,
or Yearly, but such as themselves may direct and govern, Now as for what they
suggest of signing Papers against Ministers of the Gospel for Non-Conformity, as I
know of none such ever signed there, so there having been but one Paper, that I
remember, signed at the Yearly-Meeting against any that pretended to be Ministers, I
suppose in this Cavil they aim at that. That was a Testimony signed in the year 1677.
against <hi>I. S.</hi> and <hi>I. W.</hi> who were <hi>gone from the Vnity of Friends,</hi> into a <hi>Separate</hi> Spirit,
and had countenanced an open <hi>Separation</hi> in the North, long before. And having been
charged by Friends in the North with many things <hi>contrary to the Testimony of Truth,</hi>
after many Meetings had between Friends and them thereupon, a Meeting was at length
by joynt consent of both Parties, appointed to be held at <hi>Draw-Well</hi> in <hi>York-shire,</hi> in the
2<hi>d.</hi> Month 1676. which Meeting lasted four days, and thereupon a full hearing of the
Charge against them, and their Defence, they were found faulty in the most material
things laid to their Charge (as by the Narrative of the Proceedings of that Meeting,
signed by above twenty Friends that were present, doth appear) And after a deep
Travel of Spirit for them, that they might be brought to a sence of their Guilt, they
seemed at length in some degree bowed, and produced a Paper, in order to give Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to Friends, containing a <hi>Condemnaiion of themselves,</hi> and of that Spirit by which
they had been mis-led. But quickly after (being blaimed, as was said, by some of their
own Party, and encouraged to persist in their former Opposition) <hi>they denyed their own
Paper of Condemnation,</hi> using Falshoods and <hi>Equivocations</hi> to avoid the force of it (as
with relation to <hi>I. S.</hi> I my self from a personal Conferrence which I had with him at
<hi>I. R's</hi> House, do certainly know) and their great Agent <hi>W. R.</hi> who not only was one
of that Meeting at <hi>Draw-Well,</hi> but was said to have assisted them in drawing up that
Paper of Condemnation for them, did afterwards expresly say, <hi>It was but a Rattle to
please Children;</hi> which evidenced the <hi>Naughtiness</hi> of their hearts, and the insincerity of
their dealings, who afterwards concerning their work of Opposition, Division and
Separation, they were tenderly admonished thereof in an Epistle from several Friends
at <hi>London</hi> in the 3<hi>d.</hi> Month 1676. But they rejecting the tender Love of Friends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, and hardening themselves against the good advice in that Epistle given
them, went on in their <hi>dividing Work, I. S.</hi> Travelling the Countries, and spreading
the Division and Separation further. Whereupon Friends felt a necessity upon their
Spirits at the Yearly-Meeting 1677. (above a year after) to give forth a publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against them, and against that <hi>dividing Spirit</hi> they were then led by. That all
Friends might be warned of them, that no more might be deceived by them, and that
the Meeting might be clear in the sight of God, who had laid that concern weightily
upon it. For your sakes it is, O ye beguiled ones, whom my Soul both pitties and seeks,
that I have given this short, but plain account of this matter, that ye may have a right
understanding of things, and not to be mis-led by <hi>mis-reports</hi> and <hi>mis-representations</hi> of
matters, to the hardening of you against the Work of the Lord, and the hurting of
your own Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93895:9"/>
They express their Dislike also of <hi>Contentious Books sent,</hi> as they say, <hi>on the Countries
Charge; And all those contentious Papers that have been sent abroad to be read in Meetings,
teaching People hellish Names against their Brethren, and to stir them up to deny the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Prayers of such whom</hi> (say they) <hi>we believe the Lord hath gifted for that
Service.</hi> But they should be remembred, that it was their own Party began their
Contention in Print, and have carried it on as vigorously as they could, till the work
grew heavy to them; and now these two, as two fresh Heads, starting up in the
room of the old, begin to <hi>renew the War in Print.</hi> If they dislike contentious Books
and Papers, that teach People <hi>Hellish</hi> Names, why do they not openly shew their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of <hi>W. Rogers</hi> his <hi>contentions Books</hi> and <hi>Papers?</hi> Of <hi>Francis Bugg's contentious Books? of
Iessery Bullok's cententious Books?</hi> Of <hi>Susan Aldridge</hi> her <hi>contentious Papers,</hi> which are stuft
with such <hi>base Reflections</hi> and <hi>hellish Names,</hi> as sufficiently manifest from whence that
Spirit came that gave them forth: Yet these (so great is their <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi>)
they can dispense with well enough. These, or so many of them as they think suitable
to their Service, they can <hi>secretly</hi> scatter and spread abroad, and yet (which shews the
<hi>falseness</hi> of their Spirit) cry out against contentious Books and Papers that teach Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hellish Names.</p>
            <p>As for being <hi>stirred up to deny the Testimony and Prayers of such whom these men say they
believe the Lord hath gifted for that Service;</hi> they need not lay that upon any Papers.
Certain it is that the holy God, who hates <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and loathes <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> hath
by his immediate Power stirred up the Spirits of many faithful Friends, in these as well
as in other parts, to deny the Testimony and Prayers of this <hi>Hypocritical Generation,</hi>
who to the World have published Friends to be <hi>Apostates, Innovators, Introducers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
Idolaters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> setters up of Images Idol-Prophets, a treacherous Company, possest with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of</hi> Belial, <hi>mercenary Iudges, self-seeking slavish Drudges led by Satan,</hi> with much more
such filthy stuff; and yet (for some <hi>evil ends</hi> or other) will thrust into our Meetings, and
attempt to offer their <hi>unacceptable</hi> Gifts amongst us, and be very angry too, if
they are not received and owned by us. Hear, O Heavens, and give Ear O Earth!
Was the like ever known in any Age or Nation! Can a Parallel be found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of Time, since man had a being upon the face of the Earth, that ever any men
that had <hi>branded</hi> a People with such <hi>infamous</hi> and <hi>unchristianizing</hi> Marks and Names,
and had <hi>actually separated</hi> from them, did <hi>fix themselves</hi> among the same People, <hi>to joyn
in worship</hi> with them, did <hi>bow the Knee</hi> at the Prayers of those whom they had so stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized
with the most odious Brands, and <hi>force</hi> upon such their own Preaching and
Praying, with <hi>envions Reflections</hi> on them, if they not comply with, and bow thereto!
yet thus hath this party dealt with Friends. They have openly <hi>branded</hi> them with
the most <hi>infamous</hi> Marks, Characters and Names. They have persisted in the defence
thereof, and rather than acknowledge any Evil they had done therein, they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to rend off and <hi>separate</hi> from us, thereby making themselves a distinct People from
us, as one of their own party (a <hi>small,</hi> but <hi>busie Agent</hi> in the work of <hi>Division and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in these parts) said openly at a Conference between Friends and them in <hi>Wickham</hi>
some Years ago (in my hearing, <hi>I. R.</hi> and <hi>C. H.</hi> being present) that <hi>They and We are
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> really two distinct People, as</hi> London <hi>and</hi> York <hi>are two distinct Cities.</hi> All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with standing,
these men would fain be Preaching and Praying among us, would fain
have us receive their Peaching, and <hi>stoop to their Prayers;</hi> And they themselves <hi>bow</hi> to,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93895:9"/>
and seem in outward appearance to <hi>own</hi> and <hi>joyn with</hi> the Prayers of those, whom they
have thus exposed, <hi>reviled</hi> and vilified, and <hi>separated</hi> from. O horrible Hypocrisie!</p>
            <p>They add yet one dislike more, which is of <hi>such Preachers that instead of Preaching
the Gospel, spend</hi> (they say) <hi>most of their time in base Reflections,</hi> &amp;c. This is so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
known in these parts to be their own practice, that I am perswaded there are
few, if any, that have frequently heard them, but know this to be <hi>their own Guilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Reasons they have thought fit to publish, for which (with many more
not published, (for they love Reserves) and would willingly be thought to have more
behind) they say, <hi>Many Friends</hi> (meaning themselves and seperate Party) <hi>have rather
chosen to meet apart, whereby they might peaceably enjoy the true end of their Meeting</hi> &amp;c So that their <hi>meeting apart,</hi> as they term it, is here declared by themselves to be <hi>their own Choice.</hi>
They do not say, God hath drawn them to it, nor that Friends have driven
them to it: but that <hi>they</hi> themselves <hi>have Chosen it;</hi> which is an Observation fit to
be considered by all those, who, though favourably Opinioned concerning them, are
not baptized into the same Spirit of <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>hardness</hi> with them. They have
chosen to <hi>meet apart;</hi> which is a quaint Phrase they have also chosen to cover their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
O that they could come to <hi>mourn apart</hi> also, over him whom they have
pierced by that and other <hi>ungodly</hi> Practices! But though they have thus <hi>chosen to meet
apart,</hi> that they <hi>might</hi> (as they pretend) <hi>peacebly enjoy the end of their Meetings;</hi> and,
as in their 8th page is exprest, <hi>have withdrawn to such places, where they might be at quiet, to
enioy the liberty of their Consciences;</hi> yet, so restless is their Envy, that they will not let
these whom they have thus parted and <hi>withdrawn from,</hi> be <hi>at quiet</hi> to enjoy the liberty
of their Consciences, and enjoy peacebly the end of their Meetings: but ever and anon
they resort to their Meetings, whom they say they have <hi>withdrawn</hi> and <hi>parted</hi> from, to
make Disturbances, and stir up Contention and Strife there. They pretend they <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi>
from our Meetings, and <hi>chose to meet apart,</hi> because they could not have their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Preach and Pray among us, without being denyed and testified against. And
yet now that they are <hi>withdrawn,</hi> and have set up Meetings <hi>apart,</hi> as they say, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>their own Choice,</hi> they will not yet <hi>be quiet,</hi> nor <hi>let others be quiet</hi> neither; but so
natural is Strife and Contention to them, for all their feigned pretences to Peace, that
not satisfied with <hi>their own Choice,</hi> they still thrust into our Meetings, which they have
<hi>withdrawn</hi> and <hi>parted</hi> from, and will force and <hi>impose</hi> upon us their Preaching and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which by experience they know we cannot receive; as if they did it on purpose
to <hi>provoke,</hi> and draw forth a Testimony against them, which might cause some distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in our Meetings, which they might improve to the advantage of their Party.
Judge now, O every impartial Soul, whether their thus doing can proceed from a
<hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>peaceable Spirit,</hi> which they so much pretend to? or whether this Practice
of theirs doth not plainly speak, that they are <hi>not really,</hi> and indeed <hi>Lovers of Peace,</hi>
but seekers of occasions of Strife and Contention; not willing to let others enjoy that
quiet, which themselves pretend they seperated for.</p>
            <p>Having opened, I think, the most, or most material Passages, which in their
Account they assign for the Grounds of their Offence, and <hi>Reasons of their Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and thereby answered the End of my present Undertaking, which was to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you, by exposing their <hi>Falsness</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> to your views, that none of you
may be further <hi>betrayed by them,</hi> for want of sufficent Information and warning; I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93895:10"/>
shall not at present take much notice of the remaining Fragments of their Pamphlet
as perhaps, but for your sakes, I had not now concern'd my self with it at all
What they talk of their desire, <hi>that all that is amiss might be forgiven, removed and
buried</hi> while they omit the inseparable <hi>Condition</hi> of Forgiveness, viz. Confessing
and Forsaking, shews rather their <hi>want</hi> of Forgiveness, than their <hi>desert</hi> of <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <hi>fitness</hi> for it. And when they say, they are <hi>as ready to forgive as to be forgiven,</hi> it
is a sign they are conscious that themselves are <hi>guilty of those Vngodly Reproaching</hi>
they mention just before, and would fain perswade the <hi>Innocent</hi> to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>guilty</hi> too, that, without further reckoning, they might <hi>discount</hi> one with
another. But the work is weightier then they are aware of. And they are
gone far inded from a right sense, if they do not understand, that Who go out
by Transgression, must come in by Iudgment. If they are sensible <hi>they
need Forgiveness</hi> from others, they ought to seek it in the right way and proper
course, whether those others, who they think need forgiveness from them, are sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of any such need on their parts, and desire it, or not. For if they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
others fall short of doing their duty, that will not justifie, nor excuse these
men from falling short of doing theirs. Now as the right way of <hi>seeking For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
is a true Repentance</hi> of the <hi>Evils</hi> desired to be <hi>forgiven:</hi> so the proper <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi>
of the Truth of such a <hi>Repentance,</hi> are a <hi>free and sincere Acknowledgement</hi> of
those Evils, an <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>godly Sorrow</hi> for them, and an <hi>utter forsaking</hi> of them.
And now that these men have thus intimated their desire of <hi>being forgiven,</hi> if they
shall not <hi>pursue</hi> these right and proper means thereto; it will thence the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear to all, that in this, as well as in the rest of their work, <hi>they are void
of Sncerity, Truth and Honesty.</hi> But till they, and their Party, have given <hi>Evidence of
their Repentance,</hi> they have no reason to expect any other Answer to their <hi>feigned offers
of Peace,</hi> than that which, they say, hath been frequently given them, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>they are joyned to a wrong Spirit, and no peace is to be made with them, while they remain
joyned to that wrong Spirit.</hi> From which as I heartily desire they might be disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so I certainly know, that whosoever makes Peace with them in that wrong
Spirit, and while they continue joyned to it, will certainly <hi>break his peace with God.</hi>

            <p>WE have read a Paper signed by you, which you directed to this
Meeting for an Accommodation &amp; reconciling Differences, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting separate Meetings, and Re-uniting those to us that are
separated from us in the Country, &amp;c. And we having well weighed the
Contents, and considered from whom it comes, viz. from and on behalf of
such as have rendered us to the World to bee Apostatized from the Truth, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novaters
and Setters up of a Lordly Dominion in our own wills over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, Introducers of <hi>Popery,</hi> and but one Step from it, &amp;c. It gives
cause of Marvel that after making &amp; spreading such Charges against us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have taken them off again, you should make Propositions of a more
strict Unity and Correspondency with us then is at present. If you had come
forth with an Acknowledgment that we were not such, and had come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Repentance, for your falsely charging us to be such, it had appeared
Rational. But to desire reconcilliation with us before this be done by you,
seems very unreasonable and unsafe for you and for us. For if we are <hi>defacto</hi>
such as you have rendered us, it's not fit for you to declare an Unity
with us while such. If we are not such as you have rendred us,
its fit you should take off the approby cast upon us, and acknowledge
your just Condemnation before we can with safety declare Unity with you;
and for your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying, if the Separation proceeds to be Publick it will lye at our
Doors, what do you mean, the Evil of it will lye at our Doors? if so it seems
there is an Evilinit, and therefore you ought to avoid it, for provocation to
an evil is no excuse for an evil in the sight of God, if you think the work
be good (as our separation from the World's Worships because of Apostacy
and Innovations was) why then do you seem to make terms to evade and
prevent it.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93895:11"/>
As to your complaint of Reflections &amp; Exclusions in our publick Meetings,
we say when you have condemned all those <hi>Slanderous &amp; abusive Reports</hi> which
you have publickly cast upon us in the face of the World, and manifested the
Love of God dwelling in your Hearts towards us as Brethren, you shall find us
as ready in the same Love to receive you as Brethren without any reflecting
upon you for what is past, and be very glad to appear as Sheep of one Sheep-fold under our own Shepherd Christ Jesus, for which end we were called.</p>
            <p>But while yon do retain those Sentiments of us which you have helped to
spread and publish against us, it is not possible for you to have a Christian
Unity with us: or that Love and Life can freely flow forth, from the one to
the other, in the fellowship of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Nor have we reason to Judge that you are sincere in your inclination to such
an Unity as in the Truth can be received: For that you seek to impose upon
us a subjecting our selves to the Ministry of some Men, who are known to us
by good evidence to be men of evil and vitious Practices, whom we could not
for that reason receive as Preachers among us.</p>
            <p>And there are among us, have had experience how some of you have been
so far from Concurring to detect some of those Men, when sufficient evidence
hath been produced against them, That you have rather seemed to covet
them.</p>
            <p>And as we never could admit the pretended Ministry of such among us
who lie under those Scandals, so since you seem to have owned this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be an ill thing (which we do readily agree to) and therefore neither
can we admit the Authors and Abettors of such Separation from our Friends
and Brethren elsewhere, so as to Receive their Testimony here, else we
should become partakers of that evil which we justly condemn, and you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would appear to avoid.</p>
            <p>And we are well satisfied that you cannot justly charge Friends with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
or preventing any, who have been owned Ministers among us, who
are not of the one or other sort above-mentioned; which are the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why they could not be admitted of, and not because of any meer Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity
to any outward orders or Impositions, as is unjustly and untruely
affirmed by you.</p>
