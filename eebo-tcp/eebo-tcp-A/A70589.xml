            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Reader may take notice, That this Character of Mr. <hi>Miltons</hi> was a part of his Hiſtory of <hi>Britain,</hi> and by him deſigned to be Printed: But out of tenderneſs to a Party, [whom neither this nor much more Lenity has had the luck to oblige] it was ſtruck out for ſome harſhneſs, being only ſuch a Digreſſion, as the Hiſtory it ſelf would not be diſcompoſed by its omiſſion: which I ſuppoſe will be eaſily diſcerned, by reading over the beginning of the Third Book of the ſaid Hiſtory, very near which place this Character is to come in.</p>
            <p>It is reported (and from the fore-going Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter it ſeems probable) that Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> had lent moſt of his Perſonal Eſtate upon the Publick Faith; which when he ſomewhat earneſtly and warmly preſſed to have reſtored [obſerving how all in Offices had not only feathered their own Neſts, but had enricht many of their Relations and Creatures, before the Publick Debts were
<pb facs="tcp:57329:3"/>
diſcharged] after a long and chargeable Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, met with very ſharp Rebukes; upon which at laſt deſpairing of any Succeſs in this Affair, he was forced to return from them poor and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, having ſpent all his Money, and wearied all his Friends. And he had not probably men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his worldly condition in thoſe days, but by performing ſuch Service for them, as afterwards he did, for which ſcarce any thing would appear too great.</p>

            <head>Mr. <hi>JOHN MILTONS</hi> Character OF THE Long Parliament In 1641.</head>
            <p>OF theſe who ſway'd moſt in the late Troubles, few words as to this point may ſuffice. They had Arms, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Succeſſes to their wiſh; but to make uſe of ſo great an Advantage was not their skill.</p>
            <p>To <hi>other</hi> cauſes therefore, and not to the want of Force, or Warlick Manhood in the <hi>Britains,</hi> both thoſe, and theſe lately, we muſt impute the ill Husbanding of thoſe fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, which might ſeem to have put Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſo long deſired, like a Bridle into their hands. Of which other cauſes equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Ruler, Prieſt, and People, above hath been related: which, as they brought <hi>thoſe Antient Natives</hi> to Miſery and Ruine, by Liberty, which, rightly uſed, might have made them happy; ſo brought they <hi>theſe of late,</hi> after many Labours, much Blood-ſhed, and vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57329:4"/>
to Ridiculous Fruſtration: in whom the like defects, the like Miſcarriages notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly appeared, with Vices not leſs hateful or inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>For a Parliament being call'd, to Redreſs many things, as 'twas thought, the People with great Courage, and expectation to be eaſed of what Diſcontented them, choſe to their behoof in Parliament, ſuch as they thought beſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Publick Good, and ſome indeed Men of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Integrity;</hi> the reſt, [to be ſure the greater part,] whom Wealth or ample Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, or bold and active Ambition [rather than Merit] had commended to the ſame place.</p>
            <p>But when once the ſuperficial Zeal and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Fumes that acted their <hi>New Magiſtracy</hi> were cool'd, and ſpent in them, ſtraight every one betook himſelf, ſetting the Common-wealth behind, his private Ends before, to do as his own profit or ambition led him. Then was Juſtice delayed, and ſoon after deny'd: Spight and Favour determined all: Hence Faction, thence Treachery, both at home and in the Field: Every where Wrong, and Oppreſſion: Foul and Horrid Deeds committed daily, or maintain'd, in ſecret, or in open. Some who had been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57329:4"/>
from Shops and Ware-houſes, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merit, to ſit in Supreme Councels and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, [as their Breeding was] fell to Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Common-wealth. Others did thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as Men could ſooth and humour them beſt; ſo he who would give moſt, or under Covert of Hypocritical Zeal, inſinuate baſeſt, enjoyed unworthily the Rewards of Learning and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; or eſcaped the puniſhment of his Crimes and Miſdeeds. Their Votes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which Men lookt ſhould have contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Repealing of Bad Laws, and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Conſtiturion of better, reſounded with nothing elſe, but new Impoſitions, Taxes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; Yearly, Monthly, Weekly. Not to reckon the Offices, Gifts, and Preferments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed and ſhared among themſelves: They in the mean while, who were ever faithfulleſt to this Cauſe, and freely aided them in Perſon, or with their Subſtance, when they durſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel either, ſlighted, and bereaved after, of their juſt Debts by greedy Sequeſtrations, were toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and down after miſerable Attendance from one Committee to another with Petitions in their hands, yet either miſt the obtaining of their ſuit, or though it were at length granted, [mere ſhame and reaſon oft-times extorting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57329:5"/>
from them at leaſt a ſhew of Juſtice] yet by their Sequeſtratours and Sub-committees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, Men for the moſt part of inſatiable hands, and noted Diſloyalty, thoſe Orders were commonly diſobeyed: which for certain durſt not have been, without ſecret complyance, if not compact with ſome Superiours able to bear them out. Thus were their Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſcate in their Enemies, while they forfeited their Debtours to the State, as they called it, but indeed to the Ravening Seizure of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Thieves in Office: Yet were withal no leſs burthened in all extraordinary Aſſeſments and Oppreſſions, than thoſe whom they took to be diſaffected: Nor were we happier Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours to what we call'd the State, than to them who were Sequeſtred as the States Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>For that Faith which ought to have been kept as Sacred and Inviolable as any thing holy, <hi>The Publick Faith,</hi> after infinite Sums received, and all the Wealth of the Church not better imploy'd, but ſwallowed up into a private <hi>Gulph,</hi> was not ere long aſhamed to confeſs Bankrupt. And now beſides the ſweetneſs of Bribery, and other gain, with the love of Rule, their own Guiltineſs, and the dreaded name
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57329:5"/>
of <hi>juſt Account,</hi> which the People had long call'd for, diſcovered plainly that there were of their own number, who ſecretly contrived and fomented thoſe Troubles and Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Land, which openly they ſate to remedy; and would continually finde ſuch work, as ſhould keep them from being ever brought to that <hi>Terrible ſtand,</hi> of laying down their Authority for lack of new buſineſs, or not drawing it out to any length of Time, tho' upon the Ruine of a whole Nation.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>State</hi> were in this plight, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> was not in much better; to Reform which, a certain number of Divines were called, neither choſen by any Rule or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome Eccleſiaſtical, nor eminent for either Piety or Knowledge above others left out; only as each Member of Parliament in his private Fancy thought fit, ſo elected one by one. The moſt part of them were such, as had Preach'd and cryed down, with great ſhew of Zeal, the Avarice and Pluralities of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prelates; that one Cure of Souls was a full Employment for one Spiritual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour how able ſoever, if not a charge rather above humane ſtrength. Yet theſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57329:6"/>
men (ere any part of the work done for which they came together, and that on the Publick Salary) wanted not boldneſs, to the Ignominy and Scandal of their Paſtor-like Profeſſion, and eſpecially of their boaſted Reformation, to ſeize into their hands, or not unwillingly to accept [beſides one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two or more of the beſt Livings] Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Maſterſhips in the Univerſities, rich Lectures in the City, ſetting Sail to all Winds that might blow Gain into their covetous Boſoms: By which means theſe great Rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Non-Reſidence, among ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Cures, were not aſhamed to be ſeen ſo quickly Pluraliſts and Non-Reſidents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to a fearful Condemnation doubtleſs by their own Mouths. And yet the main Doctrine for which they took ſuch pay, and inſiſted upon with more vehemence than Goſpel, was but to tell us in effect, that their Doctrine was worth nothing, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power of their Miniſtry leſs available than Bodily Compulſion; perſwading the Magiſtrate to uſe it, as a ſtronger means to ſubdue and bring in Conſcience, than Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical perſwaſion: Diſtruſting the Virtue of their own Spiritual weapons, which were given
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57329:6"/>
them, if they be rightly called, with full warrant of ſufficiency to pull down all thoughts and imaginations that exalt themſelves againſt God. But while they taught compulſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out convincement, which not long before they complained of, as executed unchriſtianly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, theſe intents are clear to have been no better than Antichriſtian: ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a Spiritual Tyranny by a Secular power, to the advancing of their own Authority above the Magiſtrate, whom they would have made their Executioner, to puniſh Church-Delln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies, whereof Civil Laws have no cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance.</p>
            <p>And well did their Diſciples manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be no better principled than their Teachers, truſted with Committeeſhips and other gainful Offices, upon their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Zealous, [and as they ſtickt not to term them] Godly men; but executing their places like Children of the Devil, unfaithfully, unjuſtly, unmercifully, and where not corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtupidly. So that between them the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and theſe the Diſciples, there hath not been a more ignominious and mortal wound to Faith, to Piety, to the work of Reformation,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57329:7"/>
nor more cauſe of Blaſpheming given to the Enemies of God and Truth, ſince the firſt Preaching of Reformation.</p>
            <p>The People therefore looking one while on the Statiſts, whom they beheld without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy or firmneſs, labouring doubtfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the weight of their own too high under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, buſieſt in petty things, trifling in the main, deluded and quite alienated, expreſſed divers ways their diſaffection; ſome deſpiſing whom before they honoured, ſome deſerting, ſome inveighing, ſome conſpiring againſt them. Then looking on the <hi>Church-men,</hi> whom they ſaw under ſubtle Hypocriſie to have Preached their own Follies, moſt of them not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, Time-ſervers, Covetous, Illiterate Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not lovers of the Truth, like in moſt things whereof they accuſed their Predeceſſors: Looking on all this, the People which had been kept warm a while with the counterfeit zeal of their Pulpits, after a falſe heat, became more cold and obdurate than before, ſome turning to Lewdneſs, ſome to flat Atheiſm, put beſide their old Religion, and foully ſcandalized in what they expected ſhould be new.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57329:7"/>
Thus they who of late were extoll'd as our greateſt Deliverers, and had the People whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their Devotion, by ſo diſcharging their Truſt as we ſee, did not only weaken and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit themſelves to be diſpenſers of what Liberty they pretended, but unfitted alſo the People, now grown worſe and more diſordinate, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or to digeſt any Liberty at all. For Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries teach us, that Liberty ſought out of ſeaſon, in a corrupt and degenerate Age, brought <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf into a farther Slavery: For Liberty hath a ſharp and double edge, fit only to be handled by Juſt and Vertuous Men; to bad and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, it becomes a miſchief unweildy in their own hands: neither is it compleatly given, but by them who have the happy skill to know what is grievance, and unjuſt to a People, and how to remove it wiſely; what good Laws are wanting, and how to frame them ſubſtantially, that good Men may enjoy the freedom which they merit, and the bad the Curb which they need. But to do this, and to know theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite proportions, the <hi>Heroick Wiſdom</hi> which is required, ſurmounted far the Principles of theſe narrow Politicians: what wonder then if they ſunk as theſe unfortunate <hi>Britains</hi> before them, entangled and oppreſt with things too
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57329:8"/>
