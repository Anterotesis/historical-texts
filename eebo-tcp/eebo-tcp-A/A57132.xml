            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

us from the wrath to come, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joshua the High-Priest</hi>] He is seldome mentioned alone without <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> as <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 2, 8. 4. 3. 5. 2. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 1, 12, 14. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 2, 4. As in their returne out of <hi>Egypt</hi> they were led by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Psal. 77. 20. so in their return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> they were led by <hi>Zerubbabel and Ioshua,</hi> and being returned, these two were to engage themselves in the work of building the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. 2. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Temple-work doth never go prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously on, but when the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Priest is backed and encouraged with the authority of the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> As it was by <hi>Nehemiah, Hezekiah,</hi> and other good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>And therefore they are enemies to the building of Gods house, who go about to perswade the <hi>Magistrate</hi> that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with matters of Religion, that it belongs not either to his <hi>power or duty,</hi> to take care that purity of <hi>truth and worship</hi> be preserved within his territores: of whom notwithstanding it is prophecied, that they should be <hi>nursing Fathers</hi> to the Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 23. and truly they are none of the best Nurses, that suffer their children to have poison as freely offer'd them, as milk or wholsome meat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64473:5"/>There is something in it, that we finde <hi>Joshua</hi> here alone. Satan would do mischief to any one whom God honours and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys. But his notable malice is against <hi>Religion,</hi> and the building of the <hi>Temple.</hi> If there be any more special instrument of that then other, him in speciall manner he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth; the more spiritual the service, the more resisted by the Devil. The true <hi>Jesus,</hi> whereof our <hi>Joshuah</hi> was a type, was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er called by God to build his house (for so it was said of him that he should do, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6. 13.) but we finde him <hi>assaulted by the Tempter,</hi> Mat. 4. 1. Of all works this is the work which Satan most desires to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as the Apostle intimates, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 18.</p>

               <hi>Standing</hi>] Both <hi>Tanquam Servus,</hi> and <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Reus.</hi> 1. As a <hi>servant</hi> to Minister unto the Angel. So much the word <hi>standing</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently importeth attending upon a <hi>Ministry,</hi> Deut. 10. 8. 17. 12. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11. whereby is noted, 1. <hi>Reverence</hi> to the Lord whom he served. 2. <hi>Readinesse</hi> to receive his commands. 2. As a <hi>Defendant,</hi> who being accused stands up to answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the Judge fate, and the people stood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 13. <hi>Actor and Reus</hi> were wont <hi>to stand</hi> together before the Judge. <hi>Who will contend with me?

50. 8. to intimate possibly in either the confidence of a just cause; therefore it is said of the ungodly, that they shall not stand in judgement, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joshua</hi> was in <hi>filthy garments,</hi> yet God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd him, and Satan accused him. How low soever our condition be, God thinks not scorne to use us in his service; <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings he hath ordained praise:</hi> He will be served as well in rags as in robes. And how low soever our condition be, Satan would have us lower, from robes to rags, from rags to nakednesse. His malice is like hell, without any bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. The truth is, it is not robes or rags that trouble him, but that whether in the one or the other, we do any way stand before the Lord, and minister unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before the Angell of the Lord</hi>] namely, the <hi>Angel of Gods presence,</hi> Isa. 63. 9. the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3. 1.

He is the Judge over the House, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> his <hi>Subject.</hi> And in both capacities he stands before him, to <hi>execute</hi> the commands of his Lord, to <hi>answer the accusations</hi> of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Satan standing at his right hand</hi>] the right hand seemes to have been the place of

Satan hopes, if he speed not at <hi>accusing,</hi> he shall at <hi>resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that he shall prevaile either as an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi> or a <hi>Tempter.</hi> But here is <hi>Joshua's</hi> comfort, though Satan be at his right hand to tempt, <hi>God also is at his right hand</hi> to support him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 8.

Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan transforming himself into an Angel of Light, zealous for Gods worship, which is the thing that he chiefly maligneth. Even the haters of Religion will pretend zeal for it, so they may do it mischief, and when they rejoyce at the failings of good men, will yet seem greatly offended for them.

So here the Lord saith to the Lord, <hi>Lord rebuke Satan.</hi> The Lord sent Christ the Lord to conquer Satan, and Christ the Lord prayes unto the Lord to rebuke Satan.</p>
            <p>1. When Satan is the Churches Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, Christ is the Churches Advocate,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64473:13"/>
we have an <hi>Advocate with the Father; Jesus Christ the Righteous,</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2. When Satan is an <hi>Adversary</hi> to resist, Christ is a <hi>Captaine</hi> to defend, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. He was for this purpose manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. And he hath destroyed Satan three manner of wayes, 1. <hi>Per viam sapientiae,</hi> he hath outwitted Satan, and made his own devices to returne upon his own head. By malice Satan brought Christ to his Crosse, and on that Crosse Christ spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principalities and powers, and <hi>triumphed</hi> over Satan, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15.

He vanquished him in <hi>a single combate</hi> of temptation himselfe, so that Satan was faine to leave the field, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 11. and he vanquished him in his warre against the Church, so that he and his Angels are cast out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9. 3. <hi>Per viam judicii,</hi> in a way of juridicall

            <p>This is a ground of great Comfort, though Christ suffer Satan to tempt and to oppugn his Church, to put out his venome, and power, and policy against it, yet he will still be a <hi>wall of fire</hi> round about it. If <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> go <hi>to and fro</hi> to devour, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 7. Christ hath his <hi>Angels</hi> going to and fro to protect, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 11. If Satan have four <hi>Horns</hi> to scatter the Church, Christ hath as many <hi>Carpenters</hi> to fray them away, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 18, 21. What ever <hi>Poyson</hi> there is in Satan, there is an <hi>Antidote</hi> in Christ against it. He a <hi>Destroyer,</hi> Christ a <hi>Saviour;</hi> He a <hi>Tempter,</hi> Christ a <hi>Comforter;</hi> He an <hi>Enemy,</hi> Christ a <hi>Captain;</hi> He an <hi>Accuser,</hi> Christ an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;</hi> He a Prince and God of this world, Christ a King of Saints and Lord of Glory. <hi>Three names</hi> Satan hath given him from his three most active Principles, A <hi>Serpent</hi> for his Cunning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. A <hi>Lion</hi> for his Strength, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. And a <hi>Dragon</hi> for his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64473:14"/>
Malice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. And Christ hath a name which meets with every one of these, A <hi>Counsellor,</hi> no subtilty of the Serpent can deceive him: A <hi>mighty God,</hi> no strength of<note place="margin">Isa. 9. 6.</note> the Lion can overcome him: An <hi>everlasting Father,</hi> no malice of the Dragon can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act him, and he is <hi>wonderfull</hi> in All these, ordering and improving his <hi>Wisedom,</hi> his <hi>Power</hi> and his <hi>Love</hi> unto the peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his people against whom Satan warreth.</p>
            <p>II. And further we may here note, That when Satan accuseth, <hi>Joshua</hi> doth not <hi>stand upon his defence,</hi> nor plead his own cause, but he <hi>answers by his Counsel,</hi> his Advocate pleads for him. When we are tempted and assaulted by Satan, we must put off our <hi>Adversary to Christ.</hi> If we go against him in our own strength, he will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be too hard for us. <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted by a Messenger of Satan; he doth not buffet Satan again, but cries to the Lord to help him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8. No name to oppose to the Accusations and fiery Darts of <hi>Satan,</hi> but the name of Christ. We know not what to do against Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but our eyes are upon him. Satan brings in his <hi>Charge</hi> to condemn; <hi>What's the</hi>

We see by what weapons Satan is to be overcome; not by humane counsel or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but by the <hi>Increpation</hi> of God, and by the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ; He only is <hi>able to succour those that are tempted, Heb.</hi> 2. 18. In his name alone we must go out against this Goliah. Though Satan be trode down <hi>under our feet,</hi> yet it is the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that doth tread him down, <hi>Romans,</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Stand before him, Appeal to him, Implore his Rebuke,</hi> and you are safe.</p>
            <p>One thing more the Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us from this Increpet, <hi>Not to despise Dominion, not to speak evil of Dignities,</hi> since

               <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel contending with the devil, durst not bring against him a railing <hi>Accusation,</hi> but said, <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee,</hi> Jude <hi>v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So is it noted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle as an evidence of <hi>walking after the flesh,</hi> of <hi>Uncleanness, Presumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Self-willedness, to despise Government,</hi> and not to be afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10, 11.

And yet the Princes in whose time they wrote, were Monsters of men for wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse. Christian Religion doth ratifie and bear up, it doth not despise or destroy Magistracy, but owneth it to be of God, as

            <p>Lastly, From the <hi>double Increpation</hi> we may draw, 1. <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Caution,</hi> not to think our selves secure at any time against the Assaults of Satan, He is like the flies, of which he hath his name, Impudent, and Importunate: When he is beaten off once, he will come on again, when he hath been foiled and rebuked once, he will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>a second Increpation:</hi> there is no truce to be held with him: when he was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely overmatched, yet he departed from Christ but <hi>for a season,</hi> Luke 4. 13.</p>
            <p>2. Matter of <hi>Comfort,</hi> That we should not despond under the Assaults of Satan. When

he <hi>multiplies Temptations,</hi> Christ will multiply <hi>Increpations;</hi> he will deliver a second <hi>time,</hi> Isa. 11. 11. In six and in seven troubles, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 19. From the Terrour by <hi>night,</hi> and the arrow by <hi>day, Psalm</hi> 91. 5. Christ is never less active and vigilant to help, then Satan is to hurt the Church. If where <hi>sin abounds, Grace</hi> doth <hi>superabound,</hi> and God doth multiply to <hi>pardon, Rom.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7. Much more when the rage of Satan abounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> succour shall superabound, and God will multiply to <hi>rebuke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Repetitions and Ingeminations in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, note 1 <hi>Certainty,</hi> as the dream of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was doubled, because of Gods fixed purpose concerning it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 32. Satan in all his oppositions against the building of Gods house shall <hi>certainly</hi> be disappointed. 2. <hi>Constancy, Thou shalt follow Justice, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> Deut. 16. 20. thou shalt never give over following it. The Lord will <hi>constantly</hi> and <hi>perpetually</hi> rebuke Satan in all his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults against <hi>Joshua</hi> and his fellowes. 3. <hi>Vehemency</hi> and Ardency of affection; it intends the sense, and makes it superlative, <hi>O Earth, Earth, Earth, a pathetical excitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!</hi> Jer. 22. 29. <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy;</hi> an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent expression of the infinite Holiness of God. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 3.

            <p>And since Christ doth thus certainly, constantly, earnestly, compleatly rebuke him, Let us keep our ground, oppose him with treble and unwearied prayers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. Resist him with stedfastness in the Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>pluckt out of the fire?</hi> Whence we learn,</p>

If he snatch out of the fire, he will bring unto his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: If he lay a foundation, he will bring forth the <hi>Head stone, Zach.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>He will perfect that which he hath wrought:</hi> If he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a good work, he will finish it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6.

            </p>
            <p>2. No <hi>condition is so sad</hi> or desperate out of which the Lord cannot <hi>rescue</hi> his people. He carries them <hi>through the fire,</hi> Zach. 13. 9. he preserves them <hi>in the fire,</hi> Dan. 3. 25, 27. He brings them <hi>through fire and water</hi> into a wealthy place, <hi>Psalme</hi> 66. 12. And this he doth <hi>suddenly,</hi> in the very nick of danger. In <hi>the Mount</hi> will the Lord be seen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 14. and <hi>hastily,</hi> laying merciful hold on us while we linger, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 16. He <hi>repenteth concerning his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone,</hi> Deut. 32. 36. and when they are as very <hi>out-casts, whom no man looketh after,</hi> Jerem. 30. 17. In our greatest perplexities and feares, if we could glorifie God by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and stand still without sinful doubts, disquiet murmurings, and diverting unto si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and perverse meanes, carnal Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and a refuge of lies, we might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably expect to see the salvation of God.</p>
            <p>3. This Brand God will not only save, but <hi>Honour,</hi> turn it into timber to build his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64473:18"/>
house withal. When the Lord rescueth a <hi>Great</hi> and a <hi>Good</hi> man, out of <hi>great troubles</hi> and temptations which were ready to consume him, usually he maketh him an Instrument of <hi>great and special service. Moses</hi> drawn out of the water, <hi>Joseph</hi> out of prison, <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the Lions den, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> from a world of persecutions and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Mordecai</hi> out of the pit of <hi>Hamans</hi> malice, and here <hi>Joshua</hi> out of the furnace of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and all afterwards <hi>eminent Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of great and honourable services for the Church of God.</p>
            <p>This is a worthy fruit of <hi>afflictions,</hi> when they season and prepare us to be <hi>beames in Gods House.</hi> As the greatest Timber hath the most seasoning. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to say, That Prayer, Meditation and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are excellent preparations for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
            <p>4. God can use weak, improbable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised Instruments unto great and excellent works. He that could make <hi>one Loafe</hi> of bread enough to feed thousands, can make <hi>one Brand</hi> Timber enough to build Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

            <p>But he can do no good at the hand to hinder that from working, he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce superstition and ignorance at that doore.

            <p>And all this not for our worthinesse, but for his <hi>own free grace,</hi> because <hi>he loved England,</hi> and chose it for a place to set his Name in.

            <p>1. To <hi>stand before the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to have our eye still upon him, to attend his Will, to listen to his Commands, to waite on his Worship, to aime at his Glory, to have our mouthes and hearts filled with the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his Name; who hath made us not as fire-brands pluckt out of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 11. but preserved from it.</p>
            <p>2. To put off our <hi>filthy garments,</hi> to bewaile the woful provocations of all orders of men amongst us, to make hast and be zealous to purge the house of God of those sad corruptions which have defaced it, and of that woful leaven of heresie, which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to sowre the whole lump.</p>
            <p>3. To get <hi>change of raiment,</hi> to be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the garments of praise, with the <hi>long white Robe</hi> of Christs righteousnesse, that our nakednesse be not discovered, to worship the Lord in the <hi>beauties of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. To walk in <hi>Gods wayes,</hi> and to keep <hi>his Charge,</hi> to be zealous and conscionable

in all our peculiar duties, to hold fast those wholesome truths which the Lord hath so long continued unto us. We know how busie <hi>forraigne Emissaries</hi> are, who are said to swarme among us, <hi>under a disguize,</hi> and in a mysterious way to infuse their doctrines into the mindes of credulous and seduced people. We see what hideous errours are every where broached; what contempt is poured out upon a learned and faithful <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi> What dishonour is cast upon <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi> as if it belonged not either to their <hi>power or duty</hi> to take care either of the truth or worship of God in their Territories: What <hi>immense and boundless licence</hi> men take to write, print, publish the most horrid opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions without check or controle: what <hi>sad effects</hi> this infinite liberty hath produced, in some <hi>Atheisme,</hi> in others <hi>Scepticisme,</hi> in others <hi>Apostacy,</hi> in others sad <hi>divisions, jealousies,</hi> animositites, scarce any face left of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian love, and holy communion which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore shined in the Assemblies of Professors.
