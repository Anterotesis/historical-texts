            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two Primates, or Arch-Bishops throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales, Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> both Metropolitans, <hi>York</hi> of <hi>England, Canterburie</hi> of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for so their Titles runne. To the Primate of <hi>Canterburie</hi> bee subordinate thirteene Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> and foure in <hi>Wales.</hi> But the Primate of <hi>Yorke</hi> hath at this time but two Suffragans in <hi>England</hi>: Namely, the Bishops of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liele,</hi> and <hi>Durhan</hi>: though hee had in King <hi>Lucius</hi> dayes, (who was the first Christian King of this our Nation) all the Prelacy of <hi>Scotland</hi> within his jurisdiction: <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> commanding all from this side the River <hi>Trent</hi> to the furthest limits of <hi>Wales</hi>; and <hi>York</hi> commanding all from beyond the <hi>Trent</hi> to the utmost bounds of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and hitherto, their prime Archiepiscopall Prerogatives may (not unproperly) be paralleld.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Henrie</hi> the first were potent two famous Prelates, <hi>Anselme</hi> of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> who durst contest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, and <hi>Girald</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who denyed to give place or any precedence at all to <hi>Anselme.

               </gap>ntly against the King his Soveraigne. that it cost him his life, being slaine in the Church as he was going to the Altar. But above all, the pride, tyrannie, and oppression of the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> in the reigne of <hi>Richard</hi> the first wants example, who was at once Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and Regent of the Land, and held in his hand at once the two Arch-Bishopricks of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Canterburie,</hi> who never rid abroad without a thousand horse for his guard to attend him, whom we may well parallel with the now great Cardinall of <hi>France</hi>: and need hee had of such a traine to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from being pulled to peeces by the oppressed Prelates, and people, equally extorting from the Clergie, and Laietie; yet he in the end, disguising himselfe in the shape of an old Woman, thinking to passe the Sea at Dover, where hee awayted on the Strand, a Pinace being hired for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he was discovered by a Sayler, and brought backe to abide a most severe sentence. <hi>Stephen Lancthon,</hi> Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> would not absolve the Land, being for sixe yeares together indicted by the Pope, till the King had payd unto him and the rest of the Bishops eighteene thousand Markes in gold; and thus I could continue the pride of the Prelacie, and their great Tyrannie through all the Kings Reignes: But I now fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promist parallel betwixt <hi>Thomas Wolsey,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and Cardinall, and <hi>William Laud,</hi> Doctor in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, and Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterburie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were both the sonnes of meane and Mechanick men, <hi>Wolsey</hi> of a Butcher, <hi>Laud</hi> of a Clothworker. The one borne in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> (threescore miles) the other in <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> thirtie miles distant from the City of <hi>London,</hi> both of them verie toward, forward, and pregnant grammar Schollars, and of singular apprehensions, as suddenly rising to the first forme in the Schoole. From thence, being yong, they were removed to the Vniversitie of <hi>Oxford, Wolsey</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into <hi>Maudlin</hi> Coledge, <hi>Laud</hi> into St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> and as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93388:3"/>
they were of different times, so they were of different sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet either of them well shapt according to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions: <hi>VVolsey</hi> was of a competent tallnesse, <hi>Laud</hi> of a lesse size, but might be called a prettie man, as the other a proper man: both of ingenious and acute aspects, as may appeare by this mans face, the others picture. In their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Colledges they were alike proficients, both as active of body as braine, serious at their private studies, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually frequent in the Schooles, eloquent Orators, either to write, speake, or dictate, daintie Disputants, well verst in Philosophy, both Morall, Physicall, and Metaphysicall, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the Mathematicks, and neither of them strangers to the Muses, both taking their degrees according to their time; and through the whole Academie, Sir <hi>Wolsey</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the boy-Batchelour, and Sir <hi>Laud</hi> the little Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p>The maine study that either of them fixt upon was Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie: for though they were conversant in all the other Arts and Sciences, yet that they solely profest, and by that came their future preferment; <hi>Wolsey</hi> being Batchelour was made Schoole-master of <hi>Maudlin</hi> Schoole in <hi>Oxford,</hi> but <hi>Laud</hi> came in time to be Master of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi>; therein transcending the other, as also in his degrees of Master of Art, Batchelour of Divinitie, and Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, when the other being suddenly cald from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorship of his schoole, to be resident upon a Countrie Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, he took no more Academicall degrees, than the first of Batchelour, and taking a strange affront by one Sir <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Paulet,</hi> a Knight in the Countrie, who set him in the Stocks, he indured likewise divers other disasters: but that disgrace he made the Knight pay dearely for, after he came to be invested in his dignitie. Briefely, they came both to stand in the Princes eye; but ere I proceed any further, let me give the courteous Reader this modest caveat, that he is to expect from me onely, a parallell of their Acts and Fortune., but no legend of their lives; it therefore briefely thus followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93388:3"/>Both these from Academicks comming to turne Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; <hi>Wolsey</hi> by his diligent waiting, came to insinuate himselfe into the brests of the Privie Counsellours. His first emploiment was in an Embassie to the Emperour, which was done by such fortunate, and almost incredible expedition, that by that only he grew into first grace with King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, father to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. <hi>Laud,</hi> by the mediation and meanes wrought by friends, grew first into favour with King <hi>Iames</hi> of sacred memory, father to our now royall Soveraigne King <hi>Charles.</hi> They were both at first the Kings Chaplaines, <hi>Woolseyes</hi> first preferment was to bee Deane of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> of which hee was after Bishop. <hi>Lauds</hi> first ecclesiasticall dignity was to be Deane of Saint <hi>Davids,</hi> of which he was after Bishop also. And both these Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Courtiers came also to be privie Counsellours. <hi>Woolsey</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths raigne, was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Tourney</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> soone after Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and before his full consecration (by the death of the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent) was ended, translated to the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>York,</hi> and all this within the compasse of a yeare; <hi>Laud,</hi> though not so suddainly, yet very speedily, was from St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> removed to <hi>London,</hi> and from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and this in the beginning of the Reigne of King <hi>Charles.</hi> Thus you see they were both Arch-Bishops, and as <hi>Laud</hi> was never Cardinall, so <hi>Woolsey</hi> was never <hi>Canterburie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in some things the Cardinall much exceeded <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie,</hi> as in holding all these Bishopricks at once, when the other was never possest but of one at one time. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall also held the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> of <hi>Worcester, Bath and W<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls,</hi> with a fourth, and two Abbat-ships in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendam</hi>: He had besides an Hat sent him from <hi>Rome,</hi> and made himselfe Cardinall, (that being before but <hi>Yorke</hi>) he might over-top <hi>Canterburie.</hi> But our <hi>William</hi> howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he might have the will, yet never attained to that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and howsoever hee could not compasse a Hat from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet made the meanes to have a consecrated Miter sent from <hi>Rome</hi>; which was so narrowly watcht, that it came not to his wearing. Moreover, the Cardinall extorted the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93388:4"/>
Chancellourship from <hi>Canterburie</hi>; but we finde not that <hi>Canterburie</hi> ever either trencht upon the jurisdiction, or tooke any thing away from the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Woolsey</hi> likewise farre out-went him in his numerous Traine, and the noblenesse thereof, being waited on not onely by the prime gentrie, but even of Earles, and Earles sonnes, who were listed in his family, and attended him at his Table, as also in his hospitalitie, his open house being made free for all commers, with the rare and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie state of his Palace, in which there were daily uprising and downe-lying a thousand persons, who were his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick servants. Moreover in his many entertainments of the K. with Masks, and mightie sumptuous banquets, his sumptuous buildings, the Prince-like state he carried in his forraigne Embassages, into <hi>France,</hi> to the Emperor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which he spent more Coyne in the service of his King, for the honour of his Countrie, and to uphold the credit of his Cardinals Cap, than would (for the time) have paid an Armie Royal. But I answer in behalfe of our <hi>Canterburie,</hi> that hee had never that meanes or imployment, by which hee might make so vain-glorious a show of his Pontificalitie, or a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall Dignitie: For unbounded mindes may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained within narrow limmits, and therefore the parallel may something hold in this too.</p>
            <p>They were also in their judiciall Courts equally tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; the one in the Chancerie, the other in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: both of them at the Councell boord, and in the Starre-chamber alike Draconically supercilious. Blood drawne from Doctor <hi>Bonners</hi> head by the fall of his Crosse presaged the Cardinals downfall. Blood drawne from the Eares of <hi>Burton, Prin,</hi> and <hi>Bastwick,</hi> was a prediction of <hi>Canterburies</hi> ruine; the first accidentall, the last premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and of purpose. The Cardinall would have expelled all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> out of the Realme, this our <hi>Canterburie</hi> would have exil'd both our Dutch and French Church out of the Kingdome. The Cardinall took maine delight in his foole <hi>Patch,</hi> and <hi>Canterburie</hi> tooke
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93388:4"/>
much delight in his partie coloured Cats. The Cardinall used for his agents <hi>Bonner</hi> and others, <hi>Canterburie</hi> for his Ministers, <hi>Duck, Lamb,</hi> and others. They both favoured the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and respected his Holinesse in it. The Cardinall did professe it publickly, the Arch-Bishop did reverence it privately. The Cardinalls ambition was to bee Pope, the Arch-Bishop strove to bee Patriarch, they both bid fairely for it, yet lost their aime; and farre easier it is for men to descend, than to ascend.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall (as I have said) was very ambitious; the Arch-Bishop was likewise of the same minde, though bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moulded, and of a more politick braine, having a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se and more reserved judgement in all his observations, and more fluent in his deliverie. The Cardinall was verie curious in his attire, and ornament of his body, and took great delight in his traine, and other his servants for their rich aparrell; the Arch-Bishop his attire was neat and rich, but not so gaudie as the Cardinals was, yet tooke as much felicitie in his Gentlemens rich aparrell, especially those that waited on his person, as ever the Cardinall did, though other men paid for them: and if all men had their owne, and every bird her Feather, some of them would bee as bare as those that professe themselves to bee of the Sect of the <hi>Adamists</hi>: To speake truth, the Arch-Bishops men were all given to covetousnesse and wantonnesse; that I never heard of was in the Cardinals men.</p>
            <p>As the Cardinall was sumptuous in his buildings, as that of <hi>White Hall, Hampton Court, &amp;c.</hi> as also in laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of two famous Coledges, the one at <hi>Ipswich,</hi> where he was borne, the other at <hi>Oxford</hi> where he had his bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: so Christ-Church which he left unfinished, <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> hath since repaired; and wherein he hath come short of him in building, though he hath bestowed much on St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Coledge, yet he hath out-gone him in his bountie of brave voluminous Books, being fourescore in number, late sent to the Bodleian or Universitie Librarie: Further, as the Cardinall was Chancelour of <hi>England,</hi> so <hi>Canterburie</hi> was Chancellour of <hi>Oxford</hi>: And as the Cardinall by pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

            <p>I have paralleld them in their dignities: I will conclude with a word or two concerning their downe-falls. The Cardinall fell into the displeasure of his King, <hi>Canterburie</hi> into an extreame hatred of the Commons: both were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested of high Treason, the Cardinall by Processe, <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> by Parliament. The Cardinall at <hi>Keywood</hi> Castle neare <hi>Yorke, Canterburie</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> neare <hi>London</hi>; both their falls were speedy and suddaine: The Cardinall sate as this day in the high Court of <hi>Chancerie,</hi> and within two dayes after was confined to his house; <hi>Canterburie</hi> as this day sate at the Counsell-boord, and in the upper house of Parliament, and the same day committed to the blacke Rod, and from thence to the Tower: The Cardinall dyed at <hi>Leicester</hi> some say of a Flux; <hi>Canterburie</hi> remaines still in the Tower, onely sick of a fever. <hi>Vanitas vanitatum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia vanitas.</hi>
