            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he writes the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> in which the paſſage is, to which

a purpoſe or promiſe of God makes not a viſible

ſo neither doth it now by vertue of ſuch viſibility
without inſtitution. If baptiſme be a new Teſtament
Ordinance and a mere poſitive rite no good proofe
can be made for it, but from precept or practiſe in

on my ſelfe, I conceive my ſelfe neceſſitated

               <p>
                  <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, play the
Divells part in accuſing their own Children and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them out of the Church and Covenant of Chriſt, and
affirming them to be no Diſciples, no ſervants of God,
nor holy as ſeparated to him; when God ſaith the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
Levit. 25. 41. 42. Deut. 29. 10. 11. 12. &amp;c. Acts 15.
10. 1 Cor. 7. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in
the plurall, yet the paſſage it ſelfe, and the circumſtances of
it, well known in theſe partes, evidence it to be directed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſolely, or mainly againſt my ſelfe. The terme [<hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>]
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117829:6"/>
I own not, any more, then my Infant ſprinkling, The
<hi>Faith</hi> I owne, but not the <hi>Ceremony</hi> They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
called <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> who have beene Baptized
after their own profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt, though they
had water <hi>ſprinkled</hi> or <hi>poured</hi> on their faces by an <hi>Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
Prieſt</hi> when they were Infants. <hi>Sprinkling</hi> is not
<hi>Baptizing,</hi> nor <hi>Infants</hi> the Subjects of the Baptiſme of
Water appointed by Chriſt, or practiſed by the Apoſtles.
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> offered to prove, In the beginning of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
after mentioned, that <hi>dipping in cold water is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Adultery.</hi> It ſeems he dare undertake to prove,
<hi>the ſnow black,</hi> he is ſo confident of his nimble wit, and
ready tongue. Thouſands in the primitive times, (in which
Baptizing was by dipping until <hi>Hieroms</hi> time at leaſt in the
4th. <hi>Century</hi>) Thouſands in theſe dayes are ſo baptized
without <hi>murder</hi> or <hi>adultery.</hi> And therefore Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi>
aſſertion is contrary to ſenſe and experience. He may do
much I believe, but will never be able to prove <hi>Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi>
or <hi>ſprinkling</hi> inſtead of it, to be the duty ordained
by Chriſt, <hi>Math. 28. 19. Mark.</hi> 16. 16. The ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
under Baptiſme about <hi>London</hi> diſclaime the Title of
Anabaptiſts, in the Preface to their Confeſſion of faith,
under that terme all the Pelagian and Arminian errours, all
thoſe peſtilent errours of <hi>Community of Goods, denying
civill Magiſtracy, lawfullneſſe of taking an Oath</hi> to end
ſtrife and ſundry other are charged on them, that deny <hi>Infant
Baptiſme,</hi> I may well ſay] in a <hi>Diveliſh</hi> manner, by many
Preachers; to make them odious to the people; that they
might drive them away out of the Land; if not deſtroy
them: and therefore if Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who knowes how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
the terme is, had minded equity or peace he had choſen
rather to ſtile us <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> then <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> But
what ſayes he of us? <hi>Anabaptiſts play the Devils part in
accuſing their own Children.</hi> A moſt <hi>virulent</hi> charge,
which ſhews Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> kept no moderation of ſpirit, nor
heeded what he wrote. The <hi>Devils</hi> part in accuſing, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117829:6"/>
by himſelfe, or his Inſtruments, before God, or before
men, or in their own conſcience. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may as ſoone
bring water out of a pumice ſtone, as prove <hi>we do,</hi> any of
theſe wayes, <hi>play the Devills part.</hi> But perhaps it will be
ſaid <hi>we accuſe them</hi> however. To <hi>accuſe,</hi> is to <hi>charge
with a fault</hi> or crime. I know <hi>no fault</hi> or crime <hi>we charge
our Children with</hi> meaning onr infant Children, but their
birth ſin; of which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath been heard to charge
them, as deep as any of us. But it is unnaturall in us, to
accuſe our own <hi>Children</hi> perhaps. I bleſſe God he hath
given me Children, to whom I bear a naturall affection, as
tender as another. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meane, denying <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
to belong to them in infancy,</hi> to be the <hi>playing the
Devils part in accuſing them,</hi> he muſt give me leave to
think, that he himſelfe playes the <hi>Devills part</hi> in aſſerting,
that it belongs to them till he prove it appointed by Chriſt,
or uſed by his Apoſtles (which I expect to be done by him,
<hi>ad Graecas Calendas</hi>) and ſo much the rather do I think he
playes the <hi>Devills part</hi> therein, becauſe experience proves,
that <hi>Thouſands</hi> are hardned in carnal preſumption, to their
perdition by conceiving their Infant Baptiſme to make them
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſo heires of heaven.</p>

of Chriſt is either viſible or inviſible: the Covenant of

according to the conſtitution of the viſible Church of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
Infants are not viſible Church Members and I ſtill
aſſert it. For <hi>the viſible Church</hi> of Chriſtians is <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of believers</hi> art. 19 of the Church of England; and
therefore till a perſon is a believer he is not a viſible Church
member according to the frame of the Chriſtian Church,
which is not a whole Nation joyned together in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
by the civill Magiſtrate, as the Jewiſh Church was,
but a company of believers made ſuch by the preaching of
the Goſpel. And this definition of the viſible Church was
formerly received among Proteſtants without the addition
which the Aſſembly lately put to it in their <hi>Confeſſion of

in the diſputation turning himſelfe to the people told them
was to contradict the Text expreſſely, and he ſought to
ſuggeſt to them as if it were my impudence, and ſaid; that if
it the Papiſts had as plaine expreſs Scripture as <hi>Deut.</hi>
29. 12. was to prove that all even little ones did enter into

v. 14. [you] are diſtinguiſhed from <hi>them that ſtand
there before the Lord</hi> &amp;c. v. 12. [thou] only is ſaid to
enter into Covenant, and therefore though <hi>all</hi> v. 10. are
ſaid to ſtand, yet it is not without ſome likely hood that
[thou] v. 12. notes only ſome that entred into Covenant in
the behalfe of the reſt. And if the paſſing into Covenant
were as <hi>Piſcator</hi> in his <hi>Scholie, that thou mayeſt paſſe

ſome inſtead of the reſt. 2. But were it granted that the
little ones are ſaid to enter into Covenant, yet this doth not
prove them to be viſible members. For. v. 15. it is ſaid
that <hi>Moſes made that Covenant and Oath with him

by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the diſpute, that this entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

them. But ſuch an entring into Covenant doth not make a
viable Church member in the Chriſtian Church, however it
did in the Jewiſh Church, there being a different Church

that he may be a God to them, yet this doth not prove the
Covenant to be a pure Goſpel Covenant, not including pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
benefits to the Jewiſh Nation: For there is a plaine
reſtriction in the words, <hi>as he hath ſaid unto thee, and as
he hath ſworne unto thy Fathers to Abraham, to Iſaac,

in <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was proper only to them as <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
which may be proved out of many paſſages following, as
<hi>Deut, 29, 21. 28. Deut.</hi> 30. 1. 4. 5. 9, &amp;c. Yea <hi>Ainſworth</hi>

<hi>the putting the yoak on the necks of the Diſciples,</hi> is the
ſame with that which is mentioned v. 1. <hi>they taught the

this Text to prove Infants diſciples is by conceiving the
yoak to note barely and preciſely the cutting off a little skin:
but to ſay <hi>it is circumciſion as obliging to Moſes Law</hi> is
to ſay the ſamewhich I ſay that it is not circumciſion as acted,
but as taught, ſith the Doctrin or command obliged to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
Law, not the bare cutting away the little skin. And yet
circumciſion is in that councel taken away, ſith he that by
teaching, ſhewes the command to ceaſe, doth thereby take
away the practiſe, as with us they that deny Ordinances do
binddo take away the uſe of them yet further if it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that the yoak were the taking away of the
little skin the terme Diſciples would not neceſſarily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Infants, though the falſe Teachers aimes were alſo to
have Infants circumciſed, yet they would firſt have the Bre-s<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren

only them, although Infants ſhould be by that means circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,

it granted that the terme [<hi>Diſcples</hi>] did note Infants, yet
it could note no other then males according to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi>

therefore femall Infants ſhould not be thence proved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

I Anſwer, what others whom he calls <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> affirme
in this thing, I am not ingaged to inquire: I beleeve if Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> were required to ſet down who thoſe <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:117829:11"/>
are, and where they affirme it, he would be hard put to it
to free himſelfe from overlaſhing. But I am aſſured Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
wrote this paſſage in haſt, and inconſideratly not well
weighing what he ſaid, and that however he name <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi>
in the plurall, yet his only inſtance would be my
ſelfe affirming in the diſputation after mentioned. But the
thing I affirmed in the diſputation was not ſo rawly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth, I ſaid this, that every child of a
believer is not, becauſe a believers child holy as ſeparated to
God, nor doth holy 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. ſignifie as much as ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God. To conceive of which it is to be noted that a
perſon may be ſaid to be ſeparated to God, either in Gods
purpoſe by his election, or in promiſe by his Covenant, or in
his preſent condition either by Gods calling to the knowledge
of Chriſt, or ſpeciall employment for God, or by his owne
profeſſion, or by vow of parents, or by ſome ſpeciall gift or
priviledge or if there be any other way whereby a perſon may
be ſaid to be ſeparated to God.</p>
               <p>I never affirmed that none of theſe wayes my children, or
other believers children are holy as ſeparated to God: I
only ſaid that every child of a believer is not becauſe a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

               <p>If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had told me in what manner he meant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
children to be holy as ſeparated to God, I ſhould
have told him in the diſputation more fully what I affirme
or deny in this thing. But all that were Auditors of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

me, when I did but deſire him to explaine the terme of
viſible Church member, and to ſhew by what note he meant
ſome Infants were viſible Church-members, ſaying <hi>it was
to catechize him,</hi> and when <hi>I</hi> told him it was neceſſary the
people ſhould be ſatisfied, he told me, <hi>his comming was
to diſpute with mee, not to ſatisfie them.</hi> and all along
the diſpute how magiſterially, ſcornfully, and unbrotherly he
carried himſelfe, not as one that minded clearing of truth,
but to diminiſh my eſteem, and to gain an opinion to himſelf
as having the better <hi>I</hi> think the Auditors will teſtiſie; and
for this reaſon <hi>I</hi> obtained not from him to ſhew in what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117829:11"/>
manner, and by what means he aſſerted <hi>every believers
infant to be holy as ſeparated to God,</hi> ſo that in fine the
diſpute was only about the meaning of the terme [<hi>holy</hi>] 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. whether it ſignifie a ſtate of ſeparation to God
as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> conceived, or legitimation as <hi>I</hi> conceived.
In which buſineſſe though <hi>I</hi> ſhould be miſtaken in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>
                  <hi>That which Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>ſaid of the meaning of this Text
was to this effect.</hi> Holineſſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. ſignifies a
ſtate of ſeparation to God: for ſo the word is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken neare 600. times, and no where for legitimate.
And the Apoſtles meaning is, the unbelieving wife is
ſanctified to the husband, that is to his uſe, paſſively,
though not actively, remotely, though not immediatly, as
it is ſaid 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. every creature is ſanctified by the
word of God and prayer, and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. to the pure all
things are pure, elſe were your children uncleane, that
is were it not the unbelieving wife were ſanctified thus
to the beleevers uſe, your children, the infant children
of you believers; having unbelieving wives were unclean,
that is not ſeparated to God, but now, that is this being
determined that the unbelieving wife is thus ſanctified
to the believing Husbands uſe your children, that is the
children of you believing Corinthians, who have unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
wives are holy, that is are ſeparated to God. <hi>The
ſame is the ſenſe</hi> mutat is mutandis <hi>of that which is ſaid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117829:12"/>
concerning the believing wife and unbelieving Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which J ſay: Holines it is true notes a ſtate of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God: and yet it is apparent that 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. 4.
7. it ſignifies barely chaſtity of the body without fornication,
to which ſenſe the uſe of [<hi>holy</hi>] for [legitimate] is neare. And
when holy notes a ſtate of ſeparation to God, that ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is many wayes, as by election, Covenant, calling vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
offering, anointing, prayer, Ordinance, apparition &amp;c.
and to many purpoſes or uſes as to glorifie God, do ſervice at
the Temple, execute judgement &amp;c. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would
diſtinctly tell me, what way, and to what uſe he would have
the children of believers holy as ſeparated to God in the
Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. J conceive he would not find one of all
his 600. places, in which it is taken juſt in his ſenſe, ſo as
that it may be verified of the infants he meanes. Jt is true
God ſaith, the Corinthians <hi>children were holy,</hi> but he doth
not ſay they were <hi>holy as ſeparated to God</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
would have it. Jn what ſenſe it is there taken, J conceive can
be gathered no way but by analyſing the Apoſtles words and
finding out of what holineſſe his ſpeech can be true, which
J have already in my Examen of Mr. <hi>Marſhalls</hi> ſermon
and my <hi>Apology</hi> and <hi>poſt ſcript</hi> proved to be only legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and may yet more fully prove in my <hi>review</hi> of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about infant-baptiſme if ever it be publiſhed, againſt
all that Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Geree,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cobbet,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Church</hi> or any other <hi>I</hi> have met with reply to my
<hi>examen:</hi> Nor is it unuſuall with interpreters to take a word
in a ſenſe in which it is uſed no where elſe, when the matter'
ſcope, and other circumſtances of the Text lead to that ſenſe
as in that Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which every where
elſe ſignifies power or authority there confeſſedly ſignifies a
veile, and the phraſe of <hi>due benevolence</hi> is uſed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
3. in a ſenſe in which it is uſed no where elſe, and the like
may be ſaid of the word [<hi>forme] Phil.</hi> 1. 6, of the word
[<hi>Church] Math.</hi> 18. 17. and many more. As for Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
expoſition I conceive it not right. 1 Becauſe if the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
be underſtood as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it in that
ſenſe the unbeliever is ſaid to be ſanctified only to the true
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117829:12"/>
real believer before God, who by prayer doth ſanctifie the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party to his or her uſe, for of ſuch only it is true, <hi>to
them every thing is ſanctified by Prayer,</hi> ſith they only can
pray, and to them <hi>only all things are pure,</hi> not to them,
<hi>who though they profeſſe they know God, yet in works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him</hi> Tit 1. 16. This then is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe, <hi>For
the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified to the uſe of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
wife, who is truly and really a believer before
God, and not only by profeſſion before men, unto whom by
vertue of her true faith and prayer her Husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to her uſe and pure to her.</hi> But if this were the ſenſe
then the reaſon of the Apoſtle had reached only to the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of ſuch to live with their unbelieving yoke-fellowes
the reſt were not to continue with them, becauſe they were
not ſanctified to them, whereas the doubt was concerning
any viſible believer or brother, and accordingly the Apoſtles
reſolution. Beſides ſuppoſing any true reall believers doubted
of the truth of their owne faith, they would be deterred by
the Apoſtles reaſon ſo underſtood from living with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
yok-fellowes as being not ſanctified to them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the Apoſtle had reſolved them of the lawfullneſſe of
their continuing together by a reaſon taken from a thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to God, and their own conſcience, whereas his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was to reſolve all concerning the lawfullneſſe of living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
with their yoke-fellowes in diſparity of Religion by
a reaſon taken from a thing obvious to them all. 2. Mr.
<hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe ſuppoſeth that the cauſe of the ſanctification of
the unbeliever is the faith of the believer, but if ſo then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the Apoſtles would have expreſſed it thus [<hi>to or in the
believing wife or husband</hi>] whereas it is only ſaid [<hi>in or to
the husbnnd or wife</hi>] without adding the terme [<hi>believing</hi>]
which manifeſtly ſhews the Apoſtle placed not the <hi>Emphaſis</hi>
in it. For who will leave out the word in which the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi>
is put and not rather expreſſe it remarkably? 3. If the
ſenſe be as Mr. <hi>Baxttr</hi> would have it, then this propoſition
is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being included in the Apoſtles reaſoning: <hi>The
Children whereof one of the Parents is not a reall true
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117829:13"/>
believer before God are none of them holy as ſeparated to
God.</hi> But it is falſe, take the ſeparation to God what way
and to what uſe he will, the child of profeſſed unbelievers,
much more the child of profeſſed believers, though not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch before God may be, and perhaps is ſeparated to
God. Now that theſe Propoſitions [<hi>All the Children
whereof one parent is not ſanctified to the other are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
none of the children whereof one of the Parents is
not ſanctified to the other are cleane or holy</hi>] are included
in the Apoſtles conſequence is confeſſed by <hi>Chamier,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Blake</hi> and others as I ſhew in my <hi>Examen, Poſtſcript</hi> and
other writings, nor do I know any that deny it, and if they
ſhould it might eaſily be evinced to any that is acquainted
with the rules of reaſoniug, and therefore according to Mr.
<hi>Baxters</hi> explication, the Apoſtle muſt aſſert [<hi>that all the
Children whereof one of the Parents is not ſanctified to
the others uſe, being a true reall believer before God are
unclean, none holy as ſeparated to God,</hi>] which being mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>falſe
Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> expoſition is apparently erroneous.</p>
               <p>Laſtly if his ſenſe were allowed him, then the baptizing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Infant but ſuch whereof one of the next parents is a reall
believer before God would be unlawfull, for ſuch only are
holy in his ſenſe, and the reſt uncleane: But it being knowne
only to God that one of the Parents is a true reall believer
before God, it will follow no Miniſters ought to baptize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
infant at all without revelation from God, that one of the
Parents is a true real believer, otherwiſe we ſhall baptize the
uncleane, or unholy who have not a right to be baptized.
To tel, us as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did in private conference with mee,
that by a judgement of Charity, a profeſſed believer is to be
taken to be a reall believer, I anſwer be it granted, yet that
is not ſufficient to juſtifie the baptizing the child of ſuch a one
according to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> expoſition, ſith as he expounds
the Apoſtle it is requiſite that the parent be a true believer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, or elſe the child is uncleane, that is in his ſenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117829:13"/>
Beſides the judgement of Charity is not that by which
perſons are to proceede in Baptizing, but the certaine
judgement of Verity ariſing from Miniſteriall Skill and
Prudence, to know what is the true Profeſſion, and from
ſenſe, that the Perſon to be Baptized maketh ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Appendix to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſmes
Pag. 58. dare not you to diſpence Gods Seales
upon your conjectures of the probability or improbability of
Mens ſincerity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe things being true, though I ſhould be miſtaken
in my ſenſe, yet Mr.</hi> Baxters <hi>arguments were anſwered:
yet</hi> ex abundanti <hi>I ſhall anſwer Mr.</hi> Baxters <hi>Exceptions
againſt my interpretation, which according to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and the Notes which I could procure of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
between us were theſe.</hi> The ſenſe is not right
which thus interpreteth the Apostles Speech. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Wife is ſanctified to the Husband, that is, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of lawfull uſe of Marriage is as if he were Sanctified;
elſe were your Children uncleane, that is baſtards, but now
they are holy, that is legitimate. For 1. The word Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſignifies ſomewhat more then lawfully uſed. Pagans
actions may be ſaid to be lawfull, not Sanctified. 2. It is
no good conſequence, your Marriage continues lawfull in
the uſe in oppoſition to Fornication; therefore you may
dwell together lawfully in oppoſition to Piety. 3. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is taken a notiori: but it could not be more known
to them that their Children were legitimate, then that
their Marriage was lawfull. 4. If it were better known
that their Children were legitimate then that their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
were lawfull, becauſe of the change of Religion, then
they ſhould doubt of their Childrens legitimation, who
were borne ſince their converſion, and not of thoſe that were
borne before, which were an irrationall Fancy.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer. 1. It is not ſaid the Unbelievers
action is ſanctified, but the Unbeliever, and Unbelieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Medes</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Gods Sanctified ones,</hi> Iſai. 14 3.
But be the word taken ſo as not to be applied to a <hi>Pagan</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:117829:14"/>
in its proper acception, yet the ſence I give alters not
the uſuall ſenſe, onely it ſuppoſeth the meaning of the
word to be taken with ſome diminution by a Catachreſis,
or acytology, that is abuſe or impropriety of ſpeech, which
is a very frequent thing, as 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 2. were Baptized,
that is, quaſi baptizati ſunt</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> rightly notes
on that place) <hi>they were as if they had been baptized:</hi>
the Cloud and Sea were to them as baptiſme to us. And ſo
here the unbelieving Husband hath been Sanctified: that
is, to his Wife in reſpect of the uſe of him, as if he had
been Sanctified: which is a plaine and eaſie Expoſition.
2. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> doubted of the lawfulneſſe of living
with the Unbelieving yokefellow, by reaſon of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs
of the Unbeliever, which they queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it did not neceſſitate a divorce or departure, though
they doubted not of their Childrens legitimation, either
borne afore or after their converſion, they yet living
with the Unbeliever. The Apoſtles anſwer I conceive
to be thus. You may lawfully continue together not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the unbelief of the yokefellow? for he being
a Husband though an Unbeliever is, as if he were San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
in reſpect of Marriage uſe, elſe were your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
you have borne in this eſtate uncleane, that is ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
which you do not conceive. Though the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the doubt were the Impiety of the one party, yet
the doubt was onely whether divorce were neceſſary;
which is rightly anſwered by telling them they might
lawfully continue in Marriage uſe. As in like caſe if a
Papiſt doubt whether ſhe muſt not be divorced from her
<hi>Lutheran</hi> Husband lately converted to it, the anſwer is
right by telling her no, for the Marriage relation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
though her Husband be an Heretique; elſe ſhould
her Children borne ſince he was made a <hi>Lutheran</hi> be ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
of which ſhe doubts not. 3. It might be more
known to them that their Children were legitimate, then
that living with the Unbeliever continued lawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was not ſuch occaſion of doubt concerning
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117829:14"/>
the Children, as of the Profeſſed Unbeliever, and for ſome
other reaſons, perhaps through meere incogitancy of the
connexion, between the unlawfulneſſe of their living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and the illegitimation of their Children, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. and is incident to men, and
women as rationall as they. 4. According to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
I give, there is no intimation of doubt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Childrens legitimacy, either borne before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
converſion; nor needs there be to make good the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
I give. As for [<hi>elſe were your Children unclean</hi>]
the conſequence of the Apoſtle might be good in my ſenſe
if it be meant either of the Children borne before, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
converſion of the one party; it is true of either, that if
the Unbelieving husband were not as if he had been ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to his Wife, in reſpect of lawfull conjugall uſe, their
Children were illegitimate, but I think upon mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
it is the moſt cleer Expoſition to underſtand
it of thoſe borne ſince the converſion of one Party. Upon
this Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I preſume the Reader will
perceive my Expoſition no irrationall fancy, which is the
interpretation of <hi>Ambroſe, Hierome, Anſelme, Aquinas,
Melanchthon, Camerarius, Oſiander, Gagnaeus, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,
Suarez, Mariana,</hi> and many others, who have
been conceived men able to diſcerne between reaſon and
irrationall fancies as actuely as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of his abilities as excellent. However ſtill the
Chriſtian that would not delude his conſcience, me thinks
ſhould feare to goe againſt the plaine Inſtitution of
Chriſt, and Practiſe of the Apoſtles, and firſt Ages of the
Church; in which Infant-baptiſme was neither appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nor Practiſed, upon ſuch uncertaine Expoſitions and
Conſequences, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath brought, and I may
now freely ſay however they ſeemed ſomewhat at the
firſt hearing, yet now upon exact conſideration, for the
conſequences from his three firſt Scriptures here brought
frivolous, and I doubt urged more like a Sophiſter then
a lover of truth. The reſt of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Paſſage hath
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117829:15"/>
with it a manifeſt tincture of reviling, little of reaſon:
yet becauſe ſuch ſpeeches too eaſily take with People,

break with Me, and to renounce Me as one unfit for
communion with him, then any action I ever did ſhewed
the like diſpoſition in Me towards him, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayth
<hi>I cannot digreſſe to fortifie you against theſe Sects.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
a Diſcourſe againſt thoſe Sects, as he calls them, had
been a Digreſſion from the ſubject of his Treatiſe, but not
from the matter of his Epiſtle, and the fifth Direction he
gives to his Neighbours of <hi>Kederminſter.</hi> But why can
he not digreſſe? I can gheſſe no other reaſon but his haſte:
willing he was in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> before that Book which was
likely to ſell, to blaſt my reputation by Name, and other
diſſenters from him without naming them; whether to
eaſe his ſtomack or to what other end he knowes beſt,
though he little conſidered what he wrote. He goes on:
<hi>you have ſeen God ſpeake againſt them by judgements from
Heaven; what were the two monſters in New England, but
miracles?</hi> I Anſwer, what judgements from heaven by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
God ſpak againſt the Sects he mentions, they had ſeen, I
could never yet learn of his Neighbours, though I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
very near them, have often converſed with them, and
had them my auditors till (I imagin) M. <hi>Baxters</hi> oppoſition
to Me took them off. Nor doe I think if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
were put to name the judgements by which God ſpake
from Heaven againſt the Sects he names, would he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any other then the two Monſters in <hi>New England,</hi>
which I am confident neither Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> nor any of his
<hi>Neighbours of Kederminſter</hi> ſaw. Theſe two Monſters
are mentioned in the Margin of his book <hi>Pag.</hi> 232. to be
<hi>the moſt hideous monſtrous births of Miſtris</hi> Hutchinſon,
<hi>and Miſtris</hi> Dier. In Mr. <hi>Welds ſtory of the Antinomians;</hi>
I finde mention in the <hi>Preface of thirty monſtrous births
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117829:16"/>
or thereabouts brought forth by Miſtris</hi> Hutchinſon <hi>at
once; ſome of them bigger, ſome of them leſſer, ſome of one
ſhape ſome of another, few of any perfect ſhape, none at all
of them (ſo far as he could learne) of humane ſhape. And
of Miſtris</hi> Dyer <hi>that ſhe brought forth her birth of a woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
child, a Fiſh, a beaſt, and a foule, all woven together
in one, and without an head, which he deſcribes pag.</hi> 44. of
his <hi>Story.</hi> The truth of the Relation I queſtion not: but
that they were Miracles as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> takes the word
[<hi>Miracle</hi>] in his ſecond part, Ch. 4. Sect. 1. &amp;c. in which
he diſtinguiſheth between <hi>Wonders and Miracles,</hi> I think
cannot be made good. If we finde not the like ſtory in
every point, yet we reade of many monſtrous births, as
that of the Earle of <hi>Hollands</hi> daughter and many other:
yet neither Divines, nor Philoſophers, nor Phyſicians
that I know do reckon them among Miracles. Nor do I
think it a very ſafe way to take ſuch Accidents as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for, or againſt any Tenet. <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi>
deſcribing Wiltſhire, makes mention of a Synod in <hi>Calne,</hi>
whereat upon the falling of the roome, and preſervation
of <hi>Dunſtan</hi> it was judged, that God had determined for
Monkery. Many more ſuch ſtrange accidents doe both
Heathen, and Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories mention for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of ſuperſtition and errors, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
himſelf takes notice of Pag. 240. by which People have
been lead to errors. And therefore I think Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth
ill to direct his Neigbhours of <hi>Kederminſter,</hi> to ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
to fortifie them againſt Sects. And I have ever
judged it a very unſafe, and I thinke an evill courſe that
many Preachers have taken to affright their People with
relations of accidents, befalling Men whom they judge
erroneous, thereby to deter them from ſo much as exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
their Tenet; as being contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>trying all things, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 5. 21. and <hi>directing to</hi>
another way of diſcerning between truth and error, then
the holy Scripture contrary to <hi>John 5. 39. Mark.</hi> 12. 24.
2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 20. &amp;c. which is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117829:16"/>
derogatory to the Scriptures uſe, and directing them by
judgements from heaven to judge of Doctrines, of which
many Relations are not true, as I am ſure for one inſtance
in the <hi>relations of Gods Judgement upon Sabbath break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
to which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> referrs Pag. 230. concerning
Mr. <hi>Powle</hi> of <hi>Lemſter</hi> in my time of being there, and not
far off from the place when it happened, in the relation
of which there are ſundry miſtakes and untruths, nor did
the circumſtances ſhew the accident to be Gods Voyce,
to that end the compiler of that Book applies it. But if the
relations of the accidents be true, yet it is uncertaine
whether the Devill do not ſpeak by them, untill it appear
firſt that the Tenet they are applied to confirme be of
God, which may be known by the Scriptures without
relying on ſuch accidents. And it is well known that
Papiſts uſe them as well as the Orthodox, and make them
a note of their Church and Doctrine, which is rejected
by Proteſtants. But were it granted a ſafe way to judge
of Doctrines by ſuch judgements of God; yet in all <hi>the
ſtory of Mr. Weld</hi> forementioned, I finde not a word of
Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> or Miſtris <hi>Dyer,</hi> or any other of theſe
whoſe errors are taken to be condemned by thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
as holding Antipaedobaptiſme. I finde Miſtris
<hi>Dyer</hi> and her Husband to have been taken for <hi>Familiſts,</hi>
Pag. 44. Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> to have held 29 errors, Pag.
60. but none of them againſt Infant baptiſme. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
himſelf in the Margin of his book Pag. 232. <hi>bids aske them
in New England, whether they were not convincing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
againſt their Antinomian Antiſcripturall hereſies.</hi>
Why then doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tell his Neigbours of theſe
judgements ſpeaking againſt the Sects he mentions inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
when it was but againſt one of them in his own
conſtruction, and place his ſpeech where it might be, and
is commonly taken, and was alledged upon Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi>
credit in Pulpit, in the Pariſh in which I taught, as ſpoken
againſt Antipaedobaptiſts, but that it is moſt likely Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> in that paſſage chiefly intended to make Me in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117829:17"/>
particular, and other oppoſers of Infant-baptiſme odious,
and the truth we hold, though he did thereby miſleade
Men, for which the Lord forgive Him. Yet I will adde
thus much, that I finde among the 82 errors condemned
in <hi>New England,</hi> in that ſtory the 21 to be this. <hi>To be
juſtified by Faith is to be juſtified by Workes:</hi> which how
near it is to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Doctrine in his <hi>Aphoriſms of
juſtification,</hi> Theſ. 20. 70. 72, 73, 74, 75, 76. in this Treatiſe

to all Goſpell Precepts,</hi> which he teacheth in his <hi>Aphoriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi>
Theſ. 76. and expounds <hi>James</hi> 2. 24. of juſtification
before God by works in a proper ſenſe, and thoſe were

we ſay he means by Fruit, their falſ Doctrine; that were but
idem per idem. Hereticks may ſeem holy for a little while,
but at laſt all falſe Doctrines likely end in wicked lives.
Where hath there been known a Society of Anabaptiſts, ſince
the World firſt knew them that have not proved wicked?
How many of theſe or Antinomians, &amp;c. have you known,
who have not proved palpably guilty of lying, perfidivuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Interpreters differ about the fruits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 16.
ſome by <hi>Fruits</hi> underſtand evill life, ſome falſe doctrine,
ſome both, ſome adde their want of calling: I for my
part think both an evill life and a falſe Doctrine do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
falſe Prophets, but chiefly their falſe Doctrine, and
ſo do <hi>Piſcator, Pareus, Perkins,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe that ſeemes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117829:17"/>
to be Gods note <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 2. And in reaſon ſith a falſe Prophet
is ſo named from his falſe Doctrine, the falſe-hood of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
beſt diſcovers that he is a falſe Prophet. As for evill life by
it ſelf, (which M. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems to hold) it cannot be the note
whereby to know a falſe Prophet as ſuch, both becauſe evill
Men may be true Prophets, as <hi>Judas</hi> for example, who was a
true Apoſtle, yet a Theif, and on the other ſide Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<hi>Heretikes may ſeem holy for a little while,</hi> and therefore
during that time they cannot be known by their evill life: yea,
many erroneous Perſons have continued in appearance, holy to
their end. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> dares ſay no more but that <hi>all falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
likely end in wicked lives. Auguſtin</hi> commends <hi>Pelagius</hi>
Epiſt. 120. <hi>Bertius Arminius;</hi> yea many of thoſe who have bin
reputed Heretiques, have been eminent for holineſſe in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
even to their end, and thereby have prevailed. And indeed
it is the common Tenent of Proteſtant Divines, anſwering
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Papiſts,<note place="margin">See Field of the Church 3. Book Ch. 52. <hi>Morton Apol.</hi> Cath part. 1. l. 2. c. 6. <hi>Alſted ſupplem. Cham. de Eccleſ.</hi> l. 2. c. 13 Sect 3.</note> who deny Profeſſion of the true
Faith to be a note of the true Church, and among other notes
make the holineſſe of their Teachers one note, that true Faith
is a ſufficient note of a viſible Church and true Teacher, and that
holineſſe of life is not the note of a true Prophet, or the want
of it of a falſe Prophet. If it were it would follow no true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
who are vitious in life, nor to be heard, nor to be owned
as Paſtors. And therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> unadviſedly perhaps in
heate, or ſpleen, directs his Neighbours to know falſe Prophets
by this note, which would if retorted prove Presbyterians,
Heretiques as well as Anabaptiſts. But to ſay <hi>by their falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
yee ſhall know falſe Prophets, were idem per idem,
the ſame by the ſame.</hi> Anſw. In Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Logick then falſe
Doctrine, and falſe Prophet are the ſame. It is true, falſe
Doctrine is the form denominating a falſe Teacher or falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
but to make the forme denominating, and the ſubject
denominated the ſame, is to Me falſe Doctrine in <hi>Logick.</hi> Are
the whiteneſſe and the thing white, the heate and thing hot, all
one? or doth a Man that knows hot water by heate, cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by its cold, know <hi>idem per idem,</hi> the ſame by the ſame? But
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> applies his rule generally againſt Anabaptiſts, and
ſaith, <hi>where hath there been known a Society of Anabaptists, ſince
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117829:18"/>
the World firſt knew them, that proved not wicked?</hi> Anſw. Were
this queſtion propounded dubitatively it would the leſſe move,
but no Man will I think take his interrogation for any other
then a moſt peremptory determination, wherein like a right
Engliſh Maſtive, he flies in the face not of one, or two Men, or
one or two Societies of Men, but on all <hi>the Societies of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
ſince the World firſt knew them,</hi> and aſſerts them <hi>to have
proved wicked.</hi> An accuſation that I ſhould not have dared to
make againſt the Papiſts themſelves. And for it, if there were
no other thing, I may boldly ſay Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath <hi>plaid</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
part with a witneſſe.</hi> But you'l ſay is it not true? <hi>Anſw.</hi>
Were not <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Colleagues, <hi>Hemerobaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi>
the <hi>Picards</hi> who re-baptized, as the Preface to the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian
Confeſſion</hi> of the year 1535 ſhewes, Anabaptiſts; that is,
baptizers againe? And yet who doubts but they had many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
who proved not wicked? But you'l ſay they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
on another ground then the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
means, who deny Infant-baptiſm? Be it ſo: yet it is a moſt
bold calumny to damne all their ſocieties as in concluſion wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may learne to order his pen better
hereafter, he may take notice that beſides the probabilities that
<hi>Berengarius</hi> oppoſed the Baptizing of little ones, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> alledgeth, it is more then probable by
<hi>Bernards</hi> 204 Epiſtle, his 66. <hi>Sermon on the Canticles, Petrus
Cluniacenſis his Epiſtle againſt Peter de Bruis, and Henricus,
Eckbertus Schonaugienſis his Sermon 7. adverſus Catharos in the
Auctarium of the Biblioth: Patxum Tom.</hi> 2. and others, that there
were many hundreds of years ſithence, a very great number of
godly Societies, that did deny Infant-baptiſme, and in <hi>Gaule</hi> and
<hi>Germany</hi> were Baptized after Infant-baptiſme. But perhaps
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> imagines no <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> (as he calls them) till <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
dayes. There have been many of thoſe Societies in high

<hi>How many of theſe, &amp;c.</hi> May I not as well aske the pariſhioners

ſo palpably guilty of the ſoule ſins he names? How many <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi>
or <hi>Antinomists</hi> they have known, I cannot tell. Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> names me for one, and I confeſſe his pariſhioners of
<hi>Kederminſter</hi> have had meanes to know me from my Cradle, as
being borne and bred up, and lived a good part of my life near
them: if they know me ſo palpably guilty of the ſins Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
ſpeakes of, they ſhew but little love, in that they <hi>rebuke me not,

<hi>they ſhould be at a loſſe, when they are called upon for proofe

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there yet remaines that which it ſeemes was firſt in his
intention, though laſt in execution; to wit, the blazing abroade
his Diſpute with me</hi> Ianua. 1. <hi>at</hi> Bewdley, <hi>of which he ſpeaks
thus.</hi> You heard in my late publick Diſpute at <hi>Bewdley</hi> Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
1. With Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> who is taken to be the ableſt of them
in the Land, and one of the moſt Moderate, how little they can
ſay even in the hardeſt point of baptiſme; what groſs abſurdities
they are driven to, and how little tender conſciencious fear of err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is left among the beſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> not content to be cryed up by his party, hath
thought good to glory in his imagined victory, and to crow over
me in print, for that which I am aſſured the moſt conſiderate
and godly Auditors of that Diſpute have thought meet to
mourn, as perceiving it to have been his hour of temptation:
and God I hope will yet open his eyes, to ſee how he hath been
abuſed, to become an Inſtrument to hinder the receiving of
Truth, and the Ringleader to a party of men, who neither mind
the things of Chriſt, nor regard Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſaving wherein
they make uſe of the keenneſs of his ſpirit, and abilities, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Truth, and to uphold their repute. But to the matter,
Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> reckons me among the <hi>Heretiques</hi> he had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
yet with difference. In <hi>an Accuſation of Hereſie, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
ſaith, <hi>a man is not to be patient.</hi> Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Juſtification, Univerſal Grace in <hi>Amyralds middle way</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
by him in this place of his <hi>Epistle,</hi> his Tenet about <hi>the
Magistrates being an Officer under Christ as Mediator</hi> in his
<hi>Aphoriſms of Iustification,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Dr Chaloners</hi> Credo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam. <hi>Davenant</hi> Exhort. to Peace.</note> pag. 273. may and are taken to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
more of Hereſie then any Tenet I hold; yea ſure, as our
Proteſtant Divines are wont to anſwer Papiſts, that the Tenets
of the Proteſtants denying their additions, when otherwiſe the
ſame Faith is avouched, cannot be juſtly charged as Hereſie;
ſo neither can I be juſtly charged with Hereſie, who do avouch
the Baptiſm appointed by Chriſt, and practiſed by his Apoſtles,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117829:20"/>
and onely deny that the Conſequences from the Old Teſtament
are convincing to prove Infant-Baptiſm: They that alter Chriſts
way, and introduce another way, from Circumciſion, or the
Jewiſh Church-ſtate, as Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> doth, are more juſtly
chargeable with Hereſie. His conceits of me I regard not: His
Neighbors of <hi>Kederminſter</hi> might hear how little I did ſay, but
ſurely they could not <hi>hear in that Dispute how little I could ſay,</hi>
much leſs how little <hi>Anabaptists</hi> ſo called <hi>can ſay in the hardest
point of Baptiſm:</hi> His Neighbors and others may know by this,
and my other Writings and Sermon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that I can ſay more then
I ſaid then; and I know other learned men who can ſay more in
the point then diſputed, though I then ſaid enough in anſwer
to Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> Arguments then produced, notwithſtanding my
care to ſpeak no more then was neceſſary, and my natural heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
in anſwering an Argument at the firſt hearing. And how
ever the buſineſs was packed, to cry up a <hi>Baxter,</hi> as if they had
been a company of Boys at a game, yet the whole Auditory
might know, and many did, that Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> gave no ſufficient
Anſwer to that which I alledged, <hi>That no good Argument could
be drawn from the Infants of the lews viſible Church memberſhip
to our Infants viſible Church-memberſhip, becauſe the viſible
Church of the Iews was the whole Nation brought into Covenant
together by</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Moſes <hi>without previous inſtruction;
but the Chriſtian viſible Church had another ſtate and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being gathered by Apoſtles and other Preachers, by teaching
them the Gospel, and thereby making them Diſciples, ſome in one
Country, City, Family, ſome in another; no one Country, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Tribe together, but ſo many of all as the Lord vouchſafed to
call by his Word and Spirit.</hi> Which was enough to anſwer the
main Argument Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> brought from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 19, 20. The <hi>groſſeſt of abſurdities</hi> he conceived <hi>I was
driven to,</hi> I take it was that I conceived <hi>[thou] Deut.</hi> 29. 12.
not to comprehend little ones, of which I have given account
above: What other <hi>groſs abſurdities I was driven to,</hi> when Mr
<hi>Baxter</hi> will ſhew them, I ſhall then make an Anſwer: He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did charge me with any ſuch groſs abſurdities, nor could
drive me to any, when he and I had a whole Afternoons Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117829:20"/>
at <hi>Kederminſter</hi> in his Chamber with him alone, <hi>Ianua.</hi>
25. after that he knew my Anſwers to his Arguments, delivered
in a <hi>Sermon at Bewdly Chappel, Ianua.</hi> 20. And for his laſt
cenſure, as if <hi>there were little tender conſcientious fear of erring
left in me,</hi> it ſhews a very great height of pride in him, to take
on him to judg my ſpirit, and uncharitableneſs or malignity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, who would thus cenſure me, when if he had any
ſpark of charity to me, he might have perceived a very great
and conſciencious fear of erring in me, who, afore I did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
any thing, did firſt try what the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters could ſay
for Infant Baptiſm, in ſix days private diſpute, and after apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf to a <hi>Committee of the Aſſembly,</hi> and particularly to
Mr <hi>Marſhal,</hi> and waited nineteen moneths afore I publiſhed
my Writings about Infants Baptiſm, as may be ſeen in my <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen
and Apology,</hi> not unknown to Mr <hi>Baxter:</hi> Yea, my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
with Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhewed the ſame fear of erring, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
afore I would adventure to preach at <hi>Bewdly,</hi> firſt endevor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to get his Animadverſions in writing on ſome part of my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,</hi>
not yet printed, which he would not yeeld: and after
that many moneths endeavored to get his Arguments in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that my Neighbors and my ſelf might be ſatisfied, and I
deſiſt from preaching what I intended, or elſe might go more
ſurely to work in aſſerting my Tenet. But it ſeems Mr <hi>Baxter</hi>
was reſolved to lie cloſe, till he could by provocations draw me
to a publique Diſpute, preſuming he ſhould carry the fame of a
victory, which would ſerve his and the reſt of his parties turn,
to leſſen my eſteem, and to hold the people in the ſuperſtition of
Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And for himſelf, I leave it to his own Conſcience and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
men to judge, how little conſcientions feare, of
erring he had, who would not, though ſo often requeſted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
his Arguments in Writing to me, to be examined
afore he vented them ſo openly; and how little Brotherly
care he had to keepe me from error, by giving me his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to ſtay me from Preaching that which his Speeches
provoked me to, and he knew as I am aſſured that I did intend.
To conclude I am enforced to expreſſe it as a grievance, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117829:21"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> have neither found that love of Truth, Candor, nor love to
me, either before, or in the Diſpute, or ſince, which I expected
in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and which encouraged me to yeeld to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
mentioned by him. As for the two flings he hath at me
in the ſixth <hi>direction of his Epiſtle,</hi> where he mentions <hi>ſome
that ſay, no truth muſt be concealed for Peace,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>they
have uſually as little of the one as the other,</hi> I had hoped I had
ſatisfied Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in a Letter, by acquainting him with
what limitation <hi>I</hi> meant, if not expreſſed my poſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which if he had been willing to deale fairely with me, he
ſhould have mentioned. As for Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> wayes, how far
they are from Truth or Peace, may eaſily be diſcerned, by his
managing the buſineſs between him and me: My friendly and
ready coming to him, <hi>Ianua.</hi> 25. ſhewed my deſire of both.
The other is in thoſe words, <hi>Temptations are now come neer your
doors,</hi> which I imagine he ſpake becauſe of my Vicinity to them:
His Neighbors I think will bear me witneſs I taught them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Truths when they did hear me, which formerly was very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and I ſtill tender their good ſo far, as to be unwilling to
miſlead them, how ever they may think of me by Mr <hi>Baxters</hi>
deſcriptions of me. And were I fit to give them Counſel, I
would warn them to take heed of the <hi>Temptations that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
now come neer their doors,</hi> in the high eſteem they have of
Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> which may cauſe them to drink in his Errors, of
which I have ſaid before he ſeems to me not to be free; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in all parts, as his own words in a Letter to me do import,
do charge him with more largely then I do. Other things in his
<hi>Treatiſe</hi> I let them paſs: But for the point in diſpute between
him and me, if he add any thing more, as I am told he intends,
if the Lord aſſiſt I ſhall examine it when I have it in writing:
and in the mean time do wiſh him <hi>mentem ſanam in corpore
ſano.</hi>
