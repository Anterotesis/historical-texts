         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

he ſo did for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> To the end that
it might be under ſtood by all.</p>
            <p>Which of us hath not heard it objected,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
that we the profeſſors of the Law ſeek to hide
and ſecreat the knowledge thereof under this
dark and diſtaſted language, wherein the law
is for the moſt part written, not that I hold
it any juſt excuſe for the neſcience or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of any, that our books are not in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.
Since, firſt, it were eaſie for any dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and intelligent man, ſpecially if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the right French language, ſo
underſtand our broken or brackiſh French in
a few dayes. Secondly, there be both ſtatutes
and ſome other law-books in Engliſh, which
<pb facs="tcp:49865:5"/>
are neglected by the moſt. Thirdly, though
care hath beene in Parliament in <hi>Edward</hi>
the third his time,<note place="margin">36. Ed. 3. c. 15.</note> that Lawyers ſhould
plead, that is, argue and debate cauſes in
Engliſh, which was often deſired by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Commons, till at laſt aſſented and
enacted;<note place="margin">2. &amp; 3. Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 6. in fine.</note> and in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time care was
taken that the Commiſſions of Purveyors
ſhould be in Engliſh, to the end that all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from or of whom they would take, might
both ſee them to be perſons authoriſed, and ſo
alſo in what manner they are directed to uſe
their authority, according to the Princes pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and princely care that his ſubjects ſhould
not be abuſed by his Officers: Yet for this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire,
of having all the Law-volumes ſpeak
Engliſh, I have not heard nor read of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
or endevour in Parliament. Fourthly,
If the Annals and Reports were in Engliſh,
they are ſo replete with debates about formes
of Writs, Returnes, Pleadings, Eſſoignes,
Imparlances, Protections, Vouchers, Ayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priers
and Counterplees of both, and the like,
as would eaſily diſtaſte and diſcourage any
not intending to profeſſe and practiſe the law,
<pb facs="tcp:49865:5"/>
from verſing much in them, or paſſing through
them. This therefore, as I thinke, would
not much effect the expreſsed deſire.</p>
            <p>The thing in my judgement fit and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to produce that good effect, would bee
to have extracts of materials of the Law;
and that not without ſome good choice and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
compoſed in way of diſcourſe, or trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
expoſitory, and that in Engliſh.</p>
            <p>I cannot well ſee or comprehend how any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
one legall part or theme may be more uſefull
to and for the generality of men, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
more generally expetible and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, than the office of executors. For who
almost is there, who either is not, or may not
be an executor or adminiſtrator, or at least
hath not, or may not have to doe with them,
either to receive from them, or to pay to them
debts or legacies. Or who is there above
<hi>Forma pauperis</hi> that may not be a teſtator,
or will maker, to the guidance of whom even
in the choice of his executors, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his will, it cannot but be materiall to
know the office and duty, the right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb facs="tcp:49865:6"/>
the power and authority of executors,
yea, of each one executor where there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
yea, to know who may be made an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
who not; who can make one, who not;
how he may be faſhioned, generally or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
what ſhall come to him, what cannot be
given from him; yea, what goods or chatels

ayme of theſe Diſcourſes; but neceſſarily it

muſt needs paſſe by &amp; thorow other Townes
and Villages, and ſpeake with divers other
perſons in his journey and returne. To come
firſt to the firſt; therein wee will conſider theſe
ſixe things.</p>
            <p>1. Whether an Executor and a Will be ſuch
Relatives, that one cannot be without th'other;
and therein of the ſeverall kinds of Wills.</p>
            <p>2. How, and by what words an Executor
may be made and created.</p>
            <p>3. How he may be in ſpeciall manner (diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the generall) faſhioned, limitted or

            <p>4. Who may make, or be made an Executor,
and who not.</p>
            <p>5. What one may give or bequeath by Will,
what not.</p>
            <p>6. How a will or Executor once made, may
be unmade, and what ſhall amount thereunto,
<hi>viz. To</hi> a revocation totall or partiall, what to
new Publication.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the relation betweene a Will and an Executor.</head>
               <p>AS to the firſt, the very name of Executor
purporteth in the generall, one that is to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49865:10"/>
execute ſomewhat, or to whom the execution
of ſomewhat is committed, or recommended.
In our particular therefore, an Executor of a
Will muſt needs be ſuch an one to whom the
execution and performance of another mans
Will after his death is commended, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
Or who is conſtituted and authoriſed
by the Teſtator, or Will-maker, to doe him
that friendly office. Hence it followes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily,
that a Will is the onely bed wherein
an Executor can be begotten or conceived,
for where no Will is, there can be no Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
And this is ſo conſpicuous, and evident
to every low capacity, that it needs no proofe
nor illuſtration. On th'other ſide, though
much be written in name of a Will, many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
bequeathed, and many things appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be done:<note place="margin">Plowd. eom. 1851 a. in Wood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. and Darcies <hi>Caſes, ſo expreſly faid.</hi>
                  </note> Yet if no Executor be named,
here is no Will; for theſe two be ſo relative,
and reciprocall, as that one cannot be without
th'other; if no Will, no Executor; if no Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
no Will. Yet here two Cautions are to
be affixed.<note place="margin">Teſtamentum quaſi teſtatio mentis.</note> 1. That a mans minde, will, and
intent, touching the diſpoſition of his goods,
being declared, although for want of naming
an Executor he die inteſtate, ſo as Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be committed: Yet for that here is
not onely an inchoation or inception of a
Teſtament, but ſo farre a progreſſion therein,
as <hi>Testatio mentis,</hi> that is, the manifeſtation of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49865:11"/>
the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty deceaſed and owner of goods; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this minde and intention of the Inteſtate
being notified and made knowne to the Judge,
who is to commit Adminiſtration, is uſually
annexed (as I take it) to the Letters of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,
and meete ſo to be, as a direction,
for, and to the Adminiſtrator; as well as the
Will fully, and perfectly made, but refuſed to
be proved by the Executor, which is uſuall.
Another Caution is, That where a man ſeiſed
of Land in Fee-ſimple, diſpoſeth the ſame,
or part thereof by his Will in writing, this
ſtandeth good for the whole or part, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the difference of Tenure, although no
Executor be named; ſo as the party dieth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate,
and Adminiſtration is to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as touching his goods, and yet hath a Will
as touching his Lands. This may ſeeme
ſtrange, that the reaſon thereof is an Act of
Parliament, inabling to diſpoſe of Land by
Will in writing. And for that Land, is not
properly Teſtamentary, neither hath the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor
(if any be) anything to doe or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
therewith; and therefore is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or not making of an Executor, nothing
pertinent to the validity or invalidity of this
deviſe or diſpoſition of Land by Will. So, as
though where there is not <hi>Teſtatio mentis,</hi>
there is not <hi>Teſtamentum;</hi> yet may there be
the firſt without the later.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49865:11"/>
Having ſeene that bequeſts of Legacies
without making of Executors, doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to a Will. Let us now conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſole making of Executors in the name
of a Will, without giving any Legacie, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
any thing to be done by his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?
Whether I ſay, this be, or amount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Will or not? Since hereupon the matter
nothing is willed, and conſequently nothing
reſts to be executed by the Executors, whoſe
Office, as hath beene ſaid, is to execute the
Will, Minde, and Intent of their Teſtator, and
<hi>Vbi non est Teſtatio mentis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Summ. Silv. fo. 32. b.</note> 
                  <hi>non eſt Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
ſaith the <hi>Cannoniſt.</hi> For anſwer hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
confeſſing that indeede to be the Office
of an Executor; I yet conceive confidently,
that in the Caſe above put, there is a good
Will and as a Will, it is to be proved and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
for theſe Reaſons. Firſt, for that the
maine and principall part of an Executors Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and that which moſt concernes the ſoule
of the Teſtator (as our Bookes ſpeake) is the
payments of his debts. Now, who knowes not,
but that the very making of an Executor, is
the conſtituting of ſuch a perſon, who is to
pay all debts; and for that cauſe and end,
principally is to have, and enjoy all the goods
and chattels of the Teſtator, and all ſummes
of money to him owing, as the naming of <hi>A.</hi>
and <hi>B.</hi> Executors is by implication a gift, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49865:12"/>
donation to them of all the goods, chattells,
credits, and perſonall eſtate of the Teſtator,
and the laying upon them an Oligation to pay
all his debts, and making them ſubject to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans ſute and Action for the ſame.
And if the Law ſpeake thus much ſenſe; <hi>Quod
neceſſario ſubintelligitur non deest;</hi> What neede
then the party expreſſe it in his Will? If hee
had willed more than this, as to have given
this or that in way of Legacy, it had beene
needefull for him, ſo to have ſet downe in his
Will, but there is no meere neceſſity that
every man ſhould give Legacies: the eſtates
of many will not doe more than pay their
debts, nor oft-times ſo much, ſo as if they
ſhould give any Legacie, it muſt bee a dead
and void gift. And ſuppoſe a man have much
more, and intendeth all to his wife, brother,
or ſiſter, or other friend, his debts being by
ſuch perſon, paid ſince the very making of
that party Executor, without any more, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
to thus much, and effecteth this;
what needeth then more words? <hi>Fruſtra fit per
plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora;</hi> as we often
ſpeake touching legall paſſages; It is needleſſe
to write foure lines where two be ſufficient.
Nor is <hi>Teſtatio mentis</hi> here wanting; ſince the
Teſtator hath made knowne who ſhould have
the Adminiſtration of his goods for payment
of his debts, and it is to be preſumed he had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49865:12"/>
no more ſpeciall Will; ſince hee did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
more, but left his Executor further to
have and doe, <hi>Prout lex poſtulat:</hi> And who
can ſay here is nothing to execute? Is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for, and collecting of debts due to the
Teſtator, and the payment of debts owing by
him nothing? Nay, it is rather <hi>in hoc negotio,</hi>
the <hi>Vnum neceſſarium.</hi> Beſides, the making of
an Executor is a deſignment, of a perſon to be
the Teſtators aſſigne to whom, and by whom
divers, things may be feaſible by vertue
of covenants, bonds, or other aſſurances, as
after where we come to ſhew how the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
repreſents the perſon of the Teſtator
will appeare. Alſo of one, who, as our Bookes
often ſpeake, is to diſpoſe the Teſtators
goods for the beſt advantage of his ſoule, but

all to make Wills by writing, and not to leave
them to the doubtfull fidelity, or ſlippery Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

               <p>So of Wills Parroll may be feared. Beſides,
many times a man doth ſpeake and declare
this or that, as part of his Will, which his wife,
child, or friend diſſwading, he letteth that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and part of Will to fall, &amp; departs from it:
Yet witneſſes wiſhing it to ſtand, will perhaps
affirme it as part of the Will. As for a Will,
gift, and diſpoſition of Land of inheritance, if
it be not fully written before the death of the
Teſtator or Doner, ſo farre (at leaſt) as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the diſpoſition of Land, it cannot be
for that part made good, by reducing it to
writing after his death, as for goods and
chattels it may. Yet if it be written before the
death of the Teſtator, though it never be
brought to him, or reade to him, after the
writing thereof, it is good enough: and that

ſo as there be an Executor named. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall wee ſay, that this is a Will <hi>Nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
or in writing? And ſurely I thinke, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49865:13"/>
this is a Will in writing, and not verball only,
though it want ſubſcribing; for wee know,
that many cannot write their names, but onely
markes, and what is that? Nay, ſuppoſe one
want hands, and cannot write ſo much as his
name; yet doubtleſſe this man may make a
Will in writing, that being written by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as his Will which he dictated: nor is
the ſubſcribing of the name of the maker, any
eſſentiall part of a Deede, much leſſe of a
Will, which needes not ſealing as a Deede
doth. Now put we the caſe on the other ſide,
that many Bequeſts or Legacies be named in
a Will, and many things expreſſed to be done,
but no Executor is named in the writing, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by word of mouth, <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> be named
Executors. This I thinke confidently is no
Will in writing, but <hi>Nuncupative</hi> onely; for
that one eſſentiall part of the Will, <hi>viz.</hi> the
making of Executors, is wanting in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

Yea, in the ſaid late Queenes time, one
giving divers Legacies, and then appointing
that his debts; and Legacies being paide, his
wife ſhould have the reſidue of his goods; ſo
that ſhe put in ſecurity for the performance of
his Will. By this without more, was ſhee an
Executor, as was held by three <hi>Iuſt. viz.
Manwood, Harper,</hi> and <hi>Mounſon,</hi> in the Lord

was made Executor, and <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,
with this, that they ſhould have the
rule and diſpoſition of his goods and payment,
and receipt of debts, untill the full age of the
Infant; by this were they held to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the meane time. And if <hi>A.</hi> be made
Executor, and the Teſtator after in his Will,
expreſſeth that <hi>B.</hi> ſhall Adminiſter alſo with
him, and in aide of him: Here <hi>B.</hi> is an Executor

being named, and two refuſe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

be named in ſutes againſt the Teſtators deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as was there admitted. But in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
caſe it was reſolved that the ſute ſhould
be onely in the name of <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> for that the
appointing of them to be Executors, if <hi>A.</hi> and
<hi>B.</hi> refuſed did imply, that then they onely
ſhould be Executors. And here all foure were
never made, nor intended to be Executors,
but <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> upon a condition ſubſequent
that they ſhould not refuſe: and <hi>C.</hi> &amp; <hi>D.</hi> upon a

It is uſuall to make one or more Executors,
conditionally, that they put in ſecurity to pay
Legacies, or in generall to performe the
Will; nor was it ever doubted, as I thinke,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49865:16"/>

that ſuch condition be plainely thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

he doe Adminiſter (Funerall perhaps ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
hee ſhall put in ſuch ſecurity;
elſe perhaps he being Executor till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

or elſe <hi>A. B.</hi> ſhould; and the queſtion
was in the Common Plees, whether preſently

ſometimes by Executors, that their Teſtators
ſtood out-lawed. But firſt it is cleare, that all

to others, which neither are forfeited by
Attainder or outlawry, nor deveſted by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,

that their Teſtator was, and died
out-lawed, proves not a nullity of the Will,
or Executorſhip: for then they might have
pleaded, that they were never Executors. But
it tends to this, that no goods did, or could
come to them for ſatisfaction of the debts by

were generally of his Leaſe, not mentioning

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49865:23"/>
hath, is another Leaſe, and not that which he
had at the time of the making of the Will.
So, if one give his blacke gelding by Will, and
after, before his death, he ſelleth or giveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that Horſe, and buyeth another blacke
one, this new gotten Horſe ſhall not paſſe by
the Will, becauſe it was not the Teſtators, at
the time of making his Will. So alſo, if the
Crop in the Barne be bequeathed in <hi>October,</hi>
and the party lives till that time twelve month,
having ſold that Crop and Inned a new, this
later Crop ſhall not paſſe by the Will, and the
former cannot.</p>
               <p>Againe, as revocation may be by alteration
of the State of the Deviſor, in the Land De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed;
ſo may it alſo be by alteration, in ſome
caſe of the ſtate or quality of the perſon of
the Deviſor. As if a woman ſole make a Will,
and after take a Husband, this without any
more, as is reſolved in the ſaid caſe of <hi>Forſe,</hi> and
<hi>Hembling,</hi> doth worke a Revocation, or adnul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Will, for that elſe it ſhould be
irrevocable, ſince ſhee having loſt the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of her Will, cannot actually and directly
make a Revocation, as we before have ſhewed.
But notwithſtanding her Will be revoked, yet
in caſe her Husband before or after marriage,
with her were bound or Covenanted, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this womans Will, if he ſo doe not, by
payment of the legacies therein bequeathed, his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49865:24"/>
Bond or Covenant ſtand good, and be ſutable
againſt him,<note place="margin">M. 25. 26. Eliz.</note> as was adjudged touching the
Will of <hi>Elizabeth Smaleman,</hi> marryed after
her Will made to one <hi>Wood.</hi> Who firſt was
bound to performe it: yet another caſe there is
of Alteration in the ſtate of the Teſtators per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which makes no Revocation of his Will.
As if he being of ſound minde and ability,
make a Will, and after becommeth franticke.
In this caſe this is no Revoction. So as his
Will ſtands till his death irrevocable, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
not. Now of a Will Revoked, there
may be a reviver by a new Publication, and
therof now.</p>

               <p>HAving ſhewed how a Will may be revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and ſo loſe its force; let us now ſee
how without making a new Will, that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
may be revived,<note place="margin">M. 38. 39, Eliz. in ba. reg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and ſet on foote againe.
And that is divers wayes: as, Firſt, by a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicell</hi>
annexed after thereunto, as was reſolved
betweene <hi>Betford,</hi> and <hi>Barnecot,</hi> in the Kings
Bench. Secondly, by adding any thing to
the Will, or making a new Executor, &amp;c.
Thirdly, by expreſſe ſpeech or word, that it
ſhould ſtand or be his Will; as I conceive, to
have beene the better opinion in the ſaid caſe
of <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Ieoffryes,</hi> wherein yet was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49865:24"/>
much difference of opinion, both touching
Revocation and new Publication. If a man
having made a former Will,<note place="margin">44. Aſſ. p. 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> doe make a latter
which is more than a bare Revocation; yet if
afterward lying upon his death-bed, and
ſpeechleſſe, both theſe Wills be delivered
into his hand, and he required to deliver to
one of his friends about him, that Will which
he would have to ſtand, and to keepe in his
hands th'other; he thereupon delivereth to
the Miniſter or other his neighbours, the firſt
made Will, retaining in his hands the latter,
as was done in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third.
Here the former Will,<note place="margin">44, Ed. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ols 33.</note> though made voyde
many yeares before, by the latter, is revived,
and ſhall ſtand as the Parties Will. But now
put the caſe that a Bequeſt at the firſt is voyde,
yet by Publication after, it may be made good,
as if one give to <hi>Sar.</hi> his wife, a peece of Plate
or other thing, and hath no ſuch Wife at the
time, but after marryeth one of that name, and
then publiſheth his Will againe; now this
ſhall bee a good Bequeſt. So if one Deviſe
Lands or Goods, which one hath not; If he
after doe purchaſe the ſame, and then ſay that
his Will before made ſhall ſtand, or be his
Will. It ſhall be a good Will and Bequeſt,
for this is in effect a new making.<note place="margin">3. &amp;. 4. P. M. Dy. 143.</note> And though
moſt of the precedent caſes, be of Revocation
of particular parts of the Will, and not of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49865:25"/>
totall: Yet firſt, be it conſidered that, that part
ſo revoked was in effect the ſubſtance of the
Will: Next, it is eaſily diſcerned that if one
part be revocable, ſo is another alſo; And thus
Revocation may ſpread it ſelfe over the whole;
nay, doubtleſſe the whole, <hi>Vno flatu,</hi> may be
revoked, as well as by parts, even as a fagot
may be put wholly into the fire, as well as
ſticke by ſticke. And as the <hi>Velleities</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
parts of the Will, are revocable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivable
by new Publication as aforeſaid, ſo is
alſo the conſtitution of Executors. As if
one of the Executors names be ſtricken out,
and afterwards a <hi>ſtet.</hi> be written over his head
by the Teſtator, or by his appointment, now
is he a revived Executor. So if the Teſtator
expreſſe by word, in the preſence of Witneſſes
that the party put out ſhall yet be Executor;
but now I meane, where the Executors name is
not ſo blotted out, but that it may be read and
diſcerned; for elſe the <hi>ſtet</hi> is upon nothing, and
if the Verball reaffirmance ſhould renue his
Executorſhip, then muſt the Will be partly
in writing, and partly <hi>Nuncupative,</hi> his name
not being to be found in the written Will.</p>

of the State of the debts to be paid, and goods

finde that ſafely this or that legacy may take
effect without making any defect in payment
of debts, or drawing upon him and his owne
goods any damage or loſſe as a waſter: and
thereupon ſhall aſſent to ſuch Legacy. Thus
now is the Law taken; but heretofore ſome
opinion hath runne otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That hee
to whom any Bequeſt was made of a thing
knowne and certaine,<note place="margin">27. H. 6. 8.</note> might take it without
any aſſent of the Executor:<note place="margin">Of late perhaps ſome ſingle or ſuddaine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may alſo have runne that way, but in <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> caſe the point was divers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>unes argued, and then adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as before.</note> and that when to
the Executor himſelfe any good or Chattell
moveable or immoveable was bequeathed.
In caſe there were otherwiſe ſufficient goods,
for ſatisfaction of debts, the ſame ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49865:26"/>
upon the Teſtators death, without any
act or election, by the Executor be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into, and unto him in his owne right, as a
Legacy, and not remaine in him as Executor.
As for ſummes of money bequeathed,<note place="margin">To be bought.</note> or ſo
much in Plate, or Ringes, it is evident that
they muſt be had by the delivery of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor:
Yet hath the Legate ſuch an intereſt
before delivery, as that dying before payment
it will goe to his Executors. But as I take
it, no ſuch to whom any thing certaine is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Will, can make any gift or grant of it,
before the Executor have aſſented to his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thereof;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quae.</hi> of this ſee more after <hi>Tit.</hi> Legacy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</note> Nor perhaps will the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
aſſent, after the grant have ſuch relation,
as to make good the grant precedent; why ſo,
yet? more then an atturnement of a Leaſſee,
which is alike aſſent to the grant of another?
And <hi>Quere</hi> if by the out-lawry of the Legatee,
before the Executors aſſent, this thing bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
be forfeited.</p>
            <p>If without juſt cauſe an Executor will refuſe
to aſſent he is compellable by Law Spirituall
or Court of Conſcience, yet if Spirituall
Court preſſe to doe where is juſt cauſe to ſtay,
a <hi>Prohibit.</hi> lyeth, <hi>ut Credo,</hi> for ſince executors
ſtand liable to recovery of debts againſt them
by Common Law. It is reaſon that Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them to keepe wherewith to pay. And
here yet note ſome ſeeming oppoſition in Law
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49865:27"/>
for where before great difference was ſhewed
betweene a Deviſe or Bequeſt, and a gift or
alienation executed in ones life time; Yet the
Lord <hi>Deyar</hi> reports it to be reſolved, that where
a Leaſe for yeares was made upon condition,
that the Leſſee ſhould not Aliene in his life
time, that yet a Bequeſt of this Leaſe by his
Will, was a breach of the Condition as being
an alienation in his life time.</p>
            <p>3. Of a diſcharge by Will to a debtor ſome
queſtion may be whether to perfect and make
good this, ſo as the debtor may plead it in
Barre, there be not requiſite, as in the former,
an aſſent of the Executor. On the one ſide,
ſince this giving is a forgiving, for he to whom
it is bequeathed, cannot otherwiſe have it, then
by way of retainer, it may probably be ſaid,
that here needes no ſuch aſſent of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as in the caſe where any thing is to be
transferred; for here is rather an extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and an exoneration then a paſſage of a
Chattell by way of <hi>Donation:</hi> On the other
ſide it is probable that it being but a Bequeſt,
and ſo a Legacy, ſince debts are in Law and
Conſcience, to be ſatisfyed before any Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
that therefore the Executor having not
ſufficient otherwiſe to ſatisfie his Teſtators
debts, may ſue for this debt, and refuſe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to paſſe away as a Legacy. And to this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49865:27"/>
opinion doe I encline, as beſt for Creditors;
and ſatisfaction of debts is by Law reſpected
as an act greatly concerning the Teſtators
ſoule. But ſome will perhaps make a contrary
doubt, that although there be an aſſent of the
Executors to this diſcharge, yet it will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to a legall releaſe, for that a debt, at
leaſt,<note place="margin">Not de eſſe, <hi>but</hi> de bene eſſe.</note> if it be by ſpeciallty, cannot be releaſed
but by Deede, and a Will is no Deede, for a
Seale is not neceſſary thereunto, though it be
fit and convenient; whereto I give this anſwer,
that a Will though it be not properly and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
a Deede, for it may be good enough
without a Seale, which is an eſſentiall part of
a Deede, yet hath it the force and effect of a
Deede: for as a Releaſe cannot be made but
by Deede, ſo neither can an Eſtate or Intereſt
though but for yeares in Tithes, Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Commons, Faires, and like things be
granted or aſſigned otherwiſe then by Deede,
yet it is cleare, that ſuch a ſtate for yeares in
any of theſe may be given by Will, as well as
a Leaſe of Land, which proves a will to have
the force and effect of a Deede.</p>

come onely into the hands of thoſe others, ſo

conſequently, if he could not ſue the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors,
he ſhould thus be ſtripped of his debt

               <p>AS to this it is cleare, that before proving
of a Will by the Executor, he may ſeiſe
and take into his hands any of the goods of the

and Execution of a Legacy, as before hath
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49865:30"/>
beene ſhewed. So as if one give me his white

aſſent, and it will ſtand good. Yea, although
he dye after any of theſe acts done, the Will
being never proved by him, yet doe theſe Acts
ſo done, ſtand firme and good, as I take it.
Yet (as I finde) an Executor, making his
Will, and dying before he had proved the
Will of his Teſtator: his Executor may not
prove both the Wills, and ſo become Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to both the Teſtators.<note place="margin">22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 23. Eliz. Dy. 372.</note> But in caſe the

                  </gap>inetaine a ſuite or action of debt or the like.
And the reaſon is, for that therein hee muſt
ſhew forth the Will proved, under the ſeale
of the Ordinary. And ſo, as I take it, muſt
it be, if he bring any Action for treſpaſſe done,
or goods taken in the Teſtators life time, ſo
as the Teſtator himſelfe was intitled to the
Action, and it growes not upon the Executors
poſſeſſion.<note place="margin">34. P. &amp; Ma. Dy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 135. a.</note> I finde that an Executor granting

as Actions of Treſpaſſe, or <hi>Replevin,</hi> for goods
taken after the death of the Teſtator: yet in the

was an Action of <hi>Detinue</hi> by the Executor,
for goods taken or detained after the Teſtators
death,<note place="margin">Plow. com. 275. b.</note> the Plaintiffe did ſhew forth the Will
proved. But that proves not any neceſſity
thereof, or that if the Will had not beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
it could be no hurt to ſhew it forth, ſo
upon his own contract for the Teſtators goods
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49865:31"/>
as if the Executor ſell Cattell or other goods
of the Teſtator, before the Will proved, hee
may for the money payable, mainetaine an
action of debt, before he have proved any Wil:
and in this and the action of Treſpaſſe, there
is no neceſſity of naming him Executor. Alſo
on th'other ſide, an Executor may well enough
be ſued for debts of the Teſtator, before the
Will be proved; for he may not by his owne
Act of delaying the <hi>Probate</hi> of the Will, keepe
off Suites, except he will refuſe in due manner,
that ſo Adminiſtration being granted, there
may be ſome body Suable by the Teſtators
Creditors, for debts by him oweing. And
the uſuall plea of the Defendant, to eſtrange
himſelfe from the Teſtament, is to ſay that he
neither is Executor, nor hath Adminiſtred as
Executor. So as if he either be Executor <hi>De

being that he neither is Executor, nor ever

the goods are. Or if within the one juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<hi>Metropolitane,</hi> the Teſtator had goods in
divers Dioceſſes; and in th'other, but in one

conceive. And ſo alſo of peculiar juriſdictions.
And in ſome places Archdeacons have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
or juriſdiction ordinary and power to take
<hi>Probates</hi> of Wills and Grant Adminiſtrations.
But where any like error or miſproving is in
theſe reſpects, it is cauſe of reverſall or of
nullity, according to the former difference; ſo
alſo, if there be falſhood in the proofe, were it
<hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni forma,</hi> that is, without witneſſes, or by

               <p>Now, yet admitting the Will true and
right, and alſo rightly proved; let us yet ſee
the force and ſtrength of the Proofe, or Will
ſo proved. It being under the Seale of the

               <p>THeſe may be divided into two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi>
living, and not living; the living are not
many and various. 1. The wardſhip of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of another, be it by reaſon of a tenure of
the preſent owner, or by Aſſignment from the
King, or other Lord of whom the tenure was,
is a Chattell reall, not perſonall, though it be
an intereſt in the perſon of another, but it is in
reſpect of a tenure of Land, or other heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
and is for yeares <hi>viz.</hi> during the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,
or till marriage had, and ſo is reall.
Next, a Villen for yeares as by Grant for a
terme from him that had the Inheritance is a
Chattell reall. As for an Apprentice, for
yeares, it is by Cuſtome, as I take it, that hee
goeth, or is derived to Executors: but for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
after ſhewed; I thinke this Intereſt be not
in the realtie, but in the perſonaltie rather. So
of a debtor in Execution for debt, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49865:41"/>
in him or perhaps more properly in his
liberty is not as I conceive (for reaſons which
after I ſhall expreſſe) a reall, but a perſonall
Chattell. The like Law of a Priſoner taken
in the Warres. As for Fiſhes in a Pond, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in a Warren, Deere in a Parke, Pigeons
in a Dove-houſe, where the Teſtator had the
Inheritance, or but for life, in the Pond, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
Parke, and Dove-houſe, they are not Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells
at all, nor to goe to the Executors, but
to the Heire with the Inheritance. If the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator
were but a Termer, they are to goe to
the Executor, but as acceſſary Chattells, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the ſtate of their principall, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Warren, Parke, Dovehouſe, Pond, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reall Chattells, not living, are either in
Houſes or Lands moſt uſually, and that three
wayes. Firſt, by Leaſe for yeares. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by Wardſhip of Lands held by Knights-Service.
Thirdly, by extent upon Judgements,
Statutes, or Recognizances; Or in things iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
out of Houſes or Lands, as Rents, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Eſtovers, or ſuch like. But where an
Inheritor reſerves a Rent upon a Leaſe for
yeares, this ſhall not goe to the Executor, but
to the Heire, with the Reverſion other than
Arrerages behinde, at the death of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Alſo Commons, Corodies for yeares,
Advowſons, Tithes, Faires, Markets, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Leetes, and ſuch like, which the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

Reall roote, as Wardſhip, and Villenage doe;
but out of a meere contract. As for a Servant
whoſe Maſter is dead, doubtleſſe he is legally
diſcharged, and is not Servant either to Heire
or Executor; but meete and honeſt it is, that
one of them continue him in ſervice till a fit
time of providing him a new Maſter, and fit for
him, not to depart ſuddenly. Now for things

in his owne right or his Wives, or eſtated for
yeares, of Land, in the right of his Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

goe to the Wife, as alſo if they had beene up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a mans owne Land of Inheritance, they
ſhould goe to the Heire, though the Corne
ſhould goe to the Executor. The reaſon of
difference is, becauſe this later comes not
meerely from the ſoile, without the induſtry
and manurance of man as the other doe:<note place="margin">Rootes of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, Parſnips, Land ſold wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſold or conveyed, if not excepted, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

what if the Wife had the Leaſe for yeares as

by addition of other things;<note place="margin">The Wife alſo ſhall have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient apparell 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31.</note> for the value is
to be aſſetts for payment of debts and Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Put the caſe againe that the Husband and
Wife were joynt-tenants of the Land, and then
the very Corne growing ſhall ſurvive to her,
together with the Land, and though the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ſowed it,<note place="margin">2. Eliz. Dy.</note> yet ſhall it not goe to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor.
Being in conſideration of things
growing on the ground, let us not forget to
thinke of Trees ſold by <hi>I. S.</hi> ſeiſed of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the Land to <hi>I. D.</hi> who dyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
felling, this Intereſt is a Chattell which
ſhall goe to the Executor, and not to the Heire
of <hi>I. D.</hi> but ſome colour may be that theſe,
becauſe fixed to the ſoyle and Freehold, are
reall Chattells, as the Intereſt in Land is, and
not perſonall: So alſo of Trees Excepted by
him who ſelleth the Inheritance of the Land;
but in both caſes I conceive this intereſt to be
perſonall, and not reall; for that, as it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of Chattell in the Vendee or Vendor
with exception, it ſtands in conſideration ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and abſtracted from the ſoyle, or ground
where the Trees grow, though the Trees be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49865:46"/>
not actually ſevered by the Axe from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Earth. But if the Leſſor for yeares or life
except the Trees,<note place="margin">Co lib. 11. f 48.</note> theſe continue parcell of the
Freehold and Inheritance. And after Corne
reaped, and before the Tithe ſet out, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor

                     </gap>1. H. 7. f. 26.</note> And in the latter end of
<hi>Henry</hi> the 7. his time, an Executor taking a
Furnace which was ſet in the middle of a houſe
and not fixed to any Wall, the Heire brought
an action of treſpaſſe againſt him for ſo doing,
and it was adjudged for the Heire, <hi>viz.</hi> that
this was to goe as part of the Freehold, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
to the Heire; and long before in
<hi>Edward</hi> the third his time,<note place="margin">42. F. 3. f 6.</note> it was debated
whether it were waſte in a Leſſee to remove or
take away a Furnace or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I finde no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
delivered by the Judges: But in the
late Queenes time, Juſtice <hi>walineſly</hi> ſaid that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49865:46"/>
the Lord <hi>Dyers</hi> opinion was, that where the
Furnace is not fixed to the Wall, the Leſſee
might within his termetake it away.<note place="margin">H. 37. Fliz. Austins <hi>caſe.</hi>
                  </note> Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
if it were fixed to the Wall, for then it
ſtrengtheneth the houſe. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it might be in the one caſe ſo remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Leſſee, yet is it not there, as he ſaid,
a Chattell perſonall or moveable, ſo as it is
attachable; and there the caſe being that a
Clothier being a Termer of an houſe had fixed
a Copper to the Wall with Loomes and
prickes neceſſary for his Occupation, a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being had againſt him, the Sheriffe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Copper in execution as a Chattell,
and after the Leſſee tooke it up, and it was
taken from him by vertue of the Execution;
whereupon he brought an action of Treſpaſſe,
and by all the Judges, the action was maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.
And whereas it was found by the
Jury, that by the Cuſtome of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Leſſee
might remove ſuch a Copper; Juſtice <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
ſaid that without any Cuſtome a Leſſee
might ſo doe at any time during his terme.
But it is to be noted in the ſaid caſe, that the
Furnace was by it ſelfe delivered as a moveable
Chattell, and not as part of the houſe, for that
was not medled withall, nor at all delivered in
extent (as in the caſe betweene <hi>Miles</hi> and <hi>Prat,</hi>
where both houſe and Copper were delivered
upon a Statute) the houſe belike being held
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49865:47"/>
upon ſuch a rackt rent, as that the party did
not deſire to have it, for hee might have had
the whole being a Chattell, and ſo have uſed
the Copper during the terme. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all other fixed things, the Law was taken
in the ſaid caſe in <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. his time, to be
all one, as in the caſe of the Furnace, <hi>viz.</hi> that
they ſhould goe to the Heire, ſave onely that
for glaſſe in the Windowes, <hi>Pollard</hi> ſaid it
was otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that that ſhould goe to
the Executors, which none there denyed. But
ſince, in the late Queenes time it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
reſolved touching glaſſe,<note place="margin">

And touching Poſts fixed, for that they be
parcell of the Freehold, ſo alſo of Millſtones,
Anvills, Doores, Keyes, Windowes, none

               <p>Now to come to Gardens alſo: Whereas,
I before laid down a difference betwixt things
ſowed,<note place="margin">Things in Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

manuring, and ſuch as grow of themſelves;
It will thence be concluded that the rootes of
Carrets, Parſneps, Turneps, Skerrits, and ſuch
like, coming and ariſing from yearely ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
muſt goe to the Executor, and not to the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49865:47"/>
Heire; the caſe being ſo, that the Gardner and
Sower had the Inheritance of the Garden, or
Soile, now though in moſt places this can
rarely be a queſtion of value, yet about <hi>London,</hi>
and ſome great Townes it may, and therefore
not unworthy of a line or two, a thought, or
two, the rather for that the reaſon of this caſe
may give light touching right in other Caſes.
And in my opinion theſe, notwithſtanding,
there is a ſowing and manurance to generate
them, and cauſe their being, ſhall goe to the
Heire and not to the Executor: my reaſon is
for that the thing of profit is the roote which
is hidden in the ground, and I hold it no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nor agreeable to Law, that the Executor
ſhould digge and breake the ſoyle and ground
to ſearch for her entrailes; hee is to content
himſelfe with that which is above ground, as
millions of all kindes, and the like whoſe fruit is
above the ground; but as for Artichoks, though
the fruit be above the ground, yet I thinke they
have no ſuch yearely ſetting, or manurance as
ſhould ſever them in intereſt from the ſoyle,
therefore they ſhall goe with it to the Heire.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider of things, though not
fixed to, yet uſually kept in houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and evidences, whereabout generally,
no doubt can be, but that they follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Land, ſo as if they touch inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
they pertaine to the Heire, if but Termes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49865:48"/>
Goods, Chattells, or Debts, they pertaine to
the Executor, yea ſo doe Statutes, and Bonds
in Law (howſoever otherwiſe in equity)
though they concerne the aſſurance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
of inheritance purchaſed. What if
<hi>A.</hi> morgage the inheritance of Lands to <hi>B.</hi>
upon Condition of redemption by payment
of 500. pound to <hi>B.</hi> his Heire, or Executor,
and <hi>B.</hi> dyeth, the Deedes being delivered into
his hands; now the Heire, not the Executor,
ſhall have them; for though the money may
be paid to the Executor, yet meane time the
Land deſcends to the Heire, nor is there any
debt to the Executor, for <hi>A.</hi> may chooſe to
pay, or not. Put it on the other ſide, that the
Land had beene ſold for 500. pound, not paid
to <hi>A.</hi> but a Condition that if not paid to him,
his Heire, or Executor, by ſuch a day, then
to re-enter; and <hi>A.</hi> dyeth, here is a debt to

hath beene queſtioned, but no where reſolved

ſome difference: Firſt, for that the Statute of

                  </note> but ſpeakes
generally of Treſpaſſe done to Teſtators; and
then brings in that particular of goods, as one
Inſtance. Now there be many caſes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
or enſamples given in acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which yet doe not reſtraine the remedy
or <hi>purven</hi> to that particular, or from extending
to other caſes, of like nature. Thirdly, the
Statute ſpeakes of Treſpaſſes remaining unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
which it meant to redreſſe: But it
ſhould ſtill leave many unpuniſhed, if it
ſhould have no larger extent, than to that one
ſingular treſpaſſe, of Goods taken away, <hi>viz.</hi>
moveables. Againe, the Teſtator was cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intituled to a recovery of dammages for this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49865:50"/>
other treſpaſſe, which if he had recovered,
ſhould have come to his Executor: Yea the
things themſelves, all if felled in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators
life, and part though not felled, ſhould
have come to the Executor, therefore alſo the
dammages recoverable in liew thereof, out of
which recovered, the debts and Legacies of
the Teſtator are to be ſatisfied. Beſides, this
Action of Treſpaſſe is a thing ſevered from the
ſtate of the Land, ſo as if the owner thereof
had, after this treſpaſſe done, aliened the Land,
yet had this Action remained to him, as I take
it, clearely. And why not as well as where a
Treſpaſſe is done upon the Land of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
and then the terme expires, this doubtleſſe
doth not take away his Action, nor his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.
But me thinkes here may be ſome
differences probably taken, as firſt betweene a
Treſpaſſe in deſtroying or taking away Come
growing, and a treſpaſſe in Graſſe, or Wood
growing: for the firſt being of that nature, as
that, though the Owner had a ſtate of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the Land wheron it groweth, &amp; ſhould
have dyed before ſeverance and felling, Yet
it ſhould have gone to the Executor, and not
with the Land to the Heire, therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
doth the Action for deſtroying or taking
away thereof, accrue by the operation of Law
to the Executor, in liew of the thing taken or
deſtroyed. Otherwiſe, perhaps of Wood or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49865:51"/>
Graſſe, Which by the Owners death ſhould
have gone to the Heire, and not to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
And yet here againe another difference
me thinkes may be betwixt Graſſe and Graſſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> betwixt that in Paſture and that in Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
yearely mowed and turned into Hay, not
leſt to be conſumed by the mouthes of beaſts,
as that growing in Paſture. For as the Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth
betweene theſe Soyles, gives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
to Meddow, and makes it waſte for
a Leſſee to Plough it up, not ſo for Paſture,
Yea Tithe is payed of Hay, but not of Graſſe
growing in Paſtures, ſo the Meddow Graſſe
being in the Owners purpoſe and intention, as
a thing ſevered from the ſoyle, ſhould mee
thinkes ſo be alſo in the eye, and eſtimation
of the Law, and therefore ſtand in a different
ſtate, and account from Paſture Graſſe. A
third difference may be in the manner of the
Treſpaſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Where the Meddow Graſſe
is eaten up with Cattell by a Treſpaſſer, and
where by him mowed and carryed away as
Hay, for in this latter caſe an Action of <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
and <hi>Converſion</hi> for ſo many loades of Hay,
is doubtleſſe maintainable by the Executor,
though it ſhould be admitted that in the other
caſe of conſumption by the mouthes of beaſts
without ſeverance, no action ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
by the Executor, which yet I admit
not, but thinke the contrary probable. For
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49865:51"/>
when Meddow ground, which yearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<hi>(Sol ſine homine generat herbam)</hi> ſhall
be ready to be delivered of her burthen, if a
ſtranger putting in an head of Cattell, which
ſwallow up, and tread downe this fruit of her
wombe, before the Mower with his ſithe, come
as a Midwife to helpe her delivery, if then by
the haſty death of the Owner, before Action
brought,<note place="margin">At leaſt me thinkes; Action upon the caſe here and before ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineable.</note> this great Treſpaſſe ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhable,
it were contrary, as me thinkes,
to the purpoſe of the ſaid Statute, and a great
defect in the Law. Yet here perhaps touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, a fourth difference may be, or ariſe
out of the time of the death of the Owner,
<hi>viz.</hi> where he dyeth before time of Mowing,
and where not; for <hi>Dato</hi> that in the former
caſe, becauſe, if ſuch deſtruction or conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had not beene; yet the Owner dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeverance, this ſhould not have come to
the Executor, but have gone with the ſoyle
to the Heire, that therefore the Executor, who
is not damnified ſhould recover no dammages.
Yet in the other caſe, the Owner living till
after Hay time clearely paſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> till
the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> me thinkes now ſince this
fruite of the Meddowes wombe ſhould have
beene a Chattell ſevered, had not this Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſer
made unlawfull prevention; Therefore
the Executor, to whom the ſame ſhould have
come, towards the performance of the Will,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49865:52"/>
ſhould have out of the ſaid Statute, an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and remedy, reached unto him to recover
recompence in dammages for this wrong done
in <hi>retardationem Executionis Testamenti.</hi> A
fifth and laſt difference may perhaps be in the
ſtate of the Owner, for <hi>Poſito,</hi> that where the
Land is his Freehold, or Copyhold Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
no Action ſhould be given to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor,
for Wood, or Graſſe taken or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his life time; yet where he is but Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for yeares, Guardian, or Tenant by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ſo as the very ſtate in the Land was to
come, and is come to the Executor (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Quicquid plantatur ſolo)</hi> me thinkes
the Executor ſhould have, together with the
ſtate in the ſoyle, the Action to puniſh the
Robber of, or Treſpaſſer upon the ſoyle. Thus
having ſcanned and ſifted, to the beſt of my
ability, all differences and circumſtances of
this point, how farre I am wide, and wherein
right, <hi>Aliorum ſit judicium,</hi> or rather, <hi>Altioris
esto judicii.</hi> But this is cleare, that whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Executors doe recover any dammages for
treſpaſſe or other wrong,<note place="margin">3. H. 6. 3. Litleton fo. 42. a.</note> done to their Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
the money recovered (at leaſt, if Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

not for payment of Legacies: and ſo, if it
were expreſſed to be for payment of Legacies
ſingularly, this ſhould not be Aſſets for debts,
as I take it. For ſince theſe are not Aſſets of
their owne nature,<note place="margin">See 9. El. Dy. 264<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſhall be accounted as any of the goods or
chattells of the Teſtator, which I conceive to
be all one, as to ſay, that they ſhould not be

Indeede, in neither of thoſe Bookes, is
there any mention of the clauſe in the ſaid
Statute; and it is poſſible that it might be
forgotten, as in other Caſes ſometime hath
happened. But caſting about how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
thoſe Bookes, with the ſaid Statute, and
not to ſuppoſe the ſame forgotten at both
times, both at the Barre, and Bench (though
being but a ſhort clauſe in the middle of a
large Statute to other purpoſe, it might well
ſo have beene) at the laſt, though not haſtily
I grew to conceive, that the ſaid clauſe being
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49865:55"/>
in an Act which limitteth the Fees of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and their Scribes, according to the value
of the goods of the deceaſed, and then bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in this clauſe, that the Lands willed to be
ſold, ſhall not be accounted as any of the
goods, &amp;c. The Parliament meant thereby
onely to exclude them to this purpoſe, that
they ſhould not be accounted as part of the
goods in the valuation, according to
which the ſaid Fees were to be rated;
and though the words be generall, that they
ſhall not be accounted as any of the goods,
&amp;c. yet is it the more probable, that the
Parliament meant no further then as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
becauſe that clauſe after the Fees limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in anſwerableneſſe to the values, is
brought in by a <hi>Proviſo, viz.</hi> provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
that if the deceaſed Willed any
Lands to be ſold, the money nor profits ſhall
not, &amp;c. And thus perhaps it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
and conſtrued in the ſaid late Queenes
time, though no mention be of any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

payeth the money due; now are theſe
reall chattells turned into Aſſets perſonall.</p>

                  <hi>tempore, Hen.</hi> 7. It was reſolved at
the laſt, that this redeemed chattell ſhould
not be Aſſets, but be to the Executor as his
owne proper goods, though at the firſt, three
Judges were of contrary opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the goods redeemed ſhould be in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
as goods of the Teſtator. And truely I
muſt confeſſe, that I cannot yet finde good
ſatisfaction in that <hi>Bookes</hi> reſolution, except
wee ſhall take the Caſe there to be ſuch as
that which is put and reported by the Lord
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49865:56"/>
                  <hi>Dyer, tempore Hen. 8. viz.</hi> that the money
payd for redemption, was as much as the full
value of the goods, pledged, or mortgaged,
or elſe ſhall admit the Caſe to be, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
was not by payment at the day
conditioned. As to the firſt, it were rare, that
any ſhould lend money upon a mortgage,
where the thing mortgaged, is not of better
value than the money lent: rare alſo, that an
Executor ſhould take care to redeeme with
his owne money, that which ſhould yeeld no
benefit or advantage to him, or his Teſtator.
Let us therefore ſcanne and examine the
Point, ſince the ſame may come frequently
in uſe; and this we may the more decently
doe, becauſe the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> in the Margent of
the Caſe by him reported, as aforeſaid, ſaith
expreſly, that the ſaid other <hi>temp. Hen.</hi> 7. was
not at all adjudged, himſelfe having viewed
the Roll, which he there ſets downe, and the
names of the parties. Wee will therefore
put the Caſe thus. <hi>A.</hi> poſeſſed of a Leaſe for
ſixtie yeares, of one hundred pound Land,
mortgageth it for five hundred pound; or be
it that the mortgage or pledge be of a Jewell,
or peece of Plate for halfe the value, and that
before the day limitted for payment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<hi>A.</hi> having made <hi>B.</hi> his Executor
dieth, and <hi>B.</hi> at the time and place maketh
payment, as was conditioned. Now the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49865:57"/>
queſtion is, whether this Leaſe, Plate, or
Jewell, being worth much more than the
ſumme for which it was mortgaged, ſhall be
in him wholly in his owne right, and to his
own uſe or partly, if not wholly as Executor to
<hi>A.</hi> ſo as to be ſubject to the payment of debts
and Legacies. Here it muſt be cleerely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that <hi>B.</hi> was inabled to this redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
onely, and meerely by the Condition
annexed to the mortgage, or pledging. It muſt
alſo be admitted, that this Condition, and
the power or intereſt to take benefit thereof
to him; came, and was derived onely as Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
of <hi>A.</hi> This being premiſed, it muſt needs
follow, as to me it ſeemes, that the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
working, and having his operation in the
redemption to deſtroy the Grant, mortgage,
or pledging, it muſt needs make theſe againe
the Teſtators goods, <hi>in ſtatu quod prius,</hi> and
ſo to be in <hi>B.</hi> as Executor; ſince in that right
onely, he was intituled to take benefit of the
Condition. For what is it which hindred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this, from being the Teſtators goods;
nothing certainely, but onely the force and
ſtrength of the mortgage or pledge: Now by
the redemption, that is become voyd, &amp; hath
it loſts its force; therfore the property of theſe
things muſt needs now be; as if no ſuch
mortgage or pledge had beene; or as if it had
at the firſt beene voyde, and of no force:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49865:57"/>
Thus muſt the Condition worke for him, who
made it, <hi>viz. A.</hi> the Teſtator, and thoſe of
the contrary opinion in the time of King <hi>Hen.
7.</hi> doe yet ſay, That by this redemption, the
Teſtator is ſo much in debted to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor,
as he disburſed for the redemption;
which could ſtand with no reaſon, unleſſe by
it the property and intereſt ſhould be reduced
to the Teſtators behoofe. That thus it is, is
alſo proved; as to me it ſeemes by the Caſe
of mortgage of Inheritance, upon which the
heire making payment, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
is not now in as a new purchaſor, but
as heire, ſo as he ſhall have his age, and be in
Ward, even for this Land: Yea, it ſhall be
Aſſets in his hands for ſatisfaction of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or other Anceſtors debts, which in
ſome reſpect is a harder Caſe than that of the
Executor; for he hath meanes to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of the money disburſed, either out of the
thing redeemed, or other goods of his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
but the heire hath no ſuch meanes. Yet
it will be asked, how the Executor can be free
from miſchiefe, for if this thing redeemed be
intire, as the Cup or the Leaſe, the whole will
be taken in execution for the Teſtators
debt. To admit this, yet here is one cleare
way of remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Executor may
before ſuch Execution, ſell the thing, and
ſo pay himſelfe, and retaine the ſurplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49865:58"/>
to the Teſtators uſe, and the like of this
is frequent in uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for Executors to pay
of the Teſtators debt, with their owne
money, and to make themſelves ſatisfaction
out of the Teſtators goods. Beſides, it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
that this redeemed thing ſhould be
thus in intereſt parted, that anſwerably and
proportionably to the ſumme disburſed for
redemption, with reference to the value of
the thing redeemed, a moyetie or third part,
or three parts therof ſhould be to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in his owne right, as his owne proper
goods, and the reſt in him as Executor. As
<hi>poſito,</hi> that <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> were Tenants in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of ſuch an entire Chattell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> maketh <hi>B.</hi>
his Executor and dieth. Now hath <hi>B.</hi> one
moyety as Executor, and another as his owne
proper, and upon a Judgement againſt him as
Executor, that moyety onely which hee
hath as Executor, muſt be taken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution;
and here may be remembred how
in execution of a Judgement, or levying of
an Amerciament out of an intire Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
of more value than the ſumme to be
levyed, the whole is to be ſold, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage
above the debt or Amerciament
is to be delivered backe to the owner. For in
all this debate, we muſt preſume the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
by the Executor, to be of better va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
than the ſumme payd, elſe wee may eaſily
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49865:58"/>
admit the whole to the Executor. Againe,
the Leaſe for yeares, is not ſo intire a thing; I
meane the Land let, but that thereof partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be made; yea inforced by Action
betweene joynt tenants, and Tenants in
Common: But here will be objected, the
Caſe of redemption by the daughter and
heire; who though ſhe have a brother borne
after; ſo as now ſhe is no longer heire, yet ſhe
ſhall, as the Booke ſaith, retaine the Land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from the heire as a <hi>Perquiſite</hi> or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.
As for this (which I will not oppoſe)
the Law ſo frameth to the favour of the
daughter, becauſe of great miſchiefe to her,
if being ſtripped of the reſt of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by the birth of a brother, ſhe ſhould alſo
loſe that which her money had redeemed,
without having any remedy to have her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
againe, or any recompence for it; but in
the other Caſe, there is no ſuch miſchiefe for
that the Executor may pay himſelfe as hath
beene ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now on the other ſide, if the Caſe ſhall be
underſtood, that the redemption was by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after the day, then will I eaſily admit that
the property or intereſt, is in the Executor to
his owne uſe; or that the Condition, now
having no power to reduce it backe, or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
any thing: It is rather a re-emption,
than a redemption, ſince it was at the Will of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49865:59"/>
the Mortgagee, to diſpoſe it at his pleaſure,
and any ſtranger, as well as the Executor
might thus have redeemed, <hi>viz.</hi> repurchaſed
it, therefore onely Equity and not Law in
that Caſe can make any part of the value Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets
in his hands: And ſo alſo I thinke if wee
ſhould admit in the other Caſe of payment, at
the day that the property of the chattell is to
the Executor as his owne, and not his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators
goods, no part of ſurpluſage of value,
can in Law be Aſſets, howſoever in Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Executor redeeme by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the day with the Teſtators owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or goods, none will doubt, but that the
thing redeemed is in him as Executor, and the
money by him payd for redemption is well
Adminiſtred, the goods redeemed being of
better value. But this way it makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
whether the whole value of the goods
redeemed, ſhall be held Aſſets; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
payd for redemption ſtand drowned
therein, or that that ſumme be ſtill adjudged
in the hands of the Executor, as Aſſets, and
onely the ſurpluſage of the thing redeemed
over and above the ſumme payd for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>

diſpoſe it at his pleaſure, no doubt can be
thereof, though the ſame fell not in poſſeſſion
to the Teſtator in his life time, yet no ſcruple
nor doubt can be, but that this is Aſſets to the
Executor, even whilſt it continues a remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and before it falleth into poſſeſſion,
becauſe it is preſently valuable and vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Nor much of other nature, to theſe
are the Caſes,<note place="margin">11. H. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35. per Babington.</note> where the Executor Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing
with the goods of his Teſtator, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
gaine thereof. So if the Sheepe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cattell of the Teſtator doe breed, <hi>viz.</hi>
beare Lambs, Calves, Colts, &amp;c. after the
Teſtators death, even theſe which were never
in the Teſtator ſhall yet be Aſſets, and ſo the
Wooll growing upon the Sheepe after the
Teſtators death. But there is one Caſe worth
the conſideration and worthy of ſome doubt,
as I thinke, and that is this. One leaveth
to his Executor a Leaſe for yeares of Land,
worth twenty pound by yeare, and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
keeping this in his owne hands, one
yeare after the Teſtators death, doth make
thereof thirty pound in cleare gaine above all
charges, now whether, as to a Creditor, this
whole thirty pound ſhall be Aſſets, or onely
twenty pound, and the Caſe ſimply thus put,
ſhall be underſtood of an occupying, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring
without any ſtocke of the Teſtators;
and then if the Executor did ſtocke it with his
owne Sheepe, or other Cattell, as he muſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49865:61"/>
have borne the loſſe by rot or death; ſo is it
reaſon, that if the manurants prove gainefull,
he reape the fruits thereof in recompence of
his adventure, and of his induſtry, skill, and
good husbandry. But if the Teſtators ſtocke
of Sheepe and Cattell were (as of neceſſitie,
or for the better advantage of the Teſtators
eſtate) continued upon the Leaſe Land, then
is it reaſon, that the gaine or loſſe whetherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of them God ſendeth, doe redound to the
Teſtators eſtate. Like Law, as I thinke, if
an Executor finding, that he cannot inſtantly,
after the Teſtators death, let the Leaſe Land
neare the value, ſhall therefore buy ſeede-Corne,
and hire the plowing, &amp;c. But it may
be ſaid, that the Leaſe hath one entire valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the firſt, upon the appraiſement. To this
I anſwer, firſt, that the value upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſement
is not binding, nor much reſpected
at the Common Law, if it be too high, it ſhall
not prejudice the Executor; if too low, ſhall
not advantage him; but the very value found
by Jury, when it comes in queſtion, whether
the Executor have fully adminiſtred, or have
Aſſets or not, is that which is binding. Next
I ſay, that if a long Leaſe come to Executors,
of Land worth an hundred pound by yeare,
and no ſale is made thereof by the ſpace of a
yeare or more, now the terme continuing of
the like value, as at firſt, it is no reaſon but
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49865:61"/>
this hundred pound raiſed the firſt yeare,
ſhould goe towards the payment of debts and
Legacies rather then any of them ſhould be
unpaid. This thing, I meane the knowledge

as Executor, are not to be taken in execution
for his owne debts either upon a Recognizance
Statute, or Judgement had againſt him. And
if ſuch a one dye indebted, leaving to his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
much Goods, which he had as Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
theſe are not Aſſets in his hands, lyable

Therefore a <hi>Quo min.</hi> brought by an
Executor, ſhewing that he was not able to pay
the Kings debt, becauſe the Defendant detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from him an 100. pound, which he owed
him as Executor to <hi>I. S.</hi> was overthrowne, for
that it could not be intended, ſaith the Booke,
that the Kings debt could be ſatisfyed with
that which the Plaintiffe ſhould recover, and
receive as Executor. Whereas a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſſeſſed of any Chattells perſonall, <hi>viz.</hi>
moveable Goods, all be deveſted out of her

dye, and ſhe overlive, they be not hers againe,
but her Husbands Executors, or Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and if ſhe dye, all be the Husbands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

of the Goods which ſhee hath as Executor,
theſe ſtill remaine in and to her, if her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

hath them as it were in another right, <hi>viz.</hi> as
ſhe repreſents the perſon of her Teſtator, her

            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">This may be in his name onely out of whoſe poſſeſſion the goods were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> whereas the Writ of Treſpaſſe
ſeemes to make no difference betweene ones
owne Goods, and thoſe he hath as Executor,
that being a poſſeſſory Action or ſuite groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the poſſeſſion; yet come to an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of debt, which more taſtes and participates
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49865:63"/>
of the right, and there are they differenced:
for where for my owne debt, when I ſue, the
Writ ſaith <hi>Debet &amp; detinet. viz.</hi> that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
owes me, and detaines from me that
ſumme. Yet when I ſue as Executor, the
Writ ſaith not,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. fo. 32.</note> 
               <hi>debet,</hi> he doth owe me, but
<hi>detinet</hi> onely, he detaines from me, as admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that he is not the Debtor to me, though
he ſhould pay me; and ſo where I am ſued as
Executor, the Writ makes me not a Debtor,
but a detainer; Otherwiſe, where in my owne
right, I owe and am ſued for a debt. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
where Judgement in an Action of
debt is given againſt one as Executor, it is not
generally that the Plaintiffe ſhall recover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, but he ſhall recover of the Goods
of the Teſtator, and therefore upon this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no <hi>Capias</hi> lyeth againſt him, to inforce
him to pay by Arreſt of his body, becauſe he
is not properly debtor, but if after it be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that he hath waſted the Teſtators Goods,
out of which the ſaid debt ſhall be ſatisfyed;
Then he having made himſelfe a Debtor, a
<hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> ſhalbe awarded, againſt
him, and then he ſhall be taken in Execution.
So alſo in ſome caſes of falſe plea pleaded, for
where the Judgement is <hi>de bonis propriis,</hi> the
Plaintiffe may have a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">34. H. 6. 43.</note>
and that Judgement is in diverſe caſes for the
dammages, although not in many for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49865:64"/>
As for the <hi>Capias</hi> before Judgement,

               <p>TO this head or Chapter, treating of the
difference betweene the Intereſt in Goods,
as Executor, and others had meerely in ones

hath at the firſt as Executor, may be changed
in property, and become the Executors owne
to his owne uſe, as other his goods, which he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49865:64"/>
had not as Executor. Here let us firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of ready money left by the Teſtator: for
ſince pieces of money, <hi>viz.</hi> ſhillings, groates,
pieces and halfe pieces of gold, cannot bee
knowne one from the other, it muſt needes
follow that theſe comming to an Executor
from the Teſtator muſt in ſome ſort be altered
in property, ſo as though the Executor ſhall
be ſaid to have ſo much in money or value, yet
can it not be diſcerned which money in his
houſe was his Teſtators, and which his owne.

poſſeſſion in the Executors, and ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of theſe Goods to their hands, as to
charge them with payment of debts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies,
yea to make their owne Goods lyable
inſtead of theſe, is a point worthy of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>And doubtleſſe, this throughly ſifted, will
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49865:75"/>
prove a caſe miſchievous, whether way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Law be taken, for firſt it muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that without the Executors laying his
hands actually and particularly upon the
Goods in the Houſe or Fields of the Teſtator,
whether the Executor hath reſorted, he ſhall
be ſaid ſo in poſſeſſion, as to ſtand lyable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Creditors, ſo farre as they extend in
value, though after, others purloyne or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſill
them. Now then if diſtance of place
ſhall make difference, where ſhall be the
bound and limit of that diſtance, and if the
Executor may come at a ſtrangers taking or
poſſeſſing of the Goods, it is miſchievous to
Creditors.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if it ſhall be ſaid upon
the Executors to anſwer for all the Goods
whereof the Teſtator dyed poſſeſſed, it will
be miſchievous for them and deterre them
from taking Executorſhip upon them, fince
much purloyning, may be even of money, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells,
and Goods by Servants and others,
about the Teſtator, or where theſe things be.
I thinke therefore, that if without any fraud,
colluſion, or voluntary conniving on the part
of the Executors, they be prevented by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
of laying hold on the Teſtators Goods,
ſo as that they may diſpoſe of them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
if it cannot be knowne by whom they
are ſo purloyned, and imbeſilled, or if they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49865:76"/>
be perſons fled, or inſolvent, that then they
ſhall not ſtand upon their ſcore, as Goods
come to their hands, in reſpect whereof, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
or Legatees ſhall draw ſo much from
them, even out of their owne Goods, as in
other caſes where they have, no ſuch excuſe
ſhall be.</p>
            <p>And of this minde I the rather am,<note place="margin">33. H. 6. c p. 1.</note> becauſe
I finde the whole Realme in Parliament, take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notice of ſuch prevention of Executors,
comming to the Goods of their Teſtator, by
the wrongfull act and imbeſilment of others,
without any default in themſelves. And in
this Caſe the Parliament hath given ſpeciall
remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> that Writs ſhall be directed to
Sheriffes, to make open Proclamation for the
appearance of the parties delinquent in the
Kings Bench, at the day limitted, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
thereof they ſhall be attainted there of
felony, the Writ being returned executed,
<hi>viz.</hi> Proclamation made. But note that this
Proclamation is to bee made two Market
dayes, within twelve dayes next after the
Delivery of the Writ, and the laſt Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
muſt be fifteene dayes before the day
of appearance. And theſe Proclamations
muſt be made in ſuch Cities, Burrowes, or
Places (ſaith the Statute) not expreſſing
what is meant by the word ſuch, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
meaning doubtleſſe thoſe in which the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49865:76"/>
act or offence is committed. So that if the fact
be not committed within the limits of ſome
City, Burrow, or Market Towne, no remedy
is to be had by the Statute; for that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
is to be made upon Market dayes,
in the place where, &amp;c. Now beſides other
Places, even ſome Burrowes, <hi>viz.</hi> Townes,
ſending Burgeſſes to the Parliament, have no
Markets, and ſo are no Places within the Act.
Alſo two Executors muſt require this Writ,
therefore where there is but one Executor, no
reliefe is given by this Law, for it is penall,
making felony, and therefore ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by equity beyond the Words. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it extends but to the Executors of Lords
and Perſons of good degree, and onely to the
Treſpaſſing ſervants of ſuch Perſons, not to
other ſtrangers, purloyning the Goods. But
now who ſhall be ſaid to be Perſons of good
degree, not being Lords, I will not much
labour to decide, the rather becauſe I have
not heard, nor read, to my remembrance, of
any Action brought upon this Statute, but I
thinke that good degree muſt ſtay either at a
Knight, being the loweſt dignity, or at a
Gentleman, being a degree of Worſhip, as
elſewhere is ſhewed, and not ſtoope any
lower.</p>
            <p>And the ſaid Statute ſeemes in ſome ſort
to imply an opinion this way, which I incline,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49865:77"/>
in that it expreſſeth this purloyning to be an
impediment of the execution of the Will,
whereas if the Executors ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll anſwer and
make good to Creditors and Legatees, out
of their owne ſtate and Goods, for theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſilled,
the execution of the Will is not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
but the Executors are damnifyed in
their owne private va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue, yet it may be ſaid
on the other ſide, that ſome things given in
<hi>ſpecie</hi> by the Will, ſuch a peece of Plate, ſuch
a Furniture of a bed or Chamber, ſuch a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
may be purloyned, ſo that the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
can never have them, and conſequently
the execution of the Wil be hindered, though
ſome recompence be made by the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
but how theſe Legatees ſhall recover re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence
in ſuch caſes; for that Legacies are not
to be recovered by Suite at the Comon Law,
I muſt leave to the Profeſſors of the Common
or Civill Law to informe. But if the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
be of ſecret aſſent to this imbeſilment,
whereof even the forbearance to ſue for the
recovery of the things, or the value of them
in dammages, if knowne where they, or the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſillers bee, is a ſhrewd evidence, or
proofe, Then ſhall the Executor be adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
an haver of them, and ſo ſtand charged
as having them, for <hi>Propoſſeſſore habetur qui

repaire to the place, where the goods were, to
put them in ſure Cuſtody; if I ſay, ſuch actor
keepe theſe goods from falling upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Executor, they ſhall ſurely fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelfe, and make him chargeable at the
Creditors ſuite, as an Executor of his owne

of their owne Eſtates for them? Surely herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <p>The firſt whereof I derive from our learning

and impriſoned, if ſuch be reſcued by
Alien enemies,<note place="margin">33. H. 6. 1.</note> the Sheriffe or Gaoler ſhall not

whom remedy is to be had by the courſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
and ſo ſhould I thinke it to be touching
Executors, <hi>viz.</hi> that if enemies landing (as

ſhall take away Cattell, or Goods from
an Executor, hereby he ſhall be excuſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe

be by ſubjects knowne and actionable.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49865:78"/>
Another difference I ſhall thinke may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be taken from the rules of our learning

and ſo if they be ſtolne from a Servant,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 4. f. 83, 84</note> or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
But if they be taken away by a knowne

hath beene, that the Keeper ſhall make recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,

of this latter I ſhould doubt, becauſe <hi>A.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
as well as <hi>B.</hi> may have this Action for
dammages againſt the Treſpaſſer. Now an
Executor is of the nature of ſuch one having
the cuſtody of another mans Goods, and I
have ſeene in a manuſcript entire, the Writ of
Treſpaſſer by the Executor,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> expreſſing goods
of the Teſtator in the Cuſtody of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to be taken from him; therefore me thinkes
he ſhould no otherwiſe be charged then <hi>B.</hi> to
whom Goods were as above is ſaid delivered
to be kept. For the Executor haply ſhall have
no benefit nor advantage by the Executor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
all the Goods not ſufficing perhaps to
pay debts, and Legacies, which is the ſtate
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49865:78"/>
we moſt thinke of, <hi>viz.</hi> where Goods want
to pay debts, and Legacies, for where there
wants not, the queſtion need not be made.
Yet a ſervant or Factor, who hath wages for
his ſervice, is not thereby made lyable to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
for things in his cuſtody ſtolne, becauſe
he hath not for this particular cuſtody, any
compenſation, ſo of an Executor, if perhaps
benefit might accrue to him by the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip,
as happely the diſcharge of a debt
owing by himſelfe, &amp;c. Other Caſes there
be, wherein the Executor will ſtand more
clearely diſcharged. As if the Teſtator left a
Leaſe for yeares, ſtate by extent, wardſhip,
or other Goods whereto he had but a defeſible
title, and they be evicted after his death. So
if he left a Ship at the Sea with much Goods
and Merchandiſes, which are drowned in the
returne, never arriving in ſafety.</p>
            <p>So alſo if he left a flocke of ſheepe, tainted
with the rot, which dye ſhortly after him, in
none of theſe three Caſes doubtleſſe ſhall the
loſſe fall upon the Executor. But to put a
Caſe of more doubt, what if a Leaſe for yeares
come to an Executor, ſubject to a Condition
for payment of Rent, or a ſumme in groſſe,
and the Executor failes in payment, whether
ſhall this loſſe fall upon the Executor, to be
made good to Creditors, or Legatees out of
his owne ſubſtance, or not? To this I muſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49865:79"/>
anſwer by this diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
had taken the profits of this Land ſo
long as to furniſh him with money for this
payment, or if he had other Goods of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators
in his hands to ſupply the payment,
then is it his default that the money is not
payed, and he muſt beare the ſmart thereof:
otherwiſe not, for he is not bound to make
payment out of his owne Goods,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> yet is he a
ſullen and unkinde Executor who will not ſo
doe, when as he may repay and ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by the profits thereof after. Like Law if
the Executor ſuffer a bond of a hundred pound
to be forfeite, for not paying of fifty pound,
having ſufficient in his hands. So alſo of a
Recognizance, Statute, or Judgement, defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanſed
upon payment of a leſſe Summe; yea,
a leſſe doubt of all theſe Caſes, then of the
forfeiture of the Leaſe for yeares, for haply
the Executor had time to have ſold the Leaſe,
and made money thereof, towards the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Debts, the omiſſion and neglect
whereof may be imputed unto him as a default
juſtly occaſioning recompence to be by the
Law required from him. But perhaps he may
excuſe himſelfe that he could not find a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who would give him to the value thereof:
hereunto yet reaſon can eaſily reply, that it
had beene much better to have ſold it under
the value, then to have loſt the whole value,

in any other caſe, where the Leſſor hath
not a good, and a firme title, but perhaps ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

the Leſſee cannot injoy the Land according
to his Leaſe. But this muſt be ſo underſtood,
that no eviction, or breach of Covenant, is in
the life of the Teſtator himſelfe, for if that be,
there is no queſtion, but the Executor ſtands
chargeable; and therefore if one make a Leaſe
of Land by Deed, wherein he hath nothing;
this Covenant is perhaps preſently broken, and
though the Leſſor dye before an action of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

            <head type="sub">Of the Order and method to be uſed by Executors
in paiment of Debts, and Legacies, ſo as to
eſcape a devaſtation or charging of
their owne goods.</head>
            <p>WE have gone through and diſpatched the
two firſt propoſed parts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Touching
the being of Executors, and the manner of their
being. 2. Their having, and the manner of their
having. We come now to the third part, <hi>viz.</hi> their
doing or diſpoſing of the teſtators eſtate.</p>
            <p>Now this conſiſts principally in the iſſuing of
money, though partly alſo in delivering or aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the execution of Legacies, not being mony,
but other goods or chattels bequeathed.</p>
            <p>Money is to be iſſued by executors, foure wayes
ordinarily.</p>
            <p>About the funerall of the teſtator.</p>
            <p>About proving his Will.</p>
            <p>In paying of debts.</p>
            <p>In paying and ſatisfying of legacies pecuniary.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, burials be as of neceſſity for two
reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of charity to the dead, that hee
may be Chriſtianly and ſeemely interred. 2. To
prevent and avoide annoyance to the living, who
by the very view of dead carkaſes, would both be
affrighted, and within a few dayes diſtaſted at the
noſe. We know that under the Law, the touching
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49865:91"/>
of a dead carkaſe made a man uncleane and to
need purifying: nor can we eaſily forget what the
ſiſters of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſaid to our Saviour touching
their brother, when hee had beene dead two or
three dayes: <hi>viz.</hi> that the taking of him then out
of his grave muſt needs bring a noyſome ſavour.
Hereabout therefore ſome expence is neceſſary,
and that not only for fees to be paid, which in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
amounts to a conſiderable ſumme, ſpecially
for ſuch as are to be buried within the Church, but
alſo otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Pall or Hearſe-cloath,
the ringing, &amp;c. As for feaſting, and banqueting,
it ſeemes not to me congruent to the ſadneſſe and
dolefulneſſe of the action in hand. But howſoever
that be yet where the teſtator leaves not ſufficient
goods to pay his debts, feſtivall expence is to bee
forborn, except the Executor will out of kindneſſe
beare it with his own purſe; for dead debtors muſt
not feaſt to make their living creditors faſt. I me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderable amount of funeral fees payable
in <hi>London,</hi> and ſurely (to let my thoughts fall back
upon it a little) it is worth conſideration, whether
in that kinde, and eſpecially for thoſe who dying
there, are yet carried into their countries to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
the exaction be not either unjuſt altogether,
or too onerouſly exceſſive, ſo alſo for much ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to the Canon made at the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the firſt yeare of King <hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing mentioned to juſtifie and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
expence, is the proving of the Will: But this
way a greater disburſement (except for riding
charges, or by reaſon of oppoſition by a caveat put
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49865:91"/>
in or the like) will not ſtand allowable then is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by the Statute made in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
whereby the fees of Ordinaries,<note place="margin">21. Hen. 8. cap. 5.</note> and their Scribes,
Regiſters, and Officers be limited. And it is ſtrange
that theſe bounds have beene ſo much and ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

law, as appeares by his book, ſaith that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ought to take nothing for the probate, if the
goods ſuffice not for funerall and debts; but hee
meanes only that conſcience is againſt it.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the third occaſion of disburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz.</hi> paiment of debts, which is the maine
part of our buſineſſe. We have before ſeene what
debts lye upon executors, having aſſets to pay
them; we are now to ſee in what order they muſt
pay them, as well <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſint fidi diſpenſatores<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as for
their owne indempnity, <hi>ne quid res ſua capiat detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti.</hi>
To put our ſelves into the better order or
method of handling theſe things, we will ſort out
debts into their ſeverall kinds thus.</p>
            <p>They are of theſe three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> either,</p>
            <p>Debts of or upon record.</p>
            <p>Or debts by ſpecialty.</p>
            <p>Or debts without ſpecialty.</p>
            <p>The debts upon record may be againe divided
into foure ſorts or kindes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49865:92"/>
Debts to the King or the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Debts by judgement or recovery in ſome court
of record.</p>
            <p>Debts by recognizance.</p>
            <p>Debts by ſtatute ſtaple, or ſtatute merchant.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe, the debts to the Crowne are to
have the firſt place or precedence, ſo as if there be
not come to the executor goods of greater valew
then will ſuffice for the ſatisfaction of theſe, he is
not to pay any debt to a ſubject, and if he be ſued
for any ſuch,<note place="margin">M. 33. &amp; 34. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. the Lady Walſingh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ms caſe in com. ba. &amp; Tr. 39. Eliz.</note> he may pleade in Barre of this ſuit
that his teſtator died thus much indebted to the
King, ſhewing how, &amp;c. and that he hath not
goods ſurmounting the value of that debt. Or if
the ſubjects purſuit be not ſo by way of action, as
that the executor hath day in Court to pleade,
but be by way of ſuing execution, as upon ſtatute
marchant, or ſtaple, then is the executor put to his
<hi>audita querela</hi> wherein he muſt ſet forth this matter.
And there is great reaſon why the Kings debts
ſhould thus be preferred before any ſubjects, <hi>viz.</hi>
for that the treaſure Royall is not only for ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
&amp; maintaining of the Kings houſehold, but
alſo for publick ſervices, as the warres, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the ſtatute, 10. <hi>Rich. 2. cap.</hi> 1. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is as I conceive, that <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith of the
treaſures or revenues Royall,<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Roborant coronam</hi>
they doe ſtrengthen or uphold the Crowne. And
for the like reaſon as I think, did God inact touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poſſeſſions of the Crown, that if they were
given to any other then the Kings owne Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they ſhould revert and come back to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49865:92"/>
Crowne the next Jubilee, which was once in fifty
yeares, <hi>ſed de hoc ſatis.</hi> But this priority of paiment
of the Kings debt before the debt of any ſubject,<note place="margin">21. E. 4 21, 22.</note>
is to be underſtood onely of debts by or upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
due to the King,<note place="margin">So muſt it bee pleaded, M. 33. &amp; 34. Eliz.</note> and not of other debts. If
any ask how the King ſhould have any debts which
ſhall not be of record, ſince by the ſtatute 33. of
King <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 39. it is inacted that all Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſpecialties taken to the uſe of the King
ſhall be of the ſame nature as a ſtatute ſtaple: To
this I anſwer, that there may be ſummes of money
due to the King upon wood ſales or ſales of Tinne,
or other his minerals, for which no ſpecialty is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
ſo alſo of amerſements in his Courts Baron,
or Courts of his Honours, which be not Courts of
record: The like of fines for coppyhold ſtates
there. So of the money for which ſtraies within
the Kings Mannors or liberties are ſold. Alſo as
the law hath lately beene taken and ruled in the
Exchequer, even debts by contract due to any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
are by his outlawry or attainder forfeitable
to the Crowne. Yet neither theſe nor thoſe due to
ſuch perſon outlawed or attainted by bond, bill,
or for arrerage of rent upon leaſe is or can be any
debt of record untill office thereupon found; for
although the outlawry or attainder be upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
yet doth it not appeare by any record before
office found that any ſuch debt was due to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
outlawed or attainted. Thus are not theſe
debts to the Crowne to have priority of payment
before the ſubjects debts, though the Kings debts
of record are ſo to have; ſo that if a ſubject to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49865:93"/>
whom the teſtator was indebted by ſpecialty ſue
for this debt, the executor muſt pleade that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator
dyed indebted thus much to the King by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,<note place="margin">And muſt plead the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in certain as was held in the caſe of the Lady Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, M. 33. &amp; 34. Eliz. but it ſufficeth to ſay, by a record of the Exchequer as was held Tr. 39. Eliz. in b. reg.</note>
more then which he left not goods to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;
if the truth of the caſe ſo be, for if there be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſatisfie both, then the ſubject creditor is
not to ſtay for his debt till the Kings debt be levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And if the ſubject creditor ſue execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſtatute, ſo that the executor hath no day in
Court to pleade this debt to the King, then is the
executor put to an <hi>audita querela,</hi> wherein he muſt
ſet forth that matter, and ſo provide for his owne
indempnity. But what ſhall we ſay of arrerages of
rent due to the King? ſurely where it is a feefarme,
rent, or other rent of inheritance, I ſee not how it
can come under the title of debt, ſince for it no
action of debt is maintainable ſo long as the ſtate
continueth in him to whom it grew due, and I find
that the <hi>Lo. Dyar, M. 14. Eliz.</hi> ſaid that the King
could but onely diſtraine for his rents, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
levie them of lands or goods; and that the
King by his Prerogative may diſtraine in any other
lands of his tenant our bookes tell us, but no more.
Yet I know it hath beene otherwiſe done of late in
the Exchequer, which if it have beene the ancient
and frequent uſe of the Exchequer, it will ſtand as
law though unknowne to the <hi>Lo. Dyar.</hi> Now rent
upon a leaſe for yeares differeth from the other,
ſince for the arrerages thereof an action of debt
lyeth, but how can either of theſe be debts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
when the not payment may be either in the
Court of Exchequer, or to the receiver generall or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49865:93"/>
particular? &amp; how then can there be any certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of the not payment, ſo as to make any certain
debt upon record? Wee know ſtatutes have beene
made to make the lands of receivers ſubject to ſale
for ſatisfaction to the Crown; and beſides that ſome
ancient Patents direct the payment of Fee-farmes
into the hands of Sheriffes, the ſtatute of Weſtm.
1. cap. 19. provides remedy for the King againſt
Sheriffes not anſwering the debts of the Crown by
them received: ſo as the Kings Farmer or debtor
may have paid his rent or other debt, and the
Crowne have not yet received it. Of Fines and
amercements in the Kings Courts of Record, there
is no doubt but they are debts of record.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the debts of ſubjects, and firſt
thoſe of record; touching which, I ſhall not be able
to hold ſo good a method, and ſo well to handle
things by parts as I would, for that the parts ſo
ſtand in competition one with another for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie,
as that they muſt of neceſſity thereabout
conflict and interplead one with the other, and
conteſt one againſt the other: yet for the Readers
better eaſe and ability to finde out that which may
concerne him in his particular caſe, I will in the
beſt ſort I can ſingle out theſe things into ſeverall
parts, and place them in ſeverall roomes or ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Firſt, conſidering how it ſhall ſtand between
one judgement and another had either againſt the
executor or teſtator. Secondly, how betweene
judgements and ſtatutes, or recognizances. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
how betweene recognizances and ſtatutes.
Fourthly, how betweene one recognizance and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49865:94"/>
another. Fifthly, how betweene one ſtatute and
another, adding to each ſome obſervations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
            <p>Now next to the debts of the Crown are judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or debts recovered againſt the teſtator, to
have priority or precedencie in payment, as being
of an higher nature, or more dignity than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that ſtatutes and recognizances, though
they make debts upon record, yet are they begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
but by voluntary conſent of parties, whereas in
every judgement there hath beene a courſe and
work of Juſtice againſt the will of the defendant,
as is preſumed; and this in a court of juſtice, and
the records of ſuch judgements are entred in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
rolls, not kept or carried in pockets or boxes
as ſtatutes,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. f. 28.</note> and untill inrolment recognizances are.
Therefore executors muſt take heed that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt their teſtators before debts any other

touching debts by judgement; yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
I will adde for the better information of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49865:97"/>
Reader, not ſtudied in the Law, theſe few things.
Firſt, that what hath been ſaid is only to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of judgements againſt the teſtator, and not
of any againſt the executor himſelfe, for of thoſe
being but debts by ſpecialty at the time of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators
death we ſhall ſpeak after. Secondly, what
is ſaid of the teſtator in caſe of an executor imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
is likewiſe to be underſtood of the teſtators
teſtator in caſe of the executor of an executor, for
where <hi>A.</hi> makes <hi>B.</hi> executor, and <hi>B.</hi> makes <hi>C.</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
there the goods which came from, or were
left by <hi>A.</hi> be not in the hands of <hi>C.</hi> lyable to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had againſt <hi>B.</hi> Nor on the otherſide, are the
goods of <hi>B.</hi> in the hands of <hi>C.</hi> ſubject to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had againſt <hi>A.</hi> And the like is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of ſtatutes, recognizances and bonds, as el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
is ſomewhat touched.<note place="margin">9. El. 4. 14. 15.</note> Thirdly, Recoveries
or judgements by meere confeſſion, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
are yet of the ſame nature, and to have the
ſame reſpect as other recoveries upon triall or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
for although they may ſeeme to be but
of the nature of recognizances which be <hi>debita re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quae. of arrera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of account before auditors without ſuit, for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Auditors, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

yet doe they differ from them, in that here
a debt is demanded by a declaration which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
true, &amp; that therefore the defendant cannot
deny it, but in caſe of a recognizance it is not ſo,
for there uſually no action is entred, nor debt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
Fourthly, the foreſhewed reſpect to debts
by judgement, is not to be incloſed within Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter
Hall-and be reſtrained to the foure Courts
there, but may and muſt extend it ſelfe to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in other Courts of Record, <hi>viz.</hi> in Cities and

Townes Corporate, having power by Charter, or
preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold plea of debt above forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as in London, Oxford, &amp;c. For although
there execution cannot bee had of any other
goods than ſuch as be within the juriſdiction of
that Court, yet if the Record be removed into
the Chancery by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and thence by <hi>Mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
into one of the Benches, ſo execution may
be had upon any goods in any County of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
Fifthly, in caſe where the teſtator was
bound in a recognizance and a <hi>Sci. fac.</hi> brought
againſt him, and thereupon judgement given;
Although this judgement be not <hi>quod recuperet;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quae. of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a writ of Annuity for arrerages after.</note>

                  </gap>nem,</hi>
yet ſince execution is the life, fruit, and
effect of all judgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this may now well ſtand
for a debt by judgement, as I take it.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Recognizances and Statutes.</head>
               <p>NExt unto debts by judgement, are thoſe by
ſtatute or recognizance to bee regarded
by the executor. And becauſe I find no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of priority or precedencie betweene theſe
two, I therefore ranke them together; yet one
reaſon of preferment given to judgments before
ſtatutes in <hi>Hariſons</hi> caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the one remains
a record upon the roll in the Kings court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other being carried in the pocket of the
couniſee is more private. This, I ſay, ſhould give
priority alſo to recognizances before ſtatutes, as
alſo another reaſon, for that ſtatutes are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49865:96"/>
records, but obligations recorded; yet do I
not find that this makes a difference for priority
of payment. And indeed the ſtatute is the more
expedite remedie, ſince thereupon execution
may be taken out without any <hi>Scire facias,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuit, which cannot be in the caſe of a recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance;

the executor may ſatisfie the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance

Neither is it materiall which of them were firſt

as touching the goods, though as touching

In none of theſe caſes is the executor hindred

               <p>NOw come wee to debts due by ſpecialty,
<hi>viz.</hi> bond or bill (of which nature the

courſe the executor muſt or may hold for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of theſe, admitting that the teſtator ſtood
not indebted by any record, or that no forfeiture
is of any ſuch debt, or that there be goods in the
executors hands above the amount of ſuch debts
by record. This I ſay <hi>dato,</hi> then according
to the rule <hi>proximus quiſque ſibi,</hi> the executor
may firſt ſatisfie himſelfe of ſuch debts, as the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator
by ſpecialty owed him: for ſuch debts
are not releaſed by the creditors taking upon

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49865:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other ſide if the creditor make his debtor execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
this is a releaſe of the debt. Although it be
given out or commonly ſpoken in the generall,
that an executor may firſt pay himſelfe, yet is it
to be underſtood with this caution or condition,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the debt to him be of equall height
or dignity with the debts to others according
to the rule <hi>inaequali jure melior eſt conditio poſſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
for if his teſtator were indebted to other men
by any ſtatute, judgement, or recognizance, and
to him whom he maketh executor only by bond,
or other ſpecialty, then may he not firſt pay
himſelfe, that is, by paying of himſelfe leave
them unpaid whoſe debts are of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but if there bee ſufficient for ſatisfaction
both to them and himſelfe, then is it not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
which be firſt paid. Now touching the debts
to other men the executor hath power to give
preferment in paiment to whom he will; ſo that
if the teſtator left but an hundred pounds, being
indebted to <hi>A</hi> an hundred pounds, and to <hi>B</hi> an
hundred pounds by ſeverall obligations, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor
hath power to pay <hi>B.</hi>

to leave <hi>A</hi> altogether unpaid any part of his

is to be taken and obſerved by executors, that if
the time of paiment upon the bond of <hi>B</hi> were
not come at the time of the teſtators death, then
may not the executors before the money to <hi>B</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

of the executor to pay whether of them he will,
ſo as the other may loſe his whole debt if the
goods will not ſuffice to pay both. What if <hi>A</hi>
have only by word demanded his debt, and not

whether doth that hinder that the executor

the ſummons might perhaps bee upon his land:
but if it were to his perſon, it is notice ſufficient,
and then to ſave himſelfe, hee muſt ſay that he
was not ſummoned till ſuch a day before which
hee had fully adminiſtred; yet doubtleſſe the
executor may be arreſted at the creditors ſute in
ſome ſort, which yet ſhall bee no ſufficient notice
of this debt. As for the purpoſe, if hee bee ſued
by <hi>Latitat</hi> out of the Kings bench, this ſuppoſing
a treſpas gives no notice of a debt, ſo alſo of a
<hi>Subpaena</hi> out of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> but the originall
returnable in the common plees expreſſeth the
debt, and ſo in ſome ſort doe the proces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
And therefore it ſeemes by ſome bookes,<note place="margin">So alſo was it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that if it bee laid in the ſame County, where the
executor dwels, he muſt take notice of it at his
owne perill. But this <hi>I</hi> take not to bee Law, nor
is there any great opinion that way: and although
to make it more cleere, the executor in King
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his time, eſtranging himſelfe
from notice of the ſute before payment to others,
did alledge that the action was layed in a forren
Country; that is no great proofe that if his abode
had beene in the County, where the action was
brought, hee muſt have taken notice; but thus it
was cleerer, and a little ſurpluſage hurts not. Now
betweene a debt by obligation, and a debt for
rent or dammages upon a Covenant broken, <hi>I</hi>
conceave no difference nor any priority or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49865:99"/>
but it is as the executors diſcretion to
pay firſt which he will, as if all were by bond. So
alſo of rents behinde and unpaid as <hi>I</hi> conceave,
but touching them principally intending rents
upon leaſes for yeeres divers conſiderations are
to be had, and ſome diſtinctions to be made, as
firſt, betweene rent behind at the time of the
teſtators death, of which that before ſaid is to bee
underſtood, and that which groweth behind
after next betweene ſute for the rent by action of
debt, and by diſtres and avoury. As to the firſt
difference, if the rent grew due ſince the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
death, then is it not accounted in Law the
teſtators debt, for onely ſo much is in Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
aſſets to the executor as the proffits of the
leaſe amounted to over and above the rent, ſo
as for that rent ſo behind the executor himſelfe
ſtands debtor, as hath beene reſolved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee is ſuable in the <hi>debet,</hi> and <hi>detinet,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
for rent behinde in the teſtators life, and all
other the debts of his teſtator hee muſt bee ſued
in the <hi>detinet</hi> onely. Hence it muſt follow as it
ſeemes, that an executor ſued for debt upon bond,
or bill, cannot (except in ſome ſpeciall caſes)
pleade a payment or recovery of rent growen
due ſince his teſtators death; though of rent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
at the time of his death it bee otherwiſe.
And yet heere againe another difference or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
is to bee taken, <hi>viz.</hi> where the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of the leaſe exceede the rent, and where the
rent is greater then the yeerely value of the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
for even there as elſe where is ſhewed, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49865:100"/>
executor if hee have aſſets, is tyed to the holding
of the leaſe, and payment of the rent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
doth ſo much of that rent as exceedes
the yeerely profit, ſtand in equall degree, the
teſtators debt with other debts by ſpecialty;
and yet againe to reconſider this point, what if
the debts of the teſtator by ſpecialtie payable
preſently at his death, or before the time that
any rent can grow due upon this Leaſe, ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to the full value of the teſtators goods;
may not then the Executor though hee doe not
pay thoſe debts before the rent day (for that
would make the caſe cleere) waive the terme;
for if he may, then happilie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he doe not ſo, but
ſhall by payment of any of this rent want goods
to pay any part of the debts by ſpecialtie, it may
lie upon himſelfe, and his owne goods, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
by his owne default. But on the one ſide
it may bee ſaid that hee could not waive it ſo
long as hee had aſſets, becauſe thereby hee ſtood
equallie liable to pay that debt being once due,
as the other debts by ſpecialty. On the other
ſide it may be ſaid that though the debts for rent,
and upon bond, ſhall bee admitted to bee in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
equall, yet the caſe being put of rent not due
at the time of the teſtators death, it was not
then a debt nor duty, whereas a Bond makes a
preſent debt, and duty, though not preſently
payable, the day of payment being not yet come,
ſo as this latter is diſcharged by a releaſe of debts,
or duties, and ſo is not the former. So to leave
that point unreſolved, let us next ſee whether in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49865:100"/>
ſome caſe, though the rent exceede not the
yeerely value of the Land, yet even that payable
after the death of the teſtator may not ſtand
in moſt part, if not wholie, upon the teſtators
ſcore as his debt, as well as if it had beene pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
before his death. <hi>Poſito</hi> then that the whole
or halfe yeeres rent is payable at the annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our <hi>Lady,</hi> and that the teſtator dieth
two or three daies or ſome like ſhort time
before that feaſt, now certainlie ſhould the
Law bee unreaſonable if it ſhould lay this debt
upon the executors ſhoulders in reſpect of
thoſe few winter daies proffits which he tooke.
But ſurely ſince the taking of the proffits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the Law to lay the rent upon the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
as his owne debt; therefore as where the
Executor had the proffits for the whole yeere
or halfe yeere, except ſome few daies incurred
in the teſtators life time: thoſe few daies will
bee unregarded according to the rule, <hi>De mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
non curat lex,</hi> &amp; the whole rent ſhall lie upon
the Executor as his owne debt. So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
part, where the whole yeere or halfe yeers
proffit except ſome few daies incurred after
the teſtators death, the rent becomming
payable ſo inſtantlie after the teſtators death
muſt in reaſon lie wholy upon the teſtators e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
as to me it ſeemes. What if to this I adde
that the teſtators cattell wherewith the ground
was ſtocked doe depaſture, and devoure the

and the teſtator dieth a few daies after <hi>Mich.</hi>

                  </gap>d that the Executor
ſhall for this winter proffit pay the rent out of
his owne purſe, eſpeciallie if the whole yeeres
rent bee payable at that one day as in ſome
caſes it is; or if the whole yeeres proffits were
taken in the ſummer as in caſe of a leaſe of tithes,
it is ſo alſo of medow grounds uſually drowned
in the winter. So if the leaſe bee then to end
not having a ſummer halfe yeere to ſucceede,
and make amends for the winter: or if the
winter halfe yeere bee the latter halfe, the leaſe
beginning at <hi>Lady</hi> day, ſo that there is but a
ſummer for each winter following, and not
any for the winter paſſed. Of like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with theſe is the caſe of a leaſe of woods
for a rent, which being fellable but once in
eight or nyne yeeres; now if the leſſee, having
made the laſt ſale and felling before his death,
the Law ſhould caſt the rent upon the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
owne eſtate for the time future, it ſhould
lay loſſe upon him, which is againſt reaſon, and
contrary to the nature, and diſpoſition of the
Law even in this particular. As appeares by
this, that ſhee enables an Executor to pay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
before any debt of equall nature, ſo as ſhee
more tenders an Executors indempnity then
any other Creditors; therefore I thinke that
with, and upon the differences above ſhewed,
even rent growen due after the teſtators
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49865:101"/>
death may in ſome caſes bee the teſtators
debt payable equally with debts by bond.
But here I conceive that if the executor were
in ſuch caſe of deſtitution of aſſets as might ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
his waiving of a leaſe over-rented, hee
then may waive theſe termes reſidue, becauſe
for the future the profits will come ſhort of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the rent, though at the firſt, and ſo in
the totall, the profits did exceed the rent. And
if for want of waiving, where he might, this
rent fall upon him, the paiment thereof would
be no excuſe againſt another creditor, nor as to
him be a good adminiſtration, for <hi>Ignorantia
juris non excuſat.</hi> This is pertinent to our preſent
conſideration, which debt may with ſafety be
paid, leaving another unpaid; and the hazard
of executors, by ignorance of the Law hath
been a principall motive to my writing theſe
Diſcourſes in Engliſh. Hitherto we have only
conſidered, as I think, of rents, as they be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
by action of debt. Now let us ſee if
there may not be ſomewhat different conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
touching diſtraining for rent, and ſo
comming to recover it by avowrie. Put wee
then the caſe that an executor hath fully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
in payment of debts by bond, and
after the leſſor or revertioner commeth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth
for arrerages of rent due in the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
life; can the executor in bar of the avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
plead fully adminiſtred, as hee might have
done if an action of debt had been brought for
theſe arrerages? doubtleſſe I think no, nothing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49865:102"/>
ſhall hinder the levying of the rent upon
the land ſo long as it is enjoyed under
the title of the leaſe, except the land come
to the King, upon whoſe poſſeſſion no diſtreſſe
can be taken: I think therefore that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
who paid out of his own purſe to the value
of this leaſe (for to I intend the caſe, and elſe
could he not have fully adminiſtred, as in the
caſe was put) he ſhould, I ſay, have abated in
the price and valuation of the leaſe, as well the
arrerages of rent, as the rent futurely pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
both being equally leviable upon the
land, and if he ſo have done, he is no loſer by
payment of this arrerage: but if truſting to the
power of an executor, and to the plea of fully
adminiſtred hee did not ſo, but disburſed in
reſpect of the leaſe to the full value without
ſuch abatement, he muſt beare the loſſe of his
owne ignorance. He might alſo another way
have helped himſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> by payment of that
arrerage, leaving other debts by ſpecialty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid.
And what if ſuits were preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſed
upon the teſtators death before hee
could make payment of the rent behind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might the executor then plead this debt
for rent, as hee might a debt by judgement or
ſtatute, and ſurely me thinkes it probable that
he might, becauſe it is a debt from which hee
cannot be freed by payment of the other debts
ſued for by ſpecialtie. If the revertioner would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
alſo commence ſuit before judgement had for
the creditor by ſpecialty, then might the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49865:102"/>
helpe himſelfe by confeſſing his action
firſt; but this perhaps the revertioner would
not conceive ſafe for him, ſince that way the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might get judgement before him, and ſo
he might loſe both his ſuit and his debt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
holding himſelfe to the courſe of diſtres, the
leaſe continuing, he hath land at the ſtake, for
his debt. What if he diſtraine and avow? may
not now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>tion or avowry, ſo as he firſt having
judgement, may firſt be ſatisfied. Surely after
ſuite commenced, I ſee not how the creditors
by bond can ſo be prevented, at leaſt without
judgement had for the rent; yea, though ſuch
a judgement be had, yet becauſe the judgment
in that caſe is not that hee ſhall recover the
ſumme due for rent, but only that he ſhal have
a returne to the pound of the cattell diſtrained
for the rent, it is queſtionable whether the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereupon of the rent ſhall prevent the
judgements after had in the ſuits upon bonds.
But I thinke it ſhall, becauſe although it bee
not an expreſſe recovery of the rent, yet is it
ſuch a judgement compulſary for the ſame, as
makes the payment inevitable and of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And where before we have made the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
only between the ſaid rent-debt, and the
debt by obligation: let us now put the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the rent-debt and the debt by ſtatute or
judgement. If then the leſſor after death
of the leſſee diſtraine for the rent behind part
of the teſtators cattell, and after there comes a

Secondly, for that this rent incident to, and
deſcendible with the reverſion, breeds a debt
of a reall nature, and ſo of more dignity and
worth than debts perſonall. Thirdly, for that
the land let (as in a ſort debtor) ſtands charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with this diſtres from the very time of
making the leaſe, as either by a contract real of
<hi>quid pro quo,</hi> or rather by an operation of law or
legall conſtitution, or ancient cuſtome of the
Realme, without any contract of perſons. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that the leſſor doth not diſtraine the
cattell therefore, or in that reſpect for that
they are or were the goods of the teſtator, but
for that hee found them levant and couchant
upon the land, which muſt afford his rent,
or a diſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perhaps object this reaſon why theſe impoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
cattell ſhould be delivered in execution,
<hi>viz.</hi> for that where otherwiſe the creditor by
ſtatute or judgement ſhould loſe all or part of
his debt, yet by this releefe done to him ſhall
not the leſſor loſe his rent, for that he may at
any time after diſtraine any goods or cattell
found upon the ground at any time during the
continuance of the leaſe. But here beſides the
point of delay and ſtay for this rent, which to
many is the ſole meanes of maintaining their
houſeholds and families; this further is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
that perhaps the leaſe may be neere
expiring, perhaps ſo highly racked and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
even to or above the value, as that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
having his teſtators ſtock taken from it
and him by execution will not ſtock it any
more, and ſo the land lying freſh, if the leſſor
ſhall loſe the benefit of his former diſtres, he
ſhall be perhaps without remedy for his arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
of rent. And if the caſe were of a diſtres
for rent behind after the teſtators death, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
though not ſo ſtrongly, for moſt of the
reaſons aboveſaid, that the law would be all
one as in the other caſe; for though in this caſe
reſpect ſhall not be had to the executors loſſe
upon whoſe goods the law caſts this debt,
though not the other, yet here the point of
loſſe muſt fall either upon the leſſor loſing
his diſtreſſe, or upon the other creditor by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialiy
or record loſing wholly or in part his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49865:104"/>
debt. And in reſpect of this locall tye upon
this land for paiment of the rent whereto even
the fealty of the leſſee and tenure of the land
bindeth him, and it I think no act that the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
can do by entring into bonds or ſtatutes, or
having judgements againſt him can hinder the
leſſor or reverſioner from taking his remedy
upon this leaſed land for the rent therefore
due, but rather any other creditor ſhall be a
loſer in his debt. Doubtleſſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in barre to the
avowrie for this rent due either before or ſince
the teſtators death, the executor will plead
that the teſtator was indebted a thouſand

which is more then all his goods amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>THat which S. <hi>Paul</hi> of diſpenſers ſpirituall
who are as it were the executors of the
laſt will and teſtament of our Saviour Chriſt
doth ſay or enjoyne, <hi>viz.</hi> that they muſt be
found faithfull; The ſame is required of theſe
leſſe or inferiour diſpenſers, the executors of
mens Wils, and hereof they are to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
not only in reſpect of eſcaping damage to
their owne eſtates, but more eſpecially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of an oath which divers of our bookes
mention to be taken by executors. And in
one of the bookes of relations of caſes in the
twentieth yeare of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 7. his time, there is an
expreſſion of three things whereto the office
of an executor tyeth him. 1. To doe truly, and
thereto are they ſworn, ſaith this book. 2. To
be diligent, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſedulity to attend the
diſcharge of the truſt. 3. To do lawfully; nor
well can this latter be without knowledge
what is lawfull or required by the law. Now
what is formerly ſaid of the right method and
order of paiment of debts, diſcovereth in
much part how and by what wayes an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
may waſte and miſpend his teſtators goods
and conſequently incurre a devaſtation, and
ſo make his owne goods liable, but of that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49865:106"/>
more fully and particularly by it ſelfe, and
herein we will conſider of theſe parts.</p>
            <p>1. What ſhall be ſaid to be a waſting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſting,
and how many wayes that may be
done.</p>
            <p>2. Who ſhall by this act be charged to
yeeld recompence.</p>
            <p>3. Who ſhall take the benefit or advantage
of it.</p>
            <p>4. How farre or in what meaſure the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
ſhall be taken.</p>
            <p>5. What way or by what meanes it ſhall
be had.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, this waſting is done divers
wayes. 1. by the executor his plaine, palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and direct giving, ſelling, ſpending, or
conſuming the teſtators goods after his owne
Will leaving debts unpaid. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By paying what
is not to be paid, which yet is to be underſtood
where there are debts payable and unpaid.
3. By the way formerly diſcourſed of, <hi>viz.</hi> the
not obſerving the right method and order of
payment. 4. By aſſenting to a legatees having
a thing bequeathed, debts being unpaid. 5. By
ſelling goods of the teſtators at an under value,
for be the appraiſement what it will, and let
him ſell for what he will, he muſt ſtand charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the beſt and utmoſt value towards the
creditors. Yet if upon a judgement againſt
the teſtator or the executor, the Sheriffe ſell
ſome of the teſtators goods at an undervalue,
this is no vaſtation of the executor, for this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49865:106"/>
difference <hi>Hody</hi> chiefe Baron makes. But ſince
an executor may happily prevent this act of the
Sheriff by paying the due ſum upon ſale of the
teſtators goods at the beſt value or otherwiſe,
he is to be blamed to leave it to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience
of the Sheriffe or Underſheriffe rather. 6. And
laſtly this may be done to the executors ſmart
by undue, <hi>viz.</hi> not legall diſcharging of any
debt or duty pertaining to the teſtator, &amp; that
divers wayes requiring heedfulneſſe. As if an
executor upon a bond of two hundred pounds
forfeited for payment of a hundred pounds
accept the principall, or perhaps alſo ſome
uſe, coſts, or damage, and give a releaſe or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall
of the whole forfeited bond, or of all

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt.</note> and ſo far his owne goods ſtand lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to creditors not ſatisfied; and ſo doubtleſſe
is it if he doe but give up the bond having no
judgement upon it, though he neither make
releaſe nor acknowledge ſatisfaction. But his
verball agreement to require or ſue for no
more, or his giving a note, of receipt for ſo
much as he hath received, or delivering of the
bond into a friends hands, or into a Court of
equity in way of ſecurity to the debtor that he
ſhall not be ſued for more, is no devaſtation,
ſince ſtill the reſt in law remaines due and ſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
So this ſets no more upon the executors
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49865:107"/>
ſcore then he received. But let him take heed
of releaſing except he be ſure there be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
debts demandable. Nor only is there
danger in releaſing of debts, but of treſpaſſes
or other cauſes of action alſo. As if one take
away goods from the teſtator or from his
executor; If the executor make him a releaſe,
this is a devaſtation, and makes his owne
goods lyable to the whole value of the goods
releaſed, as appeares by <hi>Ruſſels</hi> caſe, where
the releaſe of an Infant executor to one
who had taken and committed to his uſe
Jewels and goods of the teſtator being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the releaſe was therefore held void in
reſpect of nonage, for that if it ſhould have
ſtood good, it had amounted to a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi>
and made the executors owne goods lyable,
which his infancy conſidered had been hard.
Another way of diſcharging, dangerous to
executors, is ſubmitting matters of debt
or duty, or touching goods taken away to
arbitrement. For if by the award of the
arbitrators the debtors or wrong doers bee
diſcharged or acquitted without making full
recompence, the reſt of the value will as
to other creditors ſit upon the executors
skirts, becauſe it was their voluntary act
thus to ſubmit it to arbitrators. Thus may
executors fall under prejudice, not onely by
wilfull waſting or unfaithfull miſcarriage,
wherein they are not to bee pittied, but
through incogitancy and unskilfulneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49865:107"/>
Nay, I may ſay truly that it is very
hard for executors in ſome caſes to walke
ſafely: For beſides that to finde out all
judgements and recognizances by or againſt
their teſtators, is of ſome difficulty more
then for ſtatutes, whereof by ſearch in an
Office deſcry may be had; yet with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that ſtatutes marchant, and ſtatutes
ſtaple may be and ſtand effectuall againſt
executors, though not inrolled, albeit againſt
purchaſers of the conuſors land they be not
of force, if neglect be of inrolement within
three moneths. But where ſtatutes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizances
lye for performance of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
upon ſale or leaſe of lands, mariage,
agreements or otherwiſe; how hard is it for
executors to know whether any covenant be
broken or not; how hard to be ſure they
finde out all bonds, bils, covenants, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in writing made and kept by others,
whereby any money is due and payable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
debts by contract or legacies: as alſo
all promiſes or debts by contract payable
before legacies: For the law hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
no time for their claime and demaund,
and whether ſome ſuch thing or meane of
publication were not fit to be enacted, let
the judicious conſider. To attaine to this
knowledge of the teſtators debts, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that it is by the Lord <hi>Brooke</hi> reported,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49865:108"/>
that in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his time, Sir <hi>Edmund
Knightley</hi> being executor to Sir <hi>William Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
made Proclamation in certaine Market
Townes that the creditors ſhould come by
a certaine day and claime and prove their
debts, but hee for this was committed to
the Fleet and fined. For that none may
make proclamation ſaith the book, without
warrant or authority from the King, except
Majors and ſuch like Governours of Townes,
who by priviledge or cuſtome may ſo doe.
But the dangers are only where there is not
ſufficient of the teſtators goods and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
to ſatisfie both debts and legacies. For
where there is ſo, the executor is not in any
ſuch hazard as aforeſaid. This deſcry of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
may breed caution, and <hi>Qui timent cavent
&amp; vitant.</hi>

and the Shriefe upon the <hi>Fieri facias,</hi>
returning that there were no goods, of the
Teſtator in the Executors hands, and then this
Executor dying; A <hi>Scire fac.</hi> upon a ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion

have beene cleare, that if a devaſtation had
beene returned in the life time of the ſaid <hi>Waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>

not having any thing left to ſatisfy any of the

to none but <hi>A.</hi> who was a Creditor by Statute,
and therefore hee onely ſhall make this Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
to pay the like ſumme out of his owne
goods, ſince as to him only this is a devaſtation,
for that it was his election, to pay of thother
Creditors; which hee would, no ſute being
commenſed by any of them; conſequently no
wrong was done to <hi>B.</hi> nor <hi>C.</hi> And if no ſuch
debt had beene by Statute but all had beene
Creditors by ſpecialty, and <hi>A.</hi> onely had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſed

now if after hee payed all to <hi>D.</hi> hee ſtands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <hi>Capiat qui capere poteſt, viz.</hi> hee
who firſt could recover, or by the voluntary
act of the Executor, could obtaine payment,
muſt bee preferred: if the ſumme would reach
no further. For it ſhall by this miſ-payment,
or miſconverſion ſtand with the Executor,
as if hee had not payed it nor departed from it
at all upon the matter, and therefore <hi>I</hi> doubt
not but it is free for him to give the advantage
of this his error, to which Creditor by ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49865:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hee will, ſo as hee ſhall ſtand free from all

               </gap>uſage remayning, nor any
Creditor of record being. For if there bee any
debt upon record, the Executor ſued by a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
upon Bond may notwithſtanding this his
waſting plead in Barre of this ſute; that there
is ſuch a record of a debt not ſatisfied, and
that hee hath no more then that debt amounts
unto, and ſo admit ſo much ſtill in his hands
as hee hath miſadminiſtred, though in kinde it
bee not in his hands, but miſpent, or unduly
payed, as aforeſaid. And what is before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Statutes precedency before Bonds,
in taking the advantage againſt an Executor for
devaſting or waſting; the ſame is to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of precedency of judgements before
Statutes, and debts to the King before judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ourth point, <hi>viz.</hi> how far
the Executor thus waſting ſhall incurre dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or make his own goods liable: Doubtles
no further then the value of the Teſtators goods
waſted or miſ-adminiſtred. Therefore if one
have advantage thereof to the full ſumme, no
other after ſhall, for hee is no further a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſer
or wrong doer, nor is the Teſtators eſtate
any further, or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>epelier damnified. And as
damages for treſpas are to bee proportioned to
the value of the wrong done, and loſſe ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
So alſo in this caſe the Executor by his
miſdoing, doth not draw upon himſelfe his
Teſtators whole debts, but ſo much onely as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49865:110"/>
the goods amounted to, which hee did miſ-adminiſter,
and which ſhould have gone to
the payment of the Teſtators debt, if hee had
not ſo miſguided himſelfe in the office of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutorſhip,
which default hee muſt repaire or
make good.<note place="margin">41. E. 3. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> b.</note> And this proportion ſeemes to me
prooved by the Caſe in King <hi>Edward</hi> the third,
where the value or quantity is found, ſpecially
of the goods adminiſtred wrongfully; though
there by a wrongfull perſon, and in <hi>Suttons</hi>
caſe it was expreſly held that each Executor
ſhould anſwer for ſo much as he waſted.</p>
            <p>Now for the fift, and laſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> how
and in what manner reliefe ſhall bee had upon
this point of waſting, for him to whom it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
firſt this is to bee obſerved that in caſe
where the verdit paſſeth directly againſt the
plaintife, no devaſtation can come in queſtion,
for that no judgement being for the plaintife,
no writ of execution can iſſue, and therefore
if upon the iſſue of fully adminiſtred it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that there hath beene a devaſtation
which cauſeth aſſets to faile,<note place="margin">Paſ. 36. Eliz. in 6. reg.</note> then muſt the
Iury finde that the defendant hath aſſets, and
not finde a devaſtation, as was reſolved in the
Kings Bench in the late Queenes time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Hankeford</hi> and <hi>Metford,</hi> for there the
jury finding a devaſtation, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſurrender of
a leaſe for yeeres, left by the Teſtator, it was
held voyd, and nugatory, and was not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Court, which ſaid that muſt come

fac.</hi> Thus aſſets being found in the Executors
hands, judgement is given for the plaintife to
recover his debt, and to have it levied of theſe
aſſets; nor is this finding of them by a jury
againſt truth, though they bee waſted, and ſo
not to bee had in kind: for the Executor hath

As in the caſe firſt put, this waſting can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come in queſtion for want of a judgement
for the plaintife, ſo alſo where the judgement
it ſelfe extendeth to the Executors owne goods
by reaſon of ſome falſe plea whereof wee ſhall
after conſider, for ſince that the conſequence,
and effect of a vaſtation is but to make the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
owne proper goods liable to the debt
of the Creditor, this is altogether needleſſe
where the judgement it ſelfe hath layed hold
on his goods. But now in caſe where the
judgement extends onely to the Teſtators
goods in the Executors hands, let us finde the
way to releive the Creditor, in caſe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators
goods bee waſted by miſadminiſtring
or otherwiſe, for hereabout the right way
hath often beene miſſed, and againe eaſily may
bee. In the latter end of the late Queenes
time this courſe was taken,<note place="margin">45. Eliz. Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifers caſe.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> the Sherife
returning generally that the Executor had no
goods,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. fo. 32</note> a ſurmiſe was entred that the Executor
had converted to his owne uſe the Teſtators
goods, whereupon a writ was awarded to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49865:111"/>
Sheriffe to enquire thereof by jury or enqueſt,
which he did, and returned that it was found
that the executor had waſted the goods; and
thereupon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> was awarded againſt
the executor, to ſhew cauſe why execution
ſhould not be of his owne goods, and upon
two <hi>nihils</hi> returned, execution was ſo awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but a writ of error was hereupon brought.
And although it were ſaid for defence of that
courſe that it was uſuall in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Pleas,
and more favourable than the other courſe,
where the Sheriffe only returneth the waſting,
or is ſole judge thereof, whereas here it was
found by an inqueſt of Jurors, and thereupon
a <hi>Scire facias</hi> awarded; yet did the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the contrary, and reverſe this execution
as erroneous: For it was ſaid that upon the
Sheriffes returne of <hi>nulla bona, viz.</hi> that there
were no goods of the teſtator to be found, the
plaintiffe ſhould have a ſpeciall writ of <hi>Fieri

neither ſheriffe doing according to the inqueſt,

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49865:112"/>
upon iſſue joyned, but an inqueſt of office,
which excludeth alſo all challenge of jurors.
And whereas that booke mentions the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes
ſubjection to action onely in caſe of his
miſ-feaſance or doing wrong, I conceive that
hee is likewiſe ſuable for omiſſion or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſance
in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for not levying the
debt upon the executors owne goods where
proofe is made of his waſting. And where the
booke mentions this <hi>Fieri facias</hi> to bee in this
manner upon the Sheriffes returne in a <hi>Scire
facias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. 32.</note> doubtleſſe the booke therein is miſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and ſhould be a <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> for in a <hi>Sciri
facias</hi> the Sheriffe can returne nothing but that
he hath warned the party, or that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

is the courſe there preſcribed, that firſt a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Fieri facias</hi> go out, and that thereupon the
Sheriffe returne generally that the defendant
hath no goods of the teſtators, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the ſaid ſpeciall writ is to iſſue; yet in
the beginning of the late Queens time the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
paſſing for the plaintiffe upon the iſſue of
fully adminiſtred,<note place="margin">2. El. Dy. 185. Woodw. and Chicheſters caſe.</note> the Sheriffe was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to make ſuch a generall return of no goods
to be found of the teſtators, but was inforced
by the Court upon good adviſement, either to
leavy the debt, or to returne a <hi>Devaſtavit;</hi> and
ſo was done at laſt by the Sheriffes of London
much againſt their minds; and therupon went
out a writ to leavy the debt of the executors
owne goods, firſt into London, and after into
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49865:112"/>
Devonſhire, upon a <hi>Teſtatum</hi> that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

that if no goods could bee there found, then
the plaintiffe might have a <hi>Capias</hi> to take the
executors body in execution, or an <hi>Elegit</hi> for
the moiety of his lands. But certainly I cannot
find (except with a difference) how this courſe
of inforcing the Sheriffe to doe one of theſe
two can be juſt; as neither could Juſtice <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp,</hi>
               <note place="margin">11. H. 6. f. 38.</note>

underſtood of goods moveable, and not of
lands. This then thus being, if a Jury of Kent
find aſſets which be in London or Eſſex, how
can the Sheriffe of Kent, where the action was
laid, leavy the debt recovered by or out of
theſe goods; or ſince he cannot, why ſhould he

ſince even his oath tieth him to make a

finding aſſets generally, and this ſo returned
upon a <hi>Teſtatum,</hi> the proceſſe may be directed
into the right County. But in the ſaid caſe it
was replied to the plea of fully adminiſtred
that there were aſſets in Eſſex, the action being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49865:113"/>
laid in Middleſex, and yet as it ſeemes by the
booke, the triall was to bee by a Jury of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,
which, ſaith the booke, may find the
aſſets in Eſſex; but there the plea was demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon, and held a good plea, which proves
that although the tranſitorineſſe of the aſſets
make them ſubject to the notice of a forren
Jury, yet is it not like an act tranſitory and not
locall, for that muſt be pleaded to be done in
the place where the action is laid, though in

               <note place="margin">2. El. D. 185.</note> the judgement was had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

betweene all theſe, &amp; that of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> there is a

therefore the <hi>Fieri facias</hi> to leavy the debt of

there is no other of right to be ſued. As if one
take goods wrongfully fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a right execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
or adminiſtrator; This (though he convert
them to his owne uſe) makes him not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor

executor or adminiſtrator, who even for
theſe goods once Aſſets in his hands ſtands ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to ſuits of creditors, they being neither
lawfully evicted nor rightly adminiſtred:
But in caſe there had beene no executor at that
time, or no Will proved nor adminiſtration
committed, then ſuch taking of the deceaſeds
goods into a ſtrange hand had made an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip
by wrong.<note place="margin">L. 5. E. 472 a. Tr. 2. Jac. in com. b.</note> And thus was the difference
lately reſolved,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. 33 &amp; 34.</note> as is reported by the <hi>Lord Cooke</hi>
in the caſe betweene <hi>Reade</hi> and <hi>Carter</hi> in the
Common Place.</p>
            <p>Yet this further difference was there held,
<hi>viz.</hi> that although there be an executor or
adminiſtrator by right, yet if a ſtranger take
upon him to receive debts and make acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
or to pay debts claiming to be an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
he is ſueable as an executor by this act:
and ſo alſo in the late <hi>Queenes</hi> time was held by
6. Juſt.<note place="margin">1 El. D. 166. b.</note> as touching the receipt of debts and
making acquittances, but the book mentions
not whether any other executor then were, or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49865:117"/>
not. But in the point of bare payment of debts
Frowick makes another difference,<note place="margin">H. 20. 7. 5.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> If a
ſtranger do with his own money pay the debts
of a friend deceaſed, and not with the debtors:
This is but an act of charity, and makes him
not an executor by wrong, otherwiſe, if with
the debtors money. Yet to this another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
muſt be added, <hi>viz.</hi> that if he thus pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his owne money, have taken into his
owne hands goods of the deceaſed; then is
his payment preſumed as by or out of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of theſe goods, and ſo makes him an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
by wrong. Contrarily, if he have no ſuch
goods in his hands. And in the point of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling
with and diſpoſing of the teſtators
goods where another executor is; this further
difference is to be added or underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi>
That where the goods ſo taken never came
actually to the executors hands, but were in a
remote place, there this taker becomes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor.
For as it were miſchievous to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
if he ſhould by a poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſion in law caſt
upon him ſtand chargeable with theſe goods
in remote places purloyned as aſſets in his
hands; ſo were it as miſchievous to creditors,
if neither executor by right, nor this ſtranger
as an executor by wrong ſhould ſtand lyable
to creditors for them. It is true that the right
executor may ſue and recover damages for
them, and that ſo recovered ſhall be Aſſets;
but the creditor hath no meanes at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
law to inforce him to ſue, and perhaps it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49865:117"/>
may be a cold ſuit. And with theſe additions
I think that late reſolved difference may ſtand
firm and ſound. Yet in former times without
ſuch difference the taking only and poſſeſſion
of the goods of the deceaſed, was held to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
an executorſhip by wrong, as <hi>Belknap</hi> ſaid

what the value was of the goods ſo

were indebted to him twenty pounds
who thus uſurpeth executorſhip, whether may
he pay himſelfe or not? And this point was in
debate in the Kings Bench betweene <hi>Coulter</hi>
and one <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. 40. 41. Eliz. Co. lib. 5. f. 30.</note> executor of <hi>Hunt,</hi> where it
was ſtrongly objected, that notwithſtanding
the rightfull executor or adminiſtrator might
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49865:119"/>
puniſh him, and recover againſt him for the
goods which hee adminiſtreth; yet another
creditor ſuing him as executor generally, and
ſo affirming him to be (for there is no ſpeciall
forme of writ or declaration to diſtinguiſh an
executor by wrong from a rightfull executor)
he ſtands as againſt him in the ſtate of a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
executor, and therefore may firſt pay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
before he pay others; and of that mind at
the firſt were <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Juſtices, yet
did they admit that this payment ſhould not
ſtand good, as againſt the rightfull executor or
adminiſtrator. And <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Clinche</hi> held
ſtrongly that neither ſhould it ſtand good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
other creditors, for then every man
would ruſh upon the teſtators goods and be his
owne carver in payment: And whereas it was
ſaid at the barre, that the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> upon
an evidence at Guild-Hall had ruled it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<hi>Popham</hi> at another day of debate of the
ſaid caſe, related that the L. <hi>Anderſon</hi> did deny
that he ever ſo ruled, or was of that opinion;
and further informed that both he and Juſtice
<hi>Walmeſly, Periam</hi> and <hi>Clarke,</hi> Barons, did agree
with <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Clinche</hi> in opinion. After
which, Juſtice <hi>Gawdy,</hi> as alſo <hi>Fenner,</hi> if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
not, changing their opinions, and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with the reſt, judgement was given accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
In the debate of this caſe, queſtion
was made, if ſuch an executor by wrong pay a
debt to another creditor by ſpecialtie, whether
this ſhall not ſtand firme and good, ſince hee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49865:120"/>
ſtands lyable to creditors ſo farre as the goods
by him adminiſtred doe amount, and it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
by the better opinion at leaſt that this
ſhould ſtand firme and good, ſo as if the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were out of his owne goods, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to himſelfe in liew thereof ſo much of the
goods of the teſtator, for here he doth not, as
in the other caſe, advantage himſelfe by his
owne wrong. Yet that opinion allowing this
payment to creditors muſt, as I think, bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
with this difference, <hi>viz.</hi> that this
payment ſhall ſtand as againſt other creditors,
but not as againſt the right executor or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator,
for then any ſtranger might uſurpe
the office of executor, and take from him that
liberty and election to preferre which creditor
he will in firſt payment; yea, might take from
the executor power to pay himſelfe before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in caſe there were a debt due to him,
which were very unreaſonable.</p>

where hee had never proved the will whereof
hee was made Executor, nor ever adminiſtred

the deniall of this executorſhip by wrong or

            <p>Whereas wee before ſhewed that an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor

to bee added, <hi>viz.</hi> that that is onely
where the immediate executorſhip of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
is denied. For if <hi>B.</hi> bee made Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
by <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> dying makes <hi>C.</hi> his Executor;
now if <hi>C.</hi> bee ſued for the debt of <hi>A.</hi> as Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor

if this fall out in triall againſt him, hee ſhall not
in his owne goods ſtand liable to this debt;
becauſe it is poſſible that hee might not know
to whom his Teſtator was Executor. So
if <hi>A.</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Lib. Intr. 322.</note> made <hi>B. C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> his executors, and <hi>E.</hi>

hee denieth the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the executor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

<hi>viz.</hi> whether <hi>B. C.</hi> or <hi>D.</hi> lived longeſt. And
heere hee denied not his owne immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutorſhip,

               <hi>C.</hi> being ſued as executor of <hi>B.</hi> executor of

himſelfe to bee the immediate execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of <hi>A.</hi> and ſo denied the mediate executor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> and of him to <hi>B.</hi> yet
<hi>Quere</hi> of this, for why ſhould not as well his
falſe making himſelfe an executor immediate
to the indebted Teſtator charge his owne
goods as well as his falſe denying of that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutorſhip;
ſince both plees tend to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the plaintifes action, and each equally
reſted in the defendants knowledge. But this
difference is betweene them apparant, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the deniall of executorſhip, if true, is an
utter, and perpetuall Barre to the plaintife, as
againſt him ſo pleading; but the affirming
of an immediate executorship where hee was
ſued as executor mediate, doth not ſo it true, but
directs the plaintife to a better writ or action,
<hi>viz.</hi> againſt him as immediate executor to the
indebted Teſtator.</p>

be ſpecially and not generally pleaded and ſet

but the one of them as the truth of the caſe is;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49865:125"/>
that is, if in truth the defendant were made
executor, but never did adminiſter, now it
muſt be replyed that he was made executor at
ſuch a place, without ſpeaking any thing of
his adminiſtring. On the other ſide if he did
adminiſter, but were not made executor, then
only the adminiſtring is to be replyed;<note place="margin">So done Co. lib. Int. 144. b.</note> but if it
ſhall be found that the defendant had admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
to him commited and ſo adminiſtred

for the defendant, for this is no adminiſtring
as executor, and upon a generall deniall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

ſhall lay the whole debt or thing recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon the executors owne goods. And this
we ſhall finde in ſome few caſes, 1. Where an
executor is ſued for rent behinde after his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators
death, upon a leaſe for yeares, made to
the teſtator, and by him left to his executor.
Here it ſhall be adjudged and levied upon his
owne goods, for that ſo much of the profits as
the rent amounted to ſhall be accounted as his
owne goods, and not his teſtators, therefore is
he to be ſued as well in the <hi>debet</hi> as the <hi>detin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t,</hi>
where in other caſes he is not, but in the <hi>detinet</hi>
only being ſued as executor. So if any thing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49865:127"/>
delivered to or detained by his teſtator come
to his hands, and he ſtill detaines the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the demand, and be thereupon ſued in an
action of detinue, for this is his owne act, nor
in this caſe need he to be named as executor,
for he ſhall not anſwer damages for his teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
detaining. So if he aſſume to pay a debt
of his teſtators having aſſets, and be ſued upon
this <hi>Aſſumpt.</hi> the which debt is to be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in damages, and that upon or out of the
executors owne goods, yet is this action and
the aſſumption which is the ground thereof
founded in the executorſhip and his having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,
for if either he had not beene executor, or
if he had not aſſets at the time of the promiſe,
it had beene <hi>nudum pactum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5 Mariae fol. 182.</note> and would not
have bound him nor given good cauſe of ſuit.
Nay to go further, in the caſe of aſſumption by
the teſtator, and ſuit againſt the executor,
thereupon we finde the judgement in M. <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
Commentary given againſt the executor
generally, as if he had not beene an executor,
not fixing it upon the teſtators goods,<note place="margin">Reade &amp; Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods caſe.</note> yet there
the very debt it ſelfe is included in the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.<note place="margin">Co. l. b. Intr. fo. 1. 2.</note>
But contrarily was it after in the ſeventh
yeare of the late King, <hi>viz.</hi> judgement given,
that as well the damages as the coſts ſhould be
levied of the teſtators goods, if ſo much in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of them were in the defendants hands; and
if not, then the coſts only of the goods of the
executor. And this ſurely is the righter and
more juſt way, for there is no reaſon, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49865:127"/>
on a promiſe, more then upon a bond, the law
ſhould caſt the whole debt upon the back and
ſtate of the executor. But perhaps the two
judgements may be reconciled thus, the later
was given upon a verdict <hi>non aſſumpſit,</hi> being
the iſſue, and there the Iury aſſeſſed damages
in certain, <hi>viz.</hi> two hundred fifty three pounds
with the coſts. So as here the judgement was
compleate and full, <hi>viz.</hi> to recover the ſaid
ſumme, but in the other caſe the judgement
was had upon a demurrer, ſo as the damages
not being knowne, it was generally that the
plaintife ſhould recover his damages againſt
the defendant. <hi>Sed quia neſcitur quae damna, &amp;c.</hi>
becauſe it appeareth not to the Court what the
damages were, therefore a writ was awarded
to inquire of damages, upon the return where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
executed, the judgement was fully and
compleatly to be given of a ſumme in certain,
which ſecond judgement it appeares not by
the book in what manner it was entred, and
therefore might perhaps bee then agreeable
with the other. And that the ſaid firſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before damages inquired of is not a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
&amp; full judgement,<note place="margin">Tr. 30. Eliz.</note> but an award of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath beene divers times reſolved,<note place="margin">Paſe. 33. Eliz. in com. banc.</note> and
that therefore any defect and inſufficiency in
the declaration may be ſhewed time enough
after the firſt, and before the ſecond judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Yea if the plaintife dye before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

            <p>A woman married,<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> or femme covert, wee
know is <hi>Sub poteſtate viri, cui in vita contradice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
non poteſt,</hi> as ſaith the writ given by the Law
to the wife for recovery of her land after her
husbands death, being aliened by him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that Judges,<note place="margin">Sola &amp; ſecreta examinata.</note> when a woman is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a fine of any land, doe examine her
apart from her husband, to know whether ſhe
bee willing, or come to doe it by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of her husband: It is therefore hard
for her to have freedome of will, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
freedome to make a will. Beſides, all
her moveables or goods perſonall,<note place="margin">Debts except which are not properly good.</note> which ſhee
had at the time of her marriage, otherwiſe
than as executrix or adminiſtratrix, are by the
Law totally deveſted out of her, and ſetled in
the husband as fully <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon the very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49865:129"/>
marriage, as any other that were his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Of theſe therefore ſhe can make no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
no more than of other her husbands
goods. But in caſe ſhee doe by will bequeath
them, although the will and gift be void, yet if
the husband,<note place="margin">5. Ed. 2. Fitz. deviſe. 24.</note> as the caſe was in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi>
the ſecond, do after his wives death conſent to
this her will &amp; gift, by delivering of the goods
bequeathed after her death, or aſſenting that
the legatee take them by vertue of ſuch will
and gift; this amounteth to a new gift by the
husband. If a woman have a leaſe, an eſtate by
extent, a wardſhip, the next avoydance of a
Church, or other chattell reall; theſe are not
deveſted out of her into her husband by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
but in caſe ſhe over-live him, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to her as before, no alienation or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
having been made by the husband, who
had power to diſpoſe of them by gift in his
life-time, though not by his will; yet ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in her husbands life-time could not of or
for theſe things, without her husbands aſſent,
make an executor or will, but ſhe dying before
him, they would, by the operation of law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
to him. And here then obſerve a caſe,
though not frequent, yet full of miſchief when
it happens: Suppoſe that a woman indebted a
thouſand pounds, and having leaſes and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
goods to the value of three thouſand or
foure thouſand pounds, marrieth with <hi>I. S.</hi> and
then dyeth before the debt bee recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her: in this caſe the husband ſhall have
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49865:129"/>
and goe away with all this value of his wife,
and is not in law lyable to pay one penny of
her debts,<note place="margin">During her life hee is, but not after.</note> becauſe hee is neither her executor
nor adminiſtrator: What the Chancery could
doe, or rather what the Lord Chancellor or
Lord Keeper would doe in this caſe, I will not
take upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me to ſay or determine. Another ſort
or kind of goods, or rather intereſts a woman
may have, <hi>viz.</hi> debts or things in action, which

for that though th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49865:130"/>
much diverſity of opinion: Some books ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

but ſpeak nothing of the husbands aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,<note place="margin">39. H. 6. f. 27.</note>
whether neceſſary or not. Elſe-where we
find it mentioned, that if the husband after the

will,<note place="margin">34. H. 8. S. Bro. Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts 21.</note> then it loſeth all force, or becommeth

ſhe were executor or not, no nor ſo much
as whether ſhe had any thing in action or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell

expreſſe opinions that the husbands aſſent is
abſolutely neceſſary even in this caſe,<note place="margin">18. E. 4. f. 11. Vavaſor Inſt.</note> ſo as

To this <hi>I</hi> anſwer that this Caſe is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued
with relation, <hi>Ad materiam ſubjectam,
viz.</hi> to the matter, and point in queſtion, and
under conſideration; which was that ſtate of
a woman whereof wee have before ſpoken,
<hi>viz.</hi> one having things in action debts or duties
to her belonging, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> therein particular it was
arrearages of rent due to the woman before
marriage. As for the point of a woman exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
to another perſon, it was never in that
Caſe, under diſceptation, no nor once mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the debate or arguments thereupon.
Now conſidering the very forme, and phraſe
of judgements at the common Law, which
are thus, <hi>viz. Ideo conſideratum eſt per Curiam, &amp;c.</hi>
not <hi>Adjudicatum eſt,</hi> that is, it is conſidered
by the Court, not in expreſſe termes, that it is
adjudged: This <hi>I</hi> ſay well obſerved (as to mee
it ſeemes very remarkable) gives us to know
that no more is adjudged then is conſidered
of, the judgement being contayned, and claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up in the word <hi>Conſideratum eſt.</hi> VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſince in <hi>Ognells</hi> Caſe, the point of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
coverts ability in Caſe where ſhee is an
Executor; To make a will, and Executor hath
not beene conſidered of the eyes, tongues, nor
thoughts of the Judges, being not once ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49865:131"/>
it; It cannot bee, that that point is there
reſolved or adjudged. Beſides, even in a few
words expreſſing as to mee it ſeemes, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that reſolution, it appeares not to have
beene the intent of the Judges, that the ſame
ſhould reach or extend to this Caſe, of a woman
covert executor: for it is added (as the reaſon
of the judgement in my conceiving) that the
adminiſtration of the wives goods doth of right
belong to the husband, which amounts to this
in my underſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> that where the
wives making of a will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſequently
of an Executor, may bee prejudiciall to her
husband, and prevent him of ſome benefit
or advantage, or tend to his loſſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
there it ſhall not bee avaylable or
effectuall without his aſſent, and therefore
not in the Caſe of her, who having debts or
duties to her due, would by making another to
bee her Executor exclude or preclude her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
from that benefit, which to him ſhould
pertaine as adminiſtrator of her goods. Now as
for the goods debts or credit to her as executor
to ſome other pertayning no benefit could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the husband, by having ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of his wives goods, for thoſe ſhould
goe, and bee to the next of kinne of the
wives Teſtator taking adminiſtration <hi>De bonis
non adminiſtratis</hi> of him, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hee have no Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
&amp; therefore her making an Executor as
touching theſe brings no hurt nor prejudice
to her husband, and ſo is out of the reaſon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49865:131"/>
of <hi>Ognells</hi> Caſe. Since then it is ſo, and ſince
the Law favoureth wills, and it was by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
part of his will who made her Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
that ſhee ſhould have power to continue
his Executorſhip by making another to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
therein after her deceaſe for performance
of his will; why ſhould the Law give to the
Husband who can receave no prejudice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
power to give impediment thereunto; for
<hi>Fruſtra eſt inutilis potentia,</hi> even reaſon it
ſelfe frames, and awards againſt him in this
Caſe a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> or rather a <hi>Non impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diet,</hi>
as to mee it ſeemes. Wherefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<hi>I</hi> take it that the opinion of <hi>Fineux</hi>
is good Law in that point of a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me covert
Executor, though not in the other point, where
ſhee onely hath debts, or things in action to
her ſelfe due, for therein the ſaid reſolution in
<hi>Ognells</hi> Caſe, grounded upon good reaſon, gives
mee ſatisfaction to differ from <hi>Fineux,</hi> who
making no difference betweene the caſes held
the Husbands aſſent needles in both. <hi>Poſito</hi> then
that the wife of <hi>I. S.</hi> having debts due to her
ſelfe, and being alſo Executrix to <hi>I. D.</hi> makes
without her husbands aſſent, <hi>I. N.</hi> her executor,
and dyeth, what ſhall wee now ſay? ſhall wee
ſay, that as touching the goods, and credits, or
things in action to her as executrix of <hi>I. D.</hi>
pertaining this will ſtands good, and <hi>I. N.</hi> as
her Executor may prove it contrary to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ands
will; and that as to the credits to her ſelfe
in her owne right pertayning, the will is voyd,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49865:132"/>
voyd, &amp; thereof her husband may take admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?
Shall ſhe dye both teſtate, and inteſtate
with a will, and without a will? ſhall ſhee
have both an executor, and adminiſtrator?
why not?<note place="margin">Note.</note> to ſeverall purpoſes aſwell as where
an executor is made onely for one particular
thing or one place, the Teſtator may elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
dye inteſtate: and ſo where the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip
is divided as before is ſhewed, and one
to whom part is committed will prove the will,
but the other to whom other part of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutorſhip
is committed will not take it upon
him, here muſt needs bee a dying for part te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and for part inteſtate.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond point, <hi>viz.</hi> wives or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
coverts being made executors, and ſo
having the office of executorship put upon
them againſt their husbands will,<note place="margin">13. Ed. 1. Fitz. Exec. 119.</note> there hath
alſo beene diverſity of opinions. In the time
of King <hi>Edward 1. Brab.</hi> Juſtice ſaith shee may
executor without her husband, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
ſhall bee delivered to her onely. And
<hi>I</hi> thinke he meant that this might bee without
the conſent of her husband or whether hee
would or not, for ſo is it ſaid in the time of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh to bee the Law ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Hen. 7. 15. b.</note>
and indeed in Courts ſpirituall no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is made betweene women married, and
unmarried, for ought I can finde: there a wife
ſueth, and is ſued alone without her husband;
hee intermedleth not, nor is intermedled
withall touching the things pertaining to his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49865:132"/>
wife. But at the common law it is otherwiſe,
and there as <hi>Bryan</hi> Chiefe Juſtice ſaith,<note place="margin">2 H. 7. 15.</note> a wife
without the aſſent of her huſband cannot be
executor, he meaning thereby that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
may oppoſe and hinder it: for ſuch an
one may be named executor in and by a Will
without the knowledge of her huſband: let us
then ſee how after the death of the teſtator,
the huſband can hinder her proving of the
will or intermedling to adminiſter, ſince it may
be a matter both of much trouble and danger
to him, to have the executorſhip faſten upon
his wife, and conſequently upon himſelfe. On
the other ſide, it may be a benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the huſband, and therefore we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
conſider, whether the huſband may (though
his wife would refuſe) aſſume the executor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and faſten it upon her. The teſtator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being dead, and fame or common bruit
carrying it to the Ordinary, that the wife of <hi>I.
S.</hi> is made executrix, if ſhe come not in gratis,
or voluntarily to prove the Will; <hi>Proces</hi> or a
citation is to be ſent out of the Spirituall Court
againſt her, to enforce her comming in to take
on her the executorſhip. She comming may
cleerely, as well as any other perſon (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if her huſband concurre with her therein)
refuſe this office, truſt and charge, ſo as if there
be no other executor named, the Ordinary
muſt commit the adminiſtration: If ſhe ſhould
not come and appeare, ſhe ſhould be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
as I take it, notwithſtanding any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49865:133"/>
or intimation by her huſband of his
unwillingneſſe to have her take upon her the
executorſhip. But ſuppoſe ſhe doth come into
Court and offers her ſelfe ready to take the
executorſhip upon her, and on the other ſide
her huſband expreſſeth his diſaſſent therunto,
praying that ſhe may not have the execution
of the Will to her committed, what will then
be done? This I confeſſe pertaines to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
learning, and not to that of our profeſſion:
but foraſmuch as I find that in the Courts ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
a wife ſtandes in the ſame plight and
ſtate as a woman ſole, the husband not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled
with all in the affaires of the wife;
Therfore do I conceive that in that Court, the
husbands refuſall wil not be of force to hinder
the committing of the executorſhip to the wife
not refuſing, at leaſt if there come not a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to ſtay the Spirituall Courts ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding:
but whether a prohibition be in ſuch
a caſe to be granted or not, as I find no reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in my books, ſo wil I not take upon me to
reſolve. This ſtands cleere in the rules of the
law of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">33 H. 6. 31. 43. 39 Ed. 3. 1.</note> that the wife is under the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
power, and cannot contradict him in
pleading and doing other acts even touching
her own Freehold:<note place="margin">27 H. 8. 24.</note> nay ſhe cannot take lands
nor goods by gift or conveyance, without her
husbands aſſent, as the law hath been, and for
ought I know is taken. But if once the Will be
proved, and the execution thereof committed
to the wife, though againſt her huſbands mind
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49865:133"/>
and conſent, I think it will ſtand ſirme, and the
huſband and wife being after ſued cannot ſay
that ſhe was never executrix, and I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the wife adminiſtring without the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
privity and aſſent, although the will be
not proved, do not conclude her huſband as
well as her ſelfe, from ſaying after in any ſuit
againſt them, that ſhe neither was executor, nor
did ever adminiſter as executor.<note place="margin">18 H. 6. 4. The plea is that the femme did or did not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter without ſpeaking of the husband.</note> Yet perhaps
this adminiſtration by the wife againſt her
huſbands minde, will as againſt him be as a
voide act, elſe cannot I ſee how <hi>Brians</hi> opinion
before cited, <hi>viz.</hi> that the wife ſhall not be an
executor, without or againſt her huſbands
mind, can be law. On the other ſide if the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of a woman, named executor, would have
his wife to take upon her the execution of the
Will,<note place="margin">33 H. 6. 31. The husband may adminiſter and prove the will for his wife.</note> and to prove the ſame, but ſhe will not
aſſent thereunto (wiſhing perhaps that gaine
and benefit rather to ſome of her kindred by
way of adminiſtration then to her owne hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
by her executorſhip: as ſometimes wives
accord not well with their huſbands) in this
caſe I think the Court Spirituall will not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
the executorſhip upon the wife againſt
her will. But <hi>dato,</hi> that the huſband though
the Will be not proved, doth adminiſter as in
the wives right, but againſt her minde and

her husbands life, ſhe ſtands concluded at
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49865:134"/>
the common law, for that there ſhe ſhall not
be, nor can be ſued alone as executor, and
then being ſued with him ſhe muſt joyne in
plea with him, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe neither was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
nor adminiſtred as executor, and then
this act of her husbands given in evidence, will
as I take it, cauſe that the verdict be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her,<note place="margin">1. El. Dy. 166. b. there is cited 3 H. rot. 112. Nota per Bill.</note> not ſo after her huſbands death:
then ſhe may refuſe, as the Lord <hi>Dyar</hi> ſaith, and
citeth as reſolved. Theſe things I thought
good to offer to conſideration, and ſo leave
them without reſolution. Difference perhaps
may be, where a woman ſo made executor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an huſband after the teſtators death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either proving or refuſing to prove the
Will, and where ſhe is made executor during
the coverture, as there is in caſe of a diſcent of
her land to the heire of a diſſeaſor; for when
there is upon her ſuch a ſtate of election, ſhe
marying before her reſolution or determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
doth upon the matter deliver it into the
huſbands hands: not ſo where it firſt findeth
and falleth upon her in the ſtate of coverture:
if the huſband were indebted to the Teſtator,
this making of the wife executor is as I take it,
a releaſe in law, as well as if ſhe were the
debtor, but if after the teſtators death ſhe do
marry ſuch a debtor, it is a devaſtation.</p>

               <p>It hath beene conceived by many of old, and

and ſome have gone ſo farre as to ſay that ſhe
may ſue or be ſued without her huſband (in
the Courts of Common Law, I meane, for in
the Spirituall Court it is true the huſband is
not joyned with the wife in ſuit) but the law is
doubtleſſe in all thoſe points contrary, as not
only ſome opinion alſo was of old, <hi>viz.</hi> in the

<hi>Queenes</hi> time reſolved, for otherwiſe, if the
wives gift or releaſe ſhould ſtand good, her act

might exceedingly endamage her huſband,
and make his goods lyable to the creditors, the
teſtators ſtate being waſted by the gifts or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes

the ſaid late caſe, that unleſſe due payment
were made to ſuch women covert executors,
their releaſes or acquittances be void, and ſo
alſo their gifts and grants: yea it was then held
that the husband of the wife executrix,<note place="margin">33 H. 6. 31.</note> may
give goods or make releaſes of debts at his

are the goods though perſonall which the wife
hath as executor, deveſted out of her and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

if ſhe dye, ſhall they acrue to the husband, if
no alteration were of the property, but ſhall
go to her executor or to the next of kin being
adminiſtrator of her teſtator if ſhe have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor,
and ſo was it held in the firſt yeare of
Queene <hi>Mary:</hi> Yea though for any other goods
which the wife had in her owne right before

the wife may maintaine an action of treſpaſſe;
yet touching ſuch goods as the wife hath as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor

               <p>BEing now to conſider of diſability by age,
for want of yeares in perſons making or

of the ſeverall ages of men and women to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
purpoſes materiall in the lawes judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and reſpect. And firſt, touching a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:<note place="margin">35. H. 6. 41. b.</note>
                  <hi>Wangford</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth his time
ſhewes, and other books approve that ſhe hath
ſixe ſeverall ages, reſpected in and by the
law. As firſt the age of ſeven yeares, for her
father to have aid of his tenants to marry her.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next nine years to deſerve dower, that is, that
in caſe ſhe be of that age at the time of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
death, ſhee ſhall be endowed, but not if
ſhe be any thing under thoſe yeares; the Law
being Phyſically informed that a woman at
thoſe yeares may conceive a child, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. But of ſomewhat different opinion
was, as it ſeemes, the Parliament in the late
Queens time,<note place="margin">18. Eliz. cap. 7.</note> when it was made felony to have
unlawfull carnall knowledge of any woman
child under the age of ten yeares, it being then
conceived, as I thinke, that no ſuch could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The age of twelve yeares is a womans
time for aſſenting or diſaſſenting to marriage
in more tender yeares had. For ſo it appeares
by divers bookes, although Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49865:136"/>
here no diſtinction between male and female.
The age of fourteen years is a womans time to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
be in wardſhip or not, ſo as if ſhe be any thing
above thoſe years, at the time of her anceſtors
death, ſhe eſcapeth wardſhip. The age of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
yeares is her time of comming out of
wardſhip, being once fallen under it, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
had ſhe beene full fourteene, ſhe had
eſcaped it; yet not ſo being at the time of her
anceſtors death, her wardſhip laſteth till ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
yeares, except the Lord ſhall ſooner mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

whereby ſhe is inabled firmely and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to make grants or conveyances is one and
twenty yeares, as well as for the male, before
which time, be it that ſhe being ſole, make a
feofment or other conveyance, or being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
alien her land by Fine, and her husband of
fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now of the male, or man, the firſt age ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and ſetledly reſolved on, is twelve years,
for at that time each male is at the Leet to
ſweare his fidelity to the King; this women doe
not, and therefore are they never ſaid to be
outlawed, but to be waived, becauſe they have
not this admittance into the Law which males
have. This hath been, as I think, the ground
of that ſpeech, That women are lawleſſe
creatures.</p>
               <p>The ſecond age of males is fourteen yeares,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:49865:137"/>
accounted by the Law, the age of diſcretion,
eſpecially materiall to two purpoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt,
that if one under that age commit an act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
to felony, yet is he to ſtand free from
the attainder and puniſhment incident to a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:
Regularly it is thus, but <hi>non eſt regula quin
fall it,</hi> one of much leſſe yeares having attained
ripeneſſe of diſcretion and diſcerning, ſhall
incurre the like attainder as one of full age, as
was reſolved in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,<note place="margin">3. H. 7. f. 1. 6.</note>
touching an infant but of the age of nine
yeares, who having killed another boy of
like age with his knife, and then hiding the
ſlaine boy, and excuſing the blood found upon
him, by ſaying that his noſe had bled: It was
held by the Judges that he was to be hanged
as a fellon, his ſuch non-age notwithſtanding.
The other point, touching which, this age of
fourteen yeares is eſpecially materiall, is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
an heire of lands held by ſocage; for in
caſe ſuch heire be under that age, he is to be in
ward to the next kin, but if he be of that age,
he is not to be in ward at all, for that the law
judgeth him to be of diſcretion at thoſe years,
and therefore a Guardian in Socage being in
effect but a Bayliffe accountable, hee hath no
need of ſuch an one, other than ſuch as himſelfe
ſhall chuſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third age in and touching males mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
is fifteen yeares; for every Lord of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
or one having Freeholders in Socage, or
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49865:137"/>
by Knights Service, when his eldeſt ſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to that age, <hi>viz.</hi> fifteen yeares, is to have
of them ayd for the making of him a Knight,
towards which every one holding by a whole
Knights Fee is to pay twenty ſhillings, and ſo
ratably for more, more; and leſſe, leſſe: and each
holding twenty pound land in Socage, is to
pay the like ſumme, and ſo ratably for more
or leſſe.</p>
               <p>The fourth age of males, is the full age of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
one and twenty years, which maketh him free
from wardſhip, having lands held by Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice
deſcended unto him: And alſo makes
him able to alien lands or goods, makes firme
his bond, ſtatutes, recognizances, &amp;c. for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
at fourteene the law judge him of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
yet doth it not hold him fully ripe till
one and twenty.</p>
               <p>The laſt age of males reſpected by the law,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is ſeventy yeares,<note place="margin">Oblitum.</note> at which time Sheriffes are to

the impanelling of him; and hee may

a word, perhaps, anciently taken in a
good and favourable ſenſe, <hi>Pro dote etatis, viz.</hi>
a gift, privilege, or exemption allowed to age
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49865:138"/>
in favour thereof, and as a benefit. Having
thus by way of ingredient or introduction ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
view of theſe ſeverall ages, let us now ſee
wherein and how age is materiall, touching
them who are to make or to bee made execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and what age required thereabout. Maſter
<hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Deviſes. f. 97.</note> that one of foure yeares old may
make a will, and conſequently executors; and
his reaſon is, becauſe the executors being to
account before the Ordinary,<note place="margin">No good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for one may make an ill account; ſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a childes direction for his doings.</note> it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
but that the goods ſhall be diſtributed
for the good of his ſoule: He ſpeakes as if he
only made an executor by his will, but did not
bequeath any thing, but left all to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
conſcience and diſcretion, which is not
uſuall, though feſible, as before I have ſhewed,
or ſaid at leaſt. But admit it were ſo, and no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
at all contained in the will, yet ſince at
that age an infant hath no diſcretion to elect
a fit perſon to diſtribute his goods, money, and
other things; no nor to make continuation of
an executorſhip to another, to whom perhaps
the infant was executor: I cannot ſee that
his will ſhould be of any force, but if he be of
the age of 14. yeares, being the age of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the judgement of law, then I ſhould hold
him able to make a will, although yet he be an
infant till twenty one yeares, and can make no
gift of land nor goods which ſhall be of force.
And <hi>Babington</hi> chiefe Juſtice,<note place="margin">9. H. 6. f. 6.</note> to other purpoſe
makes like diſtinction betweene an infant of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49865:138"/>
ſuch tender yeeres, and one come to the yeares
of diſcretion. So alſo as before wee ſhewed, is
it in the Caſe of fellony. And that way alſo
ſounds that which <hi>Hanck:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. H. 4. 22.</note> ſaies in <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth his time, <hi>viz.</hi> that an infant of 18.
yeeres old may bee a diſſeiſor; as implying that
his yeeres may bee ſo tender,<note place="margin">40 Ed. 3. 44.</note> that as <hi>Candiſh</hi>
ſaith of an infant in <hi>Edward</hi> the third his time,
hee is not to bee intended able to know or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
betweene good, and evill, me thinkes
therefore hee ſhould bee at the leaſt of the age
of diſcretion, <hi>viz.</hi> 14. yeeres who ſhould bee
able to make a will, and conſequently an
Executor. And the cuſtome for an infant of
15. yeeres old to bequeath by will hath as to
mee it ſeemes,<note place="margin">37. H. 6. 5.</note> affinity with this opinion, though
there the Caſe was of land in a borou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable
by cuſtome:<note place="margin">11. H. 6. f. 40. 6.</note> and that way reflecteth
the Caſe in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth,
where it was ſaid that an infant under 15. yeeres
of age ſhould not wage his Law, <hi>viz.</hi> take an
oath to acquit himſelfe of a debt or excuſe his
default in an action reall. And further reaſon of
this opinion will ariſe out of the conſideration
of an infant made an Executor.</p>
               <p>Now touching an infant made Executor
how young ſoever hee bee, the making of him
ſo is not voyd, but yet the execution of the
will which is the performance of the office of
Executor ſhall not bee committed to him till
hee come to the age of 17. yeeres by the Law
ſpirituall, and till then (for that hee is not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49865:139"/>
able to doe the part of an Executor,) admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
is to bee committed to ſome other;
yet if it bee a woman infant who is ſo made
Executrix,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. f. 29. P.</note> in Caſe ſhee bee married to a man
of 17 yeeres old or more, now is it as if ſhee
were of that age, and her husband ſhall have
the Execution of the will, and if adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were before committed during the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the woman,<note place="margin">M. 41. &amp;. 42. Eliz.</note> it ſhall now ceaſe, as is ſaid
in <hi>Princes</hi> Caſe. Yet <hi>I</hi> doe a little marvaile at
theſe opinions, conſidering that theſe things
are managed in the ſpirituall court, and by that
Law; and it intermedles not with the husband,
in the wives caſe; now by that Law, and not
our common law, comes in this limit of 17. yeers.
And <hi>I</hi> have ſeene it otherwiſe reported in, and
touching this laſt point.</p>
               <p>Further touching infants Executors, and
under that age of 17. yeeres this is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch an one is not able as an
Executor to aſſent to a legacy,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. fo. 29. But pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to bee made to the Exec. &amp; not to the adm. M. 15. &amp; 16. El. in com. ba. rep 67. Co lib. 5. fo. 29.</note> ſo as it may by
virtue thereof ſettle in the legatee. Alſo if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
bee during ſuch minority commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſpeciall words of reſtraint or limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it is done to the uſe or profit of
the infant Executor, then no ſale of leaſe or
goods or aſſent to legacy, by ſuch adminiſtrator
will bind or prejudice the infant Executor; But
otherwiſe perhaps if the adminiſtration du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the minority bee committed generally.<note place="margin">Co. lib. 6. fo. 671.</note>
And if the Teſtator himſelfe, making an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Executor doe alſo appoint another to bee
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49865:139"/>
his Executor during his nonage, expreſſing it
to bee onely for the benefit, and behoofe of
the infant executor, <hi>I</hi> doubt whether this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
executor ſtand any whit reſtrayned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
what pertaines to the power of an abſolute
executor, for there may be perhaps difference
between him to whom the owner of the goods
commits the government of them, though but
for a time, and in ſpeciall manner, and an
adminiſtrator ſo ſpecially made by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
another being preſently by the will of the
owner or Teſtator to have the adminiſtration,
in whom for a time legall defect is found. But
now let us paſſe over this age of 17. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the infant betweene that time of his
being admitted to take upon him the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip,
and his accompliſhment of his full
age of 21. Firſt, then ſuppoſe that hee doth
releaſe a debt due to his Teſtator, whether
ſhall this bee good to bind him, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the debtor aſwell as if the executor had
bin of full age, hee now having proved the will,
and being by the Law ſpirituall approved an
able executor. And this point comming in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
in <hi>Ruſſells</hi> Caſe,<note place="margin">H. 26. Eliz.</note> in the late Queenes time,
conſideration was had both of divers good
reaſons for enabling of this releaſe, as that an
executor repreſents the perſon of his Teſtator,
and in his right, and power, doth theſe acts, and
not in his owne, and therefore his infancy
which is a ſtate or condition of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
perſon, shall no more diſable him then
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49865:140"/>
it doth the King,<note place="margin">16. H. 6. ret 45.</note> a Mayor or other head of a
Corporation.<note place="margin">21. Ed. 4. 13. 24.</note> Alſo divers Bookes were found
to runne that way as well in the caſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
as of a Femme Covert. But upon great
deliberation in the Kings Bench, and upon
conference had with the Lord <hi>Anderſon, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
and other juſtices, it was reſolved, and
adjudged that the releaſe of an infant executor
without payment of the debt or duty would
not bind or barre him,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 5. fo. 27.</note> firſt for that if it should
it would be a waſting or devaſting of the goods
of his Teſtator, and ſo would charge his owne
goods. Secondly, It would bee a wrong which
an infant could not doe by his releaſe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It was no purſuit nor performance of the
office or duty of an executor, but the contrary:
And upon this judgement a writ of error was
brought in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Chamber, where it was
agreed by all, that the releaſe was not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
nor binding, ſo as this point now had the
reſolution of all the Judges of <hi>England.</hi> But
it was agreed, that if payment or ſatisfaction had
beene made, then the infant executor might
have made a good acquittance, and diſcharge,
&amp; indeed payment it ſelf if proved, brings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
enough, except in the caſe of a ſingle
Bill; Note that the principall caſe adjudged
was not of a releaſe of any debt or duty by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty,
but of treſpaſſe in converſion of goods
found or taken in the Teſtators life time. But
<hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ito,</hi> that this infant had aſſented to a legacy,
whether will this binde him or not? for in the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49865:140"/>
ſaid Caſe of <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> it is ſaid that all things
which an infant doth according to the office,
and duty of an Executor, will ſtand firme; now
it is part of his office to pay, and execute Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies.
Yet ſince this act amounts to a vaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or waſting of the Teſtators goods aſwell
as the other, in caſe there remaine not goods
ſufficient for payment of the debts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
here aſwell as in the other caſe, the
infants owne goods would become lyable to
his Teſtator debts; I doubt, and incline, that
it is not nor can ſtand effectuall, for except in
the other wee admit a want or poſſibility of
want of aſſets or goods, the releaſe could neither
hurt the infant himſelfe, nor doe wrong to any
other, and that admitted, this caſe is of like
prejudice; yet if this aſſet ſhould bee voyd ſo
alſo would bee his payment of Legacies, and
how then were hee an able Executor at the age
of 17. yes to ſue, and to bee ſued for debts,
and Legacies, and if upon ſuit it cannot bee
ſhewed that debts will take up all or diſable the
payment, then happily hee may bee forced to
pay; Quaere notwithſtanding whether theſe
acts though voluntary ſtand not good upon
<hi>Bene eſſe,</hi> or conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> if there bee
beſides goods ſufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that elſe the
nonaged Executor may have an action of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
for the money by him payed to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatee,
and alſo avoyd his aſſent where that only
needfull. But doubtleſſe neither the aſſent of
ſuch Executor before his age of 17. nor any
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49865:141"/>
payment of a debt to him could bee good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſuch acts to or by another Executor,
before the proving of the will would ſtand
firme, and good: for this infant wants not
onely proving, but alſo ability to prove his
Teſtators will, yea the will ſtands ſuſpended,
and the Teſtator as it were inteſtate, whilſt
the adminiſtration ſtands in force, ſo as during
that time nothing can bee done by any as exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
and therefore there is great difference
betweene the caſes. What if payment of a
Legacy bee made to an infant, can hee make
a ſufficient acquittance; This <hi>I</hi> confeſſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the point in hand, yet becauſe it concerns
infants, and Executors (though not infant
Executors) it is not amiſſe here to caſt ſome
thoughts, and words upon the point, for that
it many times perplexeth both Executors, and
Legatees. Firſt, therefore in caſe the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
bee of the yeares of diſcretion, <hi>viz. 14. I</hi>
hold it cleare that any payment to him made
will ſtand good, for that the Law at that age
holds him able to governe, and manage his
owne Lands held in ſocage, and conſequently
to receave the rents thereof, wherefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee who makes ſuch payment have any
acquittance or not; if hee have proofe of the
payment, hee is well enough acquitted from
any ſecond payment, and if without payment
hee get an acquittance, it will not ſuffice, the
infancy of him who makes the acquittance
conſidered. Beſides if the acquittance bee as

the name of the maker, and not ſealed, it is
onely an evidence or proofe of payment, and
no pledable acquittance, becauſe no deed, ſo as
it nothing differs from proofe by witneſſes, ſave
that it is not mortall as they. But now if the
infant bee under the yeeres of diſcretion,
what ſhall wee ſay to a payment to him ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if hee bee but three, or foure yeares old or
thereabout: heere <hi>I</hi> thinke caution is to bee
uſed by the executor generally, and the ſureſt
way is, if hee feare to keepe it in any reſpects,
to pay it into the Court, where it is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<hi>viz.</hi> where the will was proved; yet the
caſe ſo may be, as that this payment may not
bee at all ſafe for the Executor. As put the caſe
that hee entred into bond or ſtatute to pay all
Legacies by ſuch a day, to the ſeverall Legatees,
heere <hi>I</hi> thinke the payment into the Court
ſpirituall ſufficeth not,<note place="margin">Quae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.</note> for that muſt make the
receit to be, with ſome charge, which is in ſome
kinde an abatement; there <hi>I</hi> thinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
legally to ſecure the Executor, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
muſt bee to or in the preſence of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
becauſe of noriture, <hi>viz.</hi> him or her who
hath (though not as gardian in reſpect of lands)
the cuſtody or education of the infant: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to pay it into the hands of ſuch a tender
infant ſeparate from any governor, or gardian,
were to expoſe it to loſſe, both for that hee
is not able to count the ſumme, and for that
hee yet not being come to diſcerning yeeres
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49865:142"/>
were like with <hi>Eſops</hi> Cocke, to part with pearles
or coyne for plumes and trifles of no valew.
But in caſe no bond nor other collaterall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
lie upon the Executor, or in Caſe the Bond
or Statute bee onely to performe the will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
which nothing alters the courſe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which by the will the Law laies upon
Executors, then is not the Executor put to any
ſuch payment, nor need pay without demand,
and acquittance, as in caſe of payment, upon
a ſingle Bill, or of a rente ſecke where no
diſtreſſe can bee taken, nor other penalty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred:
yet in that Caſe if demand bee, and
acquittance ready to bee given, let the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
take heede, in Caſe hee bee bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
that hee ſtand not upon the invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the acquittance in reſpect of nonage,
for as <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, proof by witneſſes may ſupply
a nullity of acquittance, and much more the
weaknes or imbecillity, payment according to
the teſtators appointment being the matter w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
acquitteth the payer, and this the Executor
may have teſtified under the hands of divers
witneſſes expreſſing circumſtances, ſo as all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may continue ſafely from ſecond payment
as well as an acquittance, the witneſſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
are ſubject to mortality, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But herein Courts of equity doe often
interpoſe helpfully for them who ſeeke not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion

               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt, we have before ſhewed the
aſſent of the executor to be neceſſary before
any legacy can be had, for that debts are firſt
to be paid, and that the executor is to look to
at his perill. But hereto adde a little out of
M. <hi>Swinborne</hi> a learned Civilian, who ſaith,
that in caſe any goods be in the hands or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody
of <hi>J. S.</hi> and the owner doth bequeath
them to him, then may he keepe or retaine
them againſt the will of the executor, ſo as
there be other ſufficient goods in the hands of
the executor for payment of all debts: but
though thus as it ſeemes would it ſtand in the
Eccleſiaſticall Law, yet for that no property
is transferred to the legatee without the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
aſſent, therefore doubtleſſe the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
may at the Common law recover the thing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49865:143"/>
with-held, or damages to the value againſt the
legatee detaining it. Another caſe there is,
wherein as the learned Civilian ſaith, the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatee
may take the thing to him bequeathed
lying in prender, <hi>viz.</hi> Horſe, other beaſt or
peece of Plate, or other like thing knowne and
in being, and that is where the teſtator doth
expreſly ſo appoint by his will. But herein
doubtleſſe the Common law, at and by the
which debts are recoverable againſt executors
will oppoſe the law Spirituall, for elſe by ſuch
appointment the teſtator might cauſe that all
his goods ſhould be taken by legatees, and that
none ſhould remaine to pay debts. Yet if there
be other goods beſides ſufficient for payment
of debts, then indeed I ſee not how the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
can hinder ſuch taking without violating
his oath taken for performance of the will. If
any ſay that it is alſo a breach of oath in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe, I ſay he obſerveth not that there that
clauſe in the will being againſt the law is void,
and conſequently there is a nullity upon it, and
it is as if no ſuch thing were in the will, and ſo
the oath extends not to it. And as a chattell
ſhall not be transferred to a ſtranger without
the executors aſſent; ſo if the deviſee be to the
executor himſelfe, till he elect to take as lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
it ſhall be in him as executor, as appeares
by the ſtraine and argument of two caſes in
<hi>Plowd.</hi> Comment. and more lately in the Kings
Bench, the point being divers dayes argued
was at laſt ſo reſolved by three Judges againſt

               </p>
               <p>As for the ſecond point, it may have theſe
two parts: 1. When the executor is able to
give ſuch aſſent to a legacy. And 2. when he
may do it with ſafety.<note place="margin">21 Eliz. D. 367</note> As for the firſt, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before probat of the will to aſſent unto the
execution of a legacy, as elſewhere is ſhewed,
and that although he be not of full age of 21
yeares; but if he be under 17 yeares, ſo as he is
not able to take upon him the office of an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
and therefore adminiſtration is during
that time to be committed to ſome other;<note place="margin">Co. lib. 3. fo. 29</note> Here
his aſſent is not of force or effectuall, as wee
find in <hi>Princes</hi> caſe to have been held in the
caſe of <hi>Pigot</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoine.</hi> As for the ſecond
part, till all debts be payd, the executor may
not ſafely conſent that the legatee enter into
the leaſe or chattell deviſed, no more then he
may pay money bequeathed, if there be not
ſufficient alſo to pay all debts. Of theſe things
more is ſaid elſewhere. Yet becauſe the reader
or he that deſires direction in theſe points will
look for them under this title, I thought not
good here to be altogether ſilent touching
them.</p>
               <p>As for the third point, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of one executor where there be many, be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49865:144"/>
ſufficient,<note place="margin">6 H. 7. 5. If the bequeſt be to one of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, he may take it without aſſent of his compan. yet if a det, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe it. 48 E. 3. 14, 15.</note> I ſee not how to doubt, ſince any
one executor may give away any goods of the
teſtators, or releaſe any debts due to him, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
much more aſſent, which is no more or
greater work in effect then an atturnment of
one leſſee upon a grant of a reverſion. And if
there want to pay debts, he only who aſſented
ſhall anſwer for it of his owne goods, and not
his companions.<note place="margin">So held where but one of the executors du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nonage aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, in the caſe of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. H. 9. Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi. Ror. 895. in ba. reg. C.</note> But if this executor be either
under the age of 17 yeares, or under cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> a woman maried, ſuch is not able to
give a good aſſent to binde the others, no nor
themſelves, for then thereby the Infant might
draw a debt upon himſelfe, and the wife upon
her huſband, by aſſenting to or paying of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy,
there not being ſufficient goods to pay all
debts. But the huſbands aſſent is ſufficient
where the wife is executor, for his acts whom
ſhe hath choſen to be her head, may prejudice
as well her as himſelfe; yea though ſhe were
within age, yet he being of full age, his aſſent
will ſtand good. But if he or another executor
in his own right be above 17 yeares of age and
under 21, I doubt whether now his aſſent will
be ſufficient, at leaſt except the caſe be put that
there be aſſets ſufficient, which perhaps there
may be materiall, though not in the other. See
more hereof after in the title of women covert,
and Infants executors.</p>
               <p>As to the fourth point, firſt there may be an
aſſent &amp; election implyed, as well as expreſſe,
for if in the deviſe or bequeſt the legatee
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49865:145"/>
be appointed to do ſome act as in reſpect of
the legacy,<note place="margin">See Co. lib. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr. 150. the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſee for life ſaid, the other ſhould have it after her death and he entred and tooke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. ſhe dying inteſtate, yet held Aſſets in him.</note> and the excecutor doth accept the
performance thereof, this amounteth to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
So if the deviſe be to an executor for the
education of ſome children which he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
educate, this makes an election to
have the thing by way of legacy, and not as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor,
as appeares by the caſe of <hi>Paramoor</hi>
and <hi>Yardly, Plowd.</hi> 543. So if an horſe be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed,
and one offering to buy him of the
executor himſelfe, he directeth him to go and
buy the horſe of the legatee;<note place="margin">This M. 19 H. 7. Rot. 318. See lib. Intr. 321.</note> or if the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
himſelfe offer money to the legatee for the
horſe,<note place="margin">One gave the third part of his goods to A with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the exec. accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, and Aſued for that ſumme in det, but no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer.</note> this implyeth an aſſent that it ſhould be
the legatees by the will, and ſo was it held in
the caſe between <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Carter,</hi> where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſee
of a terme did grant it to the executor,
and this acceptance of a grant from him was
held to imply the executors aſſent that it
ſhould be his to grant. But I ſee not well how
that ſhould be law, which in the latter part of
the Lo. <hi>Dyer</hi> is found,<note place="margin">Tr. 37 Eliz. in ba. reg.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> where a terme was
deviſed to <hi>I. S.</hi> and he was made executor, and
after the death of the teſtator entred and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
the lands a whole yeare without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Will,<note place="margin">Wherebe queſts to exec. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> that this was an election to have
it as deviſee and not as executor. For firſt he
had good right to the terme as executor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
probat, and ſo might clearly in that right
have taken the profits, although it had not bin
deviſed or bequeathed to him, and that before
any will proved. Secondly, he could not by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49865:145"/>
right have it as legatee without aſſent of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
or ſome other as executor.<note place="margin">Tr. 37 Eliz. If he by will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath it to I. S. this is an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to have it as legatee.</note> Therefore this
general accepation can determine no election,
as elſewhere is held. As for diſaſſent or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablement
to aſſent. As if the executor do once
declare his aſſent that the legatee ſhall have
his legacy, he may then enter into it or take it
notwithſtanding the executors countermand
or revocation of his aſſent after. So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, I think if he do fully and expreſly
deny that the legacy ſhall take effect, he cannot
after make a good aſſent thereunto, for that
election once made muſt ſtand peremptory, be
it refuſall to aſſent, or aſſent. Yet <hi>quae.</hi> of this,
for that the refuſall to aſſent may be checked
by ſentence or decree, in the Spiritual Court or
Court of Equity, and ſo an aſſent be inforced.
But if the power of aſſenting be legally loſt by
the meanes aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> diſabled, I ſee not
how any legall intereſt can be transferred by
that compelled aſſent,<note place="margin">So if the exec. take a new leaſ his aſſent after is void. Tr. 37. Eliz. in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters caſe.</note> howſoever decreed.
And what is ſaid of a legacy bequeathed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
the ſame may be underſtood in caſe
where the bequeſt is to the executor himſelfe,
and he makes his election to have it as legatee,<note place="margin">19 Eliz. D. 359</note>
or as executor. But if where an Horſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
to <hi>A,</hi> the executor after the teſtators
death doth ride the horſe or uſe him in the
Coach, or in the Plough; I do not take this to
be any ſuch diſagreement to the execution of
the legacy, as that the executor cannot after aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the legatees having thereof, no more
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49865:146"/>
(though it be ſomewhat more) then where a
drinking-cup is bequeathed, and the executor
after the teſtators death doth uſe it to drinke
in, nay, if a leaſe of land be bequeathed to <hi>A,</hi>
and the executor continueth the depaſturing
of the teſtators therein, yet is not this any diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
to the execution of the legacie, but
if this leaſe-land were let out by the teſtator
from yeare to yeare, and the executor diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the tenant, and taketh it into his hands at
the yeares end, this I conceive to be a diſ-aſſent
to the legacie, and ſo alſo perhaps may his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or diſtraining for any rent thereupon due
after the teſtators death; yet am I not reſolute
that the diſ-aſſent is ſo peremptory and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
as the aſſent, remembring the caſe
in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his time,<note place="margin">14. H. 8. 23.</note> where a terme
being granted by a leſſee conditionally, ſo as
the aſſent of the leſſor could be had by ſuch a
day, though the leſſors aſſent were at one time
denied, yet might it be yeelded at another, ſo
as it were at any time before the day: But yet
there it was held, that if no time of aſſent were
limitted, then one expreſſe deniall or refuſall
would be peremptory, ſo as the refuſall were
expreſſed to the party to whom the aſſent was
to be given otherwiſe, if it were but in ſpeech
to or among ſtrangers. This and the former
caſe,<note place="margin">Dy. 359. After choice once made, no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation.</note> 19. <hi>Eliz.</hi> give the beſt light to this point
that I remember. Now for diſablement to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
it was held in the fore-mentioned caſe of
<hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Carter,</hi> that where a terme is bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49865:146"/>
to <hi>A,</hi> and after the teſtators death the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
takes a new leaſe of the ſame land for
more yeares in poſſeſſion, or to begin preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
now by this was the terme left by the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
ſurrendred and drowned, ſo as it could not
paſſe to <hi>A</hi> by the executors aſſent after.</p>
               <p>As to the fifth point, <hi>viz.</hi> in what manner a
leaſe for yeares or other chattell reall may be
bequeathed to one for a time, with remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to another; it hath been heretofore much
doubted, when a leaſe for yeares was bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
to one for life, or for ſo many yeares as he
ſhould live, whether the limitting of a remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereof after his deceaſe were of any vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
in law or not: and this doubt had this
ground; any ſtate for life in the judgement of
law is greater than any terme for yeares, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a termer hath by his will given his
terme, or his houſe or land, which hee ſo hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for yeares to one for life, or for ſo many
yeares as he ſhall live; this teſtator and deviſor
hath not in the judgment of the law any eſtate
remaining in him; and therefore it was thought
very hard for him to give or limit a remainder
to another: But after many arguings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batings,
it was in the late Queenes time reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that ſuch a remainder was good, and that
if the firſt deviſee died before the terme expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">Plow. Com. 520. &amp; 542.</note>
that then he to whom the remainder was
limitted, might enter and enjoy the reſidue of
the terme: As for the giving of part of the years
to one, and the reſidue to the other: <hi>viz.</hi> If the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49865:147"/>
terme being twenty yeares, the Leſſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queatheth
ten thereof to his wife, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to his daughter. Of this no doubt ever
was, but that it was good, for that after the firſt
ſtate limitted, there remained a further terme,
<hi>viz.</hi> ten yeares more in the Deviſor, whereof
he had power to diſpoſe, whereas in the other
caſe, after the terme limitted to one for life,
there remained but a poſſibility that this life
ſhould not take up the whole terme. But now
put we the caſe a third way, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
deviſeth or bequeatheth the thing in leaſe
to one child intaile, with remainder to another,
and dieth, and the firſt entreth and dyeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
iſſue; now whether ſhall the next in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
or the executor of him ſo dying have
the terme reſidue, and this caſe came in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and was adjudged about the middle of
K. <hi>Iohn</hi> his reigne in the Exchequer, for there
Maſter Hamond holding by leaſe for yeares
from the Crowne, the manner of Akers in Kent
deviſed the ſame by his will to <hi>Alexander Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
his eldeſt ſon and the heires males of his
body, with remainder to <hi>Ralfe Hamond,</hi> another
ſon in like manner, and the like remainder to
<hi>Thomas Hamond,</hi> and made the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi>
executor,<note place="margin">Both Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Ralfe were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but that makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> who after his fathers deceaſe elected
to take as legatory, and after <hi>Ralfe Hamond</hi> died
leaving iſſue male, and making his wife execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix;
<hi>Alexander</hi> not having iſſue male, granted
the whole terme by deed to <hi>B</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> for the
behoofe of himſelfe and his wife during their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49865:147"/>
lives, and after to the uſe of his yongeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom Sir <hi>Robert Lewkenor</hi> married; then
<hi>Alexander</hi> dying without iſſue male, the wife,
and Executrix of <hi>Ralfe Hammond</hi> entred claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the terme, and being kept out ſealed a
Leaſe, whereupon an <hi>Eject firmae</hi> was brought,
and a Jury appearing at the Barre in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi>
found a ſpeciall verdict in effect <hi>Vt ſupra.</hi>
And in argument of this Caſe, firſt the maine
queſtion was whether this caſe were all one
in Law with the former, where a terme was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to one for life, which remainder over ſo
as by the death of <hi>Alexander Hammond</hi> without
iſſue male, the terme ſhould goe to the next in
remainder as in the other Caſe, by the death
of the deviſee for life dying within the terme
it ſhould doe. And on the plaintifes part it was
urged to bee all one, ſo that by vertue of
the <hi>Bequeaſts ſupra, Alexander</hi> had an eſtate to
him, and his Executors onely, ſo long as there
ſhould bee heires males of his body, and hee
dying without ſuch iſſue, the terme remained
to the Executors of <hi>Ralfe,</hi> who had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
in like manner, and left iſſue male
which ſtill lived, and ſo that ſeate of <hi>Ralfe</hi> yet
had continuance. For it was admitted by the
counſell on that ſide, that the terme could not
goe to the iſſue male of <hi>Ralfe,</hi> according to the
words, and intent of the will, ſince it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to make a terme to deſcend without
an act of Parlament. This therefore they ſaid
the Law ſhould worke, which was neereſt to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49865:148"/>
intent, <hi>viz.</hi> that after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death it ſhould
goe firſt to his Executors, and aſſignees, ſo long
as iſſue male of his body doth continue, and
for want of ſuch iſſue, then to <hi>Ralfe</hi> his Executors
and aſſignees, ſo long as his iſſue male ſhould
laſt, and therefore in this caſe the iſſue male
of <hi>Alex.</hi> failing, the executor of <hi>Ralfe,</hi> whoſe iſſue
male fayleth not, ſhould injoy the terme, and ſo
judgement ought to be given for the plaintife,
being leſſee of that Executor: on the other
ſide it was ſaid by the defenda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts counſell, that
this Caſe differeth much from the other Caſe,
where the terme or Land held by Leaſe, is
given but for life to the firſt with remainder
to another; which Caſe as having beene often
reſolved, was clearely admitted to bee good
law; for in that caſe the intent of the Teſtator
might, and did take effect. But in this caſe
if the land ſhould goe to the Executors, and
aſſignees of <hi>Ralfe Hammon,</hi> it muſt goe againſt
the intent of the Teſtator, whoſe mind, and
wil was, as it appeares by his word, that it ſhould
goe onely to the iſſue male, of one ſonne after
another, and not to any Executors. Now then
ſince this intent was ſo contrary to the rules of
Law that it could not take effect, therefore it
muſt be voyd, and ſo all the words of heires Male
ſtanding voyd, the Will is to be conſtrued as a
ſole, and abſolute gift, and bequeaſt to the ſaid
<hi>Alex.</hi> &amp; conſequently the terme muſt goe to his
Executors, and aſſignees. And for this point
reſemblance was made to a Caſe reſolved in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49865:148"/>
Kings-Bench,<note place="margin">Windſmore &amp; Holford, vel Holbord in. 28 &amp; 29. Elizab. argued; and Tr. 29. Eliz. adjudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

to <hi>A. Habend.</hi> to <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> for their lives:
now becauſe <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> could take nothing it
was reſolved that <hi>A.</hi> ſhould not have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for
their lives, but for his owne onely. This Caſe
was ſaid to come very cloſe in reaſon to the
Caſe in queſtion; for as heere the intent of
the Leaſe was that <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> ſhould bee eſtated
for their lives, and ſince that could not bee,
therefore the naming of them ſhould bee ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
voyd, and as if they had not at all beene
named; and their lives ſhall not ſtand as a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for the eſtate of <hi>A.</hi> So in thother Caſe the
intent of the will, being that the Leaſe or Land
leaſed ſhould goe to the heires Males of the
body; firſt, of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and after of <hi>Raulphe;</hi>
ſince this cannot bee, therefore the words, and
name of heires males ſhould ſtand for a meere
blancke and cipher, and not to meaſure out
any ſtate to the ſaid <hi>Alex.</hi> and <hi>Ra.</hi> and their
Executors, and aſſignes. Alſo it was ſaid on
the defendants part that an eſtate for life in the
judgement of Law is of ſo ſhort, and uncertaine
continuance, that if <hi>A.</hi> make a Leaſe to <hi>B.</hi> for
his life, and after makes a Leaſe of the ſame
Land to <hi>C.</hi> for yeeres now, ſhall not this latter
Leaſe bee voyd abſolutely, for any part of the
terme, but ſhall ſtand in expectance of the
death of <hi>B.</hi> and as ſoone as hee dyeth, ſhall take
effect immediately, whereas if the Leaſe to <hi>B.</hi>
had been for ten yeeres or any like terme, then
the Leaſe to <hi>C.</hi> ſhould have beene voyd for
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49865:149"/>
ſo many yeeres of his terme, thus it appeares
that a State for life is very momentary in the
judgement of Law, and not reputed of any
certaine continuance ſo much as for a day, but
it is otherwiſe of an eſtate tayle, ſo as
if <hi>A.</hi> having given Land to <hi>B.</hi> in tayle doth
after (without indenture which makes an Eſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell)
make a Leaſe to <hi>C.</hi> for <hi>xxj.</hi> yeeres, and
then <hi>B.</hi> dyeth without iſſue during the terme,
yet ſhall not the Leaſe take effect, becauſe it
was utterly voyd at the firſt making. For an
eſtate tayle being a ſtate of inheritance may
in the intendment, and judgement of Law have
continuance for ever, as appeares both by the
Caſe of <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Lambert,</hi> where it is held
within the Statute of Chaunteries which ſpeaks
of gifts to have continuance for ever. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a reverſion upon an eſtate tayle is no aſſets,
nor giveth cauſe of receipt, otherwiſe in all
theſe Caſes it is touching a reverſion expectant
upon a ſtate for life. Againe it was ſaid by the
defendants councell that an eſtate may bee
limitted to <hi>A.</hi> and his heires during the life of
<hi>B.</hi> with remainder to <hi>C.</hi> as in <hi>Chudlies</hi> Caſe
was reſolved, but if Land bee given to <hi>A.</hi> and
his heires, ſo long as <hi>B.</hi> ſhall have heires of his
body or heires males with remainder over
to <hi>C.</hi> this remainder is utterly voyd. So
as there is in the judgement of Law a great
difference betweene the largenes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of an eſtate tayle, and of an eſtate for
life. And if (which is worth the obſerving)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49865:149"/>
a fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſimple cannot afford a remainder to
bee drawne out of it after ſuch a gift to one,
and his heires during the continuance of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
tayle, or of the meaſure thereof; much
leſſe can a terme yield ſuch large thongs to
bee cut out of it, as a remainder after an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
to one ſo long as hee ſhall have heires of
his body, or heires Males, which is all one. And
in this caſe the remainder was held voyd by
<hi>Baldwin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 H. 8. Dy. fo. 7.</note> and <hi>Shelley,</hi> though <hi>Engl field</hi> were
of contrary opinion, as the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> ſheweth.
Further it was ſaid, that if ſuch a conveyance
by will ſhould ſtand good, it would raiſe a
perpetuity not to bee cut off, by any reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>But whereas the caſe of <hi>Hammon</hi> hath beene
related before, (ſo by way of admittance it was
argued as a gift, and bequeſt to <hi>Al. Ham.</hi> and
the heires Males of his body with remainder
in like manner to <hi>Ralfe.</hi> The truth of the caſe
was, that the words of the will, were onely to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and his heires Males (not ſpeaking
of his body) and ſo to <hi>Ralfe,</hi> which as was urged
by the defendants counſell, made the Caſe
ſtronger againſt the plantifes: for admit that the
former way <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould have had but a
ſtate determinable upon the continuance of
his iſſue Males, yet here not ſo. Since the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why in Willes, ſuch a deviſe being made,
the Law ſhould ſupply the words (of the body)
is onely to make an eſtate tayle to the iſſues
Male according to the Teſtators intent. Now
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49865:150"/>
in this caſe of a terme for yeares ſo bequeathed
no eſtate tayle could poſſibly bee, though theſe
words had beene in the will, and therefore
the motive to the Law fayling, no ſuch ſupply
will bee made by the Law, ſince it would bee
to no purpoſe: conſequently, here was neither
ſtate tayle nor iſſues or heires Males of the
body, on whoſe continuance this ſtate of <hi>Alex.</hi>
ſhould bee determinable. Therefore it was an
abſolute, and totall bequeſt of the terme to
<hi>Alexander</hi> for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo long as the Terme
ſhould continue: for as a bequeſt to one for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is aſmuch as a bequeſt to him, and his heires;
ſo a bequeſt to one and his heires, is as much as if
it had beene to him for ever.</p>
               <p>And this Caſe after ſixe arguments, on each
ſide at the Barre (if I much miſtake not) was
upon argument by the Barons adjudged for the
defendant, by the Lord chiefe Baron <hi>Tanfeild,</hi>
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baron Bromley,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baron Denham,</hi>
(who onely heard as <hi>I</hi> take it, one argument
on each ſide, made of purpoſe in reſpect of
his comming into his place after the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments)
being of the contrary opinion: and
the judgement proceeded upon the point for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
touched, that as this caſe was the ſtate
of <hi>Alexander</hi> did not end by his death, and
remaine to the Executors of <hi>Ralfe.</hi> Other points
were ſtirred which will bee touched upon
other diviſions after in this Chapter. It will be
obſerved that I doe more fully expreſſe reaſons,
and points inforced on the defendants part,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49865:150"/>
then on the plaintifes, whereof let theſe two
reaſons bee accepted. Firſt, That I better
could relate that then the other, being the
firſt who argued for the defendant, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little of that which was by others ſaid on
either ſide after, nor hearing the Courts, <hi>Nec ad
hoc conductus, nec pedibus fortis.</hi> Secondly, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
did lie on the defendants part to prove
that this Caſe differed from the common caſe
of deviſe to one for life, with remainder to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>Wee are now come to the ſixt point. <hi>viz.</hi>
that where Houſe, or Land held by leaſe, or
the proffits thereof, or the leaſe or terme it
ſelfe which in a Will makes no difference, is
bequeathed to <hi>A.</hi> for life, or for ſome part of
the terme with the remainder to <hi>B.</hi> and the
Executor aſſenteth that <hi>A.</hi> ſhall enjoy his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,<note place="margin">Ploud. 545. 6.</note>
whether this ſhall enure to <hi>B.</hi> alſo ſince
without the Executors aſſent.<note place="margin">Co. lib. 10. f. 47</note> no legacy can
take effect. And it hath beene reſolved that
this aſſent ſhall bee effectuall, as well to all the
remainders as to the firſt eſtate, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to former reſolutions, it was admitted
in <hi>Hamons</hi> Caſe, that <hi>Alexander</hi> his aſſent to
take as legatee ſufficed (if the bequeſt had
beene good) for the remainders to <hi>Ralfe,</hi> and
others. And the reaſon of this doubtles is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
heere the particular eſtate, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
are all but one eſtate in Law; they
make but one degree in a Writ of Entre, nor
ſhall have but one yeere, and a day to enter
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49865:151"/>
for mortmaine; And an atturnement to the
grantee of a rent or reverſion for life with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
over doth enure alſo to the remainder,
which being an aſſent hath much affinity to that
of the Executor, each tending to perfect the
grant of another man. Now then whereas it
was urged in <hi>Hammo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds</hi> Caſe, that the ſtate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Ral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> ſhould take effect not as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
but as a new eſtate to commence fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely.
<hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould bee dead
without iſſue male: if it ſhould bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to bee ſo, then could not the aſſent of the
firſt ſtate to <hi>Alexander</hi> have enured to this, ſince
to <hi>A.</hi> remainder it worketh as being one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
with the firſt, which reaſon muſt faile tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. This difference betweene a remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and new eſtate future brings to my
minde the caſe of a rent by way of new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
granted by <hi>C.</hi> out of land to <hi>A.</hi> for life
or in taile with remainder to <hi>B.</hi> in like manner
where it hath probably beene held, although
this limitation to <hi>B.</hi> cannot bee good by way
of remainder, becauſe <hi>C.</hi> had no eſtate in the
rent remaining with him when hee made the
grant to <hi>A.</hi> yet ſhould it be good by way of new
grant, and creation to commence futurely. But
this doubtles cannot ſo be but with a difference,
for if the grant were by indenture betweene
<hi>C.</hi> on thone part, and <hi>A.</hi> only on the other part,
now <hi>B.</hi> being no party to the deed can take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it except by way of remainder; but if
hee were party to the indenture, or if the grant
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49865:151"/>
were by deed poll to which all men are alike
parties, then it happily may enure as a future
grant to <hi>B.</hi> This not impertinent.</p>
               <p>Now as the executors aſſent to one cannot
enure to another though of the ſame thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by way of remainder, ſo neither can it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way where the things are not the ſame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in very ſpeciall caſes; as if a termor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath
a rent to <hi>A,</hi> and the land it ſelfe to <hi>B,</hi> the
executors aſſent that <hi>A</hi> ſhould have the rent is
no aſſent that <hi>B</hi> ſhould have the land;<note place="margin">Plowd. Com. 521. In Bret &amp; Rigdens caſe.</note> yet I
think the aſſent that <hi>B</hi> ſhould have the land,
doth imply the aſſent that <hi>A</hi> ſhould have the
rent.<note place="margin">So of common or other profit.</note> 1. For that the reſtraint impoſed by the
law, againſt the paſſing of a chattell by a will
without the executors aſſent, being out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the payment of the teſtators debts:
now if the land ſhall paſſe to <hi>B,</hi> it is no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable
to the teſtators debts that it paſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of the rent then charged. 2. Since the
gift and bequeſt was of the land charged with
the rent, therefore if this bequeſt ſhall take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it ſhall carry the land according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators
intent, <hi>viz.</hi> with this charge upon it: for
what elſe doth the executor in this but aſſent
that the will of the teſtator herein do ſtand
and take effect, and conſequently <hi>B</hi> muſt take
the terme according to the will, and not in any
different or contrary manner.</p>
               <p>Next we are to conſider of the manner of
aſſents by executors, which hath ſome affinity
with the fourth point. But here we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49865:152"/>
only of aſſents conditionall, now to this
purpoſe we will caſt our eyes upon two ſorts
of conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> precedent and ſubſequent.
As for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he former, an executor may to a lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
abſolutely given aſſent upon a condition
precedent, as thus. I am content, that if you
can get and bring in to me ſuch a bond where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the teſtator ſtood bound unto <hi>I. S.</hi> that then
you enter upon the terme, or take the corne or
cattell to you bequeathed. So of other like
conditions which may precede the aſſent, as if
you can get the aſſent of my coexecutor, or if
you will pay the arrerages of rent to the
leſſor behind at the teſtators death, or if you
will pay the wages already due to the ſervants
attending about the cattell or corne to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed.
In this caſe, if the condition be not
performed, there is no aſſent, and therefore
the conditioning in this manner is good. But
if it be upon a condition ſubſequent, as thus I
do agree, that you ſhall have the thing bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
to you, provided that you ſhall pay ſo
much yearly to me, or to ſuch a creditor of the
teſtator, now the legatee entring into or taking
the thing bequeathed, ſhall not loſe it againe
by failing to performe the condition after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
for the executor by his aſſent cannot
make that legacy conditionall which the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
gave abſolutely, no more then he can make
that bequeſt to be abſolute which the teſtator
gave conditionally, except by a releaſe made
of the condition. As in other things, ſo in this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49865:152"/>
the executors aſſent is like to the atturnement
of a leſſee, which cannot be upon a condition
ſubſequent, where the grant is abſolute or
without condition, though yet he may to his
atturnement prefix a condition precedent.</p>
               <p>In the eighth place we are touching the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of leaſes or chattels reall, to conſider
what manner of intereſt one to whom a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of a terme after the death of another
is limited, hath, and whether he may grant the
ſame or diſpoſe thereof during the life of the
firſt. And as to that it is cleare that he hath but
a poſſibility of remainder, for that poſſibly
the whole terme may be ſpent in the life of
the firſt, to whom during his or her life it is
bequeathed, now a meere poſſibility is not
grantable. Therefore was it reſolved in the
late <hi>Queenes</hi> time,<note place="margin">99 Eliz. Fulſes caſe.</note> where hee in remainder
granted or ſould his ſtate or intereſt to another
during the time of the firſt, that this grant was
utterly void, becauſe a poſſibility cannot be
granted;<note place="margin">Lampets caſe. Co. l. 10. fo. 48.</note> but whereas ſome opinion in that
caſe was delivered that this poſſibility could
not be releaſed, no more then granted, it hath
ſince bin reſolved that he in the remainder by
his deed of grant or releaſe to the deviſee for
life may make his eſtate, which before was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
by his death to be now abſolute, ſo
as it ſhall continue to his executors, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators,
and aſſignes after his death during the
whole terme. It may be that what was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the ſaid caſe of <hi>Fulſey,</hi> negatively of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49865:153"/>
validity of a releaſe by him in the remainder,
might be meant or perhaps expreſſed of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
to him in the reverſion; but ſurely me
thinks though he could not ſurrender, yet his
releaſe or defeaſance to him in reverſion or
remainder having the freehold or inheritance,
ſhould diſſolve or deſtroy this terme reſidue
after the death of the diviſee for life, ſo as
there the freehold ſhould be diſcharged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
But <hi>Quae.</hi> for I have not knowne this in
queſtion. As for the other point of <hi>Fulſes</hi> caſe,
it was in the ſaid later caſe of <hi>Lampett</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and admitted for good law, <hi>viz.</hi> that this
poſſibility of remainder could not be aliened
nor conveyed to a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to the ninth point,<note place="margin">9 Point.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
to examine whether any act of the deviſee for
life can fruſtrate or defeate him in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the terme, and whether by the act of
God, <hi>viz.</hi> the death of him in the remainder
before the firſt deviſee for life ſhall defeat it.
As to the firſt, it hath divers times been reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">Plowd. 520. Wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that no grant made by the firſt man cut
off or defeat the ſecond, though formerly it
were held otherwiſe; but according to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

all in the ſaid caſe of <hi>Hamo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d,</hi> where was ſuch
a grant. And as this cannot be done by direct
grant or alienation, no more can it by an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
or implyed, as by taking of a new leaſe,
which is a ſurrender in law of the old leaſe, no
more then by an expreſſe ſurrender. Nor
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49865:153"/>
doubtleſſe by outlawry, whereby the terme of
the firſt diviſee is ſetled in the Crowne. But if
we put the caſe further of waſte committed by
the tenant for life, or breach of condition by
not paiment of the rent or otherwiſe, theſe for
the whole in the later caſe, and for the part
waſted in the former, doe ſo deſtroy the leaſe,
and put the reverſioner in <hi>Statu quo prius,</hi> as
that all remainders muſt needs faile; ſo of a
feoffement or other like forfeiture by fine. As
for the death of him in remainder, it was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the caſe of <hi>Hamond,</hi> that ſince it was but
a meere poſſibility, if it could not take effect,
and become an eſtate in the life of him to
whom it was limitted, it could not ſettle in his
executor; and to that purpoſe were cited the
caſe of the Rector of Chedington, and more
expreſly as reſolved in the point, the caſe of
<hi>Price</hi> and <hi>Atmore.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Weleden &amp; Elk. ubi ſupra. But there the point was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not hinder, but that it may ſettle as well in his

ſhould have done in himſelfe, if he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived
the firſt diviſee for life. If the leſſor enter
and levie a fine, and the diviſee for life enters
not, nor claimes in five years, he in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may enter, as having a right futurely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued.</p>

may be forfeited, loſt, or revoked. Firſt then,
we will conſider of the acts of the legatee; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
of the acts of God; thirdly of the acts
of the teſtator. The legatee, as from the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
I learne, may forfeit his legacie by his
miſ-cariage towards the will:<note place="margin">Swinb. de te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtam. 352, 353. Except as tutor or guardian he accuſe it.</note> as if hee uſe
meanes to have it concealed and kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

he accuſe it of falſity. So againe, if he deface
or deſtroy the will. Alſo if being by the will
appointed to be tutor or educator of a child,
he refuſeth ſo to be; ſo ſaith Maſter <hi>Swinborne:</hi>
but <hi>Silveſter Prierius</hi> ſeemes to me oppoſite in
that where he ſaith,<note place="margin">Sum. Silv. 284.</note> 
                  <hi>Si legatum fuerit aliquid ea
conditione ut facias aliquid, tale legatum non eſt
conditionale, ſed modale;</hi> ſo as he takes away the
force of a condition from words conditionall,
whereas the other without words conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
raiſeth a condition implied. Laſtly, if the
legatee preſume too farre upon the ſtrength of
of the bequeſt to him, ſo as he taketh the thing
bequeathed without the conſent of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
thus alſo doth he forfait his legacie, ſaith
Maſter <hi>Swinborne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De teſtam. 25<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and appoint he ſhould ſo doe. The falling into
enmity with the teſtator, will be conſidered of
more fitly, as I take it, among the acts of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator.
In the next place let us ſee what acts of
ſhall God cauſe a legacy not to take effect, firſt
thus: If the legatee die before the teſtator,
this legacie is loſt, and his executor ſhall not
have it: So alſo ſaith Maſter <hi>Swinborne,</hi> if it be
appointed to bee paid after the death of the
executor, and the legatee dieth before the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,<note place="margin">De teſtam. 255 Vide Bro. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe 27. &amp; 45. th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is loſt; and ſo alſo if he dye before the
condition performed, ſaith he; Let us come
now to time of payment, and death before it.
If there bee a day certaine limitted for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the legatee die before that day, his
executor ſhall have the legacie; contrariwiſe,
if the paiment were limitted to be made when
the legatee ſhould be married: but if it were
only expreſſed to be towards the marriage of
the legatee, and ſhee die before marriage, her
executors ſhall have it, ſaith <hi>Swinborne.</hi> Now
put the caſe that a legacie is bequeathed to <hi>B</hi>
to be payed when he ſhall be five and twenty
yeares old, and <hi>B</hi> dyeth before that age, it ſhall
now be paid to the executor, and that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the words of the will be ſo,<note place="margin">According hereto; vide Dy. ubi ſupra, per majorem opinionem Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticiat.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> when he ſhall
come to ſuch an age, then if he die before, his
executors ſhall not have it at all, but if the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
be generall; and further it is added in the
will that the teſtator would have that legacie
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49865:155"/>
paid the legatee at ſuch an age there though
he die before ſuch age, yet his executors ſhall
have the ſumme bequeathed. The difference
may ſeeme very nice, yet happily it wants not
ſome probable colour of reaſon. Now laſtly,
let us come to the teſtators own act,<note place="margin">Acts of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator.</note> who clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath power to revoke or countermand any

and never reconciled between the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and legatee, the legacie is diſſolved, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of a light breach, or falling out, though it
continue untill the death of the teſtator. This
I conceived to be rather fit for this place, as an
act of the teſtator, then to be reckoned or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred
among the acts or forfeitures of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatee,
for that it is not by the Summiſt made
materiall, or any point of difference, whether
the legatee gave juſt cauſe of offence, or that
the teſtator unjuſtly conceived diſpleaſure, and
ſo grew into cauſeleſſe enmity. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
doe I hold it of the nature of a revocation
implied or preſumed, for that although no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
be made, yet ſince the teſtator hath
ceaſed to beare good will to the legatee, hee
cannot be intended to will him good, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
whether the circumſtance following
may not make a difference in the caſe thus;
that where the teſtator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dieth ſhortly after the
breach and enmity growen, and before hee
come to the place where his will is, or at leaſt
to opportunity of peruſing and reforming the
ſame: There this very alteration of affection
ſhould make an alteration in the will, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of the amicable bequeſt. But where
he living a good ſpace after, and comming to
the place where his will was, and ſpecially if
he doe againe peruſe it, and yet doth not croſſe
nor expunge that bequeſt, here it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
that either his enmity ceaſed, or that ſo
farre as to continue this bequeſt, the charity or
other motives inducing him to make it, ſtood
unvanquiſhed and not extinguiſhed by this
breach of former amity. For as the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of time and opportunity after the making
of a verball or nuncupative will, without redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it to writing, and cauſing it to be atteſted
by witneſſes, though the teſtator live divers
years after, doth ſtrongly argue his intent not
to continue, that what was done in an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhould ſtand as his will: ſo on the contrary,
the permitting of a bequeſt expreſſed in a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
will, to continue without any croſſing, blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or defacing, may argue againſt contrary
preſumption, the teſtators mind, that it ſhould
continue as part of his will. But now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49865:156"/>
of more expreſſe revocation, and to that
purpoſe will I relate a late decree in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
made by the Lord Keeper, according to
the opinion of the Maſter of the Rolls, three
Judges, and two Doctors, Maſters of the Court;
Betweene <hi>Robert Eyre</hi> and <hi>William Eyre</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants,
and <hi>Heſter</hi> late wife of <hi>Chriſtopher Eyre</hi>
their brother, and now wife of Sir <hi>Francis

and teſtament giveth and bequeatheth to the

and Maſter <hi>Stone,</hi> to ſettle his eſtate; to which

<hi>Damport</hi> did demand of the ſaid <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi>
what friend hee thought fitteſt to be his

ſhould bee his ſole Executrix, and then the

bequeath legacies to his father, to his brethren,

hee would give or leave them nothing, and

yet this hath ſuch relation to the date of

the indenture, that if <hi>A.</hi> after that, and before

granted a rent charg, or made a leaſe for yeeres,

none of theſe bee of any force to charge or

him now owner by relation as from
the time of the date: yea if a ſervant depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Auguſt</hi> for ſome great breach with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
do kill his maſter in <hi>October,</hi> this is in law
petty treaſon, as if hee had continued ſervant
when hee did the fact, becauſe it relates to the
malice conceaved when hee was his ſervant.
Now then having ſhewed that a terme or other
chatell reall or perſonall, paſſeth not nor is
transferred in property to the deviſee untill the
aſſent of the Executor bee thereunto had; Wee
now put the caſe that this aſſent is not had
till a yeere, or ſome ſuch good ſpace after the
Teſtators death, and make our queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this ſhall have relation to the Teſtators
death, <hi>viz.</hi> to bee in the lawes account as if it
had then beene. Or perhaps to ſome purpoſes
ſo to ſtand, and to others not ſo. That this is
uſefull, and materiall to bee knowne bee it
thus ſhewed. One bequeatheth his terme of
tithes of an advowſon of an Houſe or land by
him firſt leaſed to an undertenant for rent, and
dieth in <hi>May,</hi> the Executor aſſenteth to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
in <hi>October,</hi> betweene which two times
tithes be ſet out, the Church becommeth voyd,
rent groweth payable; now if this aſſent ſhall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49865:158"/>
relate to the Teſtators death, the deviſee ſhall
have theſe elſe not; the like caſes may be put of
the brood of Cowes, Mares, and Ewes, fallen
betweene the death of the Teſtator, and the
aſſent; ſo alſo of Fleeces of Sheepe ſhorne, &amp;c.
Now to come to the point, it is reported by
the Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> to have beene held in the late
Queenes time,<note place="margin">Tr. 41. Eliz.</note> that this aſſent ſhall as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

to the Teſtators death,<note place="margin">B. San ders Caſe.</note> yet ſo that if the

ſhall bee brought againſt the Executor, in the
<hi>Tenuit</hi> for the waſt done before, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

that the legatee before the Executors aſſent
granted the terme to <hi>I. S.</hi> now if to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this aſsent ſhall have relation, it ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſo bee to make good this grant, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the legatee to bee eſtated, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to grant before the Executors aſsent,
yet doe I not finde any opinion or reſolution in
the Point, but finde it debated at the Barre in
the late Queenes time betweene <hi>Puckering,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 25. Eliz.</note> and
<hi>Egerton,</hi> in the caſe of adminiſtration granted
to <hi>A.</hi> after her grant a free terme, left by her
inteſtate husband; but I finde no reſolution
therein, nor perhaps wants there materiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt that caſe, and the other: for
there the deviſee had at leaſt an inception of
title by gift of the owner, wanting onely a
circumſtance of aſsent to perfect it: but heere
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49865:159"/>
this woman till adminiſtration had not ſo; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse
perhaps the Statute 21. Of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth,
directing or enjoyning ordinaries to grant
adminiſtration ſhall amount to a kinde of title,
<hi>ad rem:</hi> though not yet <hi>in re.</hi> But to returne
to the Point of aſsets;<note place="margin">48. E. 3. 15.</note> where a reverſion is
gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by deed or fine, if the leſsee a good time
after doe atturne, this ſhall have no relation to
the time of the grant; So as for waſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or rent growne due between the grant, and
atturnement, the grantee can have no remedy.
Therefore it is good for him who buyeth or
hath any thing of the gift of a legatee, to have
the aſſent of the Executor, before the ſale or
gift well teſtified, or if the aſsent bee not had
till after, let him take a new gift, that hee may
not reſt in a doubtfull caſe, for beſides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſses
that great legiſt, Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> when
hee was a practiſer to Maſter <hi>Stubbes</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
for his Sea gave his opinion as I have beene
confidently informed, that where a leſsee, for
yeeres, being outlawed did grant his terme,
and after reverſed the outlawry, this did not
make good the grant by relation, it not being
in the grantor at the time of his grant, and this
hath much affinity with the principall point, for
there if the relation helpe not, the grant is not
good from the Legatee.</p>

buy out the others part for the legatee, or give
him the value; but if the words be but generall
ſo as they may be reaſonably ſatisfied with the

made in the point,<note place="margin">25. Ed. 3 cap. 5.</note> and after an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to enable them to bring actions, and to
make them ſubject to actions, yet the Statute
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49865:163"/>
ſpeakes nothing of conferring upon them the
Teſtators goods. Now if they had title to them
before that Statute and without the helpe of
that Statute, it is ſtrange if they ſhould not
bee ſuable for debts. But ſince that Statute, and
at this day where by a will a ſpeciall truſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to an Executor, as to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>OF theſe alſo as ſtanding in much affinity

that <hi>I</hi> ſhould have treated. But firſt my

<hi>I</hi> was unwilling to inlarge it further. Secondly,
that which in the points of having, and doing

of Debts, Legacies, and the
preferring or reſpect of perſons.</head>
            <p>TO the advertiſement what courſe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are to hold in their payments, I
thought good to adde this in <hi>foro conſcientiae.</hi>
That when as it ſhall ſtand in the executors
will and election to pay whom he will, and as
he will in reſpect of equality in the dignity
and degree of the debts, all being for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
by ſpecialty, and none of record, and yet
he hath not wherewith to pay or ſatisfie all;
Here he may have three wayes or courſes in
his eye.</p>
            <p>Firſt, where there is equality in the honeſty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and conſcience of the debts; there except in
the ability of the paties to beare loſſe, the
diſproportion may otherwiſe occaſion, me
thinks it ſhould be moſt honeſt and juſt to pay
every one proportionably, and to let the loſſe
of every one to be equall: and the juſtneſſe of
this is taught by the law, which gives the <hi>audita
querela</hi> for equall contribution in bearing of
loſſe by them who ſtand in equall degree: ſo
of legacies.</p>
            <p>The poverty and inability of ſome, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
plenty of others, may in <hi>foro conſcientiae</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the paying more to one and ſuffering him
to loſe leſſe (if any thing) then another. For as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49865:165"/>
the widowes mite was a greater gift, ſo a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
loſſe then more out of abundance. Where
charity findes, or may finde place or neerneſſe
to place of giving, it may find greater motives
of preſerving from loſſe, So of legacies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The nature of the debts, and ſo ſometime
of legacies, may be ſo different, as thence may
ſpring a juſt motive to diſproportion pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to pay more to one then another, rate
for rate, and ſo to ſuffer one to loſe more
then another. One debt may perhaps be uſe
for money, or at leaſt money lent for uſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be money freely lent. Another debt
for land of inheritance bought; another debt
for a leaſe, chattels, or moveables, come to the
executor. The firſt merits the leaſt reſpect,
next the ſecond, then the third, and the laſt
the moſt. But where without any of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
there is not equality held in payment,
<hi>Peccatur</hi> (as I think) <hi>in conſcientiam.</hi> But let
every one ſtand or fall by or to his own, or to
him who is greater then his conſcience. This
equality S. <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe recommends
to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
