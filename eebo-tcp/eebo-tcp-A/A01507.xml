         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His little Booke ensuing, was addressed to Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1537. whiche when I had redde, and well perused (kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the impression almost spente) I dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it worthy a new imprinting, bycause it was written by two auntient Fathers, and learned Diuines, who vouched their authorities from the sacred word of God. Alas, that Arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of al mischiefes, &amp; direction to most heresies and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the denial I meane of the supremacie of the Quéene, far surpasseth all other Heresies and Treasons, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, bringeth destruction of body &amp; soule. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit (the more to be lamented) it is ouer rife in <hi>England,</hi> for it is not only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of diuers old men, but of many yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are destitute of learning, voyde of grace, &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of knowledge, and yet hold opinion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is, and ought to be the supreme head. What blinde sorte of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill disposed Papistes be they? nay rather, what Romishe Rebels are they? which (contrarie to the word of God) had rather haue a forraigne <hi>Pope</hi> their head, than oure most dread and soueraigne Lady, the Quéenes most excellente Maiestie, whose Subiectes naturallie we are, vnder whose obeysance we are borne, vnder whose protection we liue, and vnder whose mightie power (next God) we rest defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all forraigne Enimies, in suche sorte, as by the lawes of God, by the lawes of Nature, and by the lawes of the Realme, we are bounde to obey hir, and none other. These things considered, I can not but maruell how those Papistes dare so presumptuouslie extoll that enimie of Christe, the <hi>Pope,</hi> as to call hym <hi>Gods Vicar on earth.</hi> What <hi>Pope</hi> hath coniured them? or what Deuill hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched them, that they are so mightilie affected to the <hi>Pope?</hi> and so slenderlie regard their naturall liege Lady the


<pb facs="tcp:3014:4"/>
Quéenes Maiestie? Sure I am, that by denying the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, they haue broughte themselues into <hi>Premunire,</hi> and from thence grow into farther mischiefes, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their holy Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> with all his Colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, can not deliuer them. And what else commeth of this Papisticall Religion, but murmuring, contention, strife, sedition, rumors, lewde practises, and priuie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, to put discord amongst them that liue in peace, and lastly open Rebellion, if they were able to bring it to passe? For want of which habilitie, they nowe vse Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Coniuration, Nicromancie, Piromancie, and Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, wherto they attribute great credite. They séeke out Witches and Sorcerers wheresoeuer they may be found throughout Christendome.

Wherefore, I wishe all menne to beware, howe they kéepe company wyth Papistes: for euen as the Lepres infect others with theyr foule disease: so doe the Papists infect many, with their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiferous euill councell, and worse example. They resemble likewise the venemous Toade: for as the foule Toade can not abyde the swéete tast of the fruitefull Uine, so can not they abide the true tast of the doctrine of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Christe, the flourishing Uyne of eternall life, but wrest the sacred Scriptures, to serue their turnes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the <hi>Pope</hi> aboue Emperour and Kings, falsehoode before truth, darkenesse before light, ignoraunce before knowlege, a Masse no Communion, a Dirge no Sermon, a Concubine no Wife, Bulles and baggages, before the sincere word of God.<note place="margin">

But let this passe, and sée nowe what oure home Papistes sende them againe. I wéepe to write: they cause, that many Gentlemen, and some of greate Worship, doe send their sons to <hi>Doway,</hi> to the Uniuersitie of <hi>Louaine,</hi> to <hi>Rheynes,</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> yea, and some to <hi>Rome,</hi> to nuzel them in Idolatrie, and roote them in Papistrie. And great are the summes of mony, whiche yearely goe hence for the finding and maintayning of those yong Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the charge whiche relieueth the Papistes that are there, for the number is greate, and they are very liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully rewarded out of <hi>England</hi> by the Papists here: For many Papists sell their lands, and employ their great summes of money in banke, contrary to the expresse word of God,<note place="margin">The Iewes entred in the time of King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1067. and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in the raigne of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the firste. 1291.</note> as the Iewes did in the time of King <hi>Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> the conqueror, &amp; employ the foule increase or vsurie therof, to the reliefe of other Papists beyond sea. Moreouer, their Buls, pardons, and such other néedlesse, or rather damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble baggage, trash, &amp; trumperies, are ouer dearly bought, althoughe indéede they be nothing worth, nay worse than naught. For in the raigne of Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> I my selfe did know a Gentlewoman, that gaue .xx. pound for a Bull that she might not come to Church, yet was shée as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike as the beste of that sorte: but the matter was, for that the priest of the parish and she were fallen out. Truly that Bull was a fit Make for a Cowe, or hir charitie, and aswel worth .xx. pound, as an Owle is worth an ounce of fine gold: and euen of that value be the rest of his Bulles, pardons, and sanctimonies, and graunted vppon as greate considerations. For it is bruted by the Papistes, that the traiterous varlet <hi>Felto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> is canonized for a Saint at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; so was <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> a Prelate, as traiterous, as <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the Papist was: but <hi>Felton</hi> obtained the Popes great


<pb facs="tcp:3014:5"/>
grace, for the setting vp of a Bull, which then was newly brought into <hi>England,</hi> and for his reward, was faire han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, drawen, and quartered (and had no more harme:) yet that Bull begat many Calues, both Bull Calues, and Cow Calues, whiche it is high time to wayne, for they make suche a bleating, that no man can take rest, or lyue quietly by them, vnlesse peraduenture they receyue the Bulles rewarde. And if it be true that <hi>Felton</hi> is Saincted, then is it for his Treason sake. And what Traytor then would not loue such a <hi>Pope</hi> as can make Saincts of Diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Traytors? or who can but feare suche a <hi>Pope,</hi> as can make Diuels of Saincts? for with his holy pardons (if he lie not) he maketh Sainctes, and with his terrible curses (if he say true) he maketh Diuels, so as Sainctes and Diuels are at his pleasure. And the <hi>Pope</hi> can do more than this too, for he can send Soules to Heauen, and take Soules out of Purgatorie, for that (as he sayeth) is the bayting place by the way to Heauen, or to hell. And what is that the <hi>Pope</hi> can (not) do? forsooth nothing at all: for as great is his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power in making of Sainctes, as a Coblers skill and arte is, to make Mappes of the whole World: And I beléeue there are as manye Sainctes in Heauen made by the <hi>Popes,</hi> as there are blacke Swannes swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Thames. But for all the <hi>Popes</hi> magnificence, and superabundant authoritie, I had rather be a Collyer at <hi>Croyden,</hi> than a <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> for in my iudgement, it is better to haue a blacke body like a Collier, than a blacke Soule like a <hi>Pope,</hi> for vnlesse the <hi>Pope</hi> washe himselfe cleane in the bloud of Christ, with the droppes and teares of repentance, onely trusting in the merites of Christes Passion (which he can not allow sufficient to saluation) hée shall neuer sée the ioyes of Heauen, but in post hast he must néedes goe to his second Sea and patrimonie in Hel, to the blacke féend Lucyfer his fellow companion for Pride, and whose faithfull Uicar he approueth himselfe héere: for as

all men know, in Hell there is no redemption. Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude &amp; demaund, what foolish senselesse Papistes are, they that beléeue the <hi>Pope</hi> can help them, where he can not help himselfe? for we beléeue in God, who sayeth, <hi>Subditi estote omni humanae ordinationi propter Dominum, siue Regi tanquam praecellenti. &amp;c.

to the Deuill, and manyfest Traytoures to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene. For to saye the truth, Papistes were the cause of the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the North, whyche was the ouerthrowe of the auntiente house of <hi>Westmerlande,</hi> and the deathe of the Earle of <hi>Northumberlande,</hi> and manye other, as <hi>Norton, Markamvielde,</hi> and others, whyche haue steyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with Treason, and vndone their houses for euer. There were also at that time many Bayliffes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables, to the number of thrée hundred or vpwarde han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whiche well deserued it, in that they commaunded menne in the Quéenes name, to goe to that Campe, the Camp where the Rebels lay. But Northerne men may say, <hi>that euill is that camping where the Gallowes winnes the Goale.</hi> These thyngs will not be forgotten in the <hi>North</hi> partes these hundreth yeares. And therefore take héede Papistes, and thinke that Northerne men will not Rebell, for they haue payde for their learning. You maye not vaunt as you were wont to doe, saying, you were sure that all the <hi>North</hi> would take your partes, for if you make your reckning so, you recken without your hoste, for ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lordes nor Lurdeynes can rayse them, withoute commaundemente from the Prince. Therefore (good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes) vouchsafe to reade this little Booke, whereby you may learne to obey the Quéenes Highnesse truely, and to detest the <hi>Popes</hi> fayned holynesse vtterly.</p>
            <p>Thys little Booke or Letter, was written in <hi>Anno</hi> 1537. and in the thirtith yeare of the Raigne of our late Soueraigne Lorde of famous memorie, Kyng <hi>HENRYE</hi> the eyght, at what time <hi>Reginalde Poole</hi> was made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, for <hi>Cosma</hi> and <hi>Damian,</hi> by <hi>Paule</hi> the third, Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> so as the Papistes can not mislike it for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, for it carieth some antiquitie, and was written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fortie yeares sithence.

But what haue I said? <hi>Supreme head in earth, of the Church of England and Ireland next vnder Christ?</hi> Yea forsooth, what make you then of the <hi>Popes</hi> holynesse may be your demaund: I aunswere, that I make of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> (so farre forthe as he be a Christian, and the seruaunt of God) the like and as large accompt for his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit (though not with so great dutie, bycause I am an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishman, and not of his Dioces) as I make of any Bishop in <hi>Englande</hi> within his iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder oure sayde Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lady, so long as the same Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> kéepeth him within his compasse, and acknowledgeth himselfe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the King of that Territorie: but so farre forth, as he standeth harlot like vpon the type of hys worldly pompe, I take him to be that <hi>Antechrist,</hi> whiche <hi>Paule</hi> calleth the man of Sinne, and child of perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. You may further aske me, <hi>howe if</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe be King there? I answere, that <hi>how if,</hi> with <hi>how if not:</hi> for if Christ, whose Uicar on

Me thinkes I sée the Papist smile in his sléeue (for in déede he is a smooth faced fellowe) at this my simple conuersion, saying, that I haue framed a goodly argument, that is, bycause the Kingdome of Christ is not of the world, therefore the <hi>Popes</hi> holynesse may not be a King in Christendome, as if it should be said, bycause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kingdome of <hi>HENRYE</hi> the eyght reached not ouer <hi>Europe,</hi> therfore <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> his right heire, may not be Quéene of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Let me smile wyth him againe (I pray you) for I will yéelde him that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Christendome, which Christ did weare the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Crowne of: let him likewise yéelde to euery King roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie in his owne Kingdome.

For there is no power but of God, and therevppon Sainte <hi>Peter</hi> sayeth in hys firste Epistle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the seconde Chapter, as in the former Preface is allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>Be yee subiect to all humane ordinance for the Lords sake, whether it be vnto the King, as to the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente. &amp;c.</hi> Nowe if the Kyng bée most excellente, who maye bée hys supreme?

            <p>Thou mayest aske of me, by what authoritie the Kings of the earthe holde thys supremacie? I saye, the wordes of Saincte <hi>Peter</hi> graunte it.

And thus from tyme to tyme, and at all tymes, the Kyng from the hande of God, and the Priest from the King, receyueth authoritie. <hi>Vnus est enim Legislator &amp; Iudex, qui potest perdere &amp; liberare.

            <p>Howbeit, the largenesse and magnificence of buildings of that Citie, and auncient excellencie and superioritie of the same, in temporall dominions, was the onely cause that in the Counsailes (where the Patriarchall seas were set in order) the Bishoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> was lotted in the first place, and not in any such constitution made by Christ, as appeareth well by that that <hi>Constantinople</hi> béeing at that time of this ordering of the Patriarchall seas, by the

            </p>
            <p>Truth it is, that the Bishops of the Orient,<note place="margin">

And those countries, as well Byshoppes as others, much infected with the heresies of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> whereof the Weast was in a manner cléere. And among the Orients, none were counted indifferent to decide those matters, but where all suspect of affection for one cause or other: wherefore they desired the opinions of the Bishops of the West as indifferent, vntangled with affections of any of those partes, and incorrupted with any of the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as appeareth by the Epistles of Sainct <hi>Basil</hi> written in all their names for the sayde purpose. In the which also it is especially to bée noted, that their suite was not to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> singularly, or by name, but as the titles doe shewe to the whole congregation of the Bishoppes of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or of the whole West, and sometyme preferring the <hi>French</hi> Bishops, saying, <hi>Gallis &amp; Italis,</hi> and neuer naming the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3014:16"/>And for a cléere proofe that the auncient Fathers knewe not this primacie of one aboue all, wée néede none other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, but their determination in the counsell of <hi>Nice,</hi> that <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and vniuersally all other primates, should haue the whole gouernaunce of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine countries, likewise as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had of his <hi>Suburbicans.</hi> And this determination proueth also, that your thrée Scriptures ment nothing lesse, then this prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ouer all. For God forbid that wée should suspect that counsell as ignoraunt of those plaine Scriptures, to the which sith that time all Christendome hath leaned, as the anker of our faith. And if you like to reade the auncient ecclesiasticall histories, there you may sée, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> &amp; other Patriarkes did execute that primacie, as in making, consecrating, and ordering of Churches, Bishoppes and Clarkes in their countries, East and South, as the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in that time did in the West and North. And if ye would yet any thing obiect against any of these witnesse, then for to eschewe contention, and for a finall conclusion, let the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> stand to his owne confession made many years past by his predecessour <hi>Agatho,</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Constantine, Heraclius,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in his Epistle written to them in his name, and in the name of all the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> which he thought to bée vnder the sea <hi>Apostolique,</hi> wherein soone after the beginning of the Epistle, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth them all vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of the Bishops dwelling in the North and West parts of their Empire. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther, in his owne Epistle, he confesseth all his subiects or obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries, to hée onely of the North and West, &amp; so appeareth euidently by his owne confession, that neither by Gods law nor mans lawe he had to do with any person of the East or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> South. And this his high souereintie ouer all challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as you and others say, by Scripture, as by his owne confession quailed and brought to a little &amp; strayght angle.

haue sith your letters sent hether concerning this matter, and would giue more credence to their humble and playne speaking, than to the latter contentious and ambitious wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that high, and aboue the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> his subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie (which passeth as ye write) the lawyers learning and capacitiy: we doubt not, but that ye perceiue and thinke the same.</p>
            <p>And where ye thincke that the king cannot be taken as supreme heade of the Churche, bicause he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the chiefe office of the Church in preaching and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string of Sacraments, it is not requisite in euery body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, that the head shall exercise eyther all manner of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the body, or the chiefe office of the same. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the head is the highest and chiefe member of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, yet the distribution of lyfe to all the members of the body, aswell to the head as to other members, commeth from the heart, and is minister of lyfe to the whole bodye as the chiefe acte of the body. This simlitude yet hath not his full place in a mysticall body, although the Scripture speaking of king <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15.</note> sayth: <hi>Cum esses paruulus in ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis tuis, coustitui te caput in tribubus Israel:</hi> When thou wert but of small reputacion in thine owne eyes, I made thée head amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> And if a king amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were <hi>Caput in tribubus Israel: hoc est homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num videntium Deum per vmbram, tempore legis, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò magis Princeps Christianus caput est in tribubus Israel, hoc est verè per fidem videntium Christum, qui est finis legis:</hi> The heade in the tribes of <hi>Israel:</hi> that is, of men which sée God by a shadowe in the time of the law, much more is a Christian king head in the tribes of spirituall <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that is, of such which by true fayth sée Christ which is the ende of the law. The office deputed to the Bishops in the misticall body, is to be as eyes to the whole bodye, as almightie God sayth to the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

to vse the office of an eye in the mysticall body, to shew vnto the body the right way of lyuing, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to the spirituall eye to doe, shall shew himselfe to be a blinde eye: and if he shall take other office in hande than appertayneth to the right eye, shall make a confusion in the body, taking vppon him an other office, then is giuen to him of God. Wherefore if the eye will take vpon him the office of the whole head, it may be aunswered vnto it: It cannot so do, for it lacketh brayne.</p>
            <p>And examples sheweth lykewise, that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie alwayes that the heade should haue the facultie or chiefe office of administration, you may sée in a Nauy by Sea, wher the Admiral who is captaine ouer all, doth not meddle with stering or gouerning of euery ship, but euery Maister perticular must direct the ship, to passe the Sea in breaking the waues, by his stering and gouernance, which the Admirall the head of all, doth not himselfe, nor yet hath the facultie to doe, but commaundeth the Maisters of the ship to doe it. And likewise many a captaine of great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, which is not able, nor neuer coulde peraduenture shoote or breake a speare by his owne strength, yet by his wisedome and commaundement onely, he atchieueth the warres, and attayneth the victory. And where ye thinke that vnitie standeth not onely in the agréeing in one fayth and doctrine of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also in agreeing in one head: if ye meane the very and onely head ouer all the Churche our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Quem pater dedit caput super omnem Ecclesiam, quae est corpus eius</hi>: Whome the father hath set ouer all the Church, which is his bodye, wherein all good Christian men doe agrée, ye say truth.

And as for any other one vniuersall head to be ouer all, then Christ himselfe, Scripture prooueth not, as it is shewed before. And yet of a farther proofe to take away the scruples, that peraduenture doe to your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce rise of certeyne wordes in some auncient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, and especially in Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epistles, as the vnitie of the Church stoode in the vnitie with the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they neuer call him supreme head, if you precisely weygh, and conferre all their sayings together, yée shall perceiue that they neyther spake nor ment other thing, but when the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was once lawfully elected and intronizate, if then any other would by faction, might, force, or otherwise, (the other lyuing and doeyng his office,) enterprise to put him downe, and vsurpe the same Bishopricke, or exercise the others office himselfe. As <hi>Nouatianus</hi> did attempt in the time of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that then the sayd Fathers reconed them good Catholiques that did communicate with him that was so lawfully elected, and the custome was one Primacie to haue adoe one with an other, by congratulatory letters, soone after the certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their election was knowne to kéepe the vnitie of the Church. And they that did take parte or maintaine that other vsurper, to be Shismatiques bicause that vsurper was a Schismatique for that, <hi>Quia non sit fas in eadem Ecclesia, duos simul esse episcopos, nec priorem legitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum

And that by the precepte of <hi>Ezechias</hi> the king, and of <hi>Azarias</hi> the Bishop of the house of the Lord, all things were done, to whom perteined all the dispensation of the house of the Lord.

By al which it may appeare, that Christian Kings be souereigns ouer the Priestes, as ouer all other their subiects, and maye commaund the Priestes to doe their offices, as well as they doe other: And ought by their supreme office, to sée that all men of all degrées doe their dueties, wherevnto they he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, either by God, or by the King. And those kings that so doe, chiefly doe execute well their office. So that the kings highnesse taking vpon him as supreme head of the Church of England, to sée that as well spirituall men as temporal do their duties, doth neither make innouation in the Churche, nor yet trouble the order thereoff: But doth as the chiefe and the best of the kinges of <hi>Israll</hi> did, and as all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian kings ought to doe. Which office good Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours alwaies tooke vpon them, in calling the vniuersall counsels of all countries in one place, and at one time to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, to the intent all heresies troubling the Church, might be there extyrped: calling &amp; commaunding as well the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as other Patriarches and all Primats, aswel of the East, as of the West: of the South, and of the North, to come to the sayde counsels. As <hi>Marlianus</hi> the Emperour did, in calling the great counsaile of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> one of the foure chiefe and first generall counsailes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding <hi>Leo,</hi> then Bishoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> to come thereto. And albeit <hi>Leo</hi> neither lyked the time whiche hée woulde for a season shoulde haue bene deferred: nor yet the place which he woulde haue had in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Emperour by


<pb facs="tcp:3014:20"/>
his owne commaundement had called it to <hi>Calchis</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> yet he aunswered the Emperour, that he would gladly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his commaundement, and sent thether his agents to appeare ther for him. As doth appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epistles of <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Martian</hi> the Emperor .xli.xlvii.xlviii. and in the xlix. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to <hi>Pulcheria</hi> Empresse.

He imparted both his substaunce and secreat aduise (as <hi>Benno</hi> sayth) vnto <hi>Brasutus,</hi> and one <hi>Iudeus,</hi> his familiar friendes, throughe whose meanes and persuasion, many men wincked at hys wickednesse.

               <l>Therein to put his comfort, life, and hope:</l>

               <l>An Epistle is the second writing flat,</l>

               <l>No foe, nor fire, haue force to make him faint:</l>

IF other men be of my nature and conceite, then surely in reading this short repetall of the destruction of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> they are in double wise perplexed: the first, for that a noble king, after many battels fought with forraine foes: many conflicts with his nobilitie (set againste him by the Pope:) many cursses and excommunications pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him by the Pope himselfe: shoulde nowe at laste bée murdered, by a foule, fatte, false, flattering Monke. And the second, for that the same Diuel incarnate, must to the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the world, and to make a path way to teach the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Prince murthur, be in a manner defied, or at least so zealously delt withal, as if he had bin a worthy Martyre of Christ, and died by the Tiranny of some Prince in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defence of the faith of Christ. But these perplexities and many moe, are, and must be patientlye putte vp, where the preposterous orders of the Pope are in place. But (God be praysed) we are cleare from them, and so I beséech the Lord to continue vs. But when I had déepelye perpended, howe straightly the omnipotent Lord forbiddeth murder, I could but tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arrogancie of the Abbot, that durst absolue the same, &amp; chieflye before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> déede was done, as though he might haue said: In despight of him which forbiddeth mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I wil dispence with murder. Of what sect was this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot think you? certainly he was no <hi>Barnardine.</hi> Wel, bicause thou shalt not staye long, I will tell the of what coate hée was: forsooth a <hi>Caian,</hi> and if thou aske me what a <hi>Caian</hi> is, I must expresse them thus. They are the Heretikes that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>Cayne,</hi> saying, that he was made of the one vertue or power, that is, of the Diuell, and <hi>Abel</hi> of the other. These <hi>Caians</hi> say, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was a good man, and his acte a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to mankinde: for he perceyuing howe much the passion of Christe shoulde preuayle, deliuered him to the Iewes, that by his death man might be redéemed. They affirme, that the olde lawe was noughte, and denye the Generall resurrection: Of whiche religion no doubte this Abbot


<pb facs="tcp:3014:44"/>
Swinesheade (this Abbot of <hi>Swinsted</hi> I should say) was: for had he eyther feared the law of God, or beléeued the Gospel of Christ, he woulde neuer haue consented to the detestable déede of the Monke, nor so grossely haue absolued (or rather committed) suche execrable murder. But being a <hi>Cayan,</hi> and made of the one vertue and power, as <hi>Cayne</hi> was, he myght dispense with Monke <hi>Simon,</hi> as the <hi>Caians</hi> do with <hi>Iudas.</hi> For séeing there might be a benefite to the Monkes by the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> why shoulde not the Abbot (<hi>Iudas</hi>-lyke) deliuer the king his maister into the handes of the Monke to be poysoned, so well as <hi>Iudas</hi> deliuered his maister Christ into the handes of the Iewes to be crucified? The reason is like, and sure they be Saincts alike, and therefore I leaue Saint <hi>Cayn,</hi> S. <hi>Iudas,</hi> S. <hi>Abbot,</hi> and S. <hi>Monke,</hi> to that one vertue or power, wherof the <hi>Caians</hi> affirme their <hi>Cayn</hi> was made: And I commende poore murdered <hi>Abel,</hi> &amp; king <hi>Iohn</hi> poysoned, vnto Christ crucified, in whome and by whome I hope of ioyfull resurrection to eternall life, by the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christ his death and passion, to the which god bring vs all. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

For succéeding, or rather inuading after <hi>Celestinus,</hi> he behaued himself so imperously, that he put down Princes, and excommunicated kings, such as did not take their confirmation at his hande. Diuers of his Cardinals he droue awaye for feare, some of them as Schismatikes he deposed, and spoyled them of all their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce. <hi>Phillip</hi> the Frenche king he excommunicated, for not suffering his money to go out of the Realme, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cursed both his and him, to the fourth generation. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> the Emperour not once or twice, but thrice soughte at his handes to be confirmed, and yet was reiected, neither could obtayn, vnlesse he would promise to driue the French king out of his Realme.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Owe be it sundrie things presentely occurreth, which affrayeth me to shew such maters as are preiudial to the common wealth (yet most noble Prince) when I consider thy humanitie, fayth, &amp; constancie, giuen to nothing more, than defence and welth of thy lieges, I cannot ceasse for the action of common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, to shewe the sooth. For sithens the tyrannie is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, which is exercised by Kings or Princes descending of lineal succession to their kinglie heritage: much more is the tyrannie insufferable, when it is exercised on vs by men of vile and obscure linage. Therfore if the sundry and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest wrongs done to vs these many yéeres by-gon, had come by the Popes mind, they were to be suffred in some maner. But sithens li<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers of vile &amp; obscure linage, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to benefices for their horrible vices, haue not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted our realme without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, but haue spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in their corrupt vices, the money that they gathered in our countrey by the Popes authoritie, for raysing of armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Turks, I think their cursed auarice should haue no further place amongst true people, specially amongst vs, bicause they haue our simplicities and méeknesse in contep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thrée yeares passed ye complained the iniuries done by Cardinal <hi>Guallo,</hi> when he held your realme interdicted, and many of all your Prelates vnder curssing, bicause they woulde not aunswere him money to susteyne his lustes.

Moreouer, after we wer exonerate of <hi>Gual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lo,</hi> came in his place another Legate, of no better life but rather worse: For when he had gotten large money for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of prisoners, and raysing of newe armies againste the Turkes, he spendeth it all in his insolence, and fayned that it was stolne by théeues and briggens. Therefore si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence we haue experience of so many wicked and heauye damagies done to vs, by these two Legates afore rehearsed, we shal be reputed miscreant fooles to admitte the third. For it is not to be beléeued, that this newe Legate shal be of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conditions than his fellowes were before. And if anye man shal demaunde me what is to be done in this matter, I say, neyther this Legate, nor yet any other Legate in time comming, shoulde be receyued within this realme, bycause the same is heriot and wasted of money by their continuall exactions. If any of you haue superfluous money, you maye rather dispose it to poore folke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to such corrupted vse of vicious Legats. Finally, these wordes are so apprysed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counsell, that this Legate was not admitted, to come within the realme of Scotlande.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Alexander</hi> the thirde woulde not receiue the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fourth within his realme, but commaunded to shew his message on the borders. He would not receiue certaine statutes made by him in his voyage, right profitable for the gouernance of the Scots, to whome king <hi>Alexander</hi> aunswered, The Scots would not receiue any statutes but such as were commaunded by the generall counsell. For aye the more precepts sayde he be giuen, the more transgressors be founde. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1271.</p>

Thus in what estimation the Scottes (this long agoe) held the Pope and his Legates, this short Oration sufficiently sheweth. And nowe of Englande.</p>
            <p>IN the .xxix. yeare of the raigne of King <hi>Edwarde</hi> the first, in a certaine declaration made against Pope <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the eyght, by a singular learned man, these words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst other were vttered.
<q>I propounde also (saith he) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said <hi>Boniface</hi> is wrapt in infinite manifest heynous sinnes: his mouth is full of cursing: his féete and steppes are swifte to shedde bloud: he vtterly teareth in péeces the Churches which he ought to cherish, wasting wickedlie the goodes of the poore, and making much of wicked men that giue hym rewards, persecuting the righteous, and among the people, not gathering, but scattering, bringing in new sectes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction that haue not bin heard of, blaspheming the way of truth, and by robberie, thinking himselfe equall to the Lorde Iesus Christe, which is blessed for euer. And beyng most couetous, thirsteth for golde, coueteth golde, and by some deuise, getteth golde of euery people, and vtterly not regarding the worshipping of God, with feyned wordes, sometime by flattering, sometimes by threatning, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by false teaching, and all to get money withall, hée maketh merchandise of vs all, enuying all things but hys owne, louing no man, nourishing warre, persecuting and hating the peace of his Subiectes. He is rooted in all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable sinnes, a contrarie and strife againste all the wayes and doctrines of the Lord. He is truly the abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the people, whiche <hi>Daniell</hi> the Lords Prophete described. Therefore I answere, that lawes, weapons, and all the Elements ought to arise againste him, whiche thus ouerthroweth the state of the Churche, for whose sinnes,

God plagueth the whole worlde. And finallye, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth to him being so vnsatiable, to satisfie him withall, but onely the vnsatiable mouth of Hell, and the fire whiche cannot be quenched, continuing for euer.</q>
