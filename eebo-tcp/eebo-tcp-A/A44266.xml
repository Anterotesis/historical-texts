            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>O Goddess, sing what woe the discontent</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Thetis</hi> Son brought to the <hi>Greeks</hi>; what Souls</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Heroes</hi> down to <hi>Erebus</hi> it sent,</l>
            <l>Leaving their bodies unto Dogs and Fowls;</l>
            <l>Whilst the two Princes of the Army strove,</l>
            <l>King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> stout.</l>
            <l>That so it should be was the will of <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But who was he that made them first fall out?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi>; who incensed by the wrong</l>
            <l>To this Priest <hi>Chryses</hi> by <hi>Atrides</hi> done,</l>
            <l>Sent a great Pestilence the <hi>Greeks</hi> among;</l>
            <l>Apace they di'd, and remedy was none.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Chryses</hi> came unto the <hi>Argive</hi> Fleet,</l>
            <l>With Treasure great his Daughter to redeem;</l>
            <l>And having in his hand the Ensignes meet,</l>
            <l>That did the Priestly Dignity beseem,</l>
            <l>A Golden Scepter and a Crown of Bays,</l>
            <l>Unto the Princes all made his request;</l>
            <l>But to the two <hi>Atrides</hi> chiefly prays,</l>
            <l>Who of the <hi>Argive</hi> Army were the best.</l>
            <l>O Sons of <hi>Atreus</hi> may the Gods grant you</l>
            <l>A safe return from <hi>Troy</hi> with Victory;</l>
            <l>And you on me compassion may shew,</l>
            <l>Receive these Gifts, and set my Daughter free;</l>
            <l>And have respect to <hi>Jove</hi>'s and <hi>Leto</hi>'s Son.</l>
            <l>To this the Princes all gave their consent,</l>
            <l>Except King <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> He alone,</l>
            <l>And with sharp language from the Fleet him sent;</l>
            <l>Old man (said he) let me not see you here</l>
            <l>Now staying, or returning back again,</l>
            <l>For fear the Golden Scepter which you bear</l>
            <l>And Chaplet hanging on it prove but vain.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93808:8"/>Your Daughter shall to <hi>Argos</hi> go far hence,</l>
            <l>And make my Bed, and labour at the Loom,</l>
            <l>And take heed you no farther me incense,</l>
            <l>Lest you return not safely to your home.</l>
            <l>Frighted with this, away the Old man went;</l>
            <l>And often as he walked on the sand,</l>
            <l>His Prayers to <hi>Apollo</hi> up he sent.</l>
            <l>Hear me <hi>Apollo</hi> with thy Bow in hand,</l>
            <l>That honour'd art in <hi>Tenedos</hi> and <hi>Chryse,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And unto whom <hi>Cylla</hi> great honour bears,</l>
            <l>If thou accepted hast my Sacrifice,</l>
            <l>Pay th'<hi>Argives</hi> with thy Arrows for my tears.</l>
            <l>His Prayer was granted by the Deity;</l>
            <l>Who with his Silver Bow and Arrows keen,</l>
            <l>Descended from <hi>Olympus</hi> silently</l>
            <l>In likeness of the sable night unseen.</l>
            <l>His Bow and Quiver both behinde him hang,</l>
            <l>The Arrows chink as often as he jogs,</l>
            <l>And as he shot the Bow was heard to twang,</l>
            <l>And first his Arrows flew at Mules and Dogs.</l>
            <l>But when the Plague into the Army came,</l>
            <l>Perpetual was the fire of Funerals;</l>
            <l>And so nine days continued the same,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> on the tenth for counsel calls;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Juno</hi> 'twas that put it in his head,</l>
            <l>Who for the <hi>Argive</hi> Army was afraid:</l>
            <l>The Lords to Counsel being gathered,</l>
            <l>Up stood <hi>Achilles</hi> and thus to them said,</l>
            <l>We must I think <hi>(Atrides)</hi> run from hence,</l>
            <l>Since War and Plague consume us both at once,</l>
            <l>Let's think on how to stay the Pestilence,</l>
            <l>Or else at <hi>Troy</hi> resolve to leave our bones.</l>
            <l>Let's with some Priest or Prophet here advise</l>
            <l>That knows the pleasure of the Gods above,</l>
            <l>Or some that at expounding Dreams are wise,</l>
            <l>For also Dreams descend on men from <hi>Jove:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That we may from him know <hi>Apollo</hi>'s minde,</l>
            <l>If we for Sacrifice be in arrear,</l>
            <l>Or if he will for Lambs and Goats be kinde,</l>
            <l>And to destroy us from henceforth forbear.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93808:8"/>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then sat down, and <hi>Chalchas</hi> rose,</l>
            <l>That was of great renown for Augury,</l>
            <l>And any thing was able to disclose</l>
            <l>That had been, is, or should hereafter be;</l>
            <l>And guided had the <hi>Greeks</hi> to <hi>Ilium</hi>;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> (said he) since you me command</l>
            <l>To tell you why this Plague is on us come,</l>
            <l>Swear you will save me both with word and hand.</l>
            <l>Of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> it will offend the best;</l>
            <l>Who though his anger for a while he smother,</l>
            <l>Will not, I fear, long time contented rest,</l>
            <l>But will revenged be some time or other.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Chalchas</hi> (reply'd <hi>Achilles</hi>) do not fear,</l>
            <l>But what the God has told you bring to light:</l>
            <l>By <hi>Phoebus</hi> not a man shall hurt you here,</l>
            <l>As long as I enjoy my life and sight;</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Agamemnon</hi> be the man you dread,</l>
            <l>Who is of all the Army most obey'd.</l>
            <l>The Prophet by these words encouraged,</l>
            <l>Said what before to say he was affraid.</l>
            <l>'Tis not neglect of Vow or Sacrifice</l>
            <l>That doth the God <hi>Apollo</hi> thus displease;</l>
            <l>But that we do his Priest so much despise,</l>
            <l>As not his Child for ransome to release.</l>
            <l>And more, till she be to her Father sent,</l>
            <l>And with a <hi>Hecatombe,</hi> and Ransomless,</l>
            <l>The anger of the God will not relent,</l>
            <l>Nor will the Sickness 'mongst the people cease.</l>
            <l>This said, he sat. The King look'd furiously,</l>
            <l>And anger flaming stood upon his eyes,</l>
            <l>While many black thoughts on his heart did lye;</l>
            <l>And to the Prophet <hi>Chalchas</hi> thus replies.</l>
            <l>Unlucky Prophet, that didst never yet</l>
            <l>Good fortune prophecy to me, but ill,</l>
            <l>And ever with a mind against me set</l>
            <l>Inventest Prophecies to cross my Will;</l>
            <l>And now again you fain would have it thought,</l>
            <l>Because I would not let <hi>Chryseis</hi> go,</l>
            <l>The Gifts refusing which her Father brought,</l>

            <l>I elder am, do then as I advise.</l>

            <l>And with them also I did what I cou'd.</l>
            <l>With these no other could contend in fight.</l>
            <l>Yet they from <hi>Pyle</hi> thought fit to call me forth</l>
            <l>Far off; nor ever did my counsel slight.</l>
            <l>Think not therefore my counsel nothing worth.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> take not from him, though you can,</l>

            <l>I nothing can deny of this at all.</l>

            <l>He well can fight; the Gods have granted it,</l>
            <l>But they nere taught him words of infamy.</l>
            <l>Then interrupting him <hi>Achilles</hi> said,</l>
            <l>I were a Wretch and nothing worth indeed,</l>
            <l>If I what ever you command obey'd.</l>
            <l>I will no more to what you say take heed.</l>
            <l>But this I tell you, if you take away</l>
            <l>The Damsel which is mine by your own gift,</l>
            <l>I do not mean for that to make a Fray</l>
            <l>Amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or once my hand to lift.</l>
            <l>Fetch her your self <hi>Atrides,</hi> but take heed</l>
            <l>Against my will you nothing else take there.</l>
            <l>Try; that th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> may see how you speed,</l>
            <l>And how your black blood shall run down my Spear.</l>
            <l>Thus in disorder the Assembly ends.</l>

               <hi>Patroclus</hi> with him and his other friends.</l>

            <l>And then <hi>Atrides</hi> th'Army purify'd,</l>
            <l>And threw into the Sea the Purgament.</l>

               <l>THe Gods, and Princes of the <hi>Argive</hi> Hoast</l>
               <l>Slept all night long. <hi>Jove</hi> only waking lay,</l>
               <l>And many projects in his mind he tost,</l>
               <l>To grace <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> annoy.</l>
               <l>At last a Dream he call'd. False Dream, said he,</l>
               <l>Go, hye to <hi>Agamemnons</hi> Tent, and say,</l>
               <l>Distinctly as you bidden are by me.</l>
               <l>Bid him bring up his Army now to <hi>Troy</hi>;</l>
               <l>For now the time is come he shall it take.</l>
               <l>The Gods no more thereon deliberate,</l>
               <l>But all consented have for <hi>Juno</hi>'s sake,</l>
               <l>No longer to delay the <hi>Trojan</hi> Fate.</l>
               <l>Then with his errand went the Dream away,</l>
               <l>And quickly was at <hi>Agamemnons</hi> Tent.</l>
               <l>And finding him as fast asleep he lay,</l>
               <l>Up presently unto his head he went.</l>
               <l>And in the shape of <hi>Nestor</hi> to him spake.</l>
               <l>Sleep you, said he, <hi>Atrides?</hi> 'Tis not fit</l>
               <l>For him from whom the people counsel take,</l>
               <l>That sleep all night upon his eyes should sit.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Jove</hi> looks to you. Listen then to me.</l>
               <l>For 'tis from <hi>Jove</hi> that I am to you come.</l>
               <l>He bids you lead the Army presently</l>

               <l>And therefore when you wake forget it not.</l>
               <l>This said, the Dream departed. And the King</l>
               <l>Believ'd it as an Oracle, and thought</l>

               <l>Consulted what to do at <hi>Nestors</hi> Tent,</l>
               <l>And said he dream'd that one like <hi>Nestor</hi> spake</l>
               <l>To him and said, <hi>Atrides</hi> 'tis not fit</l>

               <l>This said, King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> sate him down,</l>

               <l>For as the Bees in a fair Summers day</l>

               <l>And light upon the flow'rs that honey yield;</l>
               <l>So to th'Assembly did the People flock,</l>
               <l>And bristling stood with expectation fill'd</l>
               <l>When they sat down, it made the ground to sigh.</l>
               <l>The Lords nine Cryers then amongst them sent</l>

               <l>And from the press their chairs to defend.</l>
               <l>With much ado at last they silent were.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> took into his hand</l>

               <l>What is't <hi>Atrides</hi> (said he) stays you here?</l>
               <l>Your Tent is full of Brass; Women you have</l>
               <l>The best of all that by us taken were,</l>
               <l>For alwaies unto you the choice we gave.</l>
               <l>Or look you for more Gold that yet may come</l>
               <l>For ransome of some prisoner whom I</l>
               <l>Or other <hi>Greek</hi> shall take at <hi>Ilium,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or for some young maid to keep privately?</l>
               <l>But Kings ought not their private ease to buy</l>
               <l>With publick danger and a common woe.</l>
               <l>Come women of <hi>Achaia,</hi> let us fly,</l>
               <l>And let him spend his gettings on the Foe.</l>
               <l>For then how much we help him he will know,</l>
               <l>That has a better than himself disgrac'd.</l>
               <l>But that <hi>Achilles</hi> is to anger slow,</l>
               <l>That injury of his had been his last.</l>
               <l>This said, <hi>Ulysses</hi> straightway to him went,</l>
               <l>And with sour look, and bitter language said,</l>
               <l>Prater, that to thy self seems eloquent,</l>
               <l>How darest thou alone the King t'upbraid?</l>
               <l>A greater Coward than thou art there's none</l>
               <l>'Mongst all the <hi>Greeks</hi> that came with us to <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Else 'gainst the King thy tongue would not so run.</l>
               <l>Thou seek'st but an excuse to run away.</l>
               <l>Because we know not how we shall come off</l>
               <l>As yet from <hi>Troy,</hi> must you the King upbraid,</l>
               <l>And at the Princes of the Army scoff,</l>
               <l>As if they too much honour to him paid?</l>
               <l>But I will tell you one thing, and will do't.</l>
               <l>If here again I find you fooling thus,</l>
               <l>Then from my Shoulders let my Head be cut,</l>
               <l>Or let me loose my Son <hi>Telemachus,</hi>

               <l>With many stripes and ugly to be seen.</l>
               <l>This said, he basted him both back and hips.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thersites</hi> shrug'd, and wept, sat down, and had</l>
               <l>His shoulders black and blew, dy'd by the staff.</l>
               <l>Look'd scurvily. The people that were sad</l>
               <l>But just before, now could not chuse but laugh.</l>
               <l>And, Oh said one t'another standing near;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> many handsome thing has done,</l>
               <l>When we in Councel or in Battle were,</l>
               <l>A better deed than this is he did none,</l>
               <l>That has so silenced this railing knave,</l>
               <l>And of his peevish humour stay'd the flood,</l>
               <l>As he no more will dare the King to brave.</l>
               <l>And then to speak <hi>Ulysses</hi> ready stood.</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Pallas</hi> like a Crier did appear,</l>
               <l>And standing by him silence did command,</l>
               <l>That also they that sat far off might hear.</l>
               <l>Then spake he, with the Scepter in his hand.</l>
               <l>The people, O <hi>Atrides,</hi> go about</l>
               <l>To put you on an act will be your shame,</l>
               <l>Forgetting what they promis'd setting out,</l>
               <l>Not to return till <hi>Troy</hi> they overcame.</l>
               <l>But now like Widow-women they complain,</l>
               <l>Or little Children longing to go home.</l>
               <l>To be from home a month, it is a pain</l>
               <l>To them that to their loving Wives would come.</l>
               <l>To Sea they'ld go though certain to be tost</l>
               <l>By many a sturdy wind upon the same.</l>
               <l>But they have now lyen here Nine Years almost;</l>
               <l>I cannot therefore say they are to blame.</l>
               <l>But certainly after so long a stay</l>
               <l>'Tis very shameful empty back to go.</l>
               <l>Let us at least abide till know we may</l>
               <l>Whether what <hi>Chalchas</hi> said be true or no.</l>
               <l>For this we all know and are witnesses</l>
               <l>(Excepting only those that since are dead)</l>
               <l>When we from <hi>Aulis</hi> went to pass the Seas,</l>
               <l>And by contrary winds were hindered,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93808:18"/>That there we to the Gods did sacrifice</l>
               <l>Upon an Altar close unto a Spring,</l>
               <l>That of a <hi>Plane</hi>-tree at the root did rise;</l>
               <l>And how we saw there a prodigious thing.</l>
               <l>A mighty Serpent with a back blood-red</l>
               <l>From out the Spring glided up to the Tree,</l>
               <l>The boughs whereof were ev'ry way far spread.</l>
               <l>On th'utmost chanc'd a Sparrows nest to be.</l>
               <l>Young ones were in it eight, with th'old one nine;</l>
               <l>The old one near the Nest stay'd fluttering,</l>
               <l>And grievously the while did cry and whine.</l>
               <l>At last the Serpent catcht her by the wing.</l>
               <l>And when the Serpent had devour'd all nine,</l>
               <l>He presently was turn'd into a stone;</l>
               <l>That we might see from <hi>Jove</hi> it was a Signe</l>
               <l>Of what should afterward at <hi>Troy</hi> be done.</l>
               <l>We were amaz'd so strange a thing to see,</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Chalchas</hi> rose and did the same explain.</l>
               <l>This is a certain Sign from <hi>Jove,</hi> said he,</l>
               <l>That he intends to do the like again.</l>
               <l>For as the Snake devour'd nine birds in all;</l>
               <l>So nine years long we shall make war at <hi>Troy,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And after nine years <hi>Ilium</hi> shall fall.</l>
               <l>But in the tenth year we shall come away.</l>
               <l>This then said <hi>Chalchas</hi>; and all hitherto</l>
               <l>Is come to pass. Therefore <hi>Achaeans</hi> stay,</l>
               <l>Since nothing here remaineth now to do,</l>
               <l>But overcoming the old Town of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This said, the people made a mighty noise</l>
               <l>(Which bounding from the Ships was twice as great)</l>
               <l>Sounding of nothing but <hi>Ulysses</hi> praise.</l>
               <l>And up then rose old <hi>Nestor</hi> from his Seat.</l>
               <l>Fie, Fie, (said he) why sit we talking here?</l>
               <l>VVhere are your Promises, and whither gone</l>

               <l>Hold fast, <hi>Atrides,</hi> as you did before</l>
               <l>The power you have; and lead us up to <hi>Troy.</hi>

               <l>Before to <hi>Argos</hi> our retreat we make,</l>
               <l>And know if <hi>Jove</hi> have spoken true or no.</l>

               <l>A sign of granting is for what we pray.</l>
               <l>Let none of you long therefore to be gone,</l>
               <l>Till of some <hi>Trojans</hi> wife he hath his will,</l>

               <l>Down into <hi>Erebus</hi> before the rest.</l>
               <l>But you, O King, think well, and take advice</l>
               <l>First into Tribes the Army to divide,</l>
               <l>And Tribes again into Fraternities,</l>
               <l>That Tribe may Tribe, and Fellow Fellow aid.</l>
               <l>The Leaders and the Souldiers then you'll know</l>
               <l>Which of them merits praise, and which is naught.</l>
               <l>And if the Town you do not overthrow,</l>
               <l>VVhether on us or <hi>Jove</hi> to lay the fault.</l>
               <l>To this <hi>Atrides</hi> answer made and said,</l>
               <l>O <hi>Nestor,</hi> Father, you exceed all men</l>
               <l>In giving Counsel. VVould the Gods me aid</l>
               <l>VVith Counsellors such as you are but ten,</l>
               <l>The Town of <hi>Priam</hi> we should quickly win.</l>
               <l>Nor had we now so long about it staid,</l>
               <l>If <hi>Jupiter</hi> had not engag'd me in</l>
               <l>A quarrel with <hi>Achilles</hi> for a Maid.</l>
               <l>But if we come but once more to agree,</l>
               <l>The evil day from <hi>Troy</hi> will not be far.</l>
               <l>Now take your food that we may ready be,</l>
               <l>And able to endure the toil of war.</l>
               <l>Let ev'ry man now sharpen well his Spear,</l>
               <l>His Buckler mend, and give his Horses meat,</l>
               <l>And look well to his Chariot every where,</l>
               <l>That we may fight all day without retreat.</l>
               <l>

               <l>This said, the People pleas'd with what was spoken,</l>
               <l>Approv'd the same with Shouts, as loud as when</l>
               <l>Betwixt great waves and rocks the Sea is broken.</l>
               <l>Then from the Assembly they return agen.</l>
               <l>And at their Ships they sacrifice and pray</l>

               <l>To <hi>Jove,</hi> of five years old, and to the Feast</l>
               <l>Call'd such as in the Army Princes were,</l>

            <l>WHen both the Armies were prepar'd for fight,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> marched on with noise and cry.</l>
            <l>As in the air of cackling fowl a flight,</l>
            <l>Or like the Cranes when from the North they fly,</l>
            <l>The Army of <hi>Pygmaean</hi> men to charge,</l>
            <l>And shun the Winter, with a mighty cry</l>
            <l>Fly through the Air over the Ocean large;</l>
            <l>So swiftly march'd the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but silently</l>
            <l>Resolved one another to assist.</l>
            <l>And such a dust between both Hoasts did rise,</l>
            <l>As when upon the Mountains lies a Mist,</l>
            <l>Which to a stones cast limiteth the eyes.</l>
            <l>(Which good for Thieves is, but for Shepherds not)</l>
            <l>So great a dust the middle space possest.</l>
            <l>When they were near to one another got,</l>
            <l>Came <hi>Alexander</hi> forth before the rest.</l>
            <l>A Leopards skin he wore upon his Shoulders,</l>
            <l>Two Spears in hand, his Sword girt at his side,</l>
            <l>Bow at his back, and brave to the beholders;</l>
            <l>And any of th'<hi>Achean</hi> hoast defi'd.</l>
            <l>And glad was <hi>Menelaus</hi> to see this.</l>
            <l>As when a Lion finds a lusty prey,</l>
            <l>A wild Goat or a Stag, well pleased is,</l>
            <l>And hungry seizes him without delay,</l>
            <l>Although by Hunters and by Hounds pursu'd;</l>
            <l>So glad was <hi>Menelaus</hi> him to see.</l>
            <l>And soon as he his person had well view'd,</l>
            <l>Arm'd from his Charret to the ground leapt he.</l>
            <l>Assured (as he thought) revenge to take</l>
            <l>But soon as <hi>Alexander</hi> once saw that,</l>
            <l>He fled into the throng, as from a Snake</l>

            <l>I would to God thou born hadst never been,</l>
            <l>Or never hadst been married. For that</l>
            <l>A great deal better had been of the twain,</l>
            <l>Than to be scorn'd of men, and pointed at</l>
            <l>For one that durst not his own word maintain.</l>
            <l>O how the <hi>Greeks</hi> are laughing now to see</l>
            <l>That so absurdly they themselves mistook,</l>
            <l>Supposing you some mighty man to be</l>
            <l>That are worth nothing, judging by your look.</l>
            <l>Was't you to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> pass'd the deep,</l>
            <l>And fetch'd fair <hi>Helen</hi> thence (the bane of <hi>Troy</hi>)</l>
            <l>And now when it concerns you her to keep,</l>
            <l>You dare not in her husbands presence stay?</l>
            <l>For you would quickly know what kind of man</l>
            <l>You have bereav'd unjustly of his wife.</l>
            <l>Neither your Cittern, nor your Beauty can,</l>

            <l>You had a Coat of stones by this time had,</l>
            <l>A fit reward for all your evil deeds.</l>
            <l>This answer then to <hi>Hector, Paris</hi> made.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> since your reproof is just (said he)</l>

            <l>Like riggid Steel has cut me to the heart.</l>

            <l>But make the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> both to sit.</l>
            <l>And in the midst set me and <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And which of us shall have the Victory,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Helen</hi> be his, and all the Wealth she has,</l>
            <l>And 'twixt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> Amity.</l>
            <l>Let this be sworn to, that we may remain</l>
            <l>At <hi>Troy</hi> in quiet, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> repass</l>
            <l>To <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Achaea</hi> back again.</l>
            <l>At this brave proffer <hi>Hector</hi> joyful was;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93808:26"/>And stepping forth the <hi>Trojan</hi> Ranks kept in</l>
            <l>With both his hands o'th' middle of his Spear.</l>
            <l>And to shoot at him then the <hi>Greeks</hi> begin,</l>
            <l>And many took up stones and hurling were.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Agamemnon</hi> with a voice as high</l>
            <l>As he could raise it, to the <hi>Greeks</hi> cry'd, Hold.</l>
            <l>Throw no more Stones, let no more Arrows fly.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector</hi> to us has somewhat to unfold.</l>
            <l>This said, they held their hands, and silent were</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> both to <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> spake.</l>
            <l>May you be pleased on both sides to hear</l>
            <l>The motion I from <hi>Alexander</hi> make.</l>
            <l>Let Arms (said he) on both sides be laid by,</l>
            <l>And in the midst set him and <hi>Menelaus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And which of them shall have the Victory,</l>
            <l>Be <hi>Helen</hi> his, with all the wealth she has.</l>
            <l>And let the rest an Oath on b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <l>The Pacts agreed on not to violate.</l>
            <l>When this was said, then <hi>Menelaus</hi> spake.</l>
            <l>And both the Armies with great silence sate.</l>
            <l>Hear me too then, said <hi>Menelaus,</hi> who</l>
            <l>By <hi>Alexander</hi> have been most offended.</l>
            <l>If you'll do that which I advise you to,</l>
            <l>The quarrel he began will soon be ended.</l>
            <l>Which of us two shall fall in single fight,</l>
            <l>Let him dye only, and the rest agree.</l>
            <l>Bring forth two Lambs, one black, another white,</l>
            <l>To th'Earth and Sun a Sacrifice to be.</l>
            <l>Another we will sacrifice to <hi>Jove.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And let the old King <hi>Priam</hi> present be,</l>
            <l>(His proud Sons think themselves all Oaths above)</l>
            <l>That what is sworn he may performed see.</l>
            <l>No hold is to be taken of an Oath</l>
            <l>Which Young-men make, whose likings change like wind.</l>
            <l>But Old-men can foresee what's good for both.</l>
            <l>'Tis good for both that makes a Contract bind.</l>
            <l>These words did to both Armies sweetly sound;</l>
            <l>They thought the worst was past; and up they ty'd</l>
            <l>Their Horses; and their Spears stuck in the ground,</l>
            <l>With spaces left between them, but not wide.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93808:27"/>Then <hi>Hector</hi> to the King two Heralds sent,</l>
            <l>To fetch the Lambs, and <hi>Priam</hi> to implore</l>
            <l>To take the Oath. From <hi>Agamemnon</hi> went</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Talthybius</hi> to the Fleet to fetch two more.</l>
            <l>Mean while to the fair <hi>Helen Iris</hi> came,</l>
            <l>So like t'<hi>Antenor</hi>'s wife <hi>Laodice,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>King <hi>Priam</hi>'s daughter, that she seem'd the same.</l>
            <l>Quickly she found her; for at work was she</l>
            <l>Upon a double splendid Web, wherein</l>
            <l>Many a cruel Battle she had wrought</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> and th' incensed <hi>Greeks</hi> between,</l>
            <l>That for her own sake only had been sought.</l>
            <l>Come Nymph, said <hi>Iris,</hi> see one Battle more</l>
            <l>Between the gallant men of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They fight not altogether as before,</l>
            <l>But silent sit, and from their Arms away.</l>
            <l>Shields are their Cushions, planted are their Spears;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Menelaus</hi> only fight.</l>
            <l>Save these two no man any Armour wears;</l>
            <l>And you his Wife are, that has greatest might.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Iris</hi> said, and her inspir'd anew</l>
            <l>With love to <hi>Menelaus</hi> as before.</l>
            <l>Then ore her Head a milk-white Scarf she threw,</l>
            <l>And out went weeping at the Chamber-door,</l>
            <l>But not alone; two Maidens follow'd her,</l>
            <l>Fair <hi>Aethre Pittheus</hi> child, and <hi>Clymene.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And quickly at the <hi>Scaean</hi> Gate they were,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Priam</hi> sate; and in his company</l>
            <l>Were the old Lords <hi>Lampus</hi> and <hi>Clytius,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Icetaon,</hi> and <hi>Ucalegon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antenor, Thymet's,</hi> and <hi>Panthous,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whence both the Armies they might look upon.</l>
            <l>Old men they were, but had brave Captains been,</l>
            <l>And now for consultation prised were.</l>
            <l>Assoon as <hi>Helen</hi> came into their sight,</l>
            <l>They whisper'd one another in the ear,</l>
            <l>I cannot blame the man that for her strives.</l>
            <l>Like an Immortal God she is. Yet so,</l>
            <l>Rather than we should hazard all our lives,</l>
            <l>I should advise the King to let her go.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93808:27"/>Thus said they one t'another. But the King</l>
            <l>Call'd her and said, Daughter, sit down by me,</l>
            <l>(Not you, but the Immortal Powers bring</l>
            <l>Upon the <hi>Trojans</hi> this calamity.)</l>
            <l>And tell me who that great <hi>Achaean</hi> is.</l>
            <l>I see some higher by the head than he,</l>
            <l>But comelier man I never saw than this,</l>
            <l>Nor liker to a King in Majestie.</l>
            <l>O King (then answered <hi>Helen</hi>) to whom I</l>
            <l>Of all men owe most reverence and fear,</l>
            <l>Would I had rather chosen there to dye,</l>
            <l>Than to your Sons ill counsel given ear,</l>
            <l>Leaving my House, my Child, and Brothers two,</l>
            <l>And all my sweet companions for his sake.</l>
            <l>But since I cannot what is done undo,</l>
            <l>Unto your question I'll now answer make.</l>
            <l>The man you point to <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is,</l>
            <l>A good King, and a valiant Man in fight,</l>
            <l>And Brother to the Husband is of this</l>
            <l>Unworthy woman me that did him slight.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Priam</hi> then the man admiring said,</l>
            <l>Happy <hi>Atrides,</hi> great is thy command,</l>
            <l>Whose Soldiers though now very much decay'd,</l>
            <l>In such great multitude before us stand.</l>
            <l>At a great fight I was in <hi>Phrygia,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And brought to <hi>Otreus</hi> and <hi>Mygdon</hi> aid</l>
            <l>Against the <hi>Amazons.</hi> I never saw</l>
            <l>Till then, so many for a Fight array'd,</l>
            <l>As were the <hi>Amazons,</hi> upon the Banks</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Sangareus,</hi> and yet they fewer were,</l>
            <l>Than are contained in the brissled Ranks</l>
            <l>Of th'armed <hi>Greeks</hi> that stand before us here.</l>
            <l>Again <hi>Ulysses</hi> coming in his sight,</l>
            <l>Tell me (said he) sweet Daughter, Who is this</l>
            <l>He wants the head of <hi>Agamemnons</hi> height,</l>
            <l>But at the Breast and Shoulders broader is.</l>
            <l>His Arms lye still upon the ground; but he</l>
            <l>In no one certain place himself can keep,</l>
            <l>But through the Ranks and Files runs busily,</l>
            <l>Just as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> runs in a Fold of Sheep.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:93808:28"/>To this <hi>Jove</hi>'s Daughter <hi>Helen</hi> thus replies.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> 'tis, the old <hi>Laertes</hi> Son</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Ithaca</hi>; to counsel and devise,</l>
            <l>In all the Army like him there is none.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Helen</hi> (said <hi>Antenor</hi>) you say right;</l>
            <l>On your affair he once came into <hi>Troy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With <hi>Menelaus.</hi> I did them both invite</l>
            <l>To sup with me; and in my house they lay.</l>
            <l>I them compar'd. When at their Audience</l>
            <l>They both stood up, <hi>Atrides</hi> taller seem'd;</l>
            <l>Sitting <hi>Ulysses</hi> won most reverence,</l>
            <l>And was amongst the people most esteem'd.</l>
            <l>And when they were Orations to make,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> words went easily and close.</l>
            <l>For little he, but to the purpose spake,</l>
            <l>Though th'younger man. But when <hi>Ulysses</hi> rose,</l>
            <l>Upon the ground a while he fix'd his eyes,</l>
            <l>Nor ever mov'd the Scepter in his hand;</l>
            <l>You would have thought him sullen or unwise,</l>
            <l>That did not yet his bus'ness understand.</l>
            <l>But when his voice was raised to the height,</l>
            <l>And like a Snow upon a Winters day</l>
            <l>His gentle words fell from him, no man might</l>
            <l>With him compare; so much his words did weigh.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Priam</hi> seeing <hi>Ajax,</hi> askt agen,</l>
            <l>What <hi>Greek</hi> is that, that taller by the Head</l>
            <l>And Shoulders is than all the other men?</l>
            <l>And <hi>Helen</hi> to the King thus answered,</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Ajax.</hi> Who of th'<hi>Argives</hi> is the Sconce,</l>
            <l>And he o'th'other side <hi>Idomeneus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who was the guest of <hi>Menelaus</hi> once,</l>
            <l>And lodg'd at <hi>Lacedemon</hi> in his house.</l>
            <l>And now I see the rest, and could them name.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Castor</hi> I and <hi>Pollux</hi> cannot see.</l>
            <l>Two Princes are they, and well known by Fame,</l>
            <l>And by one Mother Brothers are to me.</l>
            <l>Did they not pass the Sea? Yes sure they did</l>
            <l>Come with the rest; but are asham'd of me.</l>
            <l>And in the <hi>Argive</hi> Fleet lye somewhere hid,</l>
            <l>And will not of my shame partakers be.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93808:28"/>Thus <hi>Helen</hi> said, because she could not tell</l>
            <l>Whether her Brothers were alive or dead.</l>
            <l>But dead they were; and (where they both did dwell)</l>
            <l>In <hi>Lacedemon</hi> they were buried.</l>
            <l>The Heralds now the two Lambs had brought in,</l>
            <l>That for their Sacrifice appointed were,</l>
            <l>And full of noble Wine a great Goats skin.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idaeus</hi> with the Golden Cups stood near,</l>
            <l>And pray'd the King to go down to the Plain.</l>
            <l>There stay for you the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> both;</l>
            <l>A Peace agreed on is; but all in vain</l>
            <l>Unless you also go and take the Oath.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Paris</hi> must with <hi>Menelaus</hi> fight,</l>
            <l>And he must <hi>Helen</hi> and her wealth enjoy</l>
            <l>Upon whose side the Victory shall light;</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> return; and Peace remain at <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>These words to th'Old mans heart came cold as Ice.</l>
            <l>But streight he bad his Coach made ready be.</l>
            <l>The Servants made it ready in a trice,</l>
            <l>And up into 't <hi>Antenor</hi> went and he;</l>
            <l>And past the <hi>Scaean</hi> Gate into the Plain.</l>
            <l>And when they came near to <hi>Scamander</hi> Banks,</l>
            <l>From out the Coach alighted they again,</l>
            <l>And stood between the adverse Armies Ranks.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> came,</l>
            <l>And to the Contract for the <hi>Greeks</hi> did swear.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Priam</hi> and <hi>Antenor</hi> swore the same.</l>
            <l>The Heralds mix the Wine with Water clear;</l>
            <l>And poured water on the Princes hands.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> at his Sword a Knife did wear,</l>
            <l>And as he near unto the Victims stands,</l>
            <l>Cuts with it from their foreheads locks of Hair,</l>
            <l>Which by the Heralds were distributed,</l>
            <l>Till ev'ry Leader part had of the hair.</l>
            <l>The Ceremonies being finished,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> to the gods then made this Prayer.</l>
            <l>O mighty <hi>Jove,</hi> the Monarch of the Gods,</l>
            <l>O glorious Sun with thy all-seeing Eye,</l>
            <l>O Streams, O Earth, O you that hold the Rods</l>
            <l>Beneath the Earth, scourges of Perjury,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:93808:29"/>Hear me, and be you witnesses of this.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Menelaus</hi> be by <hi>Paris</hi> slain,</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Helen</hi> and the wealth she has be his,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Achaea</hi> we return again.</l>
            <l>If slain by <hi>Menelaus Paris</hi> be,</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Helen</hi> with her wealth to <hi>Greece</hi> be sent</l>
            <l>With some amends made for the injury,</l>
            <l>To be of th' wrong done an acknowledgment.</l>
            <l>If such amends the <hi>Trojans</hi> will not make,</l>
            <l>I will pursue the War, and here abide,</l>
            <l>Till I the Town of <hi>Ilium</hi> shall take,</l>
            <l>Or till the Gods the quarrel shall decide.</l>
            <l>This said, the Victims with his Knife he slew.</l>
            <l>And sprawling there upon the place they lay.</l>
            <l>Then into Golden Cups the Wine they drew,</l>
            <l>And pour'd it on the Lambs. Then prayed they</l>
            <l>Both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans; Jove,</hi> and Pow'rs divine,</l>
            <l>Who first to break this peace shall go about,</l>
            <l>As poured on the Victims is this Wine,</l>
            <l>So they, and their Sons Brains be poured out.</l>
            <l>Thus prayed they. But <hi>Jove</hi> that Pray'r did slight.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Priam</hi> said, To <hi>Troy</hi> return will I.</l>
            <l>It cannot please me to behold the Fight.</l>
            <l>For none but Gods know which of them shall dye.</l>
            <l>And then into the Charret went again</l>
            <l>He and <hi>Antenor,</hi> and drave t'<hi>Ilium,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And with them carried their Victims slain.</l>
            <l>Then in <hi>Ulysses</hi> and great <hi>Hector</hi> come,</l>
            <l>And having measur'd out the Lists, wherein</l>
            <l>They were to fight, then the two Lots they drew</l>
            <l>For who to throw his Spear should first begin.</l>
            <l>And then the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> pray'd anew.</l>
            <l>O glorious <hi>Jove,</hi> whom all the Gods obey,</l>
            <l>Let him that of the War the Author was</l>
            <l>Be slain, and all the rest firm peace enjoy.</l>
            <l>Then mighty <hi>Hector</hi> shook the skull of brass.</l>
            <l>The Lot that was the first drawn out, was that</l>
            <l>Which gave to <hi>Paris</hi> the right to begin.</l>
            <l>Then down upon the ground the people sate</l>
            <l>In order as their Armours plac'd had been.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:93808:29"/>And <hi>Paris</hi> arm'd himself, and first puts on</l>
            <l>His Leg-pieces of Brass, and closely tyes,</l>
            <l>That silver'd over were at th' Ancle-bone.</l>
            <l>And then his Breast-plate to his Breast applyes.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lycaons</hi> Breast-plate 'twas, but ev'ry whit</l>
            <l>As just upon him sat, as it had done</l>
            <l>Upon <hi>Lycaon</hi> when he used it.</l>
            <l>And next to this his good Sword he puts on.</l>
            <l>And then his broad Shield and his Helmet good.</l>
            <l>And last of all a Spear takes in his hand.</l>
            <l>And in like Armour <hi>Menelaus</hi> stood.</l>
            <l>Then come they forth, and in the Lists they stand.</l>
            <l>And one did on another fiercely look.</l>
            <l>(The people stupid sat 'twixt hope and fear.)</l>
            <l>And when they come were nigh, their Spears they shook.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Paris</hi> was the first to throw his Spear,</l>
            <l>And threw, and smote the Shield of <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But through the Mettle tough it passed not,</l>
            <l>But turn'd, and bended at the point it was.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Menelaus</hi> was to throw by Lot.</l>
            <l>But first he prayed. Grant me, O <hi>Jove,</hi> (said he)</l>
            <l>That this my Spear may <hi>Alexander</hi> slay,</l>
            <l>Who was the first that did the injury.</l>
            <l>That they who shall be born hereafter may</l>
            <l>Not dare to violate the Sacred Laws</l>
            <l>Of Hospitality. Having thus said,</l>
            <l>He threw his Spear, which <hi>Paris</hi> Shield did pass,</l>
            <l>And through his Breast-plate quite, and there it staid;</l>
            <l>But tore his Coat. And there he had been dead,</l>
            <l>But that his Belly somewhat he drew back.</l>
            <l>Then with his Sword <hi>Atrides</hi> smote his head</l>
            <l>Which arm'd was, and the Sword in pieces broke.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Menelaus</hi> grieved at the heart,</l>
            <l>Looking to Heaven did on <hi>Jove</hi> complain.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Jove</hi> that of the Gods most cruel art,</l>
            <l>Broken my Sword, my Spear is thrown in vain.</l>
            <l>Then suddenly laid hold on <hi>Paris</hi> Crest,</l>
            <l>And to the <hi>Greeks</hi> to drag him did begin,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Paris</hi> then was mightily distrest,</l>
            <l>Choakt by the Latchet underneath his Chin.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:93808:30"/>And to the <hi>Greeks</hi> had drag'd been by the Head,</l>
            <l>If <hi>Venus</hi> to his aid had not come in,</l>
            <l>Who broke the string and him delivered.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> conquest else had famous been.</l>
            <l>Then to the <hi>Greeks</hi> the empty Cask he threw.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Venus</hi> snatcht him from him in a Mist.</l>
            <l>And whither she convey'd him none there knew.</l>
            <l>A God she is, and can do what she list.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Paris</hi> to his Chamber was convey'd,</l>
            <l>His Chamber which of Perfumes sweetly smelt,</l>
            <l>Then puts she on the form of an old Maid</l>
            <l>That <hi>Helen</hi> serv'd when she at <hi>Sparta</hi> dwelt.</l>
            <l>And in that shape went to call <hi>Helen</hi> home,</l>
            <l>That stood with other Ladies of the Town</l>
            <l>Upon a Tow'r. When she was to her come,</l>
            <l>She gently with her finger stir'd her Gown.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Helen</hi> (said she) <hi>Paris</hi> has for you sent,</l>
            <l>And on his glorious bed doth for you stay,</l>
            <l>Not as a man that came from Fight, but went</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Helen</hi> at this was mov'd, and mark'd her Eyes,</l>
            <l>And of her lovely Neck did notice take,</l>
            <l>And knew 'twas <hi>Venus</hi> though in this disguise;</l>
            <l>And troubled as she was, thus to her spake.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Venus,</hi> why seek you to deceive me still,</l>
            <l>Since <hi>Menelaus</hi> has the Victory?</l>
            <l>Though I have wrong'd him, he receive me will,</l>
            <l>And you come hither now to hinder me.</l>
            <l>Whither d'ye mean to send me further yet?</l>
            <l>To <hi>Phrygia</hi> or to <hi>Moeonia,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That there I may another Husband get?</l>
            <l>You shall not me to <hi>Alexander</hi> draw.</l>
            <l>Go to him you, and Heaven for ever quit;</l>
            <l>Grieve with him; have a care the man to save,</l>
            <l>And by his side continually to sit,</l>
            <l>Till he his Bride have made you, or his Slave.</l>
            <l>I will not to him go (for 'twere a shame)</l>
            <l>Nor any longer meddle with his Bed,</l>
            <l>Nor longer bear the scorns, nor mocks, nor blame</l>
            <l>Which from the wives of <hi>Troy</hi> I suffered.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:93808:30"/>Then <hi>Venus</hi> vext, Hussie (said she) no more</l>
            <l>Provoke my anger. If I angry be,</l>

            <l>The Armies both will to your death agree.</l>
            <l>This said, the beauteous <hi>Helen</hi> frighted was,</l>
            <l>And with the Goddess went, who led the way,</l>
            <l>And by the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wives did quiet pass</l>
            <l>Unto the house where <hi>Alexander</hi> lay.</l>
            <l>I'th' Roomes below at work her women were.</l>

            <l>The Goddess unto <hi>Helen</hi> fetcht a Chair.</l>
            <l>Then sat she down, and look'd at him again.</l>
            <l>You come from Battle. I would you had there,</l>
            <l>And by my former Husbands hand, been slain.</l>

            <l>But rather when you see him, him eschew,</l>

            <l>Forbear; though he have now the Victory</l>
            <l>By <hi>Pallas</hi> help; there are Gods on our side,</l>
            <l>And they another time may favour me.</l>
            <l>Let's go to Bed, and in sweet Love agree.</l>
            <l>Your Beauty never did me so much move,</l>

            <l>They would not have conceal'd him though they might;</l>
            <l>But had to <hi>Menelaus</hi> him betray'd.</l>
            <l>So hateful to the <hi>Trojans</hi> was his sight.</l>
            <l>Then stood King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> up and said,</l>
            <l>Hear me you <hi>Trojans</hi> and your Aids. 'Tis plain</l>
            <l>That <hi>Menelaus</hi> has the Victory.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Helen</hi> therefore rendred be again,</l>
            <l>And pay your Fine. 'Tis Right, the <hi>Greeks</hi> all cry.</l>

            <l>MEan while the Gods at Counsel drinking sat.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hebe</hi> the <hi>Nectar</hi> carry'd up and down.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> amongst them present was thereat,</l>
            <l>And sitting had his eyes upon <hi>Troy</hi> Town.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Jupiter</hi> puts out a word, to see</l>
            <l>What <hi>Juno</hi> would unto the same reply.</l>
            <l>Two Goddesses assistants are (said he)</l>
            <l>To <hi>Menelaus,</hi> but sit idly by,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi>; but on th'other side</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Venus</hi> gives <hi>Paris</hi> aid, and really</l>
            <l>Has helpt him when he thought he should have dy'd.</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Menelaus</hi> have the Victory.</l>
            <l>But let us now think which the best will be,</l>
            <l>To suffer war to make an end of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or let <hi>Troy</hi> stand and make them to agree,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Helen</hi> with <hi>Atrides</hi> go her way.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> that together sat,</l>
            <l>Grumble and plot; <hi>Pallas</hi> her spite kept in.</l>
            <l>But such of <hi>Juno</hi> was the choler, that</l>
            <l>Had she not spoke, her heart had broken been.</l>
            <l>Harsh <hi>Jove</hi> (said she) what do you mean by this?</l>
            <l>Shall I with so much sweat, and labour spent,</l>
            <l>And Horses tyr'd, now of my purpose miss?</l>
            <l>Do. But the other Gods will not consent.</l>
            <l>Devil, said <hi>Jove,</hi> what hurt is done to you</l>
            <l>By <hi>Priam</hi> and his Sons, that you should so</l>
            <l>Fiercely the ruine of the Town pursue?</l>
            <l>I think if you int' <hi>Ilium</hi> should go,</l>
            <l>And eat up <hi>Priam</hi> and his Children all,</l>
            <l>And every <hi>Trojan</hi> in the Town beside,</l>
            <l>Man, Woman, Child alive within the wall,</l>
            <l>Your anger will at last be satisfi'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93808:31"/>Do as you please. It shall breed no contention</l>
            <l>'Twixt you and me. But then remember this,</l>
            <l>When I to raze a City have intention</l>
            <l>That yours, and greatly in your favour is,</l>
            <l>To let me do't without Plea or Request;</l>
            <l>Since to give you your will I loose my own.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Ilium</hi> I love above the rest,</l>
            <l>Though under Heav'n be many a goodly Town.</l>
            <l>For I by <hi>Priam</hi> and his people still</l>
            <l>Have honour'd been, my Altars richly serv'd</l>
            <l>With Wine and Sacrifices to my will,</l>
            <l>Which is the honour to the Gods reserv'd.</l>
            <l>To this the Goddess <hi>Juno</hi> then reply'd,</l>
            <l>Three Cities I prefer before the rest,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Mycena</hi> wide.</l>
            <l>Destroy you may which of them you think best,</l>
            <l>If you see cause; I'll not stand in your way.</l>
            <l>Or if I do, what mends can I have so?</l>
            <l>For since your Pow'r does mine so much outweigh,</l>
            <l>It will be done whether I will or no.</l>
            <l>But you ought not t'undo what I have done.</l>
            <l>For I a Goddess am, and have the same</l>
            <l>Parents, of whom you boast to be the Son.</l>
            <l>And further of your Wife I bear the name,</l>
            <l>Whom Mortals and Immortals all obey.</l>
            <l>Then let us not in such things disagree.</l>
            <l>But I to you, and you to me give way.</l>
            <l>For of our two minds all the Gods will be.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Pallas</hi> to the Army streight be sent</l>
            <l>To make the <hi>Trojans</hi> first the Peace to break.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jupiter</hi> to do so was content,</l>
            <l>And did (as he was bid) to <hi>Pallas</hi> speak.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pallas,</hi> said he, down to the Armies go,</l>
            <l>Let not this Peace be by the <hi>Trojans</hi> kept.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Pallas</hi> heard her Father <hi>Jove</hi> say so,</l>
            <l>Glad of the Errand, from the Sky she leapt.</l>
            <l>Just like a falling Star, which <hi>Saturn</hi> sends</l>
            <l>To Armies or unto Seafaring men;</l>
            <l>Which change of Fortune, commonly portends.</l>
            <l>The Goddess through the Air descending then,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93808:32"/>Splendid and sparkling on the ground did light.</l>
            <l>The Armies that were in the field array'd,</l>
            <l>Both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> wondred at the sight;</l>
            <l>And one unto another next him said,</l>
            <l>This bloody War will sure return again,</l>
            <l>Or else the Peace be surer made than 'tis.</l>
            <l>But which o'th' two <hi>Jove</hi> has not yet made plain,</l>
            <l>Who both of Peace and War disposer is.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pallas</hi> the form took of <hi>Laodocus</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antenor</hi>'s Son, and went into the throng</l>
            <l>O'th' <hi>Trojans</hi> to inquire for <hi>Pandarus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>At last she found him his own Troops among,</l>
            <l>That were of <hi>Lycaonia</hi> the Bands,</l>
            <l>And from <hi>Zeleia</hi> led by <hi>Pandarus</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To <hi>Ilium.</hi> There <hi>Pallas</hi> by him stands</l>
            <l>Like to <hi>Antenor</hi>'s Son; and to him thus:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lycaon</hi>'s Son, saies she, dare you let fly</l>
            <l>A Shaft at <hi>Menelaus?</hi> For I know</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> all would thank you, specially</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Paris</hi> the Son of <hi>Priam,</hi> and bestow</l>
            <l>Great Presents on you if you should him kill.</l>
            <l>Shoot at him then, and to <hi>Apollo</hi> pray</l>
            <l>The God of Archers that he help you will.</l>
            <l>And vow a <hi>Hecatombe</hi> of Lambs to pay,</l>
            <l>When to <hi>Zeleia</hi> safely you come home.</l>
            <l>For there your people to <hi>Apollo</hi> vow.</l>
            <l>When this was said, the vain man overcome,</l>
            <l>From off his Shoulders taketh down his Bow</l>
            <l>(Which did a lusty Goats-head once adorn,</l>
            <l>Which with a Shaft he killed had among</l>
            <l>The Rocks, and taken from his head the Horn,</l>
            <l>Which was no less than sixteen handfuls long.</l>
            <l>And to a Fletcher gave it to be wrought,</l>
            <l>Shaven, and Polisht, and Guilt at the hand.)</l>
            <l>This Bow he bent; and lest the Foe should know't,</l>
            <l>He crouched down, and laid it on the sand.</l>
            <l>But lest the <hi>Greeks</hi> should rush on him, before</l>
            <l>He ready were to shoot, they that stood near,</l>
            <l>Before him with their Bucklers stood good store.</l>
            <l>And being now delivered of that fear,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93808:32"/>From out the Quiver takes an Arrow keen,</l>
            <l>And new, well wing'd to carry mischief true,</l>
            <l>Which shot before that time had never been.</l>
            <l>But yet his Vow before his Arrow flew.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> (said he) if I <hi>Atrides</hi> slay;</l>
            <l>Assoon as I shall to <hi>Zeleia</hi> come,</l>
            <l>I vow unto your Deity to pay</l>
            <l>Of my first yeaned Lambs an <hi>Hecatombe.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then to his breast he drew the leather string,</l>
            <l>And to the Bow return'd the Arrow head.</l>
            <l>Out leapt the Shaft, and as it went did sing</l>
            <l>Amongst the throng, as pleas'd mans blood to shed.</l>
            <l>And <hi>(Menelaus)</hi> now the Gods you blest,</l>
            <l>And chiefly <hi>Pallas</hi> that before you stood;</l>
            <l>And turn'd the deadly Arrow from your breast,</l>
            <l>About as much as a kind Mother cou'd</l>
            <l>From her Childs face divert a busie fly;</l>
            <l>And made it on the Golden Buckle fall,</l>
            <l>Where of his Breast plate double was the ply.</l>
            <l>And though it past through Buckle, Plate and all,</l>
            <l>And Girdle which his Coat unto him bound,</l>
            <l>The Shaft into his Body penetrated,</l>
            <l>And made (though not a great one) yet a wound,</l>
            <l>The force it went with being much abated.</l>
            <l>Yet out the blood ran. As when Ivory</l>
            <l>Is stain'd with Crimson, to adorn the Cheeks</l>
            <l>Of the proud Steeds, and please the Drivers eye,</l>
            <l>Many a Cavalier to have it seeks.</l>
            <l>The Dame that stain'd it then holds up the price,</l>
            <l>And keeps it by her as a precious thing;</l>
            <l>So lovely seems the Colour to her eyes,</l>
            <l>As to be sold to none but to a King.</l>
            <l>So look'd his body when the streams of Blood</l>
            <l>His Iv'ry Legs and Insteps did defile.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Agamemnon</hi> stiff with horror stood;</l>
            <l>And so did <hi>Menelaus</hi> for a while.</l>
            <l>But when he saw the Arrow Barbs appear</l>
            <l>Above the Nerve, his courage came again.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Agamemnon</hi> not yet out of fear,</l>
            <l>Did on the <hi>Trojans</hi> Perjury complain.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93808:33"/>Brother (said he) and took him by the hand,</l>
            <l>Dear Brother, 'tis the Oath that has you slain,</l>
            <l>Making you thus before the <hi>Trojans</hi> stand.</l>
            <l>But sure I am the Oath cannot be vain,</l>
            <l>Confirmed with so great solemnity.</l>
            <l>They shall (though late) pay for it with their lives.</l>
            <l>(For <hi>Jove</hi> nere fails to punish Perjury)</l>
            <l>Both they themselves, their children and their wives.</l>
            <l>For I well know the fatal day will come</l>
            <l>To <hi>Priam</hi> and to <hi>Priam</hi>'s people all.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> will his black Shield shake ore <hi>Ilium,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And for this ugly action make it fall.</l>
            <l>This <hi>(Menelaus)</hi> is a thing to come.</l>
            <l>But what if of your wound you chance to dye?</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> streight will think of going home.</l>
            <l>How by the <hi>Greeks</hi> then scorned shall be I!</l>
            <l>How proud will <hi>Priam</hi> and the <hi>Trojans</hi> be,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Argive Helen</hi> shall be left behind,</l>
            <l>And your bones rotting in the ground they see,</l>
            <l>Without effecting what they had design'd?</l>
            <l>Some trampling on you Grave perhaps will say,</l>
            <l>Would <hi>Agamemnon</hi> thus would alwaies vent</l>
            <l>His Choler, as he now has done at <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now gone with empty Ships back to repent,</l>
            <l>Leaving his Brother <hi>Menelaus</hi> here.</l>
            <l>Then should I wish the earth would swallow me.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Menelaus</hi> to displace that fear,</l>
            <l>Fright not the Army Brother, thus said he.</l>
            <l>Not mortal is the wound. 'Twixt me and death</l>
            <l>My Armour and the Clasps stood, all of Brass;</l>
            <l>Besides a good tough Girdle underneath.</l>
            <l>Pray God't be true (said he to <hi>Menelaus.</hi>)</l>
            <l>But we must send for a Chyrurgeon</l>
            <l>To mitigate with Lenitives the pain.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Talthybius</hi> (said he) call <hi>Machaon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And having found him quickly come again.</l>
            <l>Tell him he must to <hi>Menelaus</hi> come,</l>
            <l>Who by a Foe is with an Arrow shot,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Trojan</hi> or <hi>Lycian,</hi> I know not whom,</l>
            <l>That with great grief to us has honour got.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:93808:33"/>This said, the Herald went, and look'd about</l>
            <l>Amongst the Troops of <hi>Tricca</hi> which he led.</l>
            <l>Nor was it long before he found him out</l>
            <l>With many Targetiers environed.</l>
            <l>You must (said he) to <hi>Menelaus</hi> come,</l>
            <l>Who by some Foe is with an Arrow shot,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Trojan</hi> or <hi>Lycian,</hi> I know not whom,</l>
            <l>That (with great grief to us) has honour got.</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>Agamemnon</hi> calls you. Then they pass</l>
            <l>Together through the Hoast, and hastened</l>
            <l>Till they were come where <hi>Menelaus</hi> was</l>
            <l>With many other Lords encompassed.</l>
            <l>There <hi>Machaon</hi> the Arrow first pulls out.</l>
            <l>(The Barbs were broken as they came away)</l>
            <l>Then took he off his Armour and his Coat.</l>
            <l>Then sucked he the wound the blood to stay;</l>
            <l>And laid on Unguents to allay the pain.</l>
            <l>Mean while the <hi>Trojans</hi> arm'd were coming in.</l>
            <l>And then the <hi>Greeks</hi> were forc'd to arm again.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s vertue now was seen.</l>
            <l>He did not at their coming sleep nor start,</l>
            <l>But speedily prepared for the fight,</l>
            <l>And of a Chief Commander did the part,</l>
            <l>His own Commanders first to disaffright.</l>
            <l>His Horses and his Chariot he sent off.</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Eurymedon</hi> the Son of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Son of <hi>Pirus</hi> he gave charge thereof,</l>
            <l>And bad him with it alwaies to be nigh,</l>
            <l>To use when labour tired had his Knees.</l>
            <l>Through the great Army then on foot he went,</l>
            <l>And where them hasting to the Fight he sees,</l>
            <l>He gives them in few words encouragement.</l>
            <l>On <hi>Argives,</hi> and be sure <hi>Jove</hi> never fights</l>
            <l>Against good men for such perfidious knaves,</l>
            <l>But leave them will for food to Dogs and Kites,</l>
            <l>And to their Foes their wives and children Slaves.</l>

            <l>Our Fathers have before us us'd these Laws,</l>
            <l>And thereby many Cities level laid.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Nestor</hi> taught them. Glad <hi>Atrides</hi> was,</l>
            <l>And with great approbation to him said,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Nestor,</hi> that your Arms were but as strong</l>
            <l>As is your Mind! But they're decay'd by age.</l>
            <l>Or could you give your age to some man young,</l>

               <hi>Atrides</hi> (then said <hi>Nestor</hi>) so wish I.</l>

            <l>You hear the first when there will be a Feast,</l>
            <l>And stay for no man. For your Messes are</l>
            <l>Greater than other mens; your Wine the best,</l>
            <l>And without stint. And therefore in the War</l>
            <l>You should strive who should be the first to fight.</l>
            <l>But now though ten Troops were before you there,</l>
            <l>You would not be displeased with the sight.</l>
            <l>These words came harshly to <hi>Ulysses</hi> ear,</l>

            <l>And that this reprehension needless was.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Agamemnon</hi> smiling then reply'd,</l>
            <l>(Seeing his Censure did not kindly pass)</l>
            <l>Noble <hi>Ulysses,</hi> I meant not to chide,</l>

            <l>For we are both of us of the same mind.</l>
            <l>What's said amiss I shall again repair.</l>

            </l>

            <l>Went out before the rest, and coming close</l>

            <l>By <hi>Pyros</hi> whom the <hi>Thracians</hi> obey'd.</l>
            <l>Crusht of his Right Leg was the Ankle-bone,</l>

            <l>Ready to dye he for assistance cries.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Piros</hi> comes quickly in, and ore him stands,</l>
            <l>And wounds him in the Belly. Then he dies.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Thoas</hi> then slew <hi>Pyros</hi> with his Spear,</l>
            <l>That pass'd his Breast till in his Lungs it stopt.</l>
            <l>Then coming in he drew his Sword, and there</l>
            <l>His Belly ript till out his Bowels dropt,</l>
            <l>But to disarm him could not stay, because</l>
            <l>So many <hi>Thracians</hi> about him stood.</l>
            <l>Then back retir'd he, and well pelted was,</l>
            <l>Leaving two Leaders wrapt in dust and blood,</l>

            </l>
            <l>And many others lying by them dead.</l>
            <l>This Battle was well fought. Although a man</l>

            <l>By <hi>Pallas,</hi> and protected by her Shield,</l>

            <l>His Horses, and his Shield I have survay'd.</l>
            <l>And pleated Horse-hair hanging at his Crest.</l>
            <l>Though it be he, as I believe it is,</l>
            <l>Yet sure some God does on his Shoulders sit.</l>
            <l>For else of killing him how could I miss,</l>
            <l>When I his Shoulder with my Arrow hit?</l>
            <l>For I one Arrow shot at him before,</l>
            <l>And verily believ'd I had him slain.</l>
            <l>His Armour all besmeared was with gore,</l>
            <l>But slew him not. Now here he is again.</l>
            <l>I did not on a Charret hither come,</l>
            <l>Although <hi>Lycaon</hi> have eleven new,</l>
            <l>With handsome Curtains to each one, at home,</l>
            <l>And Horses fit to draw them not a few.</l>
            <l>The old Knight too advis'd me earnestly</l>
            <l>That when to Battle I the <hi>Trojans</hi> led,</l>
            <l>I from a Charre should charge the Enemy;</l>
            <l>But to his counsel I not hearkened.</l>
            <l>(Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <l>That when within <hi>Troy</hi> Walls we should be pent,</l>
            <l>My Horses, which were us'd to be well fed</l>
            <l>Would there be useless wanting nourishment.</l>
            <l>This made me come without a Chariot,</l>
            <l>And march (as far as 'twas) to <hi>Troy</hi> on foot.</l>
            <l>And trust unto my Bow which helps me not,</l>
            <l>But faileth me as often as I shoot.</l>
            <l>For two of them I have already shot,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> and <hi>Atrides,</hi> and good store</l>
            <l>Of blood have drawn from both, though killed no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <l>But made them fiercer than they were before.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93808:40"/>In an ill hour sure I took down my Bow</l>
            <l>To fight for <hi>Hector</hi> and the <hi>Trojan</hi> men;</l>
            <l>But if I safely to my Country go,</l>
            <l>And to my House and Wife get back agen,</l>

            <l>That never yet my hopes has answered.</l>
            <l>For why not, when it doth not serve my turn?</l>
            <l>To <hi>Pandarus Aeneas</hi> then reply'd,</l>
            <l>No, say not so, but first let's to him go.</l>
            <l>For by th'encounter soon it will be try'd</l>
            <l>Whether he be indeed a God or no.</l>
            <l>Get up into the Seat, and you shall see</l>
            <l>The vertue of my horses on the plain,</l>
            <l>And if some God with <hi>Diomedes</hi> be,</l>
            <l>How nimbly they will fetch us off again.</l>
            <l>Come take the Whip and Reins in hand, and I</l>
            <l>Descend will from the Chariot and fight.</l>
            <l>Or if you please, when to him we are nigh</l>
            <l>I'll hold the Whip and Reins, and you alight.</l>
            <l>No, no (said he) keep you the Reins in hand,</l>
            <l>The Horses us'd thereto will you obey.</l>
            <l>To me, it may be, they will restive stand,</l>
            <l>And to the Foe themselves and us betray.</l>
            <l>Let me alight and meet him with my Spear.</l>
            <l>This said, they mounted both; and coming on</l>
            <l>Towards <hi>Tydides</hi> both observed were</l>
            <l>By <hi>Sthenelus Capaneus</hi> his Son,</l>
            <l>Who warning to <hi>Tydides</hi> gave. I see</l>
            <l>Two mighty men to fight us coming on,</l>
            <l>Of which I know th'one <hi>Pandarus</hi> to be,</l>
            <l>The other <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Anchises</hi> Son.</l>
            <l>Come up into your Charret and retire.</l>
            <l>But frowning he reply'd, I'll ne'r do that.</l>
            <l>It not becomes the Children of my Sire,</l>
            <l>When they should fight to Double nor to Squat.</l>
            <l>I loath to sit upon a Chariot,</l>
            <l>And as I am I will attend them here.</l>
            <l>For of my strength deprived I am not,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> has forbidden me to fear.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93808:40"/>I doubt not but to kill them both, or one.</l>
            <l>If both, your Reins unto the two Wheels tie,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Aeneas</hi> Horses quickly run,</l>
            <l>And seize their Reins, lest frighted they should flie.</l>
            <l>Then send them to the Ships, brave Steeds, well bred;</l>
            <l>Of heavenly race they are, and got by those,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Jove</hi> to make amends for <hi>Ganymed,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Was pleas'd to give unto his Father <hi>Tros.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Anchises</hi> privily convey'd to these,</l>
            <l>Six Mares, and had a Colt by ev'ry one;</l>
            <l>Whereof he gave two to his Son <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To take these Horses now were bravely done.</l>
            <l>While they were talking, th'other two came nigh,</l>
            <l>And then said <hi>Pandarus,</hi> O <hi>Diomed,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Since my swift Arrow could not make you die,</l>
            <l>I come to try now how my Spear will speed.</l>
            <l>And as he spake the Spear flew from his hand</l>
            <l>And pass'd his Shield, but in his Armour staid.</l>
            <l>Y'are hit, said he, and long you cannot stand.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Diomed,</hi> nothing at all dismaid,</l>
            <l>No no cry'd out, your Spear is thrown in vain.</l>
            <l>But I believe before we have done here,</l>
            <l>That one of you, if not both, will be slain.</l>
            <l>And as he spake he at him threw his Spear.</l>
            <l>Which at his Nose close by his Eye went in,</l>
            <l>And struck his Teeth our, and cut off his Tongue.</l>
            <l>And out again it pass'd beneath his Chin.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Pallas</hi> from above it downward flung.</l>
            <l>There dead he lay. <hi>Aeneas</hi> to defend</l>
            <l>His body to him came with Spear and Shield,</l>
            <l>And 'bout him went, resolv'd the man to send</l>
            <l>To Hell, that should oppose him in the field.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> then took up a mighty Stone</l>
            <l>Which two men scarce could bear such as are now.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Diomedes</hi> swinging it alone,</l>
            <l>The same with ease did at <hi>Aeneas</hi> throw,</l>
            <l>And hit him on the Huckle bone, wherein</l>
            <l>Into the Hip inserted is the Thigh.</l>
            <l>And torn was by the rugged stone the skin,</l>
            <l>And Tendons broken which the Joint did tie.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93808:41"/>Then down upon his knees and hands he fell,</l>
            <l>And taken from him was his sight with pain.</l>
            <l>That <hi>Venus</hi> saw him lying thus 'twas well;</l>
            <l>Else by <hi>Tydides</hi> he had there been slain.</l>
            <l>For then came <hi>Venus</hi> down, and with the lap</l>
            <l>Of her Celestial Robe him covered,</l>
            <l>Lest any of the <hi>Greeks</hi> should have the hap</l>
            <l>To kill or wound him as from Earth he fled.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Sthenelus</hi> remembring well his Order,</l>
            <l>Ty'd his own Steeds up to his Charret-wheels,</l>
            <l>And led them out o'th' tumult and disorder,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Deiphilus</hi> that was at's Heels,</l>
            <l>(His Friend) he gave the Horses of <hi>Aeneas</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To carry them unto the <hi>Argive</hi> Fleet.</l>
            <l>But took <hi>Tydides</hi> Horses, and with these</l>
            <l>To try went if <hi>Tydides</hi> he could meet.</l>
            <l>But he in chase of <hi>Venus</hi> now was gone</l>
            <l>(Knowing that she a tender Goddess was,</l>
            <l>And for the War Commission had none,</l>
            <l>Nor had as <hi>Pallas</hi> any Shield of brass.)</l>
            <l>And had when he came to her wounded her.</l>
            <l>For through her Robe, though by the Graces made,</l>
            <l>Without resistance quickly pass'd the Spear,</l>
            <l>And at her Wrist did her fair Hand invade.</l>
            <l>And from the Wound out sprang the Blood Divine.</l>
            <l>(Not such as men have in their Veins, but <hi>Ichor.</hi>
            </l>

            <l>Have in their Veins another kind of Liquor,</l>

            <l>And <hi>Venus</hi> screaming then lets fall her Son.</l>
            <l>But by <hi>Apollo</hi>'s hand preserv'd was he,</l>
            <l>Convey'd thence in a Mist perceiv'd by none,</l>
            <l>For fear he should be by some <hi>Argive</hi> slain.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Venus</hi> then <hi>Tydides</hi> whoop'd, and said,</l>
            <l>Away <hi>Jove</hi>'s Daughter, from the War abstain.</l>
            <l>Go practise how to cosen VVife or Maid,</l>
            <l>For I believe if here you longer stay,</l>
            <l>(So many such as these mishaps there are)</l>
            <l>That you therein will have but little joy,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93808:41"/>This said, away she went, not knowing where</l>
            <l>She was; and great the pain was of her hand.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Iris</hi> from the Fight conducted her,</l>
            <l>And set her hard by <hi>Mars</hi> upon the sand.</l>
            <l>For there by <hi>Pallas</hi> placed he had been.</l>
            <l>His Horses and his Charret by him staid</l>
            <l>Hid in a Mist by man not to be seen.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Venus</hi> there before him kneeling said,</l>
            <l>Dear Brother, let me your good horses have,</l>
            <l>To bear me to <hi>Olympus</hi> from the Fray;</l>
            <l>This cruel wound mad <hi>Diomed</hi> me gave,</l>
            <l>And would wound <hi>Jove</hi> if he came in his way.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Mars</hi> presently his Horses to her lent.</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Iris</hi> the Reins held, and away they went.</l>
            <l>The time they spent in going was not great.</l>
            <l>When they were there, <hi>Iris</hi> the Steeds unty'd,</l>
            <l>And set them up, and gave unto them meat,</l>

               <hi>Ambrosian</hi> meat, till they were satisfy'd,</l>
            <l>Such as immortal Horses use to eat.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Venus</hi> fell into <hi>Diones</hi> lap,</l>
            <l>Her Mother, who imbrac'd her lovingly,</l>
            <l>Stroakt her, and said, How came this sad mishap?</l>
            <l>Who us'd you thus? What a rash God was he?</l>

            <l>You doing somthing openly amiss?</l>
            <l>It was a man, said she, gave me this wound,</l>

            <l>I sav'd my Son <hi>Aeneas</hi> from his hand,</l>

            <l>Retire (said he) <hi>Tydides,</hi> and beware</l>
            <l>You not your self think equal to the Gods.</l>

            <l>Not knowing what harm might from <hi>Phoebus</hi> come.</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Alastor</hi> then he slew, and <hi>Coeramus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Alcander, Prytanis</hi> and <hi>Noemon.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Halius</hi> he slew, and <hi>Chromius,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And many <hi>Lycians</hi> more had overthrown.</l>
            <l>But mighty <hi>Hector</hi> now approached near</l>
            <l>In glittering Arms, and brought with him Affright.</l>
            <l>But glad <hi>Sarpedon</hi> was to see him there;</l>
            <l>And when he was come up unto him quite,</l>
            <l>Himself lamenting thus to <hi>Hector</hi> said,</l>
            <l>Leave me not <hi>Hector</hi> to the <hi>Greeks</hi> a prey,</l>
            <l>But let my Body in your ground be laid,</l>
            <l>Since I my Country must no more enjoy,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:93808:45"/>Nor my beloved Wife and tender Son.</l>
            <l>So said <hi>Sarpedon. Hector</hi> not replies,</l>
            <l>But to the Enemy he passeth on;</l>
            <l>And as he goes the ground with blood he dyes.</l>
            <l>Under a Beech sacred to <hi>Jupiter</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Sarpedon</hi> placed was upon the ground,</l>
            <l>And gently <hi>Pelagon</hi> pull'd out the Spear;</l>
            <l>The pain hereof put him into a swound.</l>
            <l>Lost was his sight; but by a gentle wind</l>
            <l>And cool, that from the North upon him blew,</l>
            <l>He soon recover'd both his Sight and Mind,</l>
            <l>And all the company about him knew.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> still the <hi>Greeks</hi> gave way,</l>
            <l>And still their Faces to the <hi>Trojans</hi> were,</l>
            <l>But for to charge none durst advance or stay.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Diomed</hi> had told them <hi>Mars</hi> was there.</l>
            <l>Now tell me <hi>Muse,</hi> who slain by <hi>Hector</hi> was?</l>
            <l>Trechus, Orestes, Tenthras, Helenus,</l>
            <l>(Whose Father <hi>Oenops</hi> was) and <hi>Oenonaus.</hi>

            </l>
            <l>In <hi>Hyla</hi> on <hi>Cephissis</hi> Lake he dwelt,</l>
            <l>The richest pasture of <hi>Boeotia,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And known was by the gayness of his Belt.</l>
            <l>This slaughter of the <hi>Greeks</hi> when <hi>Juno</hi> saw,</l>
            <l>She then to <hi>Pallas</hi> spake. <hi>Pallas</hi> (said she)</l>
            <l>If we let <hi>Mars</hi> still play the madman here,</l>
            <l>Our word to <hi>Menelaus</hi> false will be,</l>
            <l>That he from <hi>Troy</hi> return should Conqueror.</l>
            <l>Let's courage take, and try what we can do.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pallas</hi> contented, 'twas agreed upon.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Juno</hi> ready made her self to go,</l>

            <l>Eight spokes each wheel had, and were all of Brass,</l>
            <l>And fixed round about at th'Axle-tree.</l>
            <l>The Axle-tree it self of Iron was.</l>
            <l>The Circle Gold, and wonderful to see.</l>

            <l>And then her Breast with Armour covered,</l>
            <l>And on her Shoulder hung her frightful Shield,</l>

            <l>That from a Hill looketh upon the Main,</l>
            <l>So far the Horses of the Gods can skip.</l>
            <l>Arriv'd at <hi>Troy,</hi> on ground they set their feet,</l>

            <l>Then swift as Doves, to give the <hi>Argives</hi> aid</l>
            <l>They went to where they saw the greatest throng.</l>
            <l>There was <hi>Tydides,</hi> and about him staid</l>
            <l>Many as Lions valiant and strong.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Juno</hi> there in shape of <hi>Stentor</hi> stood,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Argives,</hi> said she, Cowards, for nothing good,</l>
            <l>Although you make a goodly show. For when</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> went before you to the Fight,</l>
            <l>Out at their Gates the <hi>Trojans</hi> durst not peep,</l>
            <l>So much they of his Spear abhor'd the sight.</l>

            <l>Hard by his Horses sitting, wearied,</l>
            <l>And cooling in the open air the wound</l>

            <l>Under his Belt afflicted him the more.</l>
            <l>And lifting up his Belt, some ease to get,</l>
            <l>He from the wound was wiping off the gore.</l>
            <l>As at the yoke <hi>Athena</hi> leaning stood,</l>
            <l>Like him (said she) your Father left no Son.</l>
            <l>A little man was he, but Warriour good.</l>
            <l>Though I not bad him, he went boldly on.</l>
            <l>And when to <hi>Thebes</hi> alone I bad him go</l>
            <l>Ambassador, and with the <hi>Theban</hi> Lords</l>
            <l>To sit at Feast, and not provoke the Foe,</l>
            <l>And at their Table to forbear harsh words,</l>
            <l>Yet he his native Courage still retained,</l>
            <l>And them defy'd at manly Exercises,</l>
            <l>And from them all the Victory he gained,</l>
            <l>And won, by my assistance, all the Prizes.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93808:47"/>But when I you, as I did him, defend,</l>
            <l>And bid you boldly with the <hi>Trojans</hi> fight,</l>
            <l>You are affraid, or weariness pretend.</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Tydeus</hi> sure the Son you are not right.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> to her then replying said,</l>
            <l>Daughter of <hi>Jove, (Pallas</hi> I know you are)</l>
            <l>'Tis not that I am weary or affraid,</l>
            <l>That I stand here abstaining from the War,</l>
            <l>But in obedience to your own command,</l>
            <l>Who gave me leave if <hi>Venus</hi> in the Wars</l>
            <l>I met, to wound her; but not lift my hand</l>
            <l>'Gainst other Gods. Now in the field is <hi>Mars,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And domineering fights on <hi>Hectors</hi> side.</l>
            <l>And that's the cause why I from fight abstain,</l>
            <l>And others by my Counsel here abide.</l>
            <l>To this the Goddess then reply'd again,</l>
            <l>Nor <hi>Mars</hi> nor any of th'Immortals spare</l>
            <l>That shall advance against you in the field.</l>
            <l>And for your safety trust unto my care,</l>
            <l>And know you are protected by my Shield.</l>
            <l>But first to <hi>Mars</hi> drive up your Horses close,</l>
            <l>And strike the Blockhead with your Spear in hand,</l>
            <l>That fights sometimes for these, sometimes for those,</l>
            <l>And with the <hi>Trojans</hi> now you see him stand,</l>
            <l>And yet to help the <hi>Greeks</hi> he promis'd me</l>
            <l>And <hi>Juno,</hi> but a little while before,</l>
            <l>And now amongst the <hi>Trojans</hi> fighteth he,</l>
            <l>And thinks upon his promises no more.</l>
            <l>This said, they mount into the Chariot,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Sthenelus</hi> descending left his Seat.</l>
            <l>The Axtree groaned under them. Why not?</l>
            <l>A great man he, she was a Goddess great.</l>
            <l>And then to <hi>Mars</hi> directly they drive on,</l>
            <l>Who had but newly slain great <hi>Periphas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of old <hi>Ochesius</hi> the valiant Son,</l>
            <l>And far the best of all th' <hi>Aetolians</hi> was.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Athena</hi> then puts <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Helmet on,</l>
            <l>Lest she by <hi>Mars</hi> should be discovered.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Mars</hi> there saw <hi>Tydides</hi> all alone,</l>
            <l>He <hi>Periphas</hi> forsook who there lay dead;</l>
            <l>

            <l>And when to one another they were near,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Mars</hi> making full account the man to slay,</l>
            <l>Over the Yoke thrusts at him with his Spear.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Pallas</hi> with her hand the point supprest,</l>
            <l>And made it light beneath the Seat in vain.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> then to <hi>Mars</hi> a Spear addrest,</l>
            <l>Which had he been a Mortal had him slain.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Pallas</hi> in his Belly stuck the Spear,</l>
            <l>And presently the same pluckt out again.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Mars</hi> roar'd as loud as if in battle there</l>
            <l>Fighting had been nine or ten thousand men,</l>
            <l>And frighted both the Armies with the noise.</l>
            <l>Then like a black Cloud which some Wind makes rise,</l>
            <l>He left th'unlucky field and went his ways,</l>
            <l>And in a little time was in the Skies.</l>
            <l>And sitting down hard by his Fathers Throne,</l>
            <l>Shew'd him the blood that from the wound did flow,</l>
            <l>And grievously lamenting made his mone.</l>
            <l>Father, said he, do you such work allow?</l>
            <l>That we the Gods such harm from Mortals take,</l>
            <l>While some for <hi>Trojans,</hi> some for <hi>Argives</hi> fight,</l>
            <l>And partial be for one anothers sake,</l>
            <l>The fault is to be laid on you by right.</l>
            <l>For you brought forth this mad pernicious Maid,</l>
            <l>Whose study is her malice to effect,</l>
            <l>When by us other Gods you are obey'd.</l>
            <l>And this you saw, but never would correct.</l>
            <l>'Twas she that on the Gods set <hi>Diomed,</hi>

            <l>Of all the Gods most hateful to my sight,</l>
            <l>That quarrel lov'st to make, but not decide.</l>
            <l>Thou hast thy Mother <hi>Juno</hi>'s nature right,</l>
            <l>That oft provokes me with her peevish tongue,</l>
            <l>And by her order, I think, this was done.</l>

            <l>For many <hi>Trojans</hi> more I have to kill,</l>

            <l>And that our Friendship may the more appear,</l>

            <l>And you to me present the Arms you wear.</l>
            <l>This said, they lighted and their hands did joyn.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Glaucus</hi> surely here bewitched was,</l>

               <hi>Hector</hi> was now come to the <hi>Scaean</hi> Gates.</l>
            <l>To him the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wives and Daughters run</l>
            <l>To ask their Husbands and their Brothers Fates,</l>
            <l>But to those questions he answer'd none.</l>
            <l>But to the Temples bad them go and pray,</l>
            <l>Inquire no more for what you will lament.</l>
            <l>Then to the Royal Palace went his way.</l>
            <l>For great the danger was and imminent.</l>
            <l>On every side within were Galleries</l>
            <l>Magnificent, of square well-plained Stones,</l>
            <l>With Fifty Lodgings for the Families</l>
            <l>(One by another) of King <hi>Priam</hi>'s Sons.</l>
            <l>And for his Daughters twelve Appartments were</l>
            <l>(In the same Court, but on the other side)</l>
            <l>To lodge his Sons in Law when they were there,</l>
            <l>Of the same Stone in like form beautifi'd.</l>
            <l>Here <hi>Hecuba,</hi> as she conducted home</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Laodice</hi> her beautifullest Daughter,</l>

            <l>In dusty bloody Armour from the Slaughter.</l>
            <l>And took him by the hand, and to him said,</l>
            <l>Why come you from the fight? Have we the worst,</l>
            <l>And you come to sollicite <hi>Jove</hi> for aid,</l>
            <l>And after that is done to quench your thirst?</l>
            <l>A little Wine will much the strength sustain</l>
            <l>Of one that labour'd has as you have done.</l>
            <l>No, no, from Wine (said he) I must abstain,</l>
            <l>Lest I forget and leave my work undone.</l>
            <l>Besides, to <hi>Jove</hi> I dare not offer Wine</l>
            <l>With bloody hands, lest I should him incense.</l>
            <l>But, Mother, go you to <hi>Minerva</hi>'s shrine</l>
            <l>With other Ladies, and with Frankincense;</l>
            <l>And of the Robes in your perfumed Chest</l>
            <l>Take with you that which in your judgment is</l>
            <l>Amongst them all the largest and the best,</l>
            <l>And lay it down upon the Goddess knees.</l>
            <l>And vow that at her Altar you will kill</l>
            <l>Twelve yearling Heisers of the best you have,</l>
            <l>If at your Prayer condescend she will</l>
            <l>Your Children with your selves and <hi>Troy</hi> to save,</l>

               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93808:52"/>And from the Fight this <hi>Diomed</hi> remove.</l>
            <l>To th' Temple presently go you away.</l>
            <l>But I to <hi>Paris</hi> now must go, and prove</l>
            <l>If he th'advice I give him will obey.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hecuba</hi> into the Chamber came</l>
            <l>Where many divers-colour'd Vestures lay,</l>
            <l>The work of many a <hi>Sidonian</hi> Dame,</l>
            <l>Which then from <hi>Sidon Paris</hi> brought to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When thither he from <hi>Sparta Helen</hi> brought.</l>
            <l>Of these, to give the Goddess, she took one</l>
            <l>The largest and most curiously wrought,</l>
            <l>And that like to a Star in Heaven shone.</l>
            <l>And when unto the Temple come they were,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Theano</hi> opened the door; for she</l>
            <l>(<hi>Antenor</hi>'s Wife) was <hi>Pallas</hi> Priest. And there</l>
            <l>She took the Robe, and laid it on her Knee.</l>
            <l>Then prayed she (whilst with a mighty cry</l>
            <l>They to the Goddess lifted up their hands.)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pallas</hi> (said she) Daughter of <hi>Jove</hi> most high,</l>
            <l>In whose protection ev'ry City stands,</l>

            </l>
            <l>And overthrow him at the <hi>Scaean</hi> gate,</l>
            <l>That at thy Altar may be offered</l>
            <l>Twelve yearling Heisers; and commiserate</l>
            <l>The Wives and Children and the state of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus prayed they; But <hi>Pallas</hi> would not hear.</l>
            <l>To th'House of <hi>Paris Hector</hi> went away</l>
            <l>That was unto his own and <hi>Priams</hi> near,</l>
            <l>Built by himself the Citadel within,</l>
            <l>With all the Art the <hi>Trojans</hi> understood.</l>
            <l>There <hi>Hector</hi> with his Spear in hand went in,</l>
            <l>That was in length eleven Cubits good,</l>
            <l>And pointed at the Head with polisht Brass,</l>
            <l>Fastned into the staff with a Gold Ring.</l>
            <l>Busy about his Armour <hi>Paris</hi> was,</l>

            <l>Here <hi>Hector Paris</hi> chid. Is this, said he,</l>
            <l>The fittest time to manifest your spite</l>
            <l>Against the <hi>Trojans,</hi> when the Enemy</l>
            <l>Under our Walls is killing them in fight?</l>

            </l>
            <l>I think it would become you better far</l>
            <l>To rate those men that from the Battle stay.</l>
            <l>Brother, said <hi>Paris,</hi> What you say is right.</l>
            <l>But hear me too. I stayed not behind</l>
            <l>Because I to the <hi>Trojans</hi> bear a spite,</l>
            <l>But from their Slanders to avert my mind.</l>
            <l>And now my Wife too has persuaded me,</l>
            <l>Who of my self was ready to be gone.</l>
            <l>Not sure to any side is Victory.</l>
            <l>Stay only while I put my Armour on.</l>
            <l>Or go. I'll follow you and find you out.</l>
            <l>Thus he. But <hi>Hector</hi> to it nothing said.</l>
            <l>And to be gone his Face he turn'd about.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Helen</hi> saw about to speak, and staid.</l>
            <l>Brother (said she) though I unworthy am</l>
            <l>To call you so, I would I had been thrown</l>
            <l>Into the Sea the same day that I came</l>
            <l>Into the world, so many shames to own.</l>
            <l>Or that this Husband sensible had been,</l>
            <l>As men of Honour should be of ill fame;</l>
            <l>But that's not now, nor ever will be seen,</l>
            <l>He one day will (I fear) repent the same.</l>
            <l>But Brother (pra'ye) sit down and rest a while,</l>
            <l>That with the toil of Battle weary are;</l>
            <l>The cause whereof am I the Woman vile,</l>
            <l>That with me brought to <hi>Troy</hi> this cruel War.</l>
            <l>Unlucky day that brought me first acquainted</l>
            <l>With <hi>Alexander</hi> to our Infamy,</l>
            <l>Which through the world hereafter will be chanted,</l>
            <l>And make us loathsom to posterity.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Helen</hi> (said <hi>Hector</hi>) now I cannot stay,</l>

            <l>While I am in the Town, and that with speed.</l>

            <l>An't may be never back again shall come,</l>
            <l>But by the hands of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> dye.</l>

            <l>His Wife <hi>Andromache</hi> at home was not.</l>
            <l>For with the Nurse the Battle to behold,</l>
            <l>Into the Tow'r on <hi>Scaea</hi> Gate was got.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> of the women askt again,</l>
            <l>Is she gone to some Sister or some Brother?</l>
            <l>Or to the Goddess Temple in the Train</l>
            <l>Of those that thither waited on my Mother?</l>
            <l>To this one of the Women said again,</l>
            <l>She neither went to Sister nor to Brother,</l>
            <l>Nor to the Goddess Temple, in the Train</l>
            <l>Of those that thither waited on your Mother.</l>

            <l>With her young Son and Nurse as one that's mad</l>
            <l>Ran to the Gate, and up into the Tower.</l>
            <l>Then back went <hi>Hector</hi> passing the same Streets</l>
            <l>Through which he went when he came from the fight,</l>
            <l>Where in the way <hi>Andromache</hi> he meets</l>
            <l>That now was running home in great affright.</l>
            <l>The Daughter she was of <hi>Eetion,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who of <hi>Cilicia</hi> the Scepter carried,</l>

            </l>
            <l>But unto noble <hi>Hector</hi> she was married.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Hector</hi> met her with their little Boy</l>
            <l>That in the Nurses arms was carried,</l>
            <l>And like a Star upon her bosome lay</l>
            <l>His beautiful and shining golden Head.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Scamandrius</hi> he called was by <hi>Hector,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Astyanax</hi> he named was in <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Because his Father was their sole Protector,</l>
            <l>The people from his Honour nam'd the Boy.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> smiling look'd upon his Son.</l>
            <l>And to him weeping said <hi>Andromache,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>My Dear, You'll by your courage be undone,</l>
            <l>And this your Son a wretched Orphan be.</l>

            <l>When he the goodly Town of <hi>Thebe</hi> won.</l>
            <l>But from disarming him he did refrain.</l>
            <l>Together with his Arms he did him burn,</l>
            <l>And with such Rites as did a Prince become.</l>
            <l>And having put his Ashes in an Urn</l>
            <l>Bury'd the same, and ore it rais'd a Tomb.</l>
            <l>The Mountain-Nymphs Daughters of <hi>Jupiter</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Planted about it many Elmen-trees.</l>
            <l>My seven Brothers all were killed there.</l>
            <l>In one day by <hi>Achilles</hi> slain were these,</l>
            <l>As they defending were their Kine and Sheep.</l>
            <l>My Mother with the Booty he brought hither,</l>

            <l>Then to her Country back they sent my Mother,</l>

            <l>Now <hi>Hector</hi> you my Father are and Brother,</l>

            <l>Dear Wife, this might be done. But what disgrace</l>
            <l>Shall I be in? How will the <hi>Trojans</hi> scoff</l>
            <l>Both Men and Women, and deride my fear,</l>
            <l>If on the Tow'r they saw me standing off</l>

            <l>This said, he gave the Child t'<hi>Andromache,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which she receiving hug'd, and laugh'd and cry'd.</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Hector</hi> with compassion did see,</l>
            <l>And thus with gentle words his Wife did chide.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93808:54"/>Dear Wife, do not afflict your self for me.</l>
            <l>No man can die before his hour is come;</l>
            <l>And when 'tis come, put off it cannot be</l>
            <l>By weak nor strong. Therefore I pra'ye go home,</l>
            <l>And tend your work, and give your Women theirs,</l>
            <l>And sit still at your Spindle and your Loom,</l>
            <l>And leave to men these Martial affairs,</l>
            <l>And me that have the charge of <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then up he takes his Helmet and departs,</l>
            <l>And homewards she; but often turn'd her head.</l>
            <l>At home with grief she fill'd her womens hearts,</l>
            <l>And made them mourn for <hi>Hector</hi> not yet dead.</l>
            <l>Nor <hi>Paris</hi> at his house did longer stay</l>
            <l>Than he must needs his Armour to put on,</l>
            <l>And up and down the streets went every way,</l>
            <l>To see if he could <hi>Hector</hi> light upon.</l>
            <l>As when a Horse i'th' Stable pampered,</l>
            <l>And used to be washed in the River</l>
            <l>His Headstal breaks, or be delivered</l>
            <l>From that which held him by what means soever;</l>
            <l>Then proudly he sets up his Tail and Head,</l>
            <l>And bears the Plain, and with the wind he makes</l>
            <l>His Mane play in the air dishevelled,</l>
            <l>Then to the Pasture known the way he takes:</l>
            <l>So from his house went <hi>Paris</hi> through the Streets</l>
            <l>With shining Arms, and Courage at his heart;</l>
            <l>And quickly with his valiant brother meets,</l>
            <l>Turning from where he and his wife did part.</l>
            <l>And first to <hi>Hector Paris</hi> thus began.</l>
            <l>Brother I fear I've made you stay too long.</l>
            <l>No (he reply'd) your courage no man can</l>
            <l>Accuse, but such as mean to do you wrong.</l>
            <l>But when you, out of humour, will not fight,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> that much suffer for your sake</l>
            <l>Speak all the ill they can of you in spight.</l>
            <l>Which when I hear, it makes my heart to ake.</l>

            <l>THis said, they went together to the Fight,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Paris</hi> now no more the War declin'd,</l>
            <l>And welcome to the <hi>Trojans</hi> was the sight,</l>

            <l>There <hi>Paris</hi> slew <hi>Menesthius,</hi> the Son</l>

            </l>
            <l>Of <hi>Arne.</hi> And by <hi>Hector</hi> overthrown</l>
            <l>And struck clean through the Neck was <hi>Eionus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Iphinous</hi> the Son of <hi>Dexias</hi>

            <l>As to his Charre he mounted to have fled,</l>
            <l>By <hi>Glaucus</hi> through the Shoulder wounded was,</l>
            <l>And to the ground again fell backward dead.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Pallas</hi> saw the <hi>Argives</hi> fall so fast,</l>
            <l>She from <hi>Olympus</hi> leapt to <hi>Ilium:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> then to meet her made great haste,</l>

            </l>
            <l>And when they were together at the Beech,</l>
            <l>He for the <hi>Trojans,</hi> for the <hi>Argives</hi> she,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> to her thus addrest his Speech:</l>
            <l>Daughter of <hi>Jove,</hi> what great necessity</l>
            <l>Brought you to <hi>Troy?</hi> Was it to please your mind,</l>
            <l>Or give unto the <hi>Greeks</hi> the Victory?</l>
            <l>For well I know to <hi>Troy</hi> you are not kind.</l>
            <l>But for the present be advis'd by me.</l>
            <l>Let th'Armies both give over fight to day,</l>
            <l>And fight it out hereafter till they know</l>
            <l>What end the Fates assigned have to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Since you and <hi>Juno</hi> needs will have it so.</l>
            <l>Your Counsel's good (said <hi>Pallas</hi>) and the same</l>
            <l>I thought upon. But tell me how to do it.</l>
            <l>For to that end I from <hi>Olympus</hi> came.</l>
            <l>Tell me but how, and I'll consent unto it.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:93808:55"/>Why then, said <hi>Phoebus, Hector</hi> I'll excite</l>
            <l>In Duel all the <hi>Argives</hi> to defie;</l>
            <l>And they some one will choose with him to fight,</l>
            <l>And both the Armies quietly stand by.</l>
            <l>This counsel was by both agreed upon;</l>
            <l>And known to <hi>Helenus</hi> by Augury,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Helenus</hi> that was King <hi>Priam</hi>'s Son.</l>
            <l>And he to <hi>Hector</hi> did himself apply.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> said he, will you do that which I</l>
            <l>That am your Brother shall advise you to?</l>
            <l>Go to th'<hi>Achaean</hi> Army and defie</l>
            <l>The best of all the <hi>Argives</hi>; Boldly go;</l>
            <l>For in this Combat you are not to die:</l>
            <l>The Gods have told me so, Then never fear.</l>
            <l>Then to the Front came <hi>Hector</hi> joyfully,</l>
            <l>With both his hands o'th' middle of his Spear</l>
            <l>To keep the <hi>Trojans</hi> back and make them stand;</l>
            <l>And streight King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> seeing it,</l>
            <l>Unto the <hi>Argives</hi> gave the like comand.</l>
            <l>Then on the ground both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> sit.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> flew up to the Tree,</l>
            <l>The high Beech-tree that sacred was to <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I'th' likeness of two Vulturs, thence to see</l>
            <l>How the two Armies looked from above.</l>
            <l>As when a West-wind ruffled has the Main,</l>
            <l>It black and horrid to the eye appears;</l>
            <l>So lookt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> on the Plain,</l>
            <l>Grifly and dark with Helmets, Shields and Spears.</l>
            <l>Into the midst between them <hi>Hector</hi> stept.</l>
            <l>You <hi>Trojans</hi> and well-armed <hi>Greeks,</hi> said he,</l>
            <l>Since 'twas <hi>Jove</hi>'s will our Oath should not be kept,</l>
            <l>But that the War continued shall be</l>
            <l>Till either you shall win the Town of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or we your Army and your Ships confound,</l>
            <l>Fighting till one another we destroy;</l>
            <l>I to you <hi>Argives</hi> somewhat will propound.</l>
            <l>The best of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> are present here.</l>
            <l>Let one of them come forth and fight with me,</l>
            <l>On these conditions (witness <hi>Jupiter</hi>)</l>
            <l>If by his hand I slain in Combat be,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93808:56"/>Let him do with my Armor what he will,</l>
            <l>But send my Body into <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But if <hi>Apollo</hi> grant me him to kill,</l>
            <l>His Armour I will have and carry home,</l>
            <l>And in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple dedicate.</l>
            <l>His Body to the Ships shall rendred be,</l>
            <l>That on his Urn the <hi>Greeks</hi> may elevate</l>
            <l>A Mount of Earth for Passengers to see</l>
            <l>Upon the Shore of <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and say,</l>
            <l>Here lies a valiant <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>Hector</hi> slain</l>
            <l>Long since, when th'<hi>Argives</hi> were besieging <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>My honour thus for ever will remain.</l>
            <l>So <hi>Hector</hi> said. The <hi>Greeks</hi> all silent were.</l>
            <l>For shame the Challenge they could not refuse;</l>
            <l>And to accept it ev'ry one did fear.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Menelaus</hi> then his Valour shews,</l>
            <l>And rising up in anger thus he said,</l>
            <l>Women of <hi>Argos</hi> what a shame is this</l>
            <l>That you should all of <hi>Hector</hi> be affraid!</l>
            <l>What now become of all your threatning is?</l>
            <l>There, (dust and water, heartless, nameless) sit.</l>
            <l>My self I'll arm (for I perceive no odds)</l>
            <l>And will this sturdy Champion <hi>Hector</hi> meet.</l>
            <l>For Victory comes only from the Gods.</l>
            <l>This said, he rose and arm'd himself; and there</l>
            <l>Depriv'd of life had <hi>Menelaus</hi> been</l>
            <l>(So much too weak he was) by <hi>Hector</hi>'s Spear,</l>
            <l>But that the Princes starting up came in.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi> seizing on his hand,</l>
            <l>Why <hi>Menelaus</hi> are you mad, said he,</l>
            <l>In fight you cannot against <hi>Hector</hi> stand,</l>
            <l>How much soever you concerned be.</l>
            <l>Avoid him in the Field as others do.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> who than you much stronger is,</l>
            <l>Strong as he is, considers <hi>Hector</hi> too,</l>
            <l>And cooler grows as oft as he him sees.</l>
            <l>Therefore, good Brother, sit still at your Troop.</l>
            <l>Some other we'll oppose to <hi>Hector</hi>'s might,</l>
            <l>That, haughty as he is, shall make him stoop,</l>
            <l>And thank the Gods if safe he come from fight.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:93808:56"/>To this good counsel yielded <hi>Menelaus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whereat his Servants not a little joy'd,</l>
            <l>Came in, and soon by them unarm'd he was,</l>
            <l>And to the <hi>Greeks</hi> then <hi>Nestor</hi> rose, and said,</l>
            <l>O how unwelcome will this Story be</l>
            <l>To <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Peleus</hi> King o'th' <hi>Myrmidons,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who at his house the names enquir'd of me</l>
            <l>Both of your selves, your Fathers, and your Sons.</l>
            <l>If he should know how much you <hi>Hector</hi> dread,</l>
            <l>How oft would he hold up his hands, and pray</l>
            <l>The Gods to send him down amongst the dead,</l>
            <l>And from his body take all sense away!</l>
            <l>O that I were as young as I was then</l>
            <l>When war was 'twixt <hi>Arcadia</hi> and <hi>Pyle,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And at the Walls of <hi>Pheia</hi> stood the men</l>
            <l>Ready for bloody fight in Rank and File!</l>
            <l>Amongst them stood one <hi>Ereuthalion,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And of the great man <hi>Areîthous</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Upon his Shoulders had the Armour on,</l>
            <l>Who Clubman commonly surnamed was,</l>
            <l>Because he used neither Bow nor Spear,</l>
            <l>But with an Iron Club the Battles brake.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lycurgus</hi> slew him though he weaker were,</l>
            <l>(When at advantage great he did him take)</l>
            <l>By craft, not strength. For in a narrow way</l>
            <l>He watch'd him at a turning with his Spear,</l>
            <l>And on a sudden took his life away,</l>
            <l>So that the Club had nothing to do there.</l>
            <l>Then took he off his Arms, and wore the same</l>
            <l>In Battle when there was occasion,</l>
            <l>But gave them when old age upon him came</l>
            <l>To this his Squier <hi>Ereuthalion.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who wearing them our Army did defie,</l>
            <l>At which when others trembling stood and shook</l>
            <l>Although the youngest of them all was I,</l>
            <l>Great as he was, the man I undertook,</l>
            <l>And slew him by the Goddess <hi>Pallas</hi> aid,</l>
            <l>The strong'st and tallest that I ever slew,</l>
            <l>As when upon the ground he stretcht was laid,</l>
            <l>The place he covered did plainly shew.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:93808:57"/>If I were now as young and strong as then,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> for <hi>Hector</hi> soon a match should find,</l>
            <l>Though none of you that are their bravest men</l>
            <l>To try your fortune with him have a mind.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Nestor</hi> th'<hi>Argive</hi> Lords did reprehend,</l>
            <l>And nine of them in number (all that durst</l>

            <l>Armed, and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> was the first.</l>

            </l>
            <l>And then the greater <hi>Ajax,</hi> then the less,</l>

            <l>Then brought they in their Lots; which ore and ore</l>
            <l>He shook in <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Helmet bright.</l>

            <l>The Helmet shaken threw out <hi>Ajax</hi> Lot,</l>

            <l>Rose up, and lets it fall before his feet.</l>
            <l>And to the Princes said, This Lot is mine,</l>
            <l>And glad I am, and hope for Victory.</l>
            <l>But send your Pray'rs up to the Pow'rs divine,</l>
            <l>While I put on my Arms; and silently,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:93808:57"/>So that (at least) the <hi>Trojans</hi> may not hear.</l>
            <l>Or (now I think on't) plain and openly.</l>
            <l>For I see nothing that I need to fear.</l>
            <l>I am not forc'd to fight unwillingly,</l>
            <l>Nor rashly undertook the enterprize.</l>
            <l>For I was born and bred in <hi>Salamis,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And hope I am not so weak or unwise.</l>
            <l>Assoon as mighty <hi>Ajax</hi> had said this,</l>
            <l>The people looking up to Heav'n pray'd.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Jove,</hi> said one, grant <hi>Ajax</hi> Victory,</l>
            <l>Or if you be inclin'd <hi>Hector</hi> to aid,</l>
            <l>Then let their strength and glory equal be.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Ajax</hi> had his Arms put on compleat,</l>
            <l>He walkt away with a Majestique pace,</l>
            <l>As <hi>Mars</hi> goes to the War. His strides were great,</l>
            <l>And scornful smiles with terror in his face.</l>
            <l>And as he went he shook his mighty Spear,</l>
            <l>Which joyfully the <hi>Argives</hi> did behold;</l>
            <l>But by the <hi>Trojans</hi> lookt on was with fear;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> at the heart himself was cold.</l>
            <l>But was ashamed back again to fly,</l>
            <l>Since he provok'd him had into the field.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Ajax</hi> now was come unto him nigh,</l>
            <l>As from a Tower looking ore his Shield.</l>
            <l>By <hi>Tychius</hi> of <hi>Hyla</hi> made it was,</l>
            <l>And cover'd with sev'n fat Bulls hides well tan'd,</l>
            <l>And over them an eight of shining Brass,</l>
            <l>And at his Breast he held it with his hand,</l>
            <l>And threatning said, <hi>Hector</hi> I'll make you see,</l>
            <l>That in the Army many yet remain,</l>
            <l>Though from us angry gone <hi>Achilles</hi> be,</l>
            <l>And discontent from Battle now abstain,</l>
            <l>That fear not <hi>Hector.</hi> Do the worst you can.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> (said <hi>Hector</hi>) I am not a Child</l>
            <l>Nor Woman to be threatned, but a Man</l>
            <l>That understands the bus'ness of the Field,</l>
            <l>And can my Buckler bear from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est to Right,</l>
            <l>And have whereon in Battle to rely,</l>
            <l>And how to guide my Horses in a fight,</l>
            <l>And move my feet to <hi>Mars</hi> his Melody.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93808:58"/>But no such cunning will I use with you.</l>
            <l>My Spear I'll send unto you openly.</l>
            <l>And at that word the long Spear from him flew,</l>
            <l>And pierc'd his Target to the seventh ply.</l>
            <l>But there it staid. Then <hi>Ajax</hi> threw his Spear,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Hector</hi>'s Shield, Armour &amp; Coat went through.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> shrunk his Belly in for fear.</l>
            <l>For else it pierced had his Belly too.</l>
            <l>Then from their Shields the Spears they plucked out,</l>
            <l>And them no more at one another threw,</l>
            <l>But came unto each other close and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought.</l>
            <l>And like two Lions on each other flew.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> made a thrust at <hi>Ajax</hi> Shield</l>
            <l>Which entred not, resisted by the brass:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi>'s Shield to <hi>Ajax</hi> Spear did yield,</l>
            <l>Which pierc'd it through; and so far in did pass,</l>
            <l>That grazing on his Neck it fetch'd the blood.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> not dismaid took up a Stone.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> took't on his Shield and firmly stood,</l>
            <l>And with his hand took up a greater one</l>
            <l>And rougher, which did <hi>Hector</hi>'s Buckler tear,</l>
            <l>And with the weight unto the ground him threw,</l>
            <l>But up again <hi>Apollo</hi> did him rear.</l>
            <l>Then both of them (the Combat to renew)</l>
            <l>Their Swords were drawing. But the Heralds then</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idaeus</hi> and <hi>Talthibius</hi> came in,</l>
            <l>The sacred Messengers of Gods and men,</l>
            <l>And put themselves the Combatants between.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Troy</hi>'s Herald then <hi>Idaeus</hi> to them spake.</l>
            <l>Good Sons, belov'd of <hi>Jove,</hi> give over fight.</l>
            <l>For all men of your Valour notice take.</l>
            <l>And now 'tis late; we must submit to Night.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idaeus</hi> (then said <hi>Ajax</hi>) let these words</l>
            <l>From <hi>Hector</hi> come, from whom came the Defie.</l>
            <l>'Twas he that Challeng'd all the <hi>Argive</hi> Lords.</l>
            <l>Let him give over first, and then will I.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> spake. <hi>Ajax</hi> since you, said he,</l>
            <l>The Gods indued have with Strength and Wit,</l>
            <l>Let for to day the quarrel ended be.</l>

               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:93808:58"/>And give which side they please the Victory.</l>
            <l>For now 'tis late. To Night we must submit.</l>
            <l>That you the <hi>Greeks</hi> may cheer, and specially</l>
            <l>Your own friends, and companions at your Fleet:</l>
            <l>And I the <hi>Trojans</hi> from their fear relieve,</l>
            <l>And Wives, that for my safe return do pray.</l>
            <l>But come, let's t'one another Tokens give,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> seeing them may say,</l>
            <l>These two men fought and sought each others death,</l>
            <l>Yet parted friends. This said, he to him gave</l>
            <l>His Belt with his good Sword and Iv'ry Sheath;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> to him his shining Girdle brave.</l>
            <l>Thus parted, <hi>Ajax</hi> to the <hi>Argives</hi> went;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> back into the Troops of <hi>Troy</hi>;</l>
            <l>Who mightily rejoyc'd at the event</l>
            <l>That past all hope they saw him come away.</l>
            <l>The Lords conducted him to <hi>Ilium,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> to <hi>Agamemnon Ajax</hi> led.</l>
            <l>And when they all unto his Tent were come,</l>
            <l>He for them sacrific'd a Bull well fed.</l>
            <l>Which flay'd, divided, roasted, taken up</l>
            <l>The Carvers into Messes cut. This done</l>
            <l>King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and the Princes sup.</l>
            <l>The Chine at <hi>Ajax</hi> Table was set on.</l>
            <l>And when their thirst and hunger was subdu'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nestor</hi> whose counsel still had been the best,</l>
            <l>What further was to be consider'd shew'd,</l>
            <l>And to the Princes all his Speech addrest.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides,</hi> and you other Princes know</l>
            <l>How <hi>Mars</hi> with <hi>Argives</hi> strowed hath the Plain,</l>
            <l>And sent their Souls down to the Powr's below,</l>
            <l>Whose bloody Bodies in the Field remain.</l>
            <l>To morrow therefore let us cease from War,</l>
            <l>And early in the Morning fetch the dead,</l>
            <l>And burn them somewhere from the Ships not far,</l>
            <l>That t'<hi>Argos</hi> back they may be carried,</l>
            <l>When we depart from hence; that their Bones may</l>
            <l>By their own Friends and Children buried be.</l>
            <l>Let's raise a Mount upon the Shore of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>One for them all, for Passengers to see,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93808:59"/>And fortifie our good Ships with a Wall,</l>
            <l>And Turrets in it, and a Ditch without,</l>
            <l>Lest unawares the <hi>Trojans</hi> on us fall,</l>
            <l>And Gates for Charrets to go in and out.</l>
            <l>Mean while the <hi>Trojan</hi> Lords at Counsel were</l>
            <l>Loud and discordant. Then <hi>Antenor</hi> said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Trojans</hi> and Aids I pray to me give ear,</l>
            <l>For of the worst I greatly am affraid.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Menelaus</hi> have his Wife again,</l>
            <l>And all the goods she brought with her. Take heed;</l>
            <l>Against our Oath we shall but fight in vain.</l>
            <l>Then let her go, or never look to speed.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antenor</hi> (then said <hi>Paris</hi>) this is not</l>
            <l>The best advice you could have given, or</l>
            <l>(If what you say dissent not from your thought)</l>
            <l>You are not now so wise as heretofore</l>
            <l>Thus much to you. But to the <hi>Trojans</hi> this.</l>
            <l>Her wealth Ile render, with more of mine own.</l>
            <l>But my Wife <hi>Helen</hi> I will not dismiss.</l>
            <l>And when he that had said again sat down.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Priam</hi> rose: <hi>Trojans</hi> and Aids, said he,</l>
            <l>Now take your Supper as you us'd to do,</l>
            <l>And Sentinels set such as careful be;</l>
            <l>To morrow I will send <hi>Idaeus</hi> to</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> with <hi>Paris</hi> answer, and to try</l>
            <l>If they from Battle for so long will cease,</l>
            <l>That we may burn our slain men quietly,</l>
            <l>And fight again hereafter when they please.</l>
            <l>This said, the <hi>Trojans</hi> to their Suppers went.</l>
            <l>Next Morn <hi>Idaeus</hi> found the <hi>Argive</hi> Lords</l>
            <l>Together met at <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Tent,</l>
            <l>And coming in; unto them said these words.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides,</hi> and you <hi>Argives</hi> all, I come</l>
            <l>With Terms from <hi>Paris,</hi> and by <hi>Priam</hi> sent,</l>
            <l>On which you may depart from <hi>Ilium,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And end the War, if thereto you consent.</l>
            <l>The wealth which he with <hi>Helen</hi> brought ashore</l>
            <l>(I would before he brought it he had dy'd)</l>
            <l>To <hi>Menelaus</hi> he will give and more.</l>
            <l>But his wife <hi>Helen</hi> shall with him abide.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93808:59"/>Besides, the People have commanded me</l>
            <l>To ask you if you will the War suspend,</l>
            <l>Until our dead fetcht off and burned be,</l>
            <l>And after fight till <hi>Jove</hi> the War shall end.</l>
            <l>So said <hi>Idaeus.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> silent were</l>
            <l>A while. At last <hi>Tydides</hi> rose and spake.</l>
            <l>Let not the <hi>Greeks</hi> so much the <hi>Trojans</hi> fear</l>
            <l>As <hi>Helens</hi> goods, or her herself to take</l>
            <l>At <hi>Alexander</hi>'s hands. The hour is come</l>
            <l>(As any Child may manifestly see)</l>
            <l>That must orethrow the State of <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So said <hi>Tydides,</hi> and much prays'd was he.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> answer'd to <hi>Idaeus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>You hear what th'<hi>Argives</hi> say. I say the same.</l>
            <l>As for the dead men burn them if you please;</l>
            <l>They're good for nothing, I contented am.</l>
            <l>And of this Truce let <hi>Jove</hi> a witness be.</l>
            <l>This said, to <hi>Jove</hi> his Scepter up he heav'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idaeus</hi> back to <hi>Troy</hi> went speedily</l>
            <l>The Answer to relate he had receiv'd.</l>
            <l>Mean while the States of <hi>Troy</hi> in Councel sat,</l>
            <l>And there their Heralds coming back expected.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idaeus</hi> then went in, and told them that</l>
            <l>The offer made by <hi>Paris</hi> was rejected.</l>
            <l>But that a Truce was granted for a day.</l>
            <l>Next Morn the <hi>Trojans</hi> early as they cou'd</l>
            <l>Went some to th' field to fetch their dead away,</l>
            <l>And others to the Hill to fetch down wood.</l>
            <l>So did the <hi>Argives</hi> some to <hi>Ida</hi> go</l>
            <l>For wood, and others to the bloody field.</l>
            <l>But could not then distinguish friend from foe.</l>
            <l>But by and by the Sun began to guild</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Scamander</hi> Plain; then washt they off the gore</l>
            <l>And dust, and laid their dead men upon Carts.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Priam</hi> had forbidden them to roar,</l>
            <l>Or cry outright, though grieved at their hearts.</l>
            <l>When they had burnt them, back they went again.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> too, when they had consum'd with fire</l>
            <l>And done their lamentation for the slain,</l>
            <l>Unto their Ships did back again retire.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93808:60"/>But this th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> did at break of day,</l>
            <l>And rais'd one mighty Monument for all.</l>
            <l>And the incursion of the Foe to stay,</l>
            <l>Their Navy they inclosed with a Wall.</l>
            <l>With Turrets high and a great Ditch without,</l>
            <l>(Upon the sides whereof sharp Pales they fix)</l>
            <l>And Gates for Charrets to go in and out.</l>
            <l>And all the day thus toyling were the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Mean while the Gods together sat above,</l>
            <l>And wondring lookt upon this work of men;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Neptune</hi> then addrest his Speech to <hi>Jove.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>What mortals will the Gods consult agen?</l>
            <l>See you not what a Wall the <hi>Greeks</hi> have rear'd,</l>
            <l>And what a ditch about it made, said he,</l>
            <l>The same whereof 'mongst people will be heard</l>
            <l>As far as the Sun-beams extended be?</l>
            <l>Yet to the Gods they Hecatomb gave none.</l>
            <l>Whereas the Walls that I and <hi>Phoebus</hi> rais'd</l>
            <l>About the City for <hi>Laomedon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Obscur'd by this no longer will be prais'd.</l>
            <l>Then answer'd <hi>Jove. Neptune,</hi> I never thought</l>
            <l>That such a word would e're have come from you</l>
            <l>That have the pow'r to bring their work to nought.</l>
            <l>A lesser God might have complain'd, 'tis true;</l>
            <l>But of your pow'r <hi>Aurora</hi> sees no bound.</l>
            <l>Stay only till the <hi>Greeks</hi> be gone away;</l>
            <l>Then break their Wall, and throw it to the ground,</l>
            <l>And hide the place with Sand. Thus talked they.</l>
            <l>The Sun now set, and finisht was the Wall.</l>

            <l>And Wine they had great store from <hi>Lemnos</hi> sent.</l>
            <l>For Ships abundance laden were come in,</l>
            <l>Which by <hi>Euneus</hi> (th'Hero <hi>Jason</hi>'s Son</l>

            <l>For which the Army barter'd. Hides gave one,</l>

            <l>THe Morning now was quite display'd, and <hi>Jove</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Upon <hi>Olympus</hi> highest top was set:</l>
            <l>And all the Gods and Goddesses above</l>
            <l>By his command were there together met.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jupiter</hi> unto them speaking said,</l>
            <l>You Gods all and you Goddesses d'ye hear,</l>
            <l>Let none of you the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Trojans</hi> aid;</l>
            <l>I cannot do my work for you. Forbear.</l>
            <l>For whomsoever I assisting see</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> or the <hi>Trojans,</hi> be it known</l>
            <l>He wounded shall return and laught at be,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Shut in with Gates of Brass, as much below</l>
            <l>The common Hell, as 'tis from Hell to us.</l>
            <l>But if you will my pow'r by trial know,</l>
            <l>Put now into my hand a Chain of Gold,</l>
            <l>And let one end thereof lye on the plain,</l>
            <l>And all you Gods and Goddesses take hold;</l>

            <l>Do what you can, and Earth and Sea to boot,</l>
            <l>And let you hang there till my pow'r you see.</l>
            <l>The Gods were out of countenance at this,</l>
            <l>And to such mighty words durst not reply,</l>
            <l>Till <hi>Pallas</hi> said, Well known, O Father, is</l>
            <l>Your mighty Pow'r. But do not us deny,</l>
            <l>When we so many <hi>Argives</hi> falling see,</l>

            <l>And though in fight we no Assistants be,</l>

            <l>Dear Child (said <hi>Jove</hi>) it goes against my mind.</l>
            <l>I would not have my Orders disobey'd.</l>
            <l>'Tis granted though. For I'll to you be kind.</l>
            <l>This said, he set his Horses to his Charre,</l>
            <l>Hard hoof'd, swift-footed Horses two. Like Gold</l>
            <l>Their Mains profound well-combed shined farre.</l>
            <l>Then arm'd himself, and on the whip laid hold.</l>
            <l>No sooner had the Horses felt the Whip,</l>
            <l>But up they start, and 'twixt the Earth and Sky</l>
            <l>The winds themselves with swiftness they outstrip,</l>
            <l>And came unto the top of <hi>Ida</hi> high</l>
            <l>To <hi>Gargarus,</hi> and there <hi>Jove</hi> took them out,</l>
            <l>And hiding them with air on th'Hill sate down,</l>
            <l>And as he sat he cast his eyes about</l>
            <l>With great content upon the Fleet and Town.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> at their Tents short Break-fast make,</l>
            <l>And arm'd themselves assoon as they had done</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans,</hi> for their Wives and Childrens sake,</l>
            <l>(Though fewer) arm'd and made haste to be gone.</l>
            <l>Then open'd were the Gates, and to the Field</l>
            <l>Out came they Horse and Man; and being met,</l>
            <l>They Man to Man came up with Shield to Shield,</l>
            <l>And Spear to Spear; and on each other set.</l>
            <l>Some groan'd, some vaunted, mighty was the din</l>
            <l>Of those that kill, and those that falling cry.</l>
            <l>And this condition they continued in</l>
            <l>Until the Sun had mounted half the Sky.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> took up a pair of Scales of Gold,</l>
            <l>And weigh'd the fates of both the Nations,</l>
            <l>And equally suspended them did hold;</l>
            <l>But not so equal were their inclinations.</l>
            <l>For th'<hi>Argive</hi> Scale sat still upon the ground,</l>
            <l>While th'other lifted was up to the skies.</l>
            <l>Heaven and Earth did then with Thunder sound,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> threw Lightning in the <hi>Argives</hi> eyes.</l>
            <l>Then all the <hi>Greeks</hi> amazed ran away.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idomeneus</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ran;</l>
            <l>Nor either of the <hi>Ajaxes</hi> durst stay:</l>
            <l>Except old <hi>Nestor</hi> they fled ev'ry man.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:93808:62"/>And <hi>Nestor</hi> too had fled, had he known how:</l>
            <l>For of his Horses <hi>Paris</hi> one had shot,</l>
            <l>And pierc'd his Forehead just above the Brow</l>
            <l>Into the Brain, so that his Chariot</l>
            <l>Now useless was, and the Horse troublesome.</l>
            <l>Then cuts he th'Harness; but so long did stay,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Hector</hi> now was almost to him come,</l>
            <l>And th'Old man surely had been cast away,</l>
            <l>But that <hi>Tydides</hi> saw him in this pain,</l>
            <l>And terribly t'<hi>Ulysses</hi> cryed out,</l>
            <l>Whither d'ye fly <hi>Ulysses?</hi> Come again,</l>
            <l>Help to defend old <hi>Nestor</hi>; face about.</l>
            <l>While he said this, <hi>Ulysses</hi> still ran on,</l>
            <l>Not minding what he said. And <hi>Diomed,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To succour <hi>Nestor,</hi> to him went alone,</l>
            <l>And with him stood before his Chariots head,</l>
            <l>And said, O <hi>Nestor,</hi> youthful is the Foe</l>
            <l>That cometh on, and you now very old,</l>
            <l>Your Charioteer not strong, your Horses slow,</l>
            <l>Come up into my Charret, and behold</l>
            <l>My <hi>Trojan</hi> Horses how well they can run</l>
            <l>When there is cause t'approach or shun the fight.</l>
            <l>From <hi>Venus</hi> Son <hi>Aeneas</hi> I them won,</l>
            <l>A man of much experience in flight:</l>
            <l>Send back your Horses, and with mine we'll go</l>
            <l>And fight the <hi>Trojans.</hi> 'Twill not be amiss</l>
            <l>To let the mighty Champion <hi>Hector</hi> know,</l>
            <l>A Spear as mad is in my hand as his.</l>
            <l>This said, both <hi>Sthen'lus</hi> and <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With <hi>Nestor</hi>'s Horses went to <hi>Nestor</hi>'s Tent:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nestor</hi> and <hi>Diomed,</hi> both mounted on</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> Charret, up to <hi>Hector</hi> went.</l>
            <l>And when they were to one another near,</l>
            <l>At <hi>Hector Diomedes</hi> threw in haste,</l>
            <l>And miss'd of him, and kill'd his Charioteer;</l>
            <l>Clean through his Breast the Spear well driven past.</l>
            <l>Down dead he fell, but <hi>Hector</hi> lets him lye,</l>
            <l>And turns aside to seek a Charioteer</l>
            <l>The place of <hi>Heniopeus</hi> to supply.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Archeptolemus</hi> then being near,</l>

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93808:62"/>(Call'd up by <hi>Hector</hi>) on the Reins laid hold.</l>
            <l>Then mighty work and slaughter there had been,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Trojans</hi> shut like Lambs within a Fold</l>
            <l>In <hi>Troy,</hi> but that it was by <hi>Jove</hi> foreseen.</l>
            <l>For in a Clap of Thunder <hi>Jove</hi> down threw</l>
            <l>His Bolt at <hi>Diomedes</hi> Horses feet.</l>
            <l>And th'Earth with Sulphur flaming looked blew.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nestor</hi> himself astonish'd was to see't;</l>
            <l>Lets go the Reins, and down the Horses fell.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Nestor</hi> then to <hi>Diomedes</hi> said,</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>Jove</hi> (you see) that doth our force repel,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> (for this day) intends to aid.</l>
            <l>Another day to us he will be kind,</l>
            <l>If he see cause; for no man can him tie,</l>
            <l>Nor able is to make him change his mind.</l>
            <l>And therefore now our best course is to flie.</l>
            <l>'Tis true, O <hi>Nestor</hi> (said <hi>Tydides</hi> then)</l>
            <l>But what a pain then at my heart will lie,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Hector</hi> speaking to the <hi>Trojan</hi> men,</l>
            <l>Shall brag he made <hi>Tydides</hi> from him flie?</l>
            <l>Then should I wish the Earth would swallow me.</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Hector</hi> saies so (<hi>Nestor</hi> then reply'd)</l>
            <l>Believed by the <hi>Trojans</hi> 'twill not be,</l>
            <l>So many of them by your hand have dy'd.</l>
            <l>And at this word his Steeds he turn'd about.</l>
            <l>A show'r of Spears then from the <hi>Trojans</hi> flies,</l>
            <l>Who them pursued with a mighty shout.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> loud unto <hi>Tydides</hi> cries,</l>
            <l>Ho! <hi>Diomed,</hi> by th'<hi>Argives</hi> honoured</l>
            <l>Above the most, serv'd with a greater Mess,</l>
            <l>And higher Seat, and Wine unlimited,</l>
            <l>You will hereafter be esteemed less.</l>
            <l>Unmanly <hi>Diomed.</hi> Fly, Baggage, fly.</l>

            <l>This said, <hi>Tydides</hi> was a while in doubt</l>
            <l>Whether to turn or no and <hi>Hector</hi> meet,</l>
            <l>And thrice to turn his Horses was about,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> thrice thund'ring turn'd them tow'rd the Fleet,</l>

               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93808:63"/>Shewing that he the honour of that day</l>

            <l>At <hi>Hectors</hi> speech <hi>Juno</hi> upon her Throne</l>

            <l>And sure I am you wish them victory.</l>
            <l>What! Cannot we who with the <hi>Argives</hi> side,</l>

               <hi>Juno</hi> (said <hi>Neptune</hi> griev'd) these words are bold.</l>
            <l>I'll not rebel. For we shall have the worst;</l>
            <l>And so we have by <hi>Jupiter</hi> been told.</l>

            <l>Was ever King afflicted as I am,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Jove,</hi> or lost a Victory so near?</l>
            <l>And yet at all your Altars as I came,</l>
            <l>My Sacrifices duly payed were,</l>
            <l>In hope that I the Town of <hi>Troy</hi> should sack.</l>
            <l>But grant at least, O <hi>Jove,</hi> that we may come</l>
            <l>Our selves into <hi>Achaea</hi> safely back,</l>
            <l>And not be here destroy'd at <hi>Ilium.</hi>

            <l>This said, <hi>Jove</hi> grants them safely to depart.</l>

            </l>
            <l>And brought the tender issue of a Hart,</l>
            <l>And near unto his Altar dropt the same.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> when they saw the Bird of <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Were to the Fight again encouraged,</l>

            <l>And he that first came forth was <hi>Diomed.</hi>

            <l>Had any slain, he killed <hi>Agelaus,</hi>

            <l>Whom with his Spear he pierc'd from Back to Breast,</l>

            </l>
            <l>His mighty Brother to the Field he went,</l>

            <l>As Children to their Mothers, back he ran,</l>
            <l>And hid himself behind his Brothers Shield.</l>
            <l>How many were the men he killed thus?</l>
            <l>Orsilochus, Ophlestus, Lycophon,</l>

            <l>All those lay dead together on the Sands.</l>

            <l>By <hi>Teucer</hi>'s Arrows on the <hi>Trojans</hi> Bands,</l>
            <l>He to him came, and said, O valiant Son</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Telamon,</hi> so so your Shafts bestow,</l>
            <l>Unto the <hi>Argives</hi> all an honour be,</l>

            <l>Unto your Mother marry'd not was he,</l>
            <l>Yet has he still maintain'd you as his own.</l>
            <l>And if it please <hi>Jove</hi> and the Pow'rs divine</l>
            <l>To make me once the Master of this Town,</l>
            <l>Your share shall be the next set out to mine,</l>
            <l>And to your honour shall receive from me</l>
            <l>A Tripod, and two Horses with the Charre,</l>
            <l>Or if you will, your bed shall honour'd be</l>
            <l>With some fair Woman taken in the war.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Teucer</hi> to this then answer made and said,</l>
            <l>Of this encouragement no need have I.</l>
            <l>Since we came forth I have no time delaid,</l>
            <l>But done as much as in my pow'r did lie.</l>

            <l>Of this mad dog I miss I know not how.</l>
            <l>Then took he out another Arrow keen,</l>

               <hi>Teucer</hi> the while again his Bow had bent,</l>
            <l>But drawing did so long, and aiming stand,</l>
            <l>The Stone from <hi>Hector</hi> th'Arrow did prevent.</l>
            <l>And near the Shoulder on the Breast him struck.</l>
            <l>And broken was the Bow-string with the blow,</l>
            <l>And his benummed Arm all sense forsook,</l>
            <l>And sinking on his Knees he dropt the Bow.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Ajax</hi> stept before him with his Shield.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Mecistheus</hi> and <hi>Alastor</hi> him convey'd</l>
            <l>Unto the <hi>Argive</hi> Ships from off the Field,</l>
            <l>Grievously bruised, groaning and dismaid.</l>
            <l>The courage of the <hi>Trojans</hi> now renew'd,</l>
            <l>They chas'd the <hi>Argives</hi> back unto their Wall,</l>
            <l>And till the Trenches they had past, pursu'd,</l>

            <l>As when a Hound pursueth a wild Bore,</l>
            <l>Or Lion, and presuming on his Feet</l>

            <l>And many of them had the <hi>Trojans</hi> slain</l>
            <l>Ere they the Trenches and the Pale had past.</l>
            <l>But being in they there themselves contain.</l>
            <l>And comfort one another all they can,</l>
            <l>And to the Gods and Goddesses they pray,</l>
            <l>Lifting their hands to Heaven every man,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> then turn'd off and went his way.</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Juno</hi> seeing, unto <hi>Pallas</hi> said,</l>
            <l>Daughter of <hi>Jupiter</hi> do you not see</l>
            <l>What <hi>Greeks</hi> one mad man <hi>Hector</hi> has destroy'd?</l>
            <l>Shall we sit still in this extremity?</l>
            <l>To <hi>Juno</hi> then <hi>Athena</hi> thus reply'd,</l>
            <l>Had not my Fathers wits been at a loss,</l>
            <l>This furious <hi>Hector</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> had dy'd.</l>
            <l>But he my counsel alwaies loves to cross.</l>
            <l>He has forgot how oft his Son I sav'd</l>
            <l>Oppressed by <hi>Euristheus</hi> tyranny.</l>
            <l>For alwaies when his Fathers help he crav'd,</l>
            <l>Down to the Earth from Heaven sent was I.</l>
            <l>But had I known as much as I do now,</l>
            <l>When for the Dog he went to <hi>Pluto</hi>'s gate,</l>
            <l>He had for me till this time staid below,</l>
            <l>And by the odious <hi>Styx</hi> for ever sate.</l>
            <l>But now he hates me. And by <hi>Thetis</hi> led,</l>
            <l>He must <hi>Achilles</hi> honour. But my hope is,</l>
            <l>The time will come I shall be favoured</l>
            <l>By him again, and call'd his dear <hi>Glaucopis.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But make you ready now your Chariot,</l>
            <l>While I put on my Arms; that we may see</l>
            <l>If <hi>Hector</hi> will thereof be glad or not,</l>
            <l>Or if some <hi>Trojans</hi> rather shall not be</l>
            <l>Left dead for Dogs and Vulturs to devour.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Juno</hi> to her Charre the Horses brought.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Jove</hi>'s house <hi>Pallas</hi> went, and on the floor</l>
            <l>Threw down her long Robe, and put on <hi>Jove</hi>'s Coat.</l>
            <l>And then her Breast with Armour covered,</l>
            <l>And on her Shoulder hung her fearful Shield.</l>
            <l>Then took her heavy Spear with Brazen head,</l>
            <l>Wherewith she breaketh Squadrons in the Field.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:93808:65"/>Then open of it self flew Heaven-gate,</l>
            <l>(Though to the Seasons <hi>Jove</hi> the power gave</l>
            <l>Alone to judge of early and of late)</l>
            <l>And out the Goddesses the Horses drave.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> to <hi>Iris</hi> said, Go, to them speak.</l>
            <l>Tell them an ill match they will have of me.</l>
            <l>I'll lame their Horses and their Charret break,</l>
            <l>Unto the ground they both shall tumbled be;</l>
            <l>And with my Thunder wounded shall be so,</l>
            <l>That ten years after they shall not be well.</l>
            <l>For I would have <hi>Glaucopis</hi> well to know</l>
            <l>What 'tis against her Father to rebel.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Juno</hi> is so us'd to cross my will,</l>
            <l>That towards her my anger is the less.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Iris</hi> went her way from <hi>Ida</hi> hill,</l>
            <l>And near <hi>Olympus</hi> met the Goddesses,</l>
            <l>And as she bidden was did to them speak,</l>
            <l>What fury's this? Whither d'ye go, said she.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> will your Horses lame, your Charret break,</l>
            <l>And to the ground you both will tumbled be,</l>
            <l>And with his Thunder wounded will be so,</l>
            <l>That ten years after you will not be well.</l>
            <l>For you <hi>Glaucopis</hi> he will make to know</l>
            <l>What 'tis against your Father to rebel.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Juno</hi> is so us'd to cross his will</l>
            <l>That he affronts from her can better bear;</l>
            <l>But <hi>Pallas,</hi> at your hands he takes it ill</l>
            <l>That you should dare against him lift a Spear.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Iris,</hi> her errant done, no longer stay'd,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Minerva</hi> thus said <hi>Juno</hi> then,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> shall no more for me be disobey'd,</l>
            <l>By taking part in War with mortal men.</l>
            <l>But let One live, and let another die,</l>
            <l>As by the chance of War it shall fall out,</l>
            <l>And let him do what he thinks Equity.</l>
            <l>This said, her Chariot she turn'd about.</l>
            <l>The Horses by the Seasons freed and fed,</l>
            <l>The Charret was set up against the Wall.</l>
            <l>The Goddesses themselves then entered,</l>

            <l>The Charret he set to the Altar near</l>

               <hi>Juno,</hi> said he, and <hi>Pallas,</hi> why so sad?</l>
            <l>Your fight against the <hi>Trojans</hi> was not long.</l>
            <l>And more you had been vexed if it had;</l>
            <l>So much for th'other Gods I am too strong.</l>
            <l>The danger scarce begun was when you fled.</l>
            <l>But had you dar'd the Battle to maintain,</l>
            <l>You had been by my hand so thundered,</l>
            <l>You never had t'<hi>Olympus</hi> come again.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Juno</hi> at this and <hi>Pallas</hi> grumbling sate,</l>

            <l>But <hi>Juno</hi> was not able to contain.</l>
            <l>O cruel <hi>Jove,</hi> said she, what words are these?</l>
            <l>Must we unto our friends be so ingrate,</l>

            <l>For <hi>Hector</hi> shall not be by me controul'd</l>
            <l>Until <hi>Achilles</hi> be fetch'd back again,</l>

            <l>Hear me you <hi>Trojans</hi> and you Aids, said he,</l>
            <l>I thought we should have now the <hi>Greeks</hi> destroy'd,</l>
            <l>And lodged in the Town with Victory.</l>
            <l>But this my hope is by the Night made void,</l>
            <l>Nor can we help it. Let us now provide</l>
            <l>(For Supper) Beeves and Sheep, &amp; Wine and Bread</l>
            <l>From <hi>Troy</hi>; and let the Horses be unty'd,</l>
            <l>And care be taken that they be well fed.</l>
            <l>Then fetch in wood, and fires abundance make,</l>
            <l>That with the flame lightned may be the Sky,</l>
            <l>Lest th'<hi>Argives</hi> in the dark advantage take,</l>
            <l>To go aboard and safe to <hi>Argos</hi> fly.</l>
            <l>Let them imbark at least in haste, and bear</l>
            <l>Along with them their wounds uncured home,</l>
            <l>That others who shall see't may stand in fear,</l>
            <l>And say, This 'tis to fight 'gainst <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And let great Boys and old Men all night wake</l>
            <l>Upon the Walls and Tow'rs, and Guards be set,</l>
            <l>And every Wife at home a great fire make,</l>
            <l>Lest into <hi>Troy</hi> the Foe by Treason get.</l>
            <l>This (valiant <hi>Trojans</hi>) let be done to night.</l>
            <l>To morrow I shall further order give.</l>
            <l>I doubt not but to put these Dogs to flight</l>
            <l>By th' help of <hi>Jove,</hi> and <hi>Ilium</hi> relieve.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:93808:67"/>But while 'tis Night have on your Guards a care,</l>
            <l>To morrow early arm your selves for fight.</l>
            <l>For to the <hi>Argive</hi> Ships I'll bring the War,</l>
            <l>And trial make of <hi>Diomedes</hi> might,</l>
            <l>If from the Ships he drive me shall away,</l>
            <l>Or with my Spear I him shall overthrow</l>
            <l>And send his bloody Armour into <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To morrow he his strength will better know.</l>
            <l>I would I were as certain not to die,</l>
            <l>And of old age live still free from the sorrow,</l>
            <l>As <hi>Phoebus</hi> and <hi>Athena</hi> do, as I</l>
            <l>Am sure we shall defeat these <hi>Greeks</hi> to morrow.</l>
            <l>Thus ended he. The <hi>Trojans</hi> full of joy</l>
            <l>Their sweating Horses soon took out and fed,</l>
            <l>And some were sent into the Town of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To bring in Beeves and Sheep, and Wine and Bread,</l>
            <l>While others fetcht in Wood. Then to the Sky</l>
            <l>Arose the pleasant vapour of the Rost.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> confident of Victory</l>
            <l>Sat chearful at their Arms throughout the Host.</l>
            <l>As many Stars as in a Heav'n serene</l>
            <l>Together with the Moon appear i'th' Night,</l>
            <l>When all the tops of Hills and Woods are seen,</l>
            <l>And joyful are the Shepherds at the sight:</l>
            <l>So many seem'd the Fires upon the Plain.</l>
            <l>A thousand Fires, and at each fifty men,</l>
            <l>That by their Horses there all night remain</l>

            <l>Distracted was with fear the <hi>Argive</hi> Host,</l>
            <l>And their Commanders; as when two Winds meet,</l>
            <l>The Sea between them into heaps is tost.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi> grieved at the heart,</l>
            <l>Bad th'Heralds forthwith to th'Assembly call</l>
            <l>The prime Commanders ev'ry one apart,</l>
            <l>And not make proclamation once for all;</l>
            <l>And some of them himself he summoned.</l>
            <l>When met were all the Leaders of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They sat them down with hearts discouraged,</l>
            <l>And tears ran down on <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Cheeks.</l>
            <l>As Springs of Water issue from a Rock,</l>
            <l>So fell the tears from <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s eyes.</l>
            <l>And to th'Assembly thus he weeping spoke.</l>
            <l>My friends what help can any man devise?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> told me I should conquer <hi>Ilium,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And unto <hi>Argos</hi> safe return agen,</l>
            <l>And now deceiv'd me has, and sends me home</l>
            <l>With shame when I have lost so many men.</l>
            <l>And thus he loves to do to shew his might.</l>
            <l>Therefore my Counsel <hi>Argives</hi> all obey:</l>
            <l>Let's hoise our Sails and save our selves by flight;</l>
            <l>For we shall never take the Town of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>This said, the Princes long time silent sit.</l>
            <l>At last <hi>Tydides</hi> rising thus reply'd,</l>

            <l>Before the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as old and young well know.</l>

            <l>But has deny'd you a couragious Spirit,</l>
            <l>Which now is the most necessary thing.</l>
            <l>You think too meanly of your peoples merit;</l>
            <l>As for your self, if you will needs away,</l>
            <l>Go. That's your way. Your Ships there ready lye</l>
            <l>That from <hi>Mycene</hi> brought you unto <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But leave the rest their fortune here to try.</l>
            <l>If none else stay, yet <hi>Sthenelus</hi> and I</l>

            <l>To what side <hi>Jove</hi> will give the Victory.</l>
            <l>The Gods (I'm sure) will favour to us show.</l>
            <l>This Speech the Lords commended very much.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Nestor</hi> rose and to <hi>Tydides</hi> said,</l>
            <l>There is not of your age another such,</l>
            <l>For Counsel wise, in Battle not affraid.</l>
            <l>None will deny but what you say is right;</l>
            <l>But you have not said all you could have done;</l>
            <l>And no great wonder, since for age you might</l>
            <l>(So young you are) have been my youngest Son.</l>
            <l>Yet the advice you given have is best;</l>
            <l>I that am elder what wants will supply,</l>
            <l>Adding thereto what you have not exprest,</l>
            <l>To take from <hi>Agamemnon</hi> all reply.</l>
            <l>For none but such as have no Law, nor Kin,</l>
            <l>Nor House, in civil discord can delight.</l>
            <l>But let us first our chiefest work begin,</l>
            <l>And make the Youngmen keep good watch all Night.</l>
            <l>And let them all from you <hi>(Atrides)</hi> take</l>
            <l>Their Orders. For you are our General.</l>
            <l>And for the Princes a good Supper make,</l>
            <l>And all the eldest Captains to it call.</l>
            <l>It best becomes you that can do it best.</l>

            <l>So many Ships you have to bring in more.</l>
            <l>Hear their advice, and do what you think fit.</l>
            <l>Good Counsel now we need the most of all,</l>

            <l>The seven Captains of the Watch were these.</l>
            <l>And with each one an hundred Spearmen went</l>
            <l>Betwixt the Pale and Wall, and supped there.</l>
            <l>And the old Leaders t'<hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Tent,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Nestor</hi> his Counsel further open laid,</l>
            <l>Which formerly had alwaies been the best;</l>

            <l>King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> I'll with you begin,</l>
            <l>And with you end, since you the Scepter bear,</l>
            <l>And in your care it lies to lose or win.</l>
            <l>You chiefly should good Counsel give and hear.</l>
            <l>Hear then what now is my opinion,</l>
            <l>Than which a better I think you'll not find,</l>
            <l>Nor is it now the first time thought upon.</l>
            <l>But heretofore I was of the same mind,</l>
            <l>When from <hi>Achilles</hi> you <hi>Briseis</hi> took,</l>
            <l>And I advised you to let her stay,</l>
            <l>Though my good Counsel then you could not brook,</l>
            <l>But to your own great heart too much gave way,</l>
            <l>Dishonouring the man of greatest might</l>
            <l>In all the Army, and most honoured</l>
            <l>By all the Gods, and contrary to Right</l>
            <l>Taking the Prize which he had purchased.</l>
            <l>So that the bus'ness we have now to do</l>
            <l>Is how to reconcile him if we can,</l>
            <l>What Gifts to give him, who shall with them go,</l>
            <l>And with sweet language pacifie the man.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Atrides</hi> penitent reply'd,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Nestor,</hi> all you charge me with is true,</l>
            <l>And for <hi>Achilles</hi> sake ('tis not deny'd)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> does th'<hi>Achaean</hi> Army now subdue.</l>

            <l>And send a noble Present to his Tent.</l>

            <l>I think not poor, but Gold may quickly win,</l>
            <l>When I consider with their nimble feet</l>

            <l>And Women seven, the best of women kind</l>
            <l>For Beauty and for works of Houswifery.</l>
            <l>And unto these <hi>Briseis</hi> shall be joyn'd,</l>

            <l>The next thing to be thought upon and weigh'd,</l>

            <l>I think that <hi>Phoenix</hi> ought to lead the way,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Ulysses,</hi> and with these</l>

            <l>This said by <hi>Nestor</hi> all the rest approve.</l>
            <l>When water was brought in they wash'd and pray'd;</l>
            <l>The Youngmen fill'd the Temperers with Wine;</l>
            <l>And round about the full Cups were convey'd,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> sat before him looking when</l>

               <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Phoenix.</hi> And <hi>Achilles</hi> then</l>
            <l>Leapt up as one that had surprized been.</l>
            <l>And them receiving kindly to them said,</l>
            <l>Welcome my friends, what ere your bus'ness be.</l>
            <l>To see you I am not a little joy'd,</l>
            <l>Although th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> have provoked me.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:93808:70"/>And to his friend <hi>Patroclus</hi> order gave.</l>
            <l>A larger Temperer (said he) set up,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> did so. And sets on a Pot</l>
            <l>Upon the flaming fire, and puts into't</l>
            <l>A good Sheeps Chine, another of a Goat,</l>
            <l>Besides the Chine of a fat Bore to boot.</l>
            <l>The Blood boyl'd out <hi>Automedon</hi> it takes</l>
            <l>And holds it to <hi>Achilles</hi> to divide,</l>
            <l>Who of it many equal portions makes.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> makes a fire of wood well dry'd;</l>
            <l>And when the flame was spent, the Coals he rakes</l>
            <l>Till they lay even; Then the meat he spits</l>
            <l>And rostes; and when 'twas roasted up it takes,</l>
            <l>And on clean Dresser-boards the same he sets;</l>
            <l>And brought (in Baskets) to the Table Bread;</l>
            <l>And by <hi>Achilles</hi> was set on the Meat.</l>
            <l>Who when he saw the Table furnished</l>
            <l>Over against <hi>Ulysses</hi> took his Seat.</l>
            <l>And bad <hi>Patroclus</hi> sacrifice, who then</l>
            <l>The first cut took and threw into the fire,</l>

            <l>But when of food they had no more desire,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Ajax Phoenix</hi> jog'd, which was the signe</l>
            <l>When to begin, for which <hi>Ulysses</hi> staid.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> then fill'd up his Cup with Wine,</l>

            <l>My Son, said he, (when you took leave for <hi>Troy</hi>)</l>
            <l>May <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Athena</hi> strengthen you.</l>
            <l>But this one Lesson take from me. I pray</l>

            <l>Decline all contestation of the Tongue,</l>
            <l>And let your Conversation gentle be.</l>
            <l>So shall you win the hearts of old and young</l>
            <l>In the <hi>Achaean</hi> Host. Thus counsell'd he.</l>
            <l>Though you have this forgot, yet now be friends,</l>
            <l>And since he sorry is, forget th'offence</l>
            <l>And take the Gifts he offers for amends,</l>
            <l>Which we esteem a worthy recompence.</l>
            <l>I'll name the Gifts he offers one by one.</l>
            <l>Seven fire-new Trevets. Talents ten of Gold.</l>
            <l>Twenty black Cauldrons. Twelve Steeds that have won</l>

            <l>I think not poor, but Gold will quickly win,</l>
            <l>When I consider with their nimble feet</l>

            <l>What once I say I'll do. Those men I hate</l>
            <l>Whose Tongues and Hearts I find to disagree,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Since they my labour do so ill requite,</l>

            <l>With me as with a Bird i'th' field it fares,</l>

            <l>She has it in her mouth and hungry is,</l>
            <l>Yet she forbears and gives it them to eat.</l>
            <l>With the <hi>Atrides</hi> twain my case is this.</l>
            <l>In blood by day I lead a weary life,</l>
            <l>And sleepless am the great'st part of the night.</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> must against the <hi>Trojans</hi> fight.</l>
            <l>I did so; and from <hi>Troy</hi> twelve Cities won</l>
            <l>Upon the Shore i'th' Land eleven more,</l>

            <l>A small part he divided 'mongst the Host.</l>

            <l>But to himself made sure to keep the most.</l>
            <l>And firm is whatsoere he gave the rest.</l>

            <l>I am content, and let him keep her still.</l>
            <l>And her enjoy. But why then came to <hi>Troy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> with such strength? What was his will?</l>
            <l>Was it not only for fair <hi>Helens</hi> sake?</l>
            <l>What then must no man love his Wife but they?</l>
            <l>Yes, all men of their own Wives much should make,</l>
            <l>If they have either wit or honesty.</l>
            <l>And I love mine as well as he loves his,</l>

            <l>When thus <hi>Ulysses</hi> ended had his story,</l>
            <l>All silent were a while and much dismai'd</l>
            <l>With his denial flat and peremptory.</l>
            <l>At last <hi>Tydides</hi> to them spake and said,</l>
            <l>O King <hi>Atrides,</hi> we have done amiss</l>
            <l>With Gifts and Prayers thus to seek his aid,</l>
            <l>That proud before, by this made prouder is.</l>
            <l>Let him go when he will. Be not afraid,</l>
            <l>But let's refresh our selves to night with Bread</l>
            <l>And Wine. For that gives men both strength &amp; heart,</l>
            <l>And see your men i'th' morn imbattelled,</l>
            <l>And at the head of them do you your part.</l>
            <l>This said, the Princes of the Hoast admir'd</l>
            <l>The gallant Speech of valiant <hi>Diomed</hi>:</l>
            <l>And every one unto his Tent retir'd,</l>
            <l>With a good will to sleep, and went to bed.</l>

            <l>ALl night the Princes of the <hi>Argives</hi> slept,</l>
            <l>Save <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> who could take no rest,</l>
            <l>But with unquiet thoughts was waking kept,</l>
            <l>And casting for his safety what was best.</l>
            <l>And frequent as the Lightning flashes are</l>
            <l>When <hi>Jove</hi> is making Rain or Hail i'th' Skies,</l>
            <l>Or somewhere punishing the proud by War;</l>
            <l>So frequent then were <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s sighs.</l>
            <l>And when the fires he saw upon the Plain</l>
            <l>Made by the Foe, and th'Acclamation</l>
            <l>And Shouts he heard, he wondred. But again</l>
            <l>When he his Ships and People look'd upon,</l>
            <l>Then by the roots he pluck'd off from his Head</l>
            <l>Handfuls of Hair, and sigh'd and groaned more;</l>
            <l>And thought it best then to be counselled</l>
            <l>By <hi>Nestor</hi> how he might himself restore.</l>
            <l>And rising up his Coat he first puts on,</l>
            <l>And to his smooth white feet his Shoes he ty'd;</l>
            <l>And then above his Coat, he cast upon</l>
            <l>His Back a great and tawny Lions hide.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Menelaus</hi> too that waking lay</l>
            <l>And trembling in his bed all night, for fear</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> that for his sake were come to <hi>Troy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Should fall into some great disaster there,</l>
            <l>Rose up and to his Brothers Tent went in.</l>
            <l>A Spear he had in's hand, and armed was,</l>
            <l>Having upon his back a Leopards skin</l>
            <l>And on his Head a Helmet good of Brass.</l>
            <l>And said to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> Brother, Why</l>
            <l>So early up? Have you a mind to send</l>
            <l>Into the Army of the Foe some Spy?</l>
            <l>I fear you will not find so bold a friend</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:93808:76"/>As thither dares to go i'th' night alone.</l>
            <l>Brother (said <hi>Agamemnon</hi>) you and I</l>
            <l>Must better counsel take than we have done,</l>
            <l>Since <hi>Jove</hi> now favoureth the Enemy,</l>
            <l>And takes in <hi>Hector</hi>'s Sacrifice delight.</l>
            <l>For so much harm so soon was never done</l>
            <l>As he to us has done in one days fight;</l>
            <l>Yet nor of God nor Goddess is the Son.</l>
            <l>His this days Acts the <hi>Greeks</hi> will ne'er forget.</l>
            <l>But go you to the Princes quickly. Run.</l>
            <l>Call up <hi>Idomeneus</hi> the King of <hi>Creet,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And the great <hi>Ajax</hi> Son of <hi>Telamon.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>While I call <hi>Nestor</hi> up and bring him to</l>
            <l>The place which is appointed for the guard,</l>
            <l>T'instruct the men with what they have to do,</l>
            <l>Because his Counsel they will most regard.</l>
            <l>For by his Son the Watch commanded is,</l>
            <l>And with him we <hi>Meriones</hi> have join'd.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Menelaus</hi> farther askt him this</l>
            <l>(That he might fully understand his mind)</l>
            <l>When they are call'd, what next is to be done?</l>
            <l>Must I stay here till you come back again,</l>
            <l>Or after you about the Army run?</l>
            <l>No, no, said he, where you are now, remain.</l>
            <l>But going call upon each one aloud,</l>
            <l>And by the name he from his Father takes,</l>
            <l>And praise them all, let them not think you proud;</l>
            <l>Pain is no shame when 'tis for our own sakes.</l>
            <l>This said they part, and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> went</l>
            <l>To seek out <hi>Nestor</hi>; whom he found abed,</l>
            <l>And all his Armour by him in his Tent,</l>
            <l>His Shield, two Spears, and Helmet for his Head,</l>
            <l>And Belt of many Colours finely wrought,</l>
            <l>Which alwaies he was wont in War to use</l>
            <l>When he his people unto Battle brought.</l>
            <l>No Labour would he on his age excuse.</l>
            <l>Now raised on his Elbow, Who, said he,</l>
            <l>Are you that walk abroad when others sleep?</l>
            <l>Stay there I say and come no nearer me,</l>
            <l>Until your name you tell, at distance keep.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:93808:77"/>Seek you some Officer or Camerade?</l>
            <l>I <hi>Agamemnon</hi> am, said he, your friend</l>
            <l>Whom <hi>Jove</hi> to bear such miseries hath made</l>
            <l>As while I live will never have an end;</l>
            <l>And in my bed no sleep at all I take</l>
            <l>For fear of some unfortunate event.</l>
            <l>Unsetled is my Heart, my Limbs all shake,</l>
            <l>And in this plight I wandred to your Tent:</l>
            <l>And now I pray you, since you waking lye</l>
            <l>Come with me to the Watch; for since the Foe</l>
            <l>Unto our Wall encamped is so nigh,</l>
            <l>They charge us may by night for ought we know.</l>
            <l>To this old <hi>Nestor</hi> answer made and said,</l>
            <l>Think not <hi>Atrides Jove</hi> will all things do</l>
            <l>As they are now in <hi>Hector</hi>'s fancy laid?</l>
            <l>For harder work he would be put unto</l>
            <l>If we <hi>Achilles</hi> can but once appease.</l>
            <l>But go, I'll follow you, and call upon</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> if you please,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> the less, and <hi>Meges Phyleus</hi> Son.</l>
            <l>I wish some other man of nimbler feet</l>
            <l>Were to great <hi>Ajax</hi> sent to make him rise,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Idomeneus</hi> the King of <hi>Crete,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whose quarter from this place a great way lyes.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Menelaus</hi> I intend to chide,</l>
            <l>That sleeps and leaves the work to you alone.</l>
            <l>'Tis no fit time within his Tent t'abide,</l>
            <l>But to the Princes should himself have gone.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Nestor Agamemnon</hi> then reply'd,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Nestor,</hi> he is often negligent,</l>
            <l>And often I have pray'd you him to chide.</l>
            <l>Yet 'tis not sloth; but my Commandement</l>
            <l>He always looks for though there be no cause.</l>
            <l>And yet to night he has prevented me.</l>
            <l>For up and arm'd before me now he was;</l>
            <l>And when he came I sent him presently</l>
            <l>To call up <hi>Ajax</hi> and the King of <hi>Creet.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And at the Watch we both of them shall see,</l>
            <l>Where I appointed have the rest to meet.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nestor</hi> again reply'd. 'Tis well, said he,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:93808:77"/>The <hi>Greeks</hi> will of him have a better thought,</l>
            <l>And readier obedience he will find.</l>
            <l>This said, he put himself into his Coat,</l>
            <l>And ty'd his Shooes on, and his Cloak well lin'd,</l>
            <l>And took his Spear in hand. Then on they went</l>
            <l>Amongst the <hi>Argive</hi> Ships upon the sand.</l>
            <l>And when they came unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> Tent,</l>
            <l>To call and waken him, they made a stand.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Nestor</hi> with his voice stretcht to the height</l>
            <l>Call'd to him by his name. <hi>Ulysses</hi> streight</l>
            <l>Came forth and said, Why come you in the night?</l>
            <l>Your bus'ness sure must be of mighty we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ght.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Laërtiades,</hi> said <hi>Nestor</hi> then,</l>
            <l>Take it not ill. Such is our misery.</l>
            <l>But come with us to call up other men,</l>
            <l>That we may Counsel take to fight or fly.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> then return'd into his Tent,</l>
            <l>And on his shoulder hung his painted Shield;</l>
            <l>And with them first to <hi>Diomed</hi> he went</l>
            <l>Whom they found armed in the open field,</l>
            <l>His Soldiers sleeping lay about him round,</l>
            <l>And on his Buckler each one had his head,</l>
            <l>The Butt-ends of their Spears sixt in the ground,</l>
            <l>Whereof the points like Lightning glittered.</l>
            <l>But he himself slept on a good Cow-hide,</l>
            <l>His Head upon a gaudy Carpet laid.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Nestor</hi> came and standing at his side</l>
            <l>Awakt him with his foot and to him said,</l>
            <l>Awake <hi>Tydides,</hi> hear you not how nigh</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> are encamped to the Fleet?</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Tydides</hi> leapt up suddenly,</l>
            <l>And when he raised was upon his feet,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nestor</hi> (said he) unhappy restless man</l>
            <l>That aged as you are take not your ease,</l>
            <l>When younger men there are that better can</l>
            <l>Call up the <hi>Argive</hi> Princes if they please.</l>
            <l>'Tis true (said <hi>Nestor</hi>) I have at my Tent</l>
            <l>Sons of my own, and others can command,</l>
            <l>Who might upon such Errands have been sent,</l>
            <l>But that upon the very brink we stand</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:93808:78"/>Of Life and Death. And since you pity me,</l>
            <l>Call little <hi>Ajax</hi> up, and <hi>Phyleus</hi> Son.</l>
            <l>For young you are, and can do't easilie.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> then a Lions skin puts on</l>
            <l>Tauny and reaching to his heels, and then</l>
            <l>Into his hand he took a heavy Spear,</l>
            <l>And out he went and called up those men.</l>
            <l>When to the Watch they come together were,</l>
            <l>The Captains of the Watch were not asleep,</l>
            <l>But all were sitting at their Arms awake.</l>
            <l>As Dogs that guarding are a Fold of Sheep</l>
            <l>Hearing the noise the Hounds and Hunters make</l>
            <l>When in the Woods they chace some savage beast,</l>
            <l>And nearer still and nearer hear the cries,</l>
            <l>They doubt the worst, and cannot take their rest,</l>
            <l>But list'ning stand and sleep forsakes their eyes;</l>
            <l>So watchfully spent they the tedious night,</l>
            <l>And ever when of Feet they heard the tread</l>
            <l>'Twixt them and <hi>Troy,</hi> that way they turn'd their sight;</l>
            <l>So much they <hi>Hectors</hi> coming on did dread.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Nestor</hi> coming by, observ'd them had,</l>
            <l>So, so (said he) brave Lads, continue so,</l>
            <l>And give no cause to <hi>Hector</hi> to be glad.</l>
            <l>He and the Princes then together go</l>
            <l>(All that to Counsel had been made to rise</l>
            <l>Except <hi>Meriones</hi> and <hi>Nestor</hi>'s Son</l>

            <l>And part the Ditch, and sitting down upon</l>
            <l>The place to which they were pursu'd before</l>
            <l>By <hi>Hector,</hi> who retiring thence lest clear</l>
            <l>The ground from dead mens Carkasses and Gore,</l>
            <l>Of what they next should do consulted there.</l>
            <l>First <hi>Nestor</hi> spake. Who dares (said he) to go</l>
            <l>Unto the <hi>Trojan</hi> Camp that lies so near,</l>
            <l>And kill, or bring thence some outlying Foe?</l>
            <l>Or what they shall resolve upon to hear?</l>
            <l>Whether (since they have worsted us) to stay</l>
            <l>So near us or retire into the Town.</l>
            <l>If this he do and safely come away,</l>

            <l>He to our publick Feastings be invited.</l>
            <l>This said, they paus'd a while, but by and by</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> rising spake. <hi>Nestor,</hi> said he,</l>
            <l>To go into the <hi>Trojan</hi> Camp dare I.</l>
            <l>But 'twould be best some other went with me,</l>
            <l>More hope and courage is where there are two;</l>
            <l>What one observeth not the other may.</l>
            <l>A man alone can little see or do,</l>
            <l>And single Judgments see but little way.</l>
            <l>At these words many with him would have gone,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajaxes</hi> both the greater and the less</l>
            <l>And stout <hi>Antilochus</hi> old <hi>Nestor</hi>'s Son,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Meriones.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But most of all <hi>Ulysses</hi> long'd to see</l>
            <l>What projects in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Camp were laid.</l>
            <l>For none adventure farther durst than he.</l>

            <l>Regard not Birth nor Scepters, but the cause.</l>

            <l>And this he said in fear for <hi>Menelaus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To this <hi>Tydides</hi> answer made agen,</l>
            <l>Since of my fellow I the choice must make,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> I prefer before all men,</l>
            <l>And him for my assistant I will take;</l>
            <l>So much in diligence he doth excel,</l>
            <l>And so much care <hi>Athena</hi> of him has,</l>
            <l>That I believe we both should come off well</l>
            <l>Though through a flaming fire we were to pass.</l>
            <l>Then said <hi>Ulysses,</hi> Speak no more of me</l>

               <hi>Tydides</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> hunted him</l>
            <l>When back into the Herd he could not go.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Dolon</hi> to the Watch was very near,</l>

            <l>I am assur'd you cannot death avoid.</l>
            <l>And as he spake the word his Spear he flung;</l>
            <l>And miss'd on purpose, but it lighted near.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Dolon</hi> affrighted pale and trembling stands,</l>
            <l>And in his head chatter'd his Teeth with fear.</l>
            <l>Then in they came and seiz'd on both his hands.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Dolon</hi> weeping then for Quarter pray'd,</l>

            <l>Then to him said <hi>Ulysses,</hi> Do not fear,</l>

            <l>Upon what weighty bus'ness you are here,</l>

            <l>To sleep or watch, and whether they prepare</l>

            <l>The rest about the Bonfires waking were.</l>
            <l>But certain Watch appointed there was none.</l>
            <l>But those Confederates that came from far</l>
            <l>Slept at their ease all night and watched not.</l>
            <l>For that they trusted to the <hi>Trojans</hi> care,</l>
            <l>Having no Wives nor Children with them brought.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> then examin'd him again,</l>
            <l>How lye the Strangers? Mixt with those of <hi>Troy</hi>

            <l>Or by themselves? Inform me and be plain.</l>

            <l>But try now whether I say true or no,</l>
            <l>And send me to the Ships, or bind me here.</l>

            <l>As he was speaking, and lay in the dust.</l>
            <l>And from him then they took his Cap of Cat,</l>
            <l>His Spear and Wolfes-skin Coat, and Bow unbent,</l>
            <l>And in his hands <hi>Ulysses</hi> took all that,</l>

            <l>Hail <hi>Pallas,</hi> whom we pray'd to for success</l>
            <l>Before all other Gods, receive these Gifts,</l>

            <l>This said, the Spoils of <hi>Dolon</hi> up he lifts</l>
            <l>And laies them in a Tree; and for a mark,</l>
            <l>They near the way laid store of Boughs and Reeds</l>
            <l>To find them coming back because 'twas dark.</l>
            <l>Then with <hi>Tydides</hi> onward he proceeds,</l>
            <l>And ev'ry step on Arms or Blood they tread,</l>
            <l>And soon amongst the <hi>Thracians</hi> they were,</l>

            <l>And by each one his Buckler and his Spear.</l>
            <l>Their Horses to the Charret-seats were ty'd.</l>
            <l>Thus in three Rows the <hi>Thracians</hi> were laid,</l>

            <l>To go unto the Ships I think it good,</l>
            <l>For fear you thither should be forc'd to run.</l>
            <l>Some other God awake the <hi>Trojans</hi> may.</l>
            <l>This said, that <hi>Pallas</hi> to him spake he thought,</l>
            <l>And from the <hi>Thracian</hi> Quarter came away,</l>
            <l>And on one of the Horses backs he got,</l>
            <l>And tow'rds the Ships at full speed then they ride,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> with his Bow still switching on.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Phoebus</hi> with <hi>Tydides Pallas</hi> spy'd,</l>
            <l>And angerly call'd up <hi>Hippocoon.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who when he came and empty saw the ground</l>
            <l>Where th'horses stood, &amp; dy'd with blood the field,</l>
            <l>And sprawling in their blood the <hi>Thracians</hi> found,</l>
            <l>Ay me, said he, they have my Unckle kill'd.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> then in haste and frighted rise,</l>
            <l>And at the place in great disorder meer,</l>
            <l>And gaze upon the mischief with their eyes,</l>
            <l>But they that did it fled were to the Fleet.</l>
            <l>When flying they were at the Tree, where lay</l>
            <l>The Spoils of <hi>Delon,</hi> there a while they tarry,</l>
            <l>Until <hi>Tydides</hi> fetch'd them had away,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Ulysses</hi> given them to carry,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93808:82"/>And mounted was upon his Horse agen.</l>
            <l>Agen <hi>Ulysses</hi> switch'd them tow'rds the Fleet;</l>
            <l>And when they near it were, Old <hi>Nestor</hi> then</l>
            <l>Who was the first that heard the Horses Feet</l>
            <l>Cry'd out, The sound of Horses feet I hear;</l>
            <l>I wish <hi>Ulysses</hi> 'twere and <hi>Diomed.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But somewhat else and worse it is I fear;</l>
            <l>So many sad mishaps run in my Head.</l>
            <l>He scarce had spoken this but they came in.</l>
            <l>When they alighted were and welcomed</l>
            <l>With Hands and Speeches of their Friends had been,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Nestor</hi> thus <hi>Ulysses</hi> questioned.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses,</hi> Glory of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> said he,</l>
            <l>Whence are these Horses beauteous as the Sun?</l>
            <l>Won from the <hi>Trojans?</hi> But that cannot be.</l>
            <l>For such amongst the <hi>Trojans</hi> I saw none,</l>
            <l>Though I amongst them were in ev'ry fight.</l>
            <l>Or given by the Gods? Which may be true.</l>
            <l>For both of you are gracious in their sight,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> have a care of you.</l>
            <l>O Noble <hi>Nestor,</hi> said <hi>Ulysses</hi> then,</l>
            <l>Gods can give better Horses if they please.</l>
            <l>For richer much are they than mortal men.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tydides</hi> from a King of <hi>Thrace</hi> took these,</l>
            <l>Who was come newly to the <hi>Trojans</hi> aid;</l>
            <l>And slain him has, besides a dozen more,</l>
            <l>And besides these a Spy that them betraid,</l>
            <l>By <hi>Hector</hi> sent, your purpose to explore.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Ulysses</hi> with much people went</l>
            <l>Triumphing, and the milk white Horses drave</l>
            <l>Over the Trenches to <hi>Tydides</hi> Tent.</l>
            <l>There sets them up, and Wheat unto them gave;</l>
            <l>But <hi>Dolon</hi>'s Spoils astern his Ship he plac'd,</l>
            <l>Preparing for <hi>Athena</hi>'s Sacrifice.</l>
            <l>And then into the Sea they went and wash'd</l>
            <l>The sweat from off their Shoulders, Legs &amp; Thighs,</l>
            <l>And after bath, and 'noint themselves with oyl,</l>
            <l>That done, they sit down to their meat and dine.</l>
            <l>And being thus refreshed from their toil,</l>
            <l>Unto the Goddess <hi>Pallas</hi> offer Wine.</l>

            <l>Then <hi>Eris</hi> with her voice the Air did tear,</l>

            <l>Incourag'd thus the <hi>Greeks</hi> took more delight</l>

            <l>With silver Buckles, Leg-pieces of Brass;</l>
            <l>And then puts on an Armour on his breast,</l>
            <l>That had been given him by <hi>Cinyres</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(His antient acquaintance and his Guest)</l>
            <l>Whilst he preparing was to pass the Seas:</l>
            <l>For long before the <hi>Greeks</hi> for <hi>Troy</hi> set sail,</l>
            <l>Their purpose was at <hi>Cyprus</hi> known by fame,</l>
            <l>And thinking such a Gift might him avail,</l>
            <l>In kindness t'<hi>Agamemnon</hi> sent the same.</l>
            <l>The colour was by Pales distinguished,</l>
            <l>Ten Black, twelve Gold, and twenty were of Tin:</l>
            <l>And in it three black Serpents figured</l>
            <l>As if they creeping were unto his Chin.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:93808:83"/>Their sides like Rainbows lookt which in the Sky</l>
            <l>Are shewn by <hi>Jove</hi> for men to wonder at.</l>
            <l>Then from his shoulder down upon his thigh</l>
            <l>He hung his Sword. Studded with Gold was that.</l>
            <l>Then took his Shield which finely varied was;</l>
            <l>Bossed in twenty places with white Tin;</l>
            <l>And round about them were ten Orbs of Brass;</l>
            <l>And black the Circle was enclos'd within.</l>
            <l>There <hi>Gorgo</hi> painted was with killing Eyes,</l>
            <l>And with her standing Terror and Affright:</l>
            <l>His Belt of silver was, and to the Skyes</l>
            <l>Returned back agen the glittering light.</l>
            <l>Wound up lay on it painted a great Snake,</l>
            <l>Which had three heads, and crowned was each one,</l>
            <l>And last into his hand two Spears did take,</l>
            <l>Having his Helmet on his head put on.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Agamemnon</hi> armed was. And then</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> both rais'd such a sound</l>
            <l>(To honour him before the <hi>Greeks</hi>) as when</l>
            <l>A man that's slain falls suddenly to th' ground.</l>
            <l>Then every one unto his Chariotier</l>
            <l>Commandment gave upon the Ditch to stay</l>
            <l>And ready be. The foot all armed were,</l>
            <l>And forth into the Field were march'd away.</l>
            <l>But soon again the Horses with them stood.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> amongst them Noise and Tumult sent;</l>
            <l>And mingled was the Morning dew with Bloud,</l>
            <l>For on that day much bloud was to be spent.</l>
            <l>Upon a rising ground now <hi>Hector</hi> was,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Aeneas</hi> with him, and <hi>Polydamas,</hi>

               <hi>Agenor, Polybus,</hi> and th'Army was.</l>

            <l>As when a Star does through the Clouds appear,</l>
            <l>And presently again is covered;</l>
            <l>Sometimes i'th' Front was, sometimes in the Rear</l>

            <l>To <hi>Eris,</hi> who (and no God else) was by.</l>
            <l>The other Gods stay'd on <hi>Olympus</hi> Hill,</l>

            <l>To <hi>Ilium.</hi> But he car'd not for that.</l>

            <l>Took pride to see the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> fight,</l>
            <l>And look on killing and on dying men,</l>
            <l>And of their Arms to see the slashing light.</l>
            <l>Now all the while that mounting was the Sun,</l>
            <l>The number slain on both sides was the same.</l>
            <l>But when the Woodman half his work had done,</l>
            <l>And willingly unto his Dinner came,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> then brake the <hi>Trojan</hi> Ranks, and on</l>

            <l>He lighting and assailing him was slain;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Ocles</hi> had no time his Spear to throw:</l>
            <l>For <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Spear had pierc'd his brain,</l>
            <l>Passing both through his Helmet and his Brow.</l>
            <l>These there he left stript both of Arms and Coat,</l>

            <l>The other with his sword he overthrew,</l>

            </l>
            <l>And thought not on their fellows they left dead.</l>

            </l>
            <l>And for it in the Common-Councel voted.</l>
            <l>And these two <hi>Agamemnon</hi> took alive.</l>
            <l>For by mischance the reins slipt from their hands;</l>
            <l>And then they saw it was in vain to strive,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi> now before them stands.</l>
            <l>Then as they sat together on one Seat,</l>
            <l>Save us (said they) <hi>Atrides,</hi> let us live,</l>
            <l>For we redeem'd shall be with Ransome great,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Contrary to the Laws of honesty,</l>

            <l>You for your Father's evil deed must pay.</l>
            <l>Then from his Char <hi>Pisander</hi> he struck down;</l>

            <l>And then upon the <hi>Trojans</hi> prest again.</l>
            <l>And great the slaughter was of them that fled,</l>
            <l>And wonderful the Dust that raised was,</l>
            <l>And both the Field and Army covered,</l>
            <l>Forc'd up by Troops of Horses shod with Brass.</l>
            <l>As Boughs fall in a Wood that's set on flame,</l>

            <l>When <hi>Agamemnon</hi> follow'd them behind.</l>
            <l>And many Horses made their Charrets rattle,</l>
            <l>Which empty ran about when no man drives.</l>
            <l>For they that drave them faln were in the Battle,</l>
            <l>A lovelier sight to Vulturs than their Wives.</l>

            <l>Of all this dust and slaughter and disorder:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Agamemnon</hi> still with all his might</l>
            <l>Pursuing killed, and to kill gave order.</l>
            <l>Then they that were encampt at <hi>Ilus</hi> Tomb</l>
            <l>Retir'd in haste unto the Sycamore,</l>

            <l>Got back unto the Beech near <hi>Scaea</hi> gate,</l>
            <l>A while they for their fellows stayed there</l>
            <l>Who swiftly ran fearing to come too late.</l>

            <l>And to the Fleet go killing all the way,</l>
            <l>Until the Sun be set, and dark the night.</l>
            <l>This said, away she went without delay;</l>
            <l>And down from <hi>Ida</hi> came to <hi>Ilium,</hi>

            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> armed leapt unto the ground,</l>

            <l>Exhorting went about the Army round.</l>

            <l>One of <hi>Antenor</hi>'s Sons <hi>Iphidamas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That was brought up in <hi>Thrace</hi> (though born at <hi>Troy</hi>)</l>
            <l>By <hi>Cisseus</hi> who his Mothers Father was,</l>
            <l>From childhood till to mans estate he came,</l>
            <l>And made his Son in-Law. But then, because</l>
            <l>The coming of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was known by Fame,</l>
            <l>Was thence, although but new espoused, sent</l>
            <l>To th'aid of <hi>Priam</hi> and his Sons at <hi>Troy,</hi>

            <l>First <hi>Agamemnon</hi> threw his Spear and mist.</l>

               <hi>Iphidamas</hi> then at <hi>Atrides</hi> threw,</l>
            <l>And hit his Belt which did the stroke resist,</l>

            <l>Then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> with his Sword came on,</l>
            <l>And smote him on the Neck, and laid him dead.</l>
            <l>Thus dy'd <hi>Iphidamas Antenor</hi>'s Son.</l>
            <l>And much to be lamented was his case,</l>
            <l>That far from his espoused Virgin Wife</l>
            <l>Without receiving from her any grace</l>
            <l>Should fighting for his Country lose his Life.</l>
            <l>He given for her had a thousand Kine,</l>
            <l>And promis'd Sheep and Goats a thousand more.</l>
            <l>Now slain, and stript was of his Armour fine</l>
            <l>By <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and triumphed ore.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Coon</hi> then, <hi>Antenor</hi>'s eldest Son</l>

            <l>Thus these two Brothers finished their Fate.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> still the slaughter followed</l>

            <l>Not giving over whilst the wound was warm.</l>

            <l>At when the Hounds by Hunters are set on</l>
            <l>A wild Boar as he comes out from the Wood,</l>
            <l>He whets his Teeth, they from him will not run;</l>
            <l>Even so <hi>Ulysses</hi> 'mongst the <hi>Trojans</hi> stood;</l>

            <l>And after these he slew <hi>Chersidamas</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As from his Char he lighted in the Field.</l>
            <l>Then leaving these, slew <hi>Charops</hi> with his Spear,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Socus</hi> his Brother, <hi>Hippasus</hi> his Son.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Socus</hi> to him came, and standing near</l>
            <l>Unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> with a Speech begun.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> much renown'd for Craft and Pain,</l>
            <l>This day you either must the Honor wear</l>
            <l>Of having <hi>Hippasus</hi> his two Sons slain,</l>
            <l>Or lose your own life wounded by my Spear.</l>
            <l>Then threw his Spear and pierc'd <hi>Ulysses</hi> Shield.</l>
            <l>His Breast plate, and his Coat, and toar his Skin.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Pallas</hi> him preserv'd from being kill'd;</l>
            <l>For to the Vital parts it went not in.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> knew the wound not mortal was;</l>
            <l>Made a step back, and then to <hi>Socus</hi> said,</l>
            <l>Fool that thou art, that wou'dst not let me pass</l>
            <l>On other <hi>Trojans</hi> hast thy self destroy'd,</l>
            <l>I do not think you shall this hour outlive,</l>
            <l>But from my Spears sharp point receive your death,</l>
            <l>And unto me more Reputation give,</l>
            <l>And leave your Soul unto the Pow'rs beneath.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Socus</hi> turn'd himself about to fly.</l>
            <l>But overtaken by <hi>Ulysses</hi> Spear,</l>
            <l>That pierc'd him Back and Breast, he fell down dead.</l>
            <l>Then scornfully <hi>Ulysses</hi> did him jear.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Socus,</hi> gallant man at Arms, said he,</l>
            <l>By death prevented is your Enterprize;</l>
            <l>Your eyes shall not by Parents closed be,</l>
            <l>But shall be pecked out by Crows and Pyes.</l>
            <l>Then from his Shield and Body he pull'd out</l>
            <l>The Spear which at him was by <hi>Socus</hi> thrown.</l>
            <l>The Bloud then from the Wound did freely spout.</l>
            <l>Which when the <hi>Trojans</hi> saw, they straight came down,</l>
            <l>And all together tow'rds him went the Rabble,</l>
            <l>Then he retir'd, and as he going was</l>
            <l>Thrice called out as loud as he was able</l>
            <l>For help; and thrice was heard by <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:93808:88"/>Who t'<hi>Ajax</hi> said, <hi>Ulysses</hi> voice I hear,</l>
            <l>And like the voice of one that is distrest.</l>
            <l>He hem'd in by the <hi>Trojans</hi> is I fear,</l>
            <l>Come let us to him go, and do our best</l>
            <l>To fetch him off. For valiant though he be,</l>
            <l>I fear unless we aid him with great speed,</l>
            <l>He by the <hi>Trojans</hi> will be slain, and we</l>
            <l>Loose a good man, of whom we oft have need.</l>
            <l>Then up they went, and found him by the Foes</l>
            <l>Environ'd round. As when a Stag is shot</l>
            <l>By some young man, he swiftly from him goes</l>
            <l>Whilst strong his knees are and his bloud is hot.</l>
            <l>But when he by the Arrow tamed is,</l>
            <l>The Wolves feed on him in the gloomy Wood;</l>
            <l>Then comes the Lion and the Prey is his.</l>
            <l>About <hi>Ulysses</hi> so the <hi>Trojans</hi> stood,</l>
            <l>Till <hi>Ajax</hi> with a Target like a Tower</l>
            <l>Came to his aid; then sev'ral ways they fled.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> now no longer in their Power</l>
            <l>Was from the Field by <hi>Menelaus</hi> led,</l>
            <l>And mounted on his Chariot agen.</l>
            <l>But on went <hi>Ajax,</hi> and slew <hi>Pandocus</hi>
            </l>
            <l>King <hi>Priams</hi> Son, and wounded three good men,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lisander, Pylartes,</hi> and <hi>Pyrasus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then as a River coming to the Plain,</l>
            <l>And swell'd by <hi>Jupiter</hi> with showr's of rain</l>
            <l>More than the Banks are able to contain,</l>
            <l>Bears Oaks and Pines before it to the Main;</l>
            <l>So <hi>Ajax</hi> charg'd the <hi>Trojan</hi> Troops. But this</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector</hi> knew nothing of. For far off now</l>

            <l>And to the ground doth many an <hi>Argive</hi> throw.</l>
            <l>There was the noise, there aged <hi>Nestor</hi> stood,</l>
            <l>And there <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> with their Steeds.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> that the use well understood</l>

               </hi> said,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Nestor</hi> to your Charret mount again,</l>
            <l>And with <hi>Machaon</hi> make haste to the Ships.</l>
            <l>A Surgeon many other men is worth.</l>
            <l>For many other men alive he keeps</l>
            <l>By making Salves and drawing Weapons forth.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Nestor</hi> mounteth and the Horses whips,</l>
            <l>Which they no sooner feel than they are gone.</l>
            <l>And quickly brought unto the hollow Ships</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Machaon Aesculapius</hi> his Son.</l>
            <l>Mean while <hi>Cebriones</hi> the Charetier</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Hector</hi> saw the <hi>Trojans</hi> were distrest,</l>
            <l>And to him said, To what end stay we here</l>
            <l>Since yonder by the <hi>Greeks</hi> our Friends are prest?</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>Ajax</hi> that disorders them, I see,</l>
            <l>I know him by the largeness of his Shield.</l>
            <l>Now where they fighting are most furiously,</l>
            <l>Let us go down to that side of the Field.</l>
            <l>This said, he clackt his Whip, his Horses ran</l>
            <l>Unto the place where greatest was the Cry,</l>
            <l>Ore many a Shield, and over many a man,</l>
            <l>That gasping on the bloudy Field did lye.</l>
            <l>The Horses Bellies and the Charret-wheels</l>
            <l>And Axletrees with bloud were cover'd ore</l>
            <l>Forc'd up in drops by the swift Horses heels.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> rushing in, their Battles tore.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> still took heed of <hi>Ajax</hi> Spear.</l>
            <l>And sought in other places of the Field.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Ajax</hi> struck by <hi>Jupiter</hi> with Fear</l>
            <l>Amazed, at his shoulder hung his Shield;</l>
            <l>And staring on the Foe a while he stood,</l>
            <l>Then turn'd and softly from them went away.</l>
            <l>As when a Lion coming from the Wood</l>
            <l>Down to a Pasture on a Cow to prey,</l>
            <l>Is hu'd by Dogs and Pesants in the night,</l>
            <l>And hungry sometimes goes and sometimes stands,</l>
            <l>But cannot have his Will for all his might,</l>
            <l>So many Spears are flying from their hands,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:93808:89"/>And flaming Brands which put him in a fright</l>
            <l>(Keen as he is) then sullenly he goes</l>
            <l>Back to the Wood and comes no more in sight;</l>
            <l>So then retired <hi>Ajax</hi> from his Foes.</l>
            <l>Or as an Ass in spight of many Boes</l>
            <l>Is got into the Corn, and there abides</l>
            <l>Though they upon him fall with Blows and Noise,</l>
            <l>And many Cudgels break upon his sides</l>
            <l>(For he the force of Boys but little feels)</l>
            <l>He hardly will be driven out though fill'd,</l>
            <l>And now and then kicks at them with his heels:</l>
            <l>So <hi>Ajax</hi> at the last went off the Field</l>
            <l>By <hi>Hector</hi> and the <hi>Trojans</hi> still pursu'd</l>
            <l>Upon his Shield received many a Spear;</l>
            <l>Sometimes his Back sometimes his face he shew'd,</l>
            <l>So that they could not to the Ships come near.</l>
            <l>Thus he between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> stands</l>
            <l>While Spears abundance at him hurled were;</l>
            <l>Some in his Shield stuck driven by strong hands,</l>
            <l>Some on the ground fell short and fixt were there.</l>
            <l>But then <hi>Eurypylus Euaemon</hi>'s Son</l>
            <l>That saw him thus opprest came to his side,</l>
            <l>And wounded with his Spear <hi>Apisaon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Liver through; and on the place he dy'd.</l>
            <l>But as he stript him lying on the ground</l>
            <l>Was shot by <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Thigh,</l>
            <l>And broken was the Arrow in the wound,</l>
            <l>And much increased was his pain thereby.</l>
            <l>Then went <hi>Eurypylus</hi> into the croud,</l>
            <l>And cry'd out to the Princes of the Host,</l>
            <l>Turn and save noble <hi>Ajax</hi> from this cloud</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Trojan</hi> Spears, or else he will be lost.</l>
            <l>This said, the best Commanders to him go</l>
            <l>with Spears advanc'd, and Bucklers turn'd before,</l>
            <l>And place themselves between him and the Fo.</l>
            <l>And then again the Fight was very sore.</l>
            <l>Mean while <hi>Achilles</hi> as he sitting was</l>
            <l>On high astern his Ship to see them fight</l>
            <l>Perceived <hi>Nestor</hi> and <hi>Machaon</hi> pass,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Patroclus</hi> call'd with all his might,</l>

               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:93808:89"/>Come hither friend. <hi>Patroclus</hi> heard him call,</l>
            <l>For he was sitting in <hi>Achilles</hi> Tent,</l>
            <l>And (which was the beginning of his fall)</l>
            <l>Immediately rose up and to him went,</l>
            <l>And said, <hi>Achilles</hi> what's your will with me?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then reply'd, <hi>Patroclus</hi> now</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives,</hi> I believe, will bend the knee.</l>
            <l>For their condition never was so low.</l>
            <l>But go to <hi>Nestor</hi> and informed be</l>
            <l>Who 'tis that he brought with him from the Fight.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Machaon</hi> by his Back he seem'd to me,</l>
            <l>But of his Face I could not have a sight,</l>
            <l>So many Chars and Horses cross'd the way.</l>
            <l>This said, unto the Ships <hi>Patroclus</hi> went;</l>
            <l>But at the Ships arrived now were they,</l>
            <l>Alighted and gone in to <hi>Nestor</hi>'s Tent:</l>
            <l>The Horses by <hi>Eurymedon</hi> unty'd</l>
            <l>Were cooled by the Sea-side in the air,</l>
            <l>And of their sweat well cleansed were and dry'd,</l>
            <l>And in the mean time <hi>Ecameda</hi> fair</l>
            <l>That was the Daughter of <hi>Arsinous,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And taken by <hi>Achilles</hi> was when he</l>
            <l>Conquer'd and sack'd the City <hi>Tenedus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to <hi>Nestor</hi> giv'n; and she</l>
            <l>To <hi>Nestor</hi> and <hi>Machaon</hi> setteth up</l>
            <l>A Table with a Black Foot smooth and fine,</l>
            <l>And on it set a Basket, and a Cup,</l>
            <l>And to each one before him set on Wine.</l>
            <l>The Cup with nails of Gold was studded ore;</l>
            <l>Four ears it had, and two Doves at each ear,</l>
            <l>And those were Gold, and at the foot two more</l>
            <l>In posture such as if they feeding were.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nestor</hi> to <hi>Troy</hi> had with him brought this Cup.</l>
            <l>Another scarce could lift it from the Table</l>
            <l>When fill'd with Wine; Though he to take it up,</l>
            <l>Old as he was, and easily, was able.</l>
            <l>And in the same the Woman made the Drink,</l>
            <l>With Goats-milk Cheese, &amp; white flour sprinkled ore,</l>
            <l>And left it on the Board full to the brink.</l>
            <l>Then quenched they their thirst, and drank no more,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:93808:90"/>But talking sat, to put out of their thought</l>
            <l>Their ill success. Now at the door o'th' Tent</l>

            <l>But said, <hi>Achilles</hi> had me ask you who</l>
            <l>It is whom you brought with you from the Fight.</l>
            <l>And this already I can answer to.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Machaon</hi> 'tis that sits there in my sight.</l>
            <l>What need then is there of my longer stay?</l>
            <l>Return I will with all the speed I can,</l>
            <l>For fear he should some blame upon me lay</l>
            <l>Though I deserve it not. You know the man.</l>
            <l>What makes <hi>Achilles</hi> (aged <hi>Nestor</hi> said)</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> pity has on none of us;</l>
            <l>Although our safety now lye in his hands.</l>
            <l>Intends he to sit still till <hi>Hector</hi> burn</l>

            <l>For now my strength decayed is with age.</l>

            <l>For I then went his Cattle to distrain,</l>
            <l>And take amends for those he took of mine.</l>
            <l>There he defending them by me was slain,</l>
            <l>And all his people from him ran away.</l>
            <l>And there we took of fifty Herds of Kine</l>
            <l>And of as many Herds of Goats a prey,</l>
            <l>As many Flocks, as many Herds of Swine,</l>

            <l>Of colour sandy mixt with sparks of light;</l>
            <l>And most of them had Foals, and to the Wall</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Pyle</hi> I brought this booty all by night.</l>
            <l>

            <l>(All those to whom the <hi>Elians</hi> had done wrong)</l>

            <l>Many there were that had been injured,</l>
            <l>And with their shares contented sent away,</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Pylus</hi> were not well inhabited.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Hercules</hi> not many years before</l>

            <l>Had twelve good Sons, whereof he left no more</l>

            <l>Despise our number small, and do us wrong.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Neleus</hi> now unto himself did keep</l>
            <l>The best Herd of the Kine, and from among</l>
            <l>The Flocks chose one that had three hundred sheep,</l>
            <l>And justly, since so great a loss had none.</l>
            <l>For he four Steeds unto the Games had sent</l>
            <l>Of value great, which all had Prizes won.</l>
            <l>But by <hi>Augias</hi> his Commandement,</l>
            <l>When for a Tripod they prepar'd to run,</l>
            <l>Together with the Charrs were there detain'd.</l>
            <l>The Charretiers related what was done.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Neleus</hi> then the best o'th' Prey retain'd;</l>
            <l>And ev'ry man had of the rest his share.</l>
            <l>This done, unto the Gods we sacrifice.</l>
            <l>Mean while the <hi>Elians</hi> for War prepare,</l>

            <l>But with the rest on foot went to the Field,</l>
            <l>For on the Goddess <hi>Pallas</hi> I rely'd.</l>
            <l>Near to <hi>Arene</hi> falls into the Main</l>

            <l>An Heifer to the heav'nly martial Maid</l>

            <l>They rose; then presently began the Fray.</l>
            <l>And there the first man that was slain I slew,</l>

            <l>Then fled th'<hi>Epeians</hi> scatter'd here and there:</l>
            <l>For he the best amongst them was accounted.</l>
            <l>And us they fled I follow'd with my Spear,</l>
            <l>And fifty Charrets took, and at each one</l>
            <l>Two men I kill'd; for like a Storm I went;</l>
            <l>Nor had I left to <hi>Molius</hi> any Son,</l>
            <l>If <hi>Neptune</hi> had not hindred my intent,</l>
            <l>That took them up and sav'd them in a Cloud.</l>
            <l>Great honour won the <hi>Pyleans</hi> that day;</l>

               <hi>Menoetius</hi> your Father gave you then</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> to us came and led us in,</l>
            <l>And made us sup, and Supper being done,</l>
            <l>To tell our bus'ness then did I begin,</l>
            <l>Which was to bring with us to <hi>Troy</hi> his Son.</l>
            <l>Both he and you desirous were to go;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Peleus</hi> then unto <hi>Achilles</hi> said,</l>
            <l>Strive still to be the best, and let the Foe</l>
            <l>Be always of your Spear the most afraid.</l>
            <l>Then to you spake your Father, Son (said he)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> is a better man of War</l>
            <l>Than you, and higher in Nobility</l>

            <l>He will obey when for himself 'tis best;</l>
            <l>Thus he advis'd you though you have forgot.</l>
            <l>But do it now. For 'tis not yet too late.</l>
            <l>Who knows but you may make him change his mind?</l>
            <l>Or if he still continue obstinate,</l>
            <l>Or in some Oracle a scruple find,</l>
            <l>Or <hi>Thetis</hi> told him somewhat has from <hi>Jove,</hi>

            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> from the Navie to remove,</l>
            <l>And give th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> time to breathe anew.</l>

            <l>The Horses when upon the Brink they were</l>
            <l>Boggl'd and whinny'd, and refus'd to pass.</l>
            <l>For broad it was and not to be leap'd ore;</l>
            <l>And to descend into, too deep it was,</l>
            <l>And on each side bristled with stakes good store</l>
            <l>Fix'd by th' <hi>Achaeans</hi> to keep off the Foe,</l>
            <l>So that for Horse and Charres there was no way.</l>
            <l>But very willing were the Foot to go,</l>

            <l>And to the <hi>Greeks</hi> should bear as much despite,</l>
            <l>As I, that wish their Name were rooted out.</l>
            <l>Yet if the <hi>Greeks,</hi> when we encumbred were</l>
            <l>For want of room, should turn and face about,</l>

            <l>To tell at <hi>Troy</hi> what is become of us.</l>
            <l>But if you mean to have the bus'ness thrive,</l>
            <l>Then hear my Counsel, Let us all do thus.</l>

            <l>Arm'd as he was; and so did all the rest,</l>
            <l>And to their Charretiers they gave command</l>

            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> in five parts themselves divide.</l>

            <l>Two mighty men that like two great Oaks stood</l>
            <l>With deep and large Roots fixed in the ground,</l>
            <l>That many Winds and Storms had long withstood.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Lapiths</hi> they were both; <hi>Leontes</hi> one,</l>

            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> led by <hi>Asius</hi> came on</l>

            <l>To scale the Wall they roar'd and frighted were;</l>

            <l>Upon the <hi>Trojans</hi> from the Wall and Tow'rs</l>

            <l>But <hi>Asius</hi> at this vext to the heart</l>
            <l>Then spake to <hi>Jove,</hi> and clapping of his thigh,</l>
            <l>Ay me, said he, Thou too a Lyer art</l>
            <l>That mad'st us to believe the <hi>Greeks</hi> would fly;</l>

            <l>Still sharply fight and will not quit the place.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Asius</hi> said, but <hi>Jove</hi> unmoved sate,</l>
            <l>And none that day but <hi>Hector</hi> meant to grace.</l>
            <l>And as at this, they fought at ev'ry Gate.</l>
            <l>I cannot like a God relate it all,</l>
            <l>The flaming Stones that from the <hi>Trojans</hi> flew</l>
            <l>With fire divine up to the <hi>Argive</hi> Wall</l>
            <l>On ev'ry side. How th'<hi>Argives</hi> no way knew</l>
            <l>To save themselves but for the Ships to fight;</l>
            <l>And how the Gods that with the <hi>Greeks</hi> took part</l>
            <l>Sate discontent in Heav'n and full of spight</l>
            <l>To see <hi>Jove</hi> so severely make them smart.</l>
            <l>But for the fight without, 'twas first begun</l>
            <l>By the bold <hi>Lapiths,</hi> though but two they were.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Polypoetes Pirithous</hi> Son</l>
            <l>At <hi>Damasus</hi> threw first a heavie Spear,</l>

            <l>And through the Bone into the Brain went on;</l>
            <l>And when unto the Shades he him had sent,</l>
            <l>He killed <hi>Orminus</hi> and <hi>Pyloon.</hi>
            </l>

               <hi>Orestes, Menon,</hi> one upon another.</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Hector, Polydamas,</hi> and many other</l>
            <l>That of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Army were the best,</l>
            <l>Were at the Trench, and stood upon the brink</l>
            <l>The Wall to break, and set the Ships on fire.</l>
            <l>But as they stood a little while to think</l>
            <l>There came a Bird not suting their desire.</l>
            <l>An Eagle in his Pounces held a Snake,</l>
            <l>And over <hi>Hectors</hi> Soldiers carri'd it</l>
            <l>Alive, but that could yet resistance make,</l>
            <l>And by and by the Snake the Eagle bit.</l>
            <l>The Eagle smarting cri'd and flew away,</l>
            <l>And 'mongst the <hi>Trojans</hi> lets the Serpent fall,</l>
            <l>And there amazed they, and gaping stay</l>
            <l>To see <hi>Joves</hi> Prodigy before them crall.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Hector,</hi> said <hi>Polydamas,</hi> though you</l>
            <l>In Courts and Councils cross whatere I say,</l>
            <l>How good soere it for you be and true,</l>
            <l>Unless in ev'ry thing I go your way,</l>

            <l>In Peace and War to have their Voices free,</l>
            <l>And never give advice against their thought,</l>
            <l>But always for the publick good to be;)</l>
            <l>Yet now I'll tell you, if this Bird be sent</l>
            <l>Unto the <hi>Trojans</hi> as a Prodigy,</l>
            <l>'Tis not uneasie to foresee th'vent.</l>
            <l>For this I think the end of it will be:</l>
            <l>As th'Eagle in his Pounces bore the Snake,</l>
            <l>But could not to her young ones bear it home;</l>
            <l>So if the <hi>Trojans</hi> this attempt shall make,</l>
            <l>They'll back unto the City smarting come,</l>
            <l>And many good Companions leave behinde,</l>
            <l>Whom th'<hi>Argives</hi> to defend their Ships will kill.</l>

            <l>This said, he led them further on; and then</l>

            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> a mighty wind from <hi>Ida</hi> sent,</l>

            <l>Lined with many folds of strong Cow-hide,</l>
            <l>And which with golden Circles strength'ned was,</l>
            <l>And two Spears in his hand to th'Wall he hi'd.</l>

            <l>Of Men and Dogs that them are set to keep;</l>
            <l>So boldly goes <hi>Sarpedon</hi> to the Walls</l>
            <l>With mighty hand the Battlements to tear.</l>
            <l>And as he going was to <hi>Glaucus</hi> calls.</l>
            <l>

            <l>
               <hi>Glaucus,</hi> if we could death eschew and age</l>
            <l>By running from the Battle cowardly,</l>
            <l>D'ye think I foremost would my self engage,</l>
            <l>Or ever counsel you to follow me?</l>
            <l>You know the ways to death are infinite.</l>
            <l>Though we ne're fight we cannot always live.</l>
            <l>Therefore come on and let us bravely fight,</l>

            <l>Then <hi>Mnesteus</hi> was terribly afraid.</l>

            <l>And lookt about what <hi>Heroes</hi> he could spy</l>

            <l>Along the <hi>Argive</hi> Wall, and to them said,</l>

               <hi>Mnesteus</hi> entreats both of you, if you can,</l>
            <l>To come unto his Tow'r and give him aid.</l>
            <l>Keen Warriours (he says) these <hi>Lycians</hi> are.</l>

            <l>Let <hi>Telamonius</hi> of the place take care,</l>

            <l>This said, great <hi>Ajax</hi> said unto the less,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Teucer</hi> then together go</l>
            <l>Unto the Tow'r of <hi>Mnesteus</hi> with all speed,</l>

            <l>The <hi>Lycians</hi> like a black and lowring Cloud</l>
            <l>Ascended to the Wall and fiercely fought.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> resist. The noise is mighty loud.</l>
            <l>And with a heavy Stone stood <hi>Ajax</hi> out</l>

            <l>As Head and Helmet both in pieces broke.</l>
            <l>Down like a Diver from the Wall fell he</l>

               <hi>Glaucus</hi> no longer able now to fight,</l>
            <l>Leapt from the Wall unseen unto the ground,</l>
            <l>For fear, if of his hurt they had a sight,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> would make a Triumph of his wound.</l>
            <l>Griev'd was <hi>Sarpedon</hi> to see <hi>Glaucus</hi> gone,</l>
            <l>But not so grieved but that still he fought,</l>
            <l>And fixt a heavie Spear in <hi>Alcmaon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And with the same his life and all pluckt out.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Sarpedon</hi> then tore down a Battlement,</l>
            <l>And wider for the <hi>Lycians</hi> made the way.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Teucer</hi> then an Arrow to him sent.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Jupiter</hi> to save his Son that day</l>
            <l>The Shaft unto his Shield and Belt directed,</l>
            <l>So that it passed not unto the skin.</l>
            <l>The Shield and Belt together him protected.</l>
            <l>And then with Spear in hand came <hi>Ajax</hi> in,</l>
            <l>And with a Push that pierc'd his Shield clean through</l>
            <l>His coming on a little while he stay'd.</l>
            <l>But with <hi>Sarpedon</hi> that could little do,</l>
            <l>That honour sought. Then to his friends he said,</l>
            <l>Ye <hi>Lycians</hi> what makes you thus remiss?</l>
            <l>Can I make way unto the Ships alone?</l>
            <l>Strong as I am, impossible it is.</l>
            <l>For many hands much better are than one.</l>
            <l>This said the <hi>Lycians</hi> heavier than before</l>
            <l>(To please their Prince) upon the <hi>Argives</hi> lay.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> within their broken Ranks restore,</l>
            <l>And terrible the Battle was that day.</l>
            <l>For neither could the <hi>Lycians</hi> passage make</l>
            <l>Unto the Ships and break the <hi>Argives</hi> Wall,</l>
            <l>Nor <hi>Greeks</hi> compel the <hi>Lycians</hi> to forsake</l>
            <l>The battlements, so fiercely fought they all.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:93808:98"/>As two men on the Confines of their ground</l>

            <l>And each of them would fain enlarge his land:</l>
            <l>So for the Battlement they striving stood,</l>
            <l>And wounded one another Back and Brest,</l>
            <l>And sprinkled was the Battlement with bloud,</l>
            <l>Nor was it certain yet who had the best.</l>
            <l>But as a woman that is fain to spin</l>
            <l>To find her self and Children sorry food,</l>
            <l>In one scale Wooll, in th'other Weight puts in</l>

            <l>To give the honour of the Victory.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> up the Wall the formost went,</l>
            <l>And thence unto his <hi>Trojans</hi> loud did cry,</l>

            <l>And streight unto the Battlements they came.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> at the Gate took up a stone</l>

            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> with one hand the same could throw;</l>
            <l>For <hi>Jupiter</hi> to him had made it light.</l>
            <l>And as unto a Shepherd is a Fleece</l>
            <l>Of Wooll, that to be born needs little might;</l>
            <l>So eas'ly born the stone by <hi>Hector</hi> is;</l>
            <l>And standing at the Gate well fortifi'd</l>
            <l>With Planks well joyn'd, and two cross-bars within,</l>
            <l>And taking with his right foot back a stride</l>
            <l>Out flew the stone and at the Gate went in.</l>
            <l>The Gate then roar'd; the Hinges broken were;</l>
            <l>The Bars upon the ground asunder lay;</l>
            <l>And pieces of the Planks flew here and there;</l>
            <l>And to the Ships now open was the way.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> with a countenance like night</l>
            <l>Flew in. And fire appeared in his eyes:</l>
            <l>His Armour as he marched shined bright,</l>
            <l>And light reflected up unto the Skies;</l>
            <l>

            <l>And then the <hi>Greeks</hi> were mightily afraid;</l>
            <l>For none except a God could him resist.</l>
            <l>And then unto the <hi>Trojans</hi> turning said,</l>

            <l>Great numbers of the <hi>Trojans</hi> that way pass,</l>

            <l>But <hi>Neptune</hi> coming soon confirm'd them all,</l>

            <l>Upon your hands I chiefly did rely</l>
            <l>To save our Ships. If you be so remiss,</l>
            <l>The day is come in which we all must die</l>
            <l>By <hi>Hector</hi>'s hands. O strange! I never thought</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> durst to th'Ships have come so neer</l>
            <l>That heretofore peep out o'th'Town durst not,</l>

            <l>Of Leopards, Wolves, and other Beasts of Prey.</l>
            <l>For so at first they did. But you'll not fight</l>
            <l>For anger that the King had sent away</l>
            <l>Dishonoured the man of greatest might.</l>

               <hi>Hector</hi> has broken both the Bars and Gates,</l>

            <l>Thus <hi>Neptune</hi> the dismayed <hi>Greeks</hi> excites.</l>

            <l>The rest fought on, and mighty noise there was.</l>

            <l>There's none of us but understands the War,</l>

            <l>But <hi>Thoas,</hi> you that always heretofore</l>
            <l>Have fought so well, and set on other men,</l>
            <l>Still hold that purpose never giving ore.</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Idomeneus</hi> then <hi>Neptune</hi> said agen,</l>

               <hi>Idomeneus</hi> may that man ne're come back,</l>

            <l>That at this time is negligent or slack.</l>
            <l>But now put on your Arms and come away,</l>
            <l>And quickly. For although we are but two,</l>
            <l>Yet since conjoyned force of men not strong</l>

            <l>A Spear then said <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> there are</l>

            <l>For when I fight I stand neer to the Foe.</l>
            <l>And that's the cause so many Spears I have,</l>
            <l>And can so many Shields and Helmets show,</l>
            <l>And Armours for the breast great store and brave.</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Meriones,</hi> this need not have been said,</l>
            <l>I know your courage were it to be tri'd,</l>
            <l>And men somewhere in ambush to be laid</l>
            <l>(Where fear and courage are discerned best;</l>
            <l>For there 'tis seen who valiant are, who not.</l>

            <l>But in a valiant man there's none of this.</l>
            <l>He quietly abides without afright,</l>
            <l>When in the danger he engaged is;</l>
            <l>And longs for nothing but to come to fight)</l>
            <l>If you amongst them had been there, I know</l>
            <l>None of them such a fault in you had found.</l>

               <hi>Meriones</hi> sent after him a Spear,</l>
            <l>Which entring at his hinder parts, came out</l>
            <l>Beneath his Navel, and above his gear,</l>
            <l>Where wounds most fatal are. Then down he falls,</l>
            <l>And like a Cow that by the Horns is ty'd</l>
            <l>By strength of Swains, a little while he sprawls,</l>
            <l>But with the plucking out the Spear he dy'd.</l>
            <l>And then the Son of <hi>Priam Helenus</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With a broad Sword in hand all Steel of <hi>Thrace</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Upon the Helmet smote <hi>Deipyrus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who there fell down and dy'd upon the place.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> took up the Helmet at their feet.</l>
            <l>And griev'd thereat was <hi>Menelaus</hi> so</l>
            <l>That up he went with <hi>Helenus</hi> to meet</l>
            <l>Shaking his Spear. The other draws his Bow.</l>

            <l>But off the Arrow flew like chaff which fan'd</l>

            </l>
            <l>And dragging Hand and Spear himself withdrew</l>

            <l>The heavy Spear his friend <hi>Agenor</hi> drew,</l>

            <l>And then <hi>Pisandrus</hi> went to <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Betray'd thereto by cruel Destiny.</l>
            <l>For to have slain him in great hope he was.</l>
            <l>And when they were to one another nigh,</l>
            <l>First <hi>Menelaus</hi> threw his Spear, but wide.</l>
            <l>At him <hi>Pisandrus</hi> then his Spear lets fly.</l>
            <l>But passage being at the Shield deny'd,</l>
            <l>Beneath the brasen point in twain it crackt.</l>
            <l>Then to him with his Sword went <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And he to <hi>Menelaus</hi> with an Ax,</l>
            <l>VVhich cover'd with his Buckler ready was.</l>
            <l>And on his Helmet crest then fell the stroke.</l>
            <l>But he <hi>Pisandrus</hi> with his keen Sword hit</l>
            <l>Upon the Forehead near the Nose, which broke</l>
            <l>The Bone, and carry'd present death with it.</l>
            <l>His eyes unto the ground fell in the blood.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> kickt him as o'th' ground he lay,</l>
            <l>Then stript him of his Arms, and ore him stood</l>
            <l>Insulting, and reproaching those of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus, thus (said he) proud <hi>Trojans,</hi> you'll at last</l>
            <l>Be taught to quit our Ships, and have your fill</l>

            <l>But Father <hi>Jove,</hi> who (men say) art of all</l>

            <l>So that with Peace they never are content.</l>

            <l>Of Sleep, of Love, of Dance, and pleasant Song.</l>
            <l>And all men else with war may cloyed be.</l>
            <l>Only the <hi>Trojans</hi> still for fighting long.</l>

            <l>For of <hi>Harpalion</hi> he had been the guest,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Amongst the <hi>Argives</hi> one <hi>Euchenor</hi> was</l>

            <l>But for all that the Youngman valiantly</l>
            <l>Went with the <hi>Greeks</hi>; but ne'er came home again,</l>
            <l>Though he behav'd himself with caution there</l>

            <l>Not gotten by his Wife but by another.</l>
            <l>His Wife was call'd <hi>Eriopis.</hi> And he</l>

            <l>And so the <hi>Phthian</hi> Leaders were these two,</l>
            <l>And 'mongst the chief of the <hi>Boeotians</hi> sought</l>

            <l>Not all this while departed from the side</l>

            <l>Nor Spears, nor Helmets that defend the Head;</l>
            <l>But came to <hi>Troy</hi> with Bows and Arrows light.</l>
            <l>And in a standing Fight durst not abide.</l>
            <l>But from behind the <hi>Argive</hi> Ranks unseen,</l>
            <l>They <hi>Hector</hi> and his <hi>Trojans</hi> terrifi'd</l>
            <l>Incessantly with showrs of Arrows keen,</l>

            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> courage then was so allaid,</l>
            <l>That into <hi>Troy</hi> they all had run for fear,</l>
            <l>But that <hi>Polydamas</hi> to <hi>Hector</hi> said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> you are a man uncounsellable.</l>
            <l>Because in deeds of Arms you so excel,</l>
            <l>You think your self in Counsel too most able,</l>
            <l>As if all vertues must in one man dwell.</l>
            <l>The Gods to some have given well to fight,</l>
            <l>And others with the Muses they have grac'd;</l>
            <l>Others with Dance the people to delight;</l>
            <l>And in the minds of others Wisdom plac'd.</l>
            <l>The fruit whereof by many is enjoy'd:</l>
            <l>It Cities saves, as they that have it know,</l>
            <l>VVhich quickly would without it be destroy'd,</l>
            <l>But what we are to do I'll tell you now.</l>
            <l>The VVar now lyeth only on your hand:</l>
            <l>For since we past the VVall, some quite give ore,</l>
            <l>And armed as they were do idle stand,</l>
            <l>And th'Enemy than ours that fight are more.</l>
            <l>Therefore retire and call the Princes hither,</l>
            <l>That it may be determin'd by them all</l>
            <l>Upon mature deliberation, whether</l>
            <l>Upon the <hi>Argives</hi> at their Ships to fall</l>
            <l>(If so it please the Gods) or otherwise,</l>

            <l>How with most safety we may hence arise.</l>
            <l>For they are in our debt for yesterday.</l>
            <l>So said <hi>Polydamas,</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> thought</l>
            <l>The counsel not amiss, and streight obey'd.</l>
            <l>And armed from his Charriot leapt out,</l>
            <l>And standing on the ground unto him said,</l>

            <l>Where are <hi>Deiphobus</hi> and <hi>Helenus</hi>

            <l>And <hi>Adamas?</hi> Where are they to be seen?</l>

            <l>So <hi>Hector</hi> said, and <hi>Paris</hi> thus repli'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> there was for such words now no cause.</l>
            <l>Sometimes perhaps you may me justly chide.</l>
            <l>I do not think a Coward born I was.</l>
            <l>For since unto the Ships you brought the War,</l>
            <l>We with the <hi>Greeks</hi> perpetually have sought,</l>
            <l>But those you miss slain by the <hi>Argives</hi> are,</l>
            <l>Save that <hi>Deiphobus</hi> was carri'd out,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Helenus,</hi> both wounded in the hand.</l>
            <l>Now lead us on to what part you think fit.</l>
            <l>We ready are to do what you command,</l>

            <l>Sometimes to go t'<hi>Atrides</hi> he thought good,</l>

            <l>Whilst Shields and Helmets, all the way he past</l>
            <l>Resounded in his ears with frequent blows.</l>
            <l>And as he went the wounded Chiefs he met,</l>
            <l>Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed.</l>
            <l>For far off from the Fight the Ships were set,</l>

            <l>Only the foremost hawl'd were to the Plain,</l>
            <l>And close astern of those was built the Wall.</l>
            <l>For with so many Ships they crost the Main,</l>
            <l>That near the Field they could not place them all.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:93808:110"/>But side by side along the Shore they lay,</l>
            <l>And took up all the compass of the Bay.</l>
            <l>The wounded men, to look upon the Fray</l>
            <l>Helpt by their Spears went softly on the way,</l>
            <l>Griev'd at the heart, and met with <hi>Nestor</hi> there,</l>
            <l>Who with his coming made them more afraid.</l>
            <l>And when unto them <hi>Nestor</hi> was come near</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> spake, and to him said,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Nestor,</hi> Glory of the <hi>Argive</hi> Nation,</l>
            <l>I am affraid that <hi>Hector</hi> will make good</l>
            <l>That which he promis'd once in his Oration</l>
            <l>Before the <hi>Trojans</hi> when he boasting stood.</l>
            <l>I never will to <hi>Troy</hi> come back, said he,</l>
            <l>Till I have slain these <hi>Greeks,</hi> and set on fire</l>
            <l>Their Ships And now performed it will be.</l>
            <l>O strange! Do all the other <hi>Greeks</hi> conspire</l>
            <l>Against me with <hi>Achilles Thetis</hi> Son,</l>
            <l>And therefore are resolved not to fight?</l>
            <l>'Tis plain, said <hi>Nestor,</hi> some such thing is done,</l>
            <l>Else <hi>Jove</hi> himself could not with all his might</l>
            <l>Have made such work. The Wall is broken down</l>
            <l>In which to save our selves we did confide;</l>
            <l>And at the Ships they fight, nor was it known,</l>
            <l>Nor could it be observed on which side</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> that fighting were, were most distrest,</l>
            <l>So thick to th' ground in ev'ry part they fall.</l>
            <l>But let's consult what course to take were best,</l>
            <l>If counsel can do any thing at all.</l>
            <l>But that we all should fight I'll not advise.</l>
            <l>For what can wounded men in Battle do?</l>
            <l>To <hi>Nestor Agamemnon</hi> then replies,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nestor,</hi> since now the War is brought unto</l>
            <l>Our Ships, and that nor Wall nor Trench does good,</l>
            <l>And much the <hi>Argives</hi> suffer'd have who thought</l>
            <l>Their Wall for all the <hi>Trojans</hi> would have stood,</l>
            <l>And all our hopes built on it come to nought.</l>
            <l>(For though I know <hi>Jove</hi> once was to us kind,</l>
            <l>Yet now I see our ruine he designes,</l>
            <l>And pleasure takes in changing of his mind,</l>
            <l>And aids the <hi>Trojans</hi> whilst our hands he binds.)</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:93808:110"/>Let's all to what I saying am agree.</l>
            <l>The Ships that nearest lye to the Sea-side,</l>
            <l>Drawn down into the water let them be,</l>
            <l>And there till Night let them at Anchor ride.</l>
            <l>And if the <hi>Trojans</hi> then give over fight,</l>
            <l>We'll fetch away the rest. For 'tis less shame</l>
            <l>A danger to eschew, although by night,</l>
            <l>Than needlesly to perish in the same.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> frowning on him then reply'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides,</hi> what a word have you let fall?</l>
            <l>You ought of Cowards to have been the guide,</l>
            <l>And not of us <hi>Achaeans</hi> General.</l>
            <l>For we by <hi>Jove</hi> are fram'd for actions high,</l>
            <l>And to atchieve the Wars we undertake</l>
            <l>How dangerous soever, or to dye.</l>
            <l>And must we now the Siege of <hi>Troy</hi> forsake,</l>
            <l>And after so much labour lost go hence?</l>
            <l>Peace, let no other <hi>Greek</hi> hear what you say.</l>
            <l>Who would have said this that had common sense,</l>
            <l>And whom so great an Army did obey?</l>
            <l>Nor is, in how to fly, your counsel right.</l>
            <l>Must we our Ships draw down from off the Shore,</l>
            <l>And at the same time with the <hi>Trojans</hi> fight,</l>
            <l>Who now rejoice, but would do then much more?</l>
            <l>And we that fight be utterly destroy'd?</l>
            <l>For they that were at Anchor on the Main</l>
            <l>Would go their way the danger to avoid.</l>
            <l>Thus by your Counsel we should all be slain.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> to him then this answer gave.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> your reproof is very smart;</l>
            <l>Yet not command but counsel 'twas I gave,</l>
            <l>And better I would hear with all my heart.</l>
            <l>And so you shall, said <hi>Diomed,</hi> and though</l>
            <l>Amongst you all the youngest man I be,</l>
            <l>Be not offended with it. For you know</l>
            <l>That born I am of a good family.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Portheus</hi> three worthy Sons begat</l>
            <l>(In <hi>Calydon</hi> and <hi>Pleuron</hi> they all dwelled)</l>
            <l>

            <l>The other two in deeds of Arms excelled.</l>

               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:93808:111"/>Of him my Father <hi>Tydeus</hi> was the Son,</l>
            <l>But in exile at <hi>Argos</hi> led his life,</l>
            <l>And of <hi>Adrastus</hi>'s Daughters marry'd one,</l>

            <l>Therefore my counsel, if you find it good,</l>

            <l>The counsel I shall give you now is this.</l>
            <l>Let ev'ry man unto the Battle go,</l>
            <l>And place the wounded out o'th' reach o'th' shot,</l>

            <l>But like unto an aged man in sight</l>
            <l>Came in and took <hi>Atrides</hi> by the hand.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> heart (said he) now leaps to see</l>
            <l>The slaughter of the <hi>Argives</hi> and the flight,</l>
            <l>And joys therein, so little wit has he.</l>
            <l>May death and shame upon him for it light.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides,</hi> do not all the Gods mistrust.</l>
            <l>For sure I am you'll aided be by some,</l>
            <l>And see the <hi>Trojans</hi> fill the air with dust</l>
            <l>As from your Ships they fly to <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>This said, amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> he went about,</l>
            <l>And loud, as if nine or ten thousand men</l>
            <l>Together on a Plain had made a Shout,</l>
            <l>He shouted, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> took heart agen.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Juno</hi> standing on <hi>Olympus</hi> high</l>

            <l>Since th'other Gods of him stand all in awe.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Neptune</hi> to this replying first spake high.</l>
            <l>Good as he is, said he, it is not Law,</l>
            <l>Thus to usurp upon my liberty.</l>
            <l>For Sons and Heirs of <hi>Saturn</hi> we were three</l>
            <l>Begot on <hi>Rhea. Pluto, Jove,</hi> and I.</l>
            <l>By lot the Rule o'th' Waters came to me.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Jove</hi> the Government of Heaven fell,</l>
            <l>And of the Clouds, and the Ethereal Sky.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Pluto</hi> Darkness, and the rule of Hell.</l>
            <l>Earth and <hi>Olympus</hi> did as Common lye.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Jove</hi> then with his share contented be,</l>
            <l>And not encroach on me. For well 'tis known</l>
            <l>I hold not any thing of him in Fee,</l>
            <l>But live as he should do, upon my own.</l>
            <l>He should not unto me such language use,</l>
            <l>But to his Children that will be affraid,</l>
            <l>And dare not what he bids them, to refuse.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Neptune</hi> spake. Again then <hi>Iris</hi> said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Neptune,</hi> shall I this haughty answer carry</l>
            <l>To <hi>Jove?</hi> And will you that I with it go</l>
            <l>As 'tis? The Wise their minds oft vary;</l>
            <l>And Fury on the Eldest wait you know.</l>
            <l>So she to him. Then <hi>Neptune</hi> thus to her.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Iris,</hi> this word was spoken in good season.</l>
            <l>Much worth, I see, is a wise Messenger.</l>
            <l>But I was vext, because thus without reason</l>
            <l>(When I his equal am by Birth and Lot)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> uses me as if I were his slave.</l>
            <l>Well. For the present, cross him I will not</l>
            <l>Though I be vext. That answer let him have.</l>
            <l>And further, That if he without consent</l>
            <l>Of me, <hi>Athena, Juno, Mercurie,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Vulcan, Troy</hi> shall spare, our discontent</l>
            <l>For th'<hi>Argives</hi> wrong, implacable will be.</l>
            <l>And when he this had said, he Fight forbears,</l>
            <l>Nor any longer 'mongst the <hi>Argives</hi> staid,</l>
            <l>But div'd into the Sea ore head and ears.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> unto <hi>Apollo</hi> spake, and said,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:93808:118"/>To <hi>Hector</hi> go; for <hi>Neptune</hi> now is gone</l>
            <l>For fear of my displeasure; had he stay'd,</l>
            <l>The Sons of <hi>Saturn</hi> of our War had known.</l>
            <l>'Twas wisely done of him my hand t'avoid.</l>
            <l>And better both for him and me; but go,</l>
            <l>And shaking your great Shield the <hi>Greeks</hi> affright,</l>
            <l>And strengthen <hi>Hector</hi> and incourage so</l>
            <l>That he the <hi>Argive</hi> Lords may put to flight.</l>
            <l>And follow them down to the <hi>Hellespont,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And make them for their hollow Ships to fight.</l>
            <l>What then is to be done? I'll think upon't.</l>
            <l>For I intend not to destroy them quite.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Apollo</hi> left his Father <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And down he came to <hi>Troy</hi> from <hi>Ida</hi> hill</l>
            <l>Swift as a Falcon flying at a Dove,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> on the ground found sitting still,</l>
            <l>Not laid, but to his Senses come anew,</l>
            <l>And freely breathing, although very weak,</l>
            <l>And very well his friends about him knew.</l>
            <l>There <hi>Phoebus</hi> standing nigh did to him speak.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> said he, why sit you here alone?</l>
            <l>O kindest of the Gods, said he, you know</l>
            <l>That <hi>Ajax</hi> wounded has me with a Stone,</l>
            <l>So that I am disabled with the blow,</l>
            <l>And once to day I thought I should have gone</l>
            <l>To <hi>Erebus</hi> with other shadows dim;</l>
            <l>With such a force he threw the mighty stone.</l>
            <l>Then thus again <hi>Apollo</hi> answered him.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> I <hi>Phoebus</hi> am, and hither come</l>
            <l>From <hi>Jove,</hi> against the <hi>Greeks</hi> to give you aid,</l>
            <l>And ever have wisht well to <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Lead to the Ships your Troops. Be not afraid.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector</hi> at this encourag'd was again,</l>
            <l>And as a Horse at Rack and Manger fed</l>
            <l>Breaking his Headstal scudds upon the Plain,</l>

            <l>His Mane upon his shoulders plays with th'Air</l>

            <l>Rouse a fierce Lion, they the Prey let go</l>
            <l>To save it self i'th'Woods or Rochers high,</l>
            <l>And both the men and dogs are forc'd to fly;</l>
            <l>Just so the <hi>Greeks</hi> whilst they in Bodies fight,</l>
            <l>They save themselves; but seeing <hi>Hector</hi> nigh</l>
            <l>They troubled were, and lost their courage quite.</l>
            <l>Then to them spake <hi>Thoas Andraemon</hi>'s Son,</l>
            <l>Well skill'd at distance or at hand to fight</l>
            <l>Amongst th'<hi>Aetolians</hi> better there was none,</l>
            <l>And few compare with him for Counsel might.</l>
            <l>O strange, said he, what wondrous sight is this!</l>
            <l>I verily thought <hi>Hector</hi> had been slain</l>
            <l>By <hi>Ajax</hi> hand. But see he risen is.</l>
            <l>Some God or other rais'd him has again,</l>
            <l>He kill'd us has already many men,</l>
            <l>And many more is likely now to slay.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Jupiter</hi> defends him now as then.</l>
            <l>But come, let's all my Counsel now obey.</l>
            <l>Let us that most pretend to Fortitude</l>
            <l>Stay here imbattl'd to receive the Fo,</l>
            <l>And to the Ships send back the multitude.</l>
            <l>For thither, I think, <hi>Hector</hi> dares not go:</l>
            <l>This Counsel was approv'd, and then stood out</l>
            <l>Ajax, Idomeneus, Meriones,</l>

            <l>Their heavie hearts fell down into their feet,</l>

            <l>The flying <hi>Greeks</hi> into the Ditch leapt all,</l>
            <l>And there encumber'd mightily with Stakes</l>

            <l>Into the Trench threw down the Earth again,</l>
            <l>And made an easie and plain passage through it</l>
            <l>As far as one a Spear can well hurl, when</l>

            <l>Then comes into their heads another toy,</l>
            <l>And down they push this with their feet or hands;</l>
            <l>So easily <hi>Apollo</hi> did destroy</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> mighty work, and bring the fight</l>
            <l>Again unto the Ships. Where now they pray'd,</l>

               <hi>Nestor</hi> to Heaven held up his hands and said,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Jove,</hi> if you the Sacrifice accepted have</l>
            <l>Of any <hi>Greek</hi> before he hither came,</l>

            <l>Here <hi>Ajax</hi> with a long Spear in his hand</l>
            <l>Killed <hi>Caletor, Hector</hi>'s Brother's Son,</l>
            <l>As he was coming with a flaming brand</l>
            <l>To fire the Ship, and di'd before 'twas done.</l>
            <l>This <hi>Hector</hi> saw, and to his fellows cri'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Trojans</hi> and friends defend the body dead</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Clytius</hi> Son, and shrink not from my side.</l>
            <l>And as he spake his long Spear from him fled,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:93808:121"/>Which (aim'd at <hi>Ajax</hi>) fell on <hi>Lycophron,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A man that was to <hi>Ajax</hi> very dear,</l>
            <l>But born at <hi>Cythera,</hi> and <hi>Mastors</hi> Son,</l>
            <l>That having kill'd a man durst not stay there,</l>
            <l>But unto <hi>Ajax</hi> fled, and with him stay'd,</l>
            <l>Till now by <hi>Hector</hi>'s Spear struck through the head</l>
            <l>He di'd. Then <hi>Ajax</hi> to his Brother said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Teucer,</hi> our friend <hi>Mastorides</hi> is dead.</l>
            <l>You know how much we honour'd him at home.</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>Hector</hi> that has slain him. Where are now</l>
            <l>Your deadly Arrows? And what is become</l>

            <l>Which <hi>Teucer</hi> hearing quickly with him was</l>
            <l>With Bow and Quiver in his hand, and shot,</l>
            <l>And slew the Servant of <hi>Polydamas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That had the guiding of his Chariot</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Clitus</hi> by name, who while in vain he sought</l>
            <l>By driving to where hottest was the fight,</l>
            <l>From <hi>Hector</hi> and the <hi>Trojans</hi> thanks t'have got,</l>
            <l>The fatal Arrow on his Neck did light.</l>
            <l>Then down he fell. The frighted Horses shook</l>
            <l>The empty Charre. Then came <hi>Polydamas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And by the heads the capring Horses took,</l>
            <l>And sets <hi>Astynous</hi> in <hi>Clitus</hi> place;</l>
            <l>And gave him a strict charge to hold them nigh,</l>
            <l>But not to come with them into the Fight.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Teucer</hi> lets another Arrow fly</l>
            <l>At <hi>Hector,</hi> which if it had hit him right,</l>
            <l>He never at the Ships again had fought.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Jupiter</hi> was pleas'd to save him now,</l>
            <l>And brake the Bow-string. Then in vain flew out</l>
            <l>The Arrow, and into the dust the Bow.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Teucer</hi> to his Brother made his moan.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax,</hi> said he, is't not a wondrous thing?</l>
            <l>My Bow is started from my hand and gone,</l>
            <l>Some God or other broken has the String.</l>
            <l>Yet new 'twas made this morning purposely</l>
            <l>To last all day. <hi>Teucer,</hi> said <hi>Ajax</hi> then,</l>
            <l>Cannot you let your Bow and Quiver lie,</l>
            <l>And fight with Spear in hand like other men,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:93808:121"/>And give unto the <hi>Greeks</hi> encouragement?</l>
            <l>No. Though the Gods above should in their hate</l>
            <l>To let the <hi>Trojans</hi> take our Ships be bent,</l>
            <l>Yet let us sell them at a lusty rate.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Teucer</hi> then laid his Bow up in his Tent,</l>
            <l>And arm'd himself with Helmet and with Shield,</l>
            <l>And a good Spear, and back to <hi>Ajax</hi> went,</l>
            <l>And found him where he left him in the Field.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Hector</hi> saw that <hi>Teucer</hi>'s noble Bow</l>
            <l>Was useless now, he to his Squadrons cry'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Lycians</hi> come on boldly now,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Teucer</hi> now his Bow hath laid aside.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> brake the String. I saw it with these eyes.</l>
            <l>For easily it may discerned be</l>
            <l>To whom the hand of <hi>Jove</hi> intends the Prize,</l>
            <l>And to whom he denies the Victory.</l>
            <l>And now upon our side he is you see,</l>
            <l>And from the <hi>Greeks</hi> their courage takes away.</l>
            <l>Then to the Ships let's go couragiously,</l>
            <l>And let the fear of death no man dismay.</l>
            <l>For why should any of us fear to dye?</l>
            <l>When for his Country 'tis, it is no shame.</l>
            <l>And if we make the Enemy to fly,</l>
            <l>Sav'd are his Wife and Children, Goods, and Name.</l>
            <l>Whilst <hi>Hector</hi> thus the <hi>Trojans</hi> did excite,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> unto the <hi>Argives</hi> spake, and said,</l>
            <l>We must now either put our Foes to flight,</l>
            <l>Or make account we shall be all destroy'd.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Hector</hi> here to burn our Ships should chance,</l>
            <l>Can you go home again (d'ye think) afoot?</l>
            <l>He calleth on his men. 'Tis not to dance,</l>
            <l>But fire our Ships if we will let him do't.</l>
            <l>For us 'tis better in close Fight to die</l>
            <l>Here all at once, or get the Victory</l>
            <l>Than here, God knows how long consuming lie</l>
            <l>And peck in vain at a weak Enemy.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Ajax</hi> rais'd the courage of th'<hi>Achaeans.</hi>

            <l>From the beginning such was his designe</l>

            <l>Now <hi>Hector</hi> looking where the best men stood</l>

            <l>His friends, though many standing by him were,</l>
            <l>And griev'd to see him fall, did him no good.</l>
            <l>For ev'ry one now for himself did fear,</l>
            <l>And out of <hi>Hector</hi>'s way kept all he cou'd.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> retreated were no further yet</l>
            <l>Than to between the first and second Row</l>
            <l>Of th'<hi>Argive</hi> Ships; but forc'd that place to quit,</l>
            <l>Near to their Tents themselves they rally now.</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Nestor</hi> them encouraged agen.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Argives,</hi> my friends, be valiant now (said he)</l>
            <l>And if at any time now play the men.</l>
            <l>Of one anothers Censures fearful be.</l>
            <l>Besides, by what you should be moved most,</l>
            <l>Your Parents, Children, Wives, and Goods and Land,</l>
            <l>Whether you have them still or have them lost.</l>
            <l>I you conjure against the Foe to stand.</l>
            <l>This <hi>Nestor</hi> said, the <hi>Argives</hi> to exite:</l>
            <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> from them took the Mist again,</l>
            <l>That they might see who did, who did not fight</l>
            <l>Both at the Ships and elswhere on the Plain.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Ajax Telamonius</hi> thought not good</l>
            <l>To stay with other <hi>Argives</hi> in the throng,</l>
            <l>But up into a Ship he went and stood</l>
            <l>With a Ship spear twenty two Cubits long.</l>
            <l>As when a man that taught has been to guide</l>
            <l>Four Horses at a time, and in his hand</l>
            <l>Holdeth their Reins while they go side by side,</l>
            <l>And people on the way admiring stand,</l>
            <l>He from one Horse unto another skips,</l>
            <l>And makes them run together to the Town;</l>
            <l>So <hi>Ajax</hi> ore the <hi>Argives</hi> ranged Ships</l>
            <l>To save them, and the Tents ran up and down.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:93808:124"/>And terribly unto the <hi>Argives</hi> cry'd</l>
            <l>To play the men. Nor <hi>Hector</hi> 'mongst his Troops</l>
            <l>Could be perswaded longer to abide;</l>
            <l>But suddenly as a black Eagle stoops</l>
            <l>At a great Flock of Geese, or Cranes, or Swans;</l>
            <l>So <hi>Hector</hi> of the <hi>Argive</hi> Ships to one</l>
            <l>Flew down, and <hi>Jove</hi> with his puissant hands</l>
            <l>Behind him marching alwaies pusht him on.</l>
            <l>Then at the Ships the Fight began again,</l>
            <l>More cruel than before. You would have said</l>
            <l>They had no sense of weariness or pain,</l>
            <l>So mightily they all about them laid.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> were in despair of their return.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> thought the <hi>Argive</hi> Lords to rout,</l>
            <l>And all the Ships that brought them thither burn.</l>
            <l>Thus minded on each side they fiercely fought.</l>
            <l>Upon a Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then <hi>Hector</hi> laid his hand,</l>
            <l>Which brought <hi>Protesilaus</hi> unto <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But never back unto his native Land.</l>
            <l>For this good Ship they one another slay.</l>
            <l>Arrows and Darts no longer slew about;</l>
            <l>But now with Battle-axes of great strength</l>
            <l>In one anothers reach they stood and fought,</l>
            <l>And with great Spears and of a mighty length,</l>
            <l>And great keen Swords, whereof from dying hands</l>
            <l>Abundance fell on either side to th' ground;</l>
            <l>And covered were with streaming bloud the Sands,</l>
            <l>That gushed out from many a ghastly wound.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> on the Ship his hand held fast,</l>
            <l>And to his <hi>Trojans</hi> call'd aloud for Fire.</l>
            <l>This day, said he, requites our ill days past.</l>
            <l>To burn these Ships. <hi>Jove</hi> with us doth conspire.</l>
            <l>And set on fire they had been long ago</l>
            <l>(For I would gladly at the Ships have fought)</l>
            <l>But that the Senate would not have it so,</l>
            <l>And kept both you and me from going out.</l>
            <l>But though by <hi>Jove</hi> then smitten were their hearts,</l>
            <l>Yet boldly now himself he leads us on.</l>
            <l>This said, the <hi>Trojans</hi> bravely play their parts,</l>
            <l>And with more vigour fought than they had done.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:93808:124"/>Then on the Deck no longer <hi>Ajax</hi> stay'd,</l>
            <l>So many Spears went singing by his head.</l>
            <l>For if he there had stood he was afraid</l>
            <l>That some unlucky Spear would strike him dead;</l>
            <l>And to the far side of the Ship retreats,</l>
            <l>Leaving the Deck which fenceless was and high,</l>
            <l>And sat upon one of the Rowers seats,</l>
            <l>And still upon the <hi>Trojans</hi> kept his eye.</l>
            <l>And thence he from the fire the Ship defends,</l>
            <l>And terribly on th'<hi>Argive</hi> Heroes calls</l>
            <l>To do their best. We have, said he, no friends</l>
            <l>Behinde to save our lives, nor better Walls</l>
            <l>Than those we made; nor any City nigh,</l>
            <l>That can or willing are our part to take.</l>
            <l>But far from home in hostile ground we lie,</l>
            <l>And hemmed in are by the briny lake;</l>
            <l>And nothing can redeem us but our hands.</l>
            <l>This said, he lookt about him furiously</l>
            <l>To see if any durst approach with Brands,</l>
            <l>Resolv'd to kill him that with Fire came nigh.</l>
            <l>And many to the Ship with Fire were sent</l>
            <l>By <hi>Hector</hi>; but when they approached near,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> continually did them prevent,</l>
            <l>And twelve he killed with his Naval Spear.</l>

            <l>THus fiercely fought the <hi>Trojans</hi> and the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And with <hi>Achilles</hi> was <hi>Patroclus</hi> now</l>
            <l>With tears abundance running down his Cheeks,</l>
            <l>Like Springs that from a high Rock streaming flow.</l>
            <l>No sooner him <hi>Achilles</hi> weeping spi'd</l>
            <l>But piti'd him. Why weep you so, said he,</l>
            <l>Like a Childe running by his Mothers side,</l>
            <l>And holding by her Coat would carri'd be?</l>
            <l>Bring you some News that none but you can tell?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Menoetius</hi> and <hi>Peleus</hi> still do live</l>
            <l>At <hi>Phthia</hi> with the <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> and well.</l>
            <l>If not, we both have cause enough to grieve.</l>
            <l>Or is it that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are slaughter'd so,</l>
            <l>And fall before the Ships? 'tis for their pride?</l>
            <l>Speak what's the matter, that we both may know.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> sobbing to him then repli'd,</l>
            <l>O Son of <hi>Peleus,</hi> of all <hi>Greeks</hi> the best,</l>
            <l>Forgive me if in this necessity</l>
            <l>I freely speak. They that excel the rest</l>
            <l>In Prowess, at the Ships all wounded lie.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> wounded is and <hi>Diomed,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Eurypylus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And cur'd may be, but stand us in no sted;</l>
            <l>Nor does your Vertue any good to us.</l>
            <l>O Gods let never anger in me dwell</l>
            <l>Like this of yours. If you cannot, who can</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> from the <hi>Argive</hi> Fleet repel,</l>
            <l>And save so many lives? O cruel man!</l>
            <l>The noble <hi>Peleus</hi> sure was not your Father;</l>
            <l>Born of the Goddess <hi>Thetis</hi> you were not.</l>
            <l>Sprung from the raging Sea I think you rather,</l>
            <l>And that by some hard Rock you were begot.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:93808:125"/>But if you stand upon some Prophecie,</l>
            <l>Or <hi>Thetis</hi> have forbidden you to fight</l>
            <l>From <hi>Jove,</hi> yet send some <hi>Myrmidons</hi> with me,</l>
            <l>That I may to the <hi>Argives</hi> give some light.</l>
            <l>But in your Armour let me be array'd,</l>
            <l>That when they see me they may think me you,</l>
            <l>And back into the City run dismay'd,</l>
            <l>And th'<hi>Argives</hi> wearied take breath anew.</l>
            <l>For long the <hi>Trojans</hi> have endur'd the Fight;</l>
            <l>And if fresh Enemies they coming see,</l>
            <l>With little labour they'll be put to flight,</l>
            <l>And leave the <hi>Argive</hi> Tents and Navy free.</l>
            <l>Thus prayed he, but 'gainst himself he pray'd,</l>
            <l>And rashly su'd to cast his life away.</l>
            <l>To this <hi>Achilles</hi> answer made and said,</l>
            <l>My dear <hi>Patroclus</hi> what is this you say?</l>
            <l>I stand not on, nor care for Prophecy,</l>
            <l>Nor yet by <hi>Jove</hi> forbidden am to fight;</l>
            <l>But at my heart it lieth grievously,</l>
            <l>My equal should oppress me by meer might.</l>
            <l>A Town I won, in which we found great Prey.</l>
            <l>For my reward the <hi>Greeks</hi> gave me a Maid,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> from me took away,</l>
            <l>Only because more people him obey'd,</l>
            <l>As if I were a man of little worth.</l>
            <l>But let that pass. Though once I never meant</l>
            <l>My <hi>Myrmidons</hi> should with the <hi>Greeks</hi> go forth</l>
            <l>To Battle till the Foes were at my Tent,</l>
            <l>Yet since the <hi>Argive</hi> Ships with such a mist</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Trojans</hi> on the shore environ'd lie,</l>
            <l>And th'<hi>Argives</hi> wanting room can scarce resist,</l>
            <l>And have the pow'r of <hi>Troy</hi> for enemy,</l>
            <l>Take you my Arms and lead unto the Fight</l>
            <l>The <hi>Myrmidons.</hi> The <hi>Trojans</hi> shall not see</l>
            <l>My Helmet neer, to put them in a fright.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had been just to me,</l>
            <l>The Ditches had been fill'd with <hi>Trojans</hi> dead.</l>
            <l>But now into the very Camp they break;</l>
            <l>Nor can resisted be by <hi>Diomed.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To save the Ships <hi>Tydides</hi> is too weak.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:93808:126"/>Nor can that hateful mouth of <hi>Atreus</hi> Son</l>
            <l>Be heard for <hi>Hector,</hi> who the Air doth fill</l>
            <l>With roaring to the <hi>Trojans</hi> to fall on,</l>
            <l>And shouting of the <hi>Trojans</hi> as they kill.</l>
            <l>Yet so, <hi>Patroclus,</hi> charge them lustily,</l>
            <l>For fear the Ships should all be set on fire;</l>
            <l>Then lost the <hi>Greeks</hi> are without remedy,</l>
            <l>And to their Country never shall retire.</l>
            <l>But now what I shall say give ear unto.</l>
            <l>To th'end the <hi>Greeks</hi> may honour me, and send</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Briseis</hi> back with Gifts, you thus must do.</l>
            <l>When you have freed the Ships, there make an end</l>
            <l>And come away. If <hi>Jove</hi> give you success</l>
            <l>No longer without me pursue the Fight.</l>
            <l>'Twill make my honour with the <hi>Greeks</hi> the less.</l>
            <l>Nor in the slaughter take so much delight</l>
            <l>As to proceed up to the Walls of <hi>Troy</hi>;</l>
            <l>Lest by some God or other you be checkt.</l>
            <l>But having freed the Ships come straight away</l>
            <l>(<hi>Apollo</hi> has for <hi>Troy</hi> a great respect)</l>
            <l>And leave both sides to fight upon the Plain</l>
            <l>Till (grant it O ye Gods) there left are none,</l>
            <l>But you and I, the Town of <hi>Troy</hi> to gain.</l>
            <l>Thus they to one another talkt alone.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> by this time from the Ship was gone,</l>
            <l>Forc'd by the Spears that from the <hi>Trojans</hi> flew,</l>
            <l>And weakned by the hand of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Son.</l>
            <l>For at his head the <hi>Trojans</hi> always threw,</l>
            <l>And forc'd he was to hold his great Shield high,</l>
            <l>And weari'd was thereby his Buckler-hand.</l>
            <l>With Spear in hand no <hi>Trojan</hi> durst come nigh,</l>
            <l>But pelting him with Spears aloof they stand.</l>
            <l>The sweat ran down his Limbs, nor could he well,</l>
            <l>Though mightily for breath he pull'd, respire.</l>
            <l>Now tell me Muses that in Heav'n do dwell,</l>
            <l>How came the Ship first to be set on fire?</l>
            <l>Thus. <hi>Hector</hi> with his broad Sword at a blow</l>
            <l>The Spear of <hi>Ajax</hi> chanc'd to cut in twain</l>
            <l>Where to the staff the head was fixt, and so</l>
            <l>His mighty Naval Spear he shook in vain.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:93808:126"/>The head of Brass flew humming to the ground.</l>
            <l>This <hi>Ajax</hi> saw, and frighted was to see</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> thus the counsel of the <hi>Greeks</hi> confound,</l>
            <l>To give unto the <hi>Trojans</hi> Victorie,</l>
            <l>And went his way. Then in the <hi>Trojans</hi> came</l>
            <l>With Brands of flaming fire; and presently</l>
            <l>The hind part of the Ship was all in flame.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> with his hand then clapt his Thigh</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Patroclus</hi> said, A flame I see</l>
            <l>Rise at the Ships. 'Tis time that you were gone,</l>
            <l>Lest our Retreat should intercepted be.</l>
            <l>Away and quickly put my Armour on.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Patroclus</hi> first of all puts on</l>
            <l>His Boots of War, and to his legs them ti'd</l>
            <l>With Silver Clasps; and next of <hi>Thetis</hi> Son</l>
            <l>The Breast-plate good he to his Breast appli'd</l>
            <l>With Golden Stars like Heaven beautifi'd.</l>
            <l>His Sword then ore his shoulder he puts on,</l>
            <l>With Silver Studs to hang down by his side;</l>
            <l>And then his Helmet shining like the Sun</l>
            <l>He puts upon his head; and last of all</l>
            <l>He took two Spears that fit were for his hand.</l>
            <l>But not that which <hi>Achilles</hi> fought withal.</l>
            <l>For that none but <hi>Achilles</hi> could command.</l>
            <l>A great and strong and heavy Spear it was,</l>
            <l>Made of an Ash cut down i'th' woody hill</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Pelius,</hi> and by <hi>Chiron</hi> given 'twas</l>
            <l>To <hi>Peleus,</hi> his mighty Foes to kill.</l>
            <l>Then to <hi>Achilles</hi> Charre <hi>Automedon</hi>
            </l>

            <l>While by his Charre <hi>Patroclus</hi> arming stands,</l>
            <l>Apace from Tent to Tent <hi>Achilles</hi> runs,</l>

            <l>

            <l>Like Wolves that on a lusty Stag had fed,</l>
            <l>And lapping stain'd the River with his blood,</l>
            <l>With Bellies full and hearts encouraged.</l>
            <l>When they together were, <hi>Achilles</hi> then</l>
            <l>Appointed who i'th'Field should them command.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Troy</hi> he Ships brought with him five times ten,</l>
            <l>From ev'ry Ship came fifty men to land.</l>
            <l>And then five Bodies he made of them all,</l>
            <l>And Captains five by whom they led should be.</l>
            <l>But was himself the Captain-General;</l>
            <l>For of the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> the King was he.</l>
            <l>Of these five Captains one <hi>Menestius</hi> was,</l>
            <l>Who was the River <hi>Sperchius</hi> his Son,</l>
            <l>And by the name of <hi>Boro</hi> then did pass</l>
            <l>His Mother was of <hi>Peleus</hi> Daughters one,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Polydora</hi> was her name. And she</l>
            <l>To <hi>Perierus</hi> had been married,</l>
            <l>And for his Wife reputed constantly</l>
            <l>Before she was of <hi>M'nestius</hi> brought to bed.</l>
            <l>The second Bands were by <hi>Eudorus</hi> led,</l>
            <l>The Son of <hi>Polymela</hi> a fair Maid.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hermes</hi> of her became enamoured,</l>
            <l>As at a Dance her Beauty he survay'd.</l>
            <l>It was upon <hi>Diana</hi>'s Holy-day</l>
            <l>He saw her dancing, and at night he got</l>
            <l>Unseen into her bed and with her lay,</l>
            <l>And his brave Son <hi>Eudorus</hi> then begot.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Echecles</hi> she after married.</l>
            <l>Her Father <hi>Phylas</hi> to him took her Son,</l>
            <l>And unto mans estate him nourished,</l>
            <l>And lov'd no less than if t'had been his own.</l>
            <l>The third <hi>Pisandrus</hi> led that swift could run,</l>
            <l>And had at fighting with a Spear more art</l>
            <l>In bloudy War than any <hi>Myrmidon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Amongst them all (<hi>Patroclus</hi> set apart.)</l>
            <l>The fourth was by the old Knight <hi>Phoenix</hi> led.</l>
            <l>And of the fifth, charge had <hi>Alcimedon.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When they were all together gathered,</l>
            <l>Unto them sharply thus spake <hi>Thetis</hi> Son.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:93808:127"/>Ye <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> said he, remember now,</l>
            <l>How all the time I kept you have from fight,</l>
            <l>You have the <hi>Trojans</hi> threatned hard; and how</l>
            <l>You said my Mother fed me had with Gall,</l>
            <l>And in great tumult bid me let you go,</l>
            <l>Or at the Ships upon the <hi>Trojans</hi> fall.</l>
            <l>Lo there before you is the War you crave.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> are about to burn the Fleet;</l>
            <l>Do you your utmost now the same to save.</l>
            <l>Let him that brags of Valour let us see't.</l>
            <l>This said, the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> became more keen,</l>
            <l>Because they saw the King had chang'd his mind;</l>
            <l>And presently into their Ranks fell in,</l>
            <l>And close themselves to one another joyn'd.</l>
            <l>As close as in a Wall are laid the stones</l>
            <l>By him that means his House shall keep out wind;</l>
            <l>So close together stood the <hi>Myrmidons.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Helmets with Helmets, Shields with Shields conjoyn'd.</l>
            <l>Before them all two good men armed went,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Automedon</hi> to th'Fight.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then returned to his Tent,</l>
            <l>Where stood a Chest most beautiful to sight,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Thetis</hi> gave him when he went to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Wherein were Carpets, Coats, and Cloaks laid up,</l>
            <l>To keep him warm when he a Ship-board lay;</l>
            <l>And in the same was kept a dainty Cup.</l>
            <l>In which no other man ere drank but he,</l>
            <l>Though 'twere to offer to the Gods above.</l>
            <l>Nor he himself (such was his nicetie)</l>
            <l>Ere in it drank but offering to <hi>Jove.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then with Sulphur scour'd the Cup,</l>
            <l>And having rins'd it clean with water fair,</l>
            <l>And washt his hands, went out and held it up</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> is a man of War alone,</l>
            <l>And not then only when I with him go.</l>
            <l>And when he has the <hi>Trojans</hi> driven from</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argive</hi> Ships, then grant, O <hi>Jove,</hi> he may</l>
            <l>With all his <hi>Myrmidons</hi> safe hither come,</l>
            <l>With all their Arms and make no longer stay.</l>

               <hi>Jove</hi> nodded; but the other half deni'd.</l>
            <l>He granted him to save the Ships from fire;</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> when he offer'd had and pray'd,</l>

            <l>For they suppos'd <hi>Achilles</hi> now was there,</l>
            <l>And that his discontent was past and gone.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> first of all lets fly his Spear</l>
            <l>Amongst the thickest of the Foes, about</l>

            <l>Not only these he frighted had, but all,</l>

            <l>When than the Hills the Mist is gotten higher;</l>

            <l>And cover'd with his Shield oft shifted ground.</l>
            <l>And though he knew the honour of the day</l>
            <l>Would fall unto th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> in the end,</l>
            <l>Yet from the Field he went not straight away,</l>

            <l>And after him the <hi>Trojans</hi> take their heels,</l>

            <l>Whom he himself encourage will to fight,</l>

            <l>For thrice he mounted and was thrice put back</l>
            <l>By the Immortal hand; but when again</l>
            <l>He mounting was, <hi>Apollo</hi> to him spake.</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> at these words great fear was in,</l>
            <l>And far off from the Wall himself withdrew.</l>

            <l>In likeness of his Uncle <hi>Asius,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Him sharply did for standing idle chide.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> said he, why stay you here? If I</l>
            <l>Exceeded you in strength as you do me,</l>
            <l>I teach you would, in such necessity</l>

            <l>Away went <hi>Phoebus</hi> when he this had said.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> then returned to the Fight</l>
            <l>While <hi>Phoebus</hi> did the <hi>Argive</hi> throng dismay.</l>

            <l>Above his Eyes upon his Forehead just</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> hit him with the knobby stone.</l>
            <l>Then from his Seat he dropt into the dust.</l>
            <l>Broke was his Skull, his Eye-brows crusht int'one,</l>
            <l>And at his feet before him fell his eyes.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> scoft and said 'tis nimbly done.</l>

            <l>To <hi>Argos</hi> with you when you went away.</l>
            <l>Were you so simple that you could not see,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Hector</hi> with his Horses and his Spear</l>
            <l>Protects the <hi>Trojans</hi> from Captivitie?</l>
            <l>Now shall you for the Dogs and Fowls lie here;</l>
            <l>Nor can <hi>Achilles</hi> do you any good,</l>
            <l>That bad you ('t may be) when you from him went,</l>
            <l>Not to return, till dyed in his blood</l>
            <l>You <hi>Hector</hi>'s Coat had from his shoulders rent.</l>
            <l>And vain enough you were to promise it.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> with a feeble voice repli'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> you now may boast as you think fit,</l>
            <l>And in your own Ability take pride.</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Apollo</hi> first my death I owe, who threw</l>
            <l>My Armour from my body to the ground;</l>
            <l>I could have slain else twenty such as you.</l>
            <l>And from <hi>Euphorbus</hi> I receiv'd a wound.</l>
            <l>To bring me down; you were but one of three.</l>
            <l>But hear me and remember what I say,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> you will not long live after me,</l>
            <l>And only for <hi>Achilles</hi> hand you stay.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:93808:135"/>And at these words he was of life bereft.</l>
            <l>His Soul unto th'Infernal Regions fled</l>
            <l>Lamenting so much Youth and Vigour left;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> to him spake again though dead.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus,</hi> why do you foretel my death?</l>
            <l>Who knows but that <hi>Achilles</hi> may be slain</l>
            <l>By me first, and before me lose his breath?</l>
            <l>This said, he pulled out the Spear again.</l>
            <l>And presently pursu'd <hi>Automedon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who of <hi>Achilles</hi> was the Charretier;</l>
            <l>But he away was carried and gone</l>

            <l>ANd <hi>Menelaus</hi> understanding now</l>
            <l>That slain <hi>Patroclus</hi> lay upon the ground,</l>
            <l>Careful, as of her first Calf is a Cow,</l>
            <l>To th'Body went and walkt about it round,</l>
            <l>Couching his Spear and holding out his Shield,</l>
            <l>Resolv'd to kill him whosoe'er he was</l>
            <l>That durst to stand against him in the Field.</l>
            <l>Then to him said <hi>Euphorbus, Menelaus</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Retire, let me advise you, from the dead.</l>
            <l>For I am he that gave him the first wound,</l>
            <l>That with his Arms I may be honoured;</l>
            <l>Lest with my Spear I strike you to the ground.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Menelaus</hi> to him thus repli'd.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in Lion never was,</l>
            <l>Nor yet in Panther, nor in Boar such pride</l>
            <l>(Though other Beasts in strength they far surpass)</l>
            <l>As in these Sons of <hi>Panthus.</hi> Though they know,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Hyperenor</hi> proudly me defi'd,</l>
            <l>And spitefully did value me below</l>
            <l>All other <hi>Greeks,</hi> that by my hand he di'd.</l>
            <l>And sorry were his Parents and his Wife</l>
            <l>Now you succeed will to your Brother's fate.</l>
            <l>Be gone then if you mean to save your life,</l>
            <l>And quickly, or you will be wise too late.</l>
            <l>No <hi>Menelaus</hi> (said <hi>Euphorbus</hi> then)</l>
            <l>Since you have griev'd his Parents and his Wife,</l>
            <l>'Tis best, I think, to comfort them agen,</l>
            <l>By making you pay for it with your life.</l>
            <l>For though intolerable be their grief,</l>
            <l>Yet when they see your Armour and your head</l>
            <l>Brought to them home, it will be some relief.</l>
            <l>But this by sight must be determined.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:93808:136"/>This said, he made a thrust at <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which he received on his trusty Shield,</l>
            <l>It entered not, resisted by the Brass,</l>
            <l>Which bent the point, and passage none did yield.</l>
            <l>Then as he backward stept to get away</l>
            <l>He by <hi>Atrides</hi> on the Breast was hit.</l>
            <l>The Spear prest with his hand not there did stay,</l>
            <l>But to his Neck went up and pierced it.</l>
            <l>And then the ground he with his Armour knocks;</l>
            <l>And dyed was with blood his dainty hair,</l>
            <l>Those fine (with Gold and Silver twined) Locks,</l>
            <l>Like those that <hi>Cytherea</hi>'s Graces wear.</l>
            <l>As when one planted hath an Olive sprig</l>
            <l>In open place, and where are many Springs,</l>
            <l>And stir'd by gentle winds it is grown big,</l>
            <l>Then comes a storm and to the ground it flings;</l>
            <l>So by <hi>Atrides</hi> fell <hi>Euphorbus</hi> now.</l>
            <l>As when a Lion cometh from the Wood</l>
            <l>Into the Herd and seizeth on a Cow,</l>
            <l>First breaks his Neck, then seeds he on his blood</l>
            <l>And Bowels, Dogs and Herds men looking on</l>
            <l>And hueing him, that dare not to go near;</l>
            <l>So then upon <hi>Atrides</hi> ventur'd none,</l>
            <l>So much the <hi>Trojans</hi> stricken were with fear.</l>
            <l>And now into the hands of <hi>Menelaus</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> Armour came; and born away.</l>
            <l>Had been, but that by <hi>Phoebus</hi> crost he was,</l>
            <l>That was a friend to <hi>Hector</hi> and to <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And in the shape of <hi>Mentes</hi> gone was then</l>
            <l>(Whom now the <hi>Cicon</hi> Regiments obey'd)</l>
            <l>To call back <hi>Hector</hi> to the Field agen,</l>
            <l>And overtaking him thus to him said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> you here <hi>Automedon</hi> pursue</l>
            <l>To take <hi>Achilles</hi> Horses all in vain,</l>
            <l>Which never will be won or rul'd by you,</l>
            <l>And suffer good <hi>Euphorbus</hi> to be slain</l>
            <l>By <hi>Menelaus</hi> at the Body dead</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Menoetiades.</hi> Then went his way.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> grieved turn'd about his head,</l>
            <l>And saw how on the ground <hi>Euphorbus</hi> lay</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:93808:137"/>Bleeding and naked left by <hi>Menelaus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> then enflamed with the sight</l>
            <l>Like raging fire did through the Squadrons pass,</l>
            <l>And with great cry returned to the fight.</l>
            <l>And cold was then <hi>Atrides</hi> at the heart,</l>
            <l>And with himself he thus disputing stands;</l>
            <l>If I should from the Body slain depart,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> would say of me but little good;</l>
            <l>But if I stay alone here 'twill be worse</l>
            <l>Than any thing the <hi>Greeks</hi> can of me say.</l>
            <l>For he brings with him all the <hi>Trojan</hi> force.</l>
            <l>But wherefore do I thus disputing stay?</l>
            <l>Who fights against him whom a God doth aid,</l>
            <l>Draws on himself a great and certain ill.</l>
            <l>My best course then is <hi>Hector</hi> to avoid,</l>
            <l>And let the <hi>Greeks</hi> say of it what they will.</l>
            <l>But if of <hi>Ajax</hi> I could get a sight,</l>
            <l>Then he and I together would not fear</l>
            <l>With <hi>Hector</hi> aided by a God to fight,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Achilles</hi> the dead Body bear.</l>
            <l>Whilst thus unto himself he laid the Case,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> came with <hi>Hector</hi> at the head,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Menelaus</hi> then forsook the place,</l>
            <l>And going left behinde the Body dead.</l>
            <l>But oft lookt back. As when a Lion is</l>
            <l>Compel'd to leave a Fold by Men and Dogs,</l>
            <l>He oft looks back, and runs not for all this,</l>
            <l>But tow'rds the Wood still slowly on he jogs</l>
            <l>Unwillingly; his heart's too big to run;</l>
            <l>So <hi>Menelaus</hi> off went safe and sound.</l>
            <l>And then for <hi>Ajax</hi> Son of <hi>Telamon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Lookt round about, and 'mongst his Troops him found</l>
            <l>Inciting them to fight. For not a man</l>
            <l>But frighted was by <hi>Phoebus</hi> and dismay'd;</l>
            <l>And with all speed <hi>Atrides</hi> to him ran,</l>
            <l>And standing at his side unto him said,</l>
            <l>Come <hi>Ajax,</hi> quickly come away with me</l>
            <l>To save <hi>Patroclus</hi> from the <hi>Trojans</hi> wrath,</l>
            <l>That to <hi>Achilles</hi> carri'd he may be</l>
            <l>Though naked. For his Armour <hi>Hector</hi> hath.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:93808:137"/>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> inrag'd at this flies to the place</l>
            <l>With <hi>Menelaus,</hi> where <hi>Patroclus</hi> lay</l>
            <l>When <hi>Hector</hi> from the Field him drawing was,</l>
            <l>(Having already snatcht his Arms away)</l>
            <l>Unto the <hi>Trojans</hi> to cut off his head,</l>
            <l>And give the Body to the Dogs to eat.</l>
            <l>But when great <hi>Ajax</hi> thither came, he fled,</l>
            <l>And to the <hi>Trojans</hi> made a quick Retreat;</l>
            <l>And order gave to bear the Arms to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> Arms, a noble Monument</l>
            <l>Of his great deed. But <hi>Ajax</hi> still did stay,</l>
            <l>And with his Shield about the Body went.</l>
            <l>As when a Lion, his Whelps following him,</l>
            <l>Into the open Field comes from the Wood,</l>
            <l>And Hunters meets, he looks upon them grim;</l>
            <l>So <hi>Ajax</hi> looking by <hi>Patroclus</hi> stood,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Glaucus</hi> then that led the <hi>Lycian</hi> Bands</l>
            <l>To <hi>Hector</hi> went and frowning to him said,</l>
            <l>Though you be thought a good man of your hands</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> it is not so I am afraid.</l>
            <l>Consider first if you the Town can save</l>
            <l>By <hi>Trojans</hi> only, without other guard,</l>
            <l>And of their service how great need you have;</l>
            <l>And then how lightly you their pains regard.</l>
            <l>What <hi>Lycian</hi> again will for you fight?</l>
            <l>Or how will you defend a meaner man,</l>
            <l>That left <hi>Sarpedon</hi> to the <hi>Argives</hi> spight</l>
            <l>And sport, and from his body frighted ran,</l>
            <l>That was your friend and had such service done?</l>
            <l>So that if I were won to lead them home,</l>
            <l>You'd finde a little after we were gone,</l>
            <l>The utmost fate of <hi>Troy</hi> were on it come.</l>
            <l>For if the <hi>Trojans</hi> had as forward been,</l>
            <l>As men should be that for their Country fight,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> body we in <hi>Troy</hi> had seen,</l>
            <l>Fetcht from the field, for all the <hi>Argives</hi> might;</l>
            <l>And from the <hi>Greeks</hi> in change we might have had</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Sarpedons</hi> Corps, and brought it into <hi>Troy</hi>;</l>
            <l>And all the <hi>Greeks</hi> thereof would have been glad,</l>
            <l>So great experience of his worth had they.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:93808:138"/>But you to <hi>Ajax</hi> never yet durst go.</l>
            <l>And when he came to you, you from him ran</l>
            <l>Into the throng o'th'<hi>Trojans.</hi> And why so?</l>
            <l>But that you know he is the better man.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> frowning on him thus repli'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Glaucus,</hi> 'tis strange that such a man as you</l>
            <l>Should so severely without cause me chide;</l>
            <l>I thought you very wise, but 'tis not true.</l>
            <l>You say I dare not with great <hi>Ajax</hi> fight</l>
            <l>When I do neither Foot nor Horse-men shun,</l>
            <l>But only way give sometimes to the might</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Jove</hi> when he the Enemy sets on.</l>
            <l>For he to whom he will gives Victorie,</l>
            <l>And from the proud their courage takes away.</l>
            <l>But to the Fight come with me now, and see</l>
            <l>If I be such a Coward as you say;</l>
            <l>And do not from <hi>Patroclus</hi> body make</l>
            <l>Some of the <hi>Argives</hi> to retire agen.</l>
            <l>This said, he turn'd and to the <hi>Trojans</hi> spake,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Trojans,</hi> said he, and <hi>Lycians</hi> play the men</l>

            <l>Which from <hi>Patroclus</hi> body slain I took.</l>
            <l>This said, he from the Field went toward <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And quickly those that bare them overtook,</l>
            <l>And gave to them the Armour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <l>But were not kept by him till he was old.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> that out of sight in Heaven sate</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> in this Armour did behold,</l>
            <l>Poor man, said he, he knoweth not his fate,</l>
            <l>Which now is neer; and at it shook his head,</l>
            <l>And said, Though now these heavenly Arms you wear</l>
            <l>Of this great man whom all men else did dread,</l>

               <hi>Achilles, Jove</hi> took at him no offence,</l>
            <l>Nor thought that to be Dogs meat he deserv'd,</l>

            <l>And as he goes <hi>Jove</hi> gives him Victory.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Athena</hi> pleas'd was with the same,</l>

            <l>Him <hi>Menelaus</hi> with his Spear then slew</l>
            <l>Just as he turn'd himself about to run,</l>
            <l>And from the <hi>Trojans</hi> the dead body drew.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Hector</hi> then came <hi>Phoebus,</hi> having on</l>
            <l>The form of <hi>Phoenops</hi> Son of <hi>Asius,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In <hi>Hector</hi>'s grace inferior to none,</l>
            <l>And standing by his side said to him thus.</l>
            <l>If you be so afraid of <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>What other <hi>Greek</hi> will be afraid of you?</l>
            <l>He never yet good Spear-man counted was</l>
            <l>Nor is, though <hi>Podes</hi> now by chance he slew,</l>
            <l>And vainly now he thinks alone he can</l>

            <l>This said, unto the body <hi>Hector</hi> ran.</l>

            <l>And in thick Clouds the Mountain <hi>Ida</hi> wraps,</l>
            <l>And dark it was upon the Field as night.</l>
            <l>And then with Lightning and with Thunder claps</l>
            <l>The Squadrons of the <hi>Argives</hi> puts to flight.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Menelaus</hi> who the <hi>Boeotions</hi> led,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> was the first that fled,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Leitus</hi> his Mate the second was,</l>

            <l>On <hi>Hector</hi>'s Shield then lights a heavie Spear</l>
            <l>That thrown was at him by <hi>Idomeneus,</hi>

            <l>But brake in two; and glad the <hi>Trojans</hi> were.</l>
            <l>And at <hi>Idomeneus</hi> then <hi>Hector</hi> threw,</l>
            <l>Beside him but a little went the Spear,</l>
            <l>And lighting upon <hi>Caeranus</hi> him slew,</l>
            <l>Who was <hi>Meriones</hi> his Charretier,</l>
            <l>And with him came to <hi>Lyctus</hi> all the way</l>
            <l>By Sea, and thence he went to <hi>Troy</hi> by land.</l>
            <l>And much good service he had done to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For fallen had the King by <hi>Hector</hi>'s hand,</l>
            <l>And safe had been himself; but now was hit</l>
            <l>By <hi>Hector</hi>'s Spear betwixt the Cheek and Ear,</l>
            <l>And struck out were his Teeth, his Tongue was slit,</l>
            <l>And falling to the ground expired there.</l>
            <l>And then <hi>Meriones</hi> took up the Reyns,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Idomeneus</hi> cri'd out to fly.</l>
            <l>To little purpose now is all our pains;</l>
            <l>You see the <hi>Trojans</hi> have the Victory.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idomeneus</hi> to th'Ships then drave away</l>
            <l>As fast as he could make the Horses go,</l>
            <l>As being certain they had lost the day.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Ajax</hi> did the same acknowledge now.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Meriones</hi> (said he) and <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That <hi>Jove</hi> will to the <hi>Trojans</hi> give the day</l>
            <l>A man may see that little judgment has,</l>
            <l>So manifestly now he fights for <hi>Troy.</hi>

            <l>Let's therefore here consider of some way</l>

            <l>That now the <hi>Trojans</hi> have the Victorie,</l>
            <l>I think it is already known to you.</l>
            <l>But further know that slain <hi>Patroclus</hi> is.</l>
            <l>Run therefore to <hi>Achilles</hi> quickly, and</l>
            <l>Tell him the news. It may be, mov'd by this</l>
            <l>To help the <hi>Argives</hi> with his mighty hand,</l>
            <l>He'll to the naked body hither come</l>
            <l>(For now <hi>Achilles</hi> Armour <hi>Hector</hi> wears).</l>
            <l>At this <hi>Antilochus</hi> was stricken dumb,</l>
            <l>And filled were and swoln his eyes with tears.</l>
            <l>And there <hi>Antilochus</hi> no longer staid,</l>
            <l>But to <hi>Laodocus</hi> his Armour gave,</l>
            <l>And he the same upon his Charret laid;</l>
            <l>For to that end he neer unto him drave.</l>
            <l>Away <hi>Antilochus</hi> then weeping went</l>
            <l>To carry to <hi>Achilles</hi> the ill news,</l>
            <l>And left to <hi>Thrasymed</hi> his Regiment.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Menelaus</hi> did the same refuse;</l>
            <l>Though of a valiant Commander then</l>
            <l>The tired <hi>Pylians</hi> had the greatest need,</l>
            <l>And to the <hi>Ajaxes</hi> return'd agen</l>
            <l>Where lay <hi>Patroclus</hi> body, with all speed.</l>
            <l>And when he thither came, unto them said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antilochus</hi> is to <hi>Achilles</hi> gone.</l>
            <l>Although I see not how he should us aid.</l>
            <l>How can he, seeing Armour he has none?</l>
            <l>Let's therefore now bethink our selves, how we</l>
            <l>Our selves may bear the body from the Field;</l>
            <l>And also how we may secured be</l>
            <l>Against the <hi>Trojans</hi> that we be not kill'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> to this replying said, 'Tis true,</l>
            <l>And the advice I'll give you will be right.</l>
            <l>Take up the Corps <hi>Meriones</hi> and you,</l>
            <l>And on your shoulders bear it from the Fight.</l>

            <l>Whilst towards them the back of <hi>Ajax</hi> was,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> with great shouting followed.</l>
            <l>Just as a Pack of Hounds pursue a Boar</l>
            <l>Wounded by Hunters, running with great cry,</l>

            <l>WHilst at the Ships the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> sought,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antilochus</hi> came to <hi>Achilles</hi> Tent.</l>
            <l>And found him to the <hi>Argive</hi> Ditch gone out</l>

            <l>The Battle to the Ships is come again;</l>
            <l>Pray God it be not as I fear it is,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> are routed and <hi>Patroclus</hi> slain.</l>
            <l>My Mother told me that the best of all</l>
            <l>The <hi>Myrmidons</hi> by th'<hi>Trojans</hi> should be slain.</l>
            <l>I bad him not t'assault the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wall,</l>
            <l>Nor fight with <hi>Hector,</hi> but come back again.</l>
            <l>As speaking to himself <hi>Achilles</hi> stood,</l>

               <hi>Antilochus</hi> unto him weeping came,</l>
            <l>The news, said he, I bring you is not good.</l>
            <l>I cannot without Tears relate the same.</l>
            <l>Slain is <hi>Patroclus.</hi> On the ground he lies,</l>
            <l>And now they fighting are with Swords and Spears</l>
            <l>Who shall his Body have with mighty cries</l>

            <l>At this sad news dark were <hi>Achilles</hi> eyes.</l>
            <l>And up he takes the dust with both his hands,</l>
            <l>And throws it on his head; then down he lies,</l>
            <l>His Face and Coat sulli'd with dust and sands,</l>

            </l>
            <l>And for the City fight and for our Wives.</l>
            <l>Let's to the City go. 'Tis as I say,</l>
            <l>And nothing keeps him from us but the night.</l>
            <l>And if he here shall find us when 'tis day,</l>
            <l>Some of us will acknowledge I say right.</l>
            <l>And many flying wish when 'tis too late,</l>
            <l>They were within the Walls of <hi>Ilium,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whom Dogs and Kites shall eat without the Gate.</l>
            <l>But to my ears may never such news come.</l>
            <l>But if you will be ruled all by me,</l>
            <l>Into the Market-place of <hi>Troy</hi> by night</l>
            <l>We'll bring our strength, and soon as we can see,</l>
            <l>Stand arm'd upon the Tow'rs prepar'd to fight.</l>
            <l>Then let him from the Ships come fight at <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And drive about the Walls and do his worst,</l>

            <l>Again, said he, I from you must dissent,</l>

            <l>We have already there too long been pent.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Troy</hi> once was counted rich in Brass and Gold.</l>
            <l>But since <hi>Jove</hi> angry was, all that is gone,</l>
            <l>In <hi>Phrygia</hi> and in <hi>Maeonia</hi> sold,</l>
            <l>And little left in <hi>Ilium</hi> to be won.</l>
            <l>But since the <hi>Greeks</hi> are beaten and dismayd</l>
            <l>By th'hand of <hi>Jove,</hi> your fear is out of season,</l>
            <l>Nor will you by the <hi>Trojans</hi> be obey'd,</l>
            <l>Nor shall you; though the <hi>Trojans</hi> thought it reason.</l>
            <l>And therefore take my counsel, which is this.</l>
            <l>Go now and ev'ry man his Supper take</l>
            <l>In Rank and File there where he placed is;</l>
            <l>And set good Guards, and keep your selves awake.</l>
            <l>If any <hi>Trojan</hi> for his Goods lament,</l>
            <l>He may the same upon the Town bestow</l>
            <l>In service of the Publick to be spent,</l>
            <l>Rather than be possessed by the Foe;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:93808:148"/>And armed in the morn go to the Fleet,</l>
            <l>And sharply charge the <hi>Greeks</hi> by break of day.</l>
            <l>And if indeed <hi>Achilles</hi> there we meet</l>
            <l>He were not best oppose us in our way.</l>
            <l>For from him I will neither fly nor shrink,</l>
            <l>But either honour from him bear away,</l>
            <l>Or he from me. <hi>Mars</hi> common is I think</l>
            <l>To them that fight; and slain are they that slay.</l>
            <l>This said, the <hi>Trojans</hi> heard with great applause,</l>
            <l>Fools as they were; <hi>Pallas</hi> had made them mad.</l>
            <l>But none of them commend <hi>Polydamas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That given them much better counsel had.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> presently to Supper went.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> all night about <hi>Patroclus</hi> stand.</l>
            <l>And there began <hi>Achilles</hi> to lament,</l>
            <l>And on <hi>Patroclus</hi> breast he laid his hand.</l>
            <l>As when a Lion coming to his Den</l>
            <l>Misses the tender Whelps he left behind,</l>
            <l>He roars, and furiously goes out agen.</l>
            <l>And through the Vallies hunts, the Thief to find;</l>
            <l>Such fierce thoughts on <hi>Achilles</hi> heart then lay.</l>
            <l>And sighing to the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> he spake.</l>
            <l>Oh, what did I to old <hi>Menoetius</hi> say!</l>
            <l>How vain a promise did I to him make!</l>
            <l>I said when we had sackt the Town of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That I to <hi>Opus</hi> would bring back his Son</l>
            <l>Enriched with his portion of the Prey.</l>
            <l>But all we hope from <hi>Jove</hi> is seldom done.</l>
            <l>For both of us have the same Destiny</l>
            <l>With our hearts bloud to dye the <hi>Trojan</hi> Plain.</l>
            <l>And as he lieth now, so shall I lie,</l>
            <l>And never to my Parents come again.</l>
            <l>But since <hi>Patroclus</hi> you the first are dead,</l>
            <l>Your Funeral I will not celebrate,</l>
            <l>Till I have brought you <hi>Hector</hi>'s Arms and Head,</l>
            <l>Whose bloudy hand deliver'd your sad fate,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Beheaded in revenge. Till then stay here,</l>

            <l>My Tools take up, and Bellows set away.</l>
            <l>This said, the Bellows he took and set by,</l>
            <l>But in a Chest his working Tools did lay.</l>
            <l>Then with a Sponge he wip'd his hands and face,</l>
            <l>His brawny neck, and hairy breast, and on</l>
            <l>He puts his Coat, and with his staff, apace,</l>
            <l>Though haulting goes, and waited was upon</l>
            <l>By Maids of Massie Gold, endu'd with Wit,</l>
            <l>And Speech, &amp; Strength, and learn'd in Heav'nly Art;</l>
            <l>And went to <hi>Thetis</hi> and did by her sit,</l>
            <l>And joyful at her presence was his heart,</l>
            <l>And laid his hand on hers, and to her said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Thetis,</hi> so welcome to me there is none.</l>
            <l>Tell me wherein you think I can you aid.</l>
            <l>And if it can be done, it shall be done.</l>
            <l>And then to <hi>Vulcan Thetis</hi> answered,</l>
            <l>No Goddess ever was distrest like me</l>
            <l>Whom <hi>Jove</hi> made subject to a Mortal's Bed,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Peleus</hi> Wife constrained me to be,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:93808:151"/>Who lies at home decrepid now and spent.</l>
            <l>And when I born unto him had a Son,</l>
            <l>Of all the <hi>Heroes</hi> the most excellent,</l>
            <l>And of his breeding, care omitted none,</l>
            <l>And when he grown was to a goodly height,</l>
            <l>He sent was to the War at <hi>Ilium</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Against the <hi>Trojans</hi> for the <hi>Greeks</hi> to fight;</l>
            <l>From whence he never shall again come home.</l>
            <l>Though yet he live, he takes therein no joy,</l>
            <l>And I to comfort him no power have,</l>
            <l>Since <hi>Agamemnon</hi> taken has away</l>
            <l>Her whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> for honour to him gave.</l>
            <l>And then my Son no longer would him aid;</l>
            <l>And by the <hi>Trojans</hi> beaten were the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi> then sent Gifts and pray'd,</l>
            <l>And by Embassadors his favour seeks.</l>
            <l>Then though to th'Fight himself he would not go,</l>
            <l>Yet he his Armour to <hi>Patroclus</hi> gave,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Myrmidons</hi> t'assist him 'gainst the Fo,</l>
            <l>And to the <hi>Scaean</hi> Gate the <hi>Trojans</hi> drave.</l>
            <l>And by <hi>Patroclus</hi> taken had been <hi>Troy,</hi>

            <l>Had he not then been by <hi>Apollo</hi> slain,</l>
            <l>That unto <hi>Hector</hi> gave a glorious day,</l>
            <l>And th'Armour of my valiant Son to gain.</l>
            <l>Which makes me now come hither to request</l>
            <l>That you would make new Armour for my Son,</l>
            <l>A Shield, a Helmet, Armour for the breast</l>
            <l>And for the legs. For those he had are gone.</l>
            <l>Then (to her answer'd <hi>Vulcan</hi>) do not fear.</l>
            <l>Oh that when for him the harsh Fates enquire,</l>
            <l>To hide him from them I as able were,</l>
            <l>As make him Arms for Mortals to admire.</l>
            <l>This said, unto his Shop he went, and bad</l>
            <l>His golden serving Statues blow the fire.</l>
            <l>For twenty Bellowses in all he had</l>
            <l>To blow as he should, and his work require.</l>
            <l>And then into the fire he threw in Tin,</l>
            <l>And Brass, and Silver fine, and pretious Gold;</l>
            <l>And to the Socket puts the Anvile in,</l>
            <l>And th'heavie Hammer in one hand did hold,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:93808:151"/>Into his other hand the Tongs he takes,</l>

            <l>And fastens to the same a silver Thong,</l>

            <l>The Shield it self consisted of five plies,</l>
            <l>And with great art described in it was</l>
            <l>The surface of the Earth, the Sea and Skies,</l>
            <l>The Sun, the Moon at Full, and all the train</l>

            <l>And full of people was the Market-place,</l>
            <l>Assembled at the hearing of a Cause.</l>
            <l>A man was slain. And this was then the Case.</l>
            <l>One said that he had satisfi'd the Laws,</l>
            <l>The other said that nothing he had paid;</l>
            <l>And on this Issue they will both be tri'd,</l>
            <l>And have their Proofs before the Judges laid.</l>
            <l>And clamour great of friends was on each side.</l>
            <l>The Cryers when they stilled had the cry,</l>
            <l>Into the Judges hands their Scepters gave,</l>
            <l>And in the midst, of Gold two Talents lie</l>
            <l>For him that has the better Cause to have.</l>
            <l>Before the other Town two Armies stood.</l>
            <l>The Foe resolved was to plunder it.</l>
            <l>The Town, to save it, offer'd half their good.</l>
            <l>The other to accept it thought not fit.</l>
            <l>Then up unto the Walls the Towns-men sent</l>
            <l>Their Women, Children, and their men grown old,</l>
            <l>And all the rest out from the City went,</l>

            <l>Who in respect of them seem'd very low.</l>
            <l>For men are much inferior to the Gods.</l>
            <l>Then they before the Gate to counsel go.</l>
            <l>The Enemies themselves in ambush laid</l>
            <l>At th'watering place upon the Rivers brink,</l>
            <l>And Scouts sent out, which not far from them staid</l>
            <l>To tell them when the Cattle came to drink.</l>
            <l>And when they were informed they were nigh,</l>
            <l>And Shepherds two that did suspect no harm,</l>
            <l>They on the Shepherds and the Cattle fly.</l>
            <l>At which the other Army took th'Alarm,</l>
            <l>And rising up from Counsel, with their Horse</l>
            <l>Pursu'd, and soon they overtaken were.</l>
            <l>And then began the Fight. Without remorse</l>
            <l>They one another slay with Sword and Spear.</l>
            <l>And there Disorder plac'd was and Debate;</l>
            <l>And one born wounded out, another sound,</l>
            <l>Another dead was drag'd away by Fate</l>
            <l>With bloudy Coat and Armour on the ground</l>
            <l>So lively seemed to the Eye their features</l>
            <l>In fighting and in fetching off their slain,</l>
            <l>One would have thought they had been living creatures,</l>
            <l>And that the Fight had real been. Again</l>
            <l>Describ'd was in the same a spacious ground,</l>
            <l>And men at Plough, and at each Ridges end</l>
            <l>At turning of the Plough about, they found</l>
            <l>A man that for them did with Wine attend.</l>
            <l>And then again the Plough about they winde,</l>
            <l>And lab'ring to the other end go back;</l>
            <l>And as they plough, still what they leave behinde,</l>
            <l>Though Golden 'twas, to th'Eye appeared black.</l>
            <l>A wonder 'twas. Besides, in the same Shield</l>
            <l>Pourtrayed was a goodly Close of Wheat,</l>
            <l>And many Reapers working on the field,</l>
            <l>That threw it to the ground in handfuls great;</l>
            <l>And Boys that follow'd took it from the ground,</l>
            <l>And put it in the hands of Binders three,</l>
            <l>By whom they made were into Sheaves and bound.</l>
            <l>Which standing by, their Lord was glad to see,</l>

            <l>And to the woman gave it to be drest.</l>
            <l>And in't a golden Vineyard was pourtray'd.</l>
            <l>The Grapes that on it hung were black, and all</l>

            </l>
            <l>A Ditch there was about it black, and on</l>
            <l>The same a Hedge, the colour of it Tin,</l>
            <l>And Path unto it there was only one,</l>
            <l>By which the Fruit in Vintage was brought in.</l>
            <l>And on it Boys and Girls described were</l>
            <l>After a Fiddle play'd on by a Boy,</l>
            <l>That sing, dance, whistle, and full Baskets bear</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Bacchus</hi> gifts unto the house with joy.</l>
            <l>And in it was a Herd of Bulls and Kine,</l>
            <l>Part Gold, part Tin, and Herds-men four of Gold</l>
            <l>That to the Pasture drave them with Dogs nine</l>
            <l>T'a sedgy River; where two Lions bold</l>
            <l>Upon the horned Herd came from the Wood,</l>
            <l>And 'mongst the foremost seiz'd upon a Bull.</l>
            <l>The Dogs went to them neer and barking stood.</l>
            <l>Then roars the Bull. The Lions tear and pull.</l>
            <l>And in the same he pasture made for Seeep</l>
            <l>Within a Valley large with Lodges good,</l>

            <l>In safety from the wilde Beasts of the Wood.</l>
            <l>And in it was a Dancing-place pourtray'd</l>

            <l>For <hi>Ariadne,</hi> while in <hi>Crete</hi> he slay'd,</l>

            <l>And in the midst two Tumblers sung the Song,</l>
            <l>And many wondrous things did in their sight.</l>

            <l>The Shield now done he went about the rest,</l>

            <l>Wounded by <hi>Coon,</hi> nor recovered yet;</l>
            <l>But th'Heroes for his coming not long staid.</l>
            <l>And when they were together all and set,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> rose, and t'<hi>Agamemnon</hi> said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides,</hi> what great profit got we by</l>
            <l>This our unlucky strife about a Maid?</l>
            <l>I would it had her fortune been to die,</l>
            <l>Before I Siege unto <hi>Lyrnessus</hi> laid.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Hector</hi> and the <hi>Trojans</hi> comes the gain.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> with grief will think on't while they live.</l>
            <l>But since it is too late now to complain,</l>
            <l>Go forth and orders for the Battle give;</l>
            <l>That I may to them go again and see</l>
            <l>If at the Ships they mean to stay all night.</l>
            <l>I think they will much rather wish to be</l>
            <l>Within the Walls of <hi>Troy</hi> than stay and fight.</l>
            <l>This said, the <hi>Greeks</hi> were glad and courage take,</l>
            <l>Assured that <hi>Achilles</hi> would them aid,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi> sitting to them spake</l>
            <l>(Which he excus'd) and thus unto them said.</l>
            <l>'Twere fitter (<hi>Argive</hi> Princes) I stood out,</l>
            <l>That so my words you might the better hear;</l>
            <l>But such a number standing are about,</l>
            <l>My voice, though greater, would not reach your ear.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:93808:154"/>Nor were it fit for me to go about,</l>
            <l>And tell my minde to each man in his ear.</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Achilles</hi> therefore only I'll speak out,</l>
            <l>But so, if you attend, that all may hear.</l>
            <l>I often have, said he, been blamed by</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> for taking from you your fair prize,</l>
            <l>When not in me, but <hi>Jove</hi> the fault did ly,</l>
            <l>And in <hi>Erinnys</hi> and the Destinies,</l>
            <l>That did me of my wits that day bereave.</l>
            <l>For what can I do when the Gods do all?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi>'s Daughter <hi>Ate</hi> did me then deceive,</l>
            <l>From whom, on Men and Gods great troubles fall.</l>
            <l>Her Feet are soft, because she never treads</l>
            <l>On th'Earth; but when she mischief has to do,</l>
            <l>Walks in the Air, and puts it in mens heads,</l>
            <l>And sometimes does shrewd turns t'Immortals too.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Juno,</hi> though but of the Female Sex,</l>
            <l>That day that <hi>Hercules</hi> was to be born,</l>
            <l>Was able <hi>Jove</hi> the best o'th'Gods to vex,</l>
            <l>And labour of <hi>Alcmena</hi> to adjourn.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Jove</hi> before th'Immortals having said</l>
            <l>That he a man that day to light would bring</l>
            <l>By whom his Race in <hi>Greece</hi> should all be sway'd,</l>
            <l>You jest, said <hi>Juno,</hi> you mean no such thing.</l>
            <l>I'll not believe't unless you first be sworn</l>
            <l>That he shall of your Seed in <hi>Greece</hi> be King,</l>
            <l>That of a woman shall this day be born.</l>
            <l>This said, straight <hi>Jove</hi> no fraud imagining</l>
            <l>The great Oath took. But after did repent.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Juno</hi> from <hi>Olympus</hi> lofty head</l>
            <l>Leapt down, and t'<hi>Argos</hi> of <hi>Achaia</hi> went,</l>
            <l>And brought the Wife of <hi>Sthenelus</hi> to bed.</l>
            <l>And there was she delivered of a Son,</l>
            <l>That was by <hi>Perseus</hi> of <hi>Jove</hi>'s discent.</l>
            <l>Though she but seven months had of him gone.</l>
            <l>And then to <hi>Thebes</hi> she to <hi>Alcmena</hi> went,</l>
            <l>And hindred her that day from bringing forth.</l>
            <l>Then up to <hi>Jupiter</hi> she came again,</l>
            <l>And said, This day is born a man of worth,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Eurysteus</hi> in <hi>Argos</hi> fit to reign,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:93808:155"/>And of your Seed. And <hi>Jove</hi> in choler then</l>
            <l>Took <hi>Ate</hi> by the head, and swung her round,</l>
            <l>And swore she ne're to Heav'n should come agen.</l>
            <l>And having said it, threw her to the ground</l>
            <l>And always after sigh'd to see the pain</l>
            <l>To which <hi>Eurysteus</hi> did put his Son;</l>
            <l>As I do when I see the <hi>Argives</hi> slain</l>
            <l>By <hi>Hector,</hi> grieve to think what I have done.</l>
            <l>But since that <hi>Jove</hi> has made me to offend,</l>
            <l>I for my Errour willing am to pay.</l>
            <l>Come then, and your assistance to us lend,</l>
            <l>And quickly bring your <hi>Myrmidons</hi> away.</l>
            <l>And all that by <hi>Ulysses</hi> yesterday</l>
            <l>I to you promis'd shall performed be.</l>
            <l>Or presently, if you will for it stay,</l>
            <l>That you th'atoning Gifts your self may see.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then unto him thus replies.</l>
            <l>As for your Gifts to give them me or no,</l>
            <l>Yet only in your choice <hi>(Atrides)</hi> lies.</l>
            <l>But now 'tis time we to the <hi>Trojans</hi> go.</l>
            <l>To make fine Speeches here is but delay.</l>
            <l>But let your men o'th'Field <hi>Achilles</hi> see</l>
            <l>Through Squadrons of the <hi>Trojans</hi> making way.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> then encouraged will be.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> then t'<hi>Achilles</hi> answered,</l>
            <l>Godlike <hi>Achilles,</hi> mighty as you are,</l>
            <l>Urge not the <hi>Greeks</hi> to fight till they be fed;</l>
            <l>They fasting cannot long endure the Warre.</l>
            <l>And likely 'tis the Battle will be long;</l>
            <l>Especially if Gods both sides assist;</l>
            <l>And Bread and Wine is that which makes men strong.</l>
            <l>Let therefore now the <hi>Argives</hi> be dismist.</l>
            <l>Who can, d'ye think, the toil of Battle bear</l>
            <l>From morning unto night, unless he first</l>
            <l>With food his heart and feeble limbs do chear?</l>
            <l>He would be heavie, hungry, and athirst.</l>
            <l>But he that is with food well satisfi'd,</l>
            <l>Courageous is, and fight will all the day.</l>
            <l>His heart and limbs are strong, and will abide</l>
            <l>As long as any on the Field dare stay.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:93808:155"/>Come, let the people now to Breakfast go,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Agamemnon</hi> send the Presents in</l>
            <l>Into th'Assembly where we sit, that so</l>
            <l>By the <hi>Achaeans</hi> all they may be seen;</l>
            <l>And let him take an Oath before us, that</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Briseis</hi> Bed he never went unto,</l>
            <l>Nor all this while has done unto her, what</l>
            <l>A Husband to his Wife is us'd to do.</l>
            <l>And you your anger henceforth bridle must.</l>
            <l>And you <hi>Atrides</hi> feast him like a friend,</l>
            <l>And for hereafter learn to be more just,</l>
            <l>Nor think't a shame for men their faults to mend.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ulysses</hi> (said <hi>Atrides</hi>) I am joy'd</l>
            <l>The counsel you have given us to hear.</l>
            <l>For 'tis but reason all that you have said.</l>
            <l>And I with all my heart the Oath will swear.</l>
            <l>And let <hi>Achilles,</hi> though in haste, stay here</l>
            <l>With all the rest, that they my Gifts may see,</l>
            <l>And Witnesses be to the Oath I swear.</l>
            <l>And for the Gifts <hi>(Ulysses)</hi> presently</l>
            <l>Go you your self with good men whom you will,</l>
            <l>And bring them from my Tent, and set them here.</l>
            <l>For what they are, you well remember still.</l>
            <l>The same that by you promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from me were.</l>
            <l>And you <hi>Talthybius</hi> provide a Swine,</l>
            <l>That we may offer up a Sacrifice</l>
            <l>To <hi>Jove,</hi> the Sun, and other Pow'rs Divine.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Achilles</hi> to him thus replies,</l>
            <l>Renowned <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> I think yet</l>
            <l>Another time for Feast had better been;</l>
            <l>As when in War a pause we intermit,</l>
            <l>And whilst yet unabated is my spleen.</l>
            <l>We see our friends lie torn upon the ground.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> to battle and revenge I prompt.</l>
            <l>You think my counsel therein is not sound,</l>
            <l>And seek with Feasting to divert them from't.</l>
            <l>But let us fasting to the Battle go,</l>
            <l>And make good Chear when we come back agen,</l>
            <l>And have reveng'd our selves upon the Fo.</l>
            <l>For I will neither eat nor drink till then.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:93808:156"/>For whilst <hi>Patroclus</hi> mangled lieth here,</l>
            <l>And they that love him stand lamenting by,</l>
            <l>There nothing is that I can think good Chear</l>
            <l>But Slaughter, Bloud, and Groans of men that die.</l>
            <l>To this <hi>Ulysses</hi> did again reply,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles,</hi> you have not in <hi>Greece</hi> your Peer,</l>
            <l>For Martial worth; yet Elder much am I,</l>
            <l>And more have seen; I pray you therefore hear.</l>
            <l>The fare of War soon breeds Satiety.</l>
            <l>Much Straw there is, but Harvest none, or small.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Jove</hi> once hold the Scales unevenly,</l>
            <l>Innumerable are the men that fall.</l>
            <l>When then an end of weeping shall we see?</l>
            <l>The Bellies of the <hi>Argives</hi> must not mourn.</l>
            <l>They that go to the War must patient be,</l>
            <l>And let the dead unto their Graves be born,</l>
            <l>And not weep over them above a day.</l>
            <l>And we that safe from Fight are come again,</l>
            <l>When we are fed can all day fighting stay.</l>
            <l>All other Exhortation is vain.</l>
            <l>Let therefore now the <hi>Greeks</hi> to Breakfast go,</l>
            <l>Which is the Soldiers best encouragement.</l>
            <l>Then all together fall upon the Fo.</l>
            <l>And when he this had said, away he went.</l>
            <l>And with him took <hi>Meges, Meriones,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Theas, Antilochus,</hi> and <hi>Thrasymed,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Menalippus,</hi> and added unto these</l>
            <l>(The Martial Son of <hi>Creon) Lycomed.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And brought the Presents from <hi>Atrides</hi> Tent,</l>
            <l>Sev'n Tripods great, and twenty Caldrons bright,</l>
            <l>Twelve Horses and sev'n Women with them went,</l>
            <l>And fair'st of all <hi>Briseis</hi> made them eight.</l>
            <l>Talents of Gold <hi>Ulysses</hi> weigh'd out ten,</l>
            <l>And took the pains himself to carry that.</l>
            <l>The rest was carri'd by the younger men,</l>
            <l>And laid before the Princes as they sat.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> rose, and by him neer</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Talthybius</hi> attended with a Swine,</l>
            <l>From which <hi>Atrides</hi> clipt a lock of hair,</l>
            <l>And lifts his hands unto the Pow'rs Divine.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:93808:156"/>O <hi>Jove</hi> (said he) the chiefest of the Gods,</l>

            <l>That in your hands carry th'Eternal rods</l>
            <l>To punish such as perjur'd shall be found,</l>
            <l>My hand I on <hi>Briseis</hi> never laid,</l>
            <l>Neither for Bed, nor any other cause;</l>
            <l>But always in my Tent untoucht she staid,</l>
            <l>Nor ever by me once attempted was.</l>
            <l>And if herein I told you have a Lye,</l>

            <l>To such as guilty are of Perjury</l>
            <l>Upon me fall. This said, the Swine he slew.</l>
            <l>Then out the Stomach of the Swine did cut,</l>
            <l>And that <hi>Talthybius</hi> took in his hands,</l>
            <l>And threw't into the Sea the Fish to glut.</l>

            <l>This said, the Councel he dissolv'd, and sent</l>

            <l>Mean while the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> the Presents bear</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Achilles</hi> Ships, and laid them in his Tent,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Briseis,</hi> when she saw <hi>Patroclus</hi> lie</l>
            <l>With many gastly wounds dead on the Biere,</l>
            <l>She flung her arms about him and did crie,</l>
            <l>And her white Neck, and Face, and Breast did tear,</l>
            <l>And weeping over him did thus complain.</l>
            <l>O dear <hi>Patroclus,</hi> whom alive I left,</l>

            <l>How fast my Woes on one another fall!</l>
            <l>The Husband which my Parents made me wed,</l>
            <l>And three good Brothers of one Mother all</l>
            <l>I saw before <hi>Lyrnessus</hi> Massacred.</l>

            <l>But now since you have also lost your life,</l>

            <l>Himself to strengthen with a little food,</l>
            <l>But could by no means get him to consent.</l>
            <l>My friends, said he, importune me no more</l>

            <l>The two <hi>Atrides</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> stay.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Phoenix</hi> and old <hi>Nestor</hi> at his Tent,</l>
            <l>And King <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> his grief t'allay.</l>
            <l>But nothing they could say did any good,</l>
            <l>So fiercely he was set upon the Fight;</l>
            <l>And looking on <hi>Patroclus</hi> body stood.</l>
            <l>And then afresh lamented at the sight.</l>
            <l>Sweet friend, said he, you wont were to provide</l>
            <l>Good Breakfast for me when I was to fight,</l>
            <l>But since that comfort now I am deni'd,</l>
            <l>In meat and drink I take no more delight.</l>
            <l>For greater hurt cannot upon me fall,</l>
            <l>Although for want of me my Father die,</l>
            <l>While absent from him at the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wall</l>
            <l>For this accursed <hi>Helen</hi>'s sake I lie;</l>
            <l>Nor though my Son <hi>Neptolemus</hi> should die,</l>
            <l>Whom I in <hi>Scyros</hi> Isle lest to be bred,</l>
            <l>Not thinking then that here both you and I</l>
            <l>Should lose our lives; but that when I was dead</l>
            <l>He should by you be to my House convey'd,</l>
            <l>And made to know my Servants and Estate.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Peleus</hi> now is very much decay'd,</l>
            <l>If quite he have not finished his Fate.</l>

               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:93808:157"/>When this <hi>Achilles</hi> weeping spoken had,</l>
            <l>The good old men that also had their fears</l>
            <l>For those they left at home, were very sad.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> had pity on <hi>Achilles</hi> tears,</l>
            <l>And speaking to <hi>Athena,</hi> Child, said he,</l>
            <l>Your love to valiant men, I see, is gone.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> must no more remembred be.</l>
            <l>Behold how for his friend he maketh moan,</l>
            <l>And takes no food, though th'other Princes feast.</l>
            <l>Let not his strength by hunger be decay'd;</l>
            <l>Distil Ambrosia into his breast,</l>
            <l>And Nectar. Straight <hi>Athena</hi> him obey'd.</l>
            <l>And swift as any Harpy came away,</l>
            <l>And arming of themselves she found the rest.</l>
            <l>But that <hi>Achilles</hi> strength might not decay</l>
            <l>She dropt Ambrosia into his breast,</l>
            <l>And Nectar sweet, and out the <hi>Argives</hi> went.</l>
            <l>As when from <hi>Jove</hi> descendeth a thick Snow,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Boreas</hi> bloweth through the Element;</l>
            <l>Such of the armed <hi>Argives</hi> was the show;</l>

            <l>And at the moving of their feet resound.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then his mighty Arms puts on,</l>
            <l>And grinds his teeth, and fire was in his eyes,</l>
            <l>And hasted to the Battle to be gone;</l>
            <l>So much his heart did at the <hi>Trojans</hi> rise.</l>
            <l>First to his legs the Leg-pieces he ti'd</l>
            <l>With Buckles of fine silver all along,</l>
            <l>And next his Breast-plate to his breast appli'd,</l>
            <l>And on his shoulder then his Sword he hung,</l>
            <l>Then up into his hands his Shield he took</l>
            <l>Large, strong, and mighty, radiant was the same,</l>
            <l>And from afar it like the Moon did look,</l>
            <l>Or, as to Seamen, on the wolds a flame,</l>
            <l>That sure are of a storm when that they see,</l>
            <l>And from their friends to scatter'd be by wind</l>
            <l>To places where they not desire to be;</l>
            <l>So then the Buckler of <hi>Achilles</hi> shin'd.</l>
            <l>

            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> to the Goddess <hi>Thetis</hi> gave command</l>
            <l>The Common Councel of the Gods to call.</l>
            <l>Then down she came, and calling went about.</l>
            <l>Ye Gods, said she, <hi>Jove</hi> calls you to his house.</l>
            <l>And straight the Rivers from their streams came out</l>
            <l>All but their Father old <hi>Oceanus.</hi>

            <l>The Nymphs from ev'ry Meadow, Spring, and Grove</l>
            <l>Up to the Mount <hi>Olympus</hi> went in hast;</l>
            <l>And when they come were to the house of <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In Porches round on polish'd Seats were plac'd.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Neptune</hi> also having heard the Call,</l>
            <l>Leapt from the Sea up to <hi>Olympus</hi> Hill,</l>
            <l>And sitting in the midst before them all</l>
            <l>To <hi>Jove</hi> he spake, and said, What is your will?</l>
            <l>D'ye call us hither our advice to hear;</l>
            <l>To give the day to <hi>Trojan</hi> or to <hi>Greek?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For I perceive the Battle now is near.</l>
            <l>My mind (said <hi>Jupiter</hi>) you need not seek.</l>
            <l>For of the <hi>Greeks</hi> distrest I have a care.</l>
            <l>But on <hi>Olympus</hi> I intend to stay,</l>
            <l>And please my self with looking on the Warre.</l>
            <l>But let the other Gods go down to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And take which side they will. For else I fear,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> whom the <hi>Trojans</hi> did so dread,</l>
            <l>When in the Battle no Immortals were,</l>
            <l>And more enrag'd is since his friend is dead;</l>
            <l>When he has driy'n the <hi>Trojans</hi> from the Field,</l>
            <l>Will then directly go to <hi>Ilium,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And overthrow the Wall which you did build,</l>
            <l>Before the time (by Fate appointed) come.</l>

               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:93808:159"/>This said, the Fight began. On th' <hi>Argives</hi> side</l>
            <l>Stood <hi>Juno, Pallas, Neptune, Mercury</hi>;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Vulcan</hi> taking in his strength great pride,</l>
            <l>Went halting 'mongst them with his legs awry.</l>
            <l>On th'other side, <hi>Mars</hi> for the <hi>Trojans</hi> stood,</l>

            <l>And <hi>Venus</hi> that of all the fairest is.</l>
            <l>And whilst they from the Battle stood aside,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> mightily encourag'd were,</l>
            <l>And in <hi>Achilles</hi> presence took great pride;</l>
            <l>For long it seem'd they had not seen him there.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> when they saw him shook for fear,</l>
            <l>So like to <hi>Mars</hi> he was, his Arms so bright.</l>
            <l>But when the Gods on both sides with them were,</l>
            <l>Then all about was filled with affright,</l>
            <l>And in the Air heard was <hi>Athena</hi> shrill</l>
            <l>As from the Ditch, and sometimes from the shore,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Mars</hi> sometimes from <hi>Callidone</hi> Hill,</l>
            <l>And sometimes as at <hi>Troy</hi> was heard to rore,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> he, but she the <hi>Greeks</hi> t'incite.</l>
            <l>Thus by the Gods from Heav'n encouraged</l>
            <l>The Armies met, and cruel was the Fight,</l>
            <l>And terribly above <hi>Jove</hi> thundered,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Neptune</hi> shook the Earth on ev'ry side,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argive</hi> Ships, and stately <hi>Trojan</hi> Tow'rs,</l>
            <l>The Plain beneath, and lofty Tops of <hi>Ide.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And frighted with it were th'Infernal Pow'rs,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Pluto</hi> starting from his ugly Throne</l>
            <l>To <hi>Neptune</hi> cried out his hand to hold,</l>
            <l>For fear his dismal dwelling should be shown</l>
            <l>To Men and Gods so hateful to behold.</l>
            <l>So great a noise the Gods make when they fight.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> to <hi>Neptune</hi> now opposed is,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> stands against rude <hi>Mars</hi> his might,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Juno</hi> matched is with <hi>Artemis,</hi>

            <l>And <hi>Mercury</hi> against <hi>Latona</hi> stood.</l>
            <l>But he that <hi>Vulcan</hi> had to deal withal,</l>
            <l>Was the divine and deep swift-running Flood,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Xanthus</hi> Gods, but Men <hi>Scamander</hi> call.</l>

            <l>And therefore boldly to him go your way.</l>
            <l>His mighty words and threats you must not fear.</l>
            <l>This said, he courage breath'd into his breast.</l>
            <l>Then through the foremost went he with his Spear,</l>
            <l>And Helmet of strong Brass with glittring Crest.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:93808:161"/>Now <hi>Juno</hi> of his going was aware,</l>
            <l>And calling to her th'other Gods, she said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> let us have a care;</l>
            <l>I see a danger that ought to be wai'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Aeneas</hi> yonder with his spear in hand,</l>
            <l>Goes to <hi>Achilles</hi> with a mind to fight.</l>
            <l>Let's keep him off, or by <hi>Achilles</hi> stand,</l>
            <l>And add both to his courage and his might,</l>
            <l>That he may know, the Gods of greatest Pow'r</l>
            <l>Are on his side, and those that stand for <hi>Troy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In vertue much to us inferiour,</l>
            <l>And dare not in the Field against us stay;</l>
            <l>And that we from <hi>Olympus</hi> hither came</l>
            <l>To save him now; hereafter whatsoere</l>
            <l>Mischances come he must endure the same,</l>
            <l>Since at his Birth they woven with him were.</l>
            <l>For if unknown our purpose to him be,</l>
            <l>To meet a God will put him into fear.</l>
            <l>'Tis dangerous Gods as they are to see;</l>
            <l>So terrible to mortals they appear.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Neptune</hi> unto <hi>Juno</hi> then repli'd,</l>
            <l>You are too fierce. A fight between the Gods</l>
            <l>I would not have begin upon our side.</l>
            <l>Nor does it need; so much we have the ods.</l>
            <l>But let's go hence to yonder Mountain top,</l>
            <l>And leave the Battle in the hands of men.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Phoebus</hi> then <hi>Achilles</hi> stop,</l>
            <l>We to the Battle will return agen,</l>
            <l>And send them to <hi>Olympus</hi> home with shame,</l>
            <l>'Mongst other of the Gods at Court to stay,</l>
            <l>Well beaten at our hands, disgrac'd, and tame.</l>
            <l>And when he this had said, he led away.</l>
            <l>And when he come was to the Castle-wall,</l>
            <l>Which was by th'<hi>Trojans</hi> built for <hi>Hercules</hi>
            </l>
            <l>By <hi>Pallas</hi> help, to save him from the Whale</l>
            <l>That much annoy'd the <hi>Trojans</hi> from the Seas,</l>
            <l>He and his Party of the Gods stay'd there</l>
            <l>Concealed by a Cloud, and looking on.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Phoebus</hi> with their Party were</l>
            <l>Sitting upon the Brow of <hi>Callidon.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:93808:162"/>Thus from the Field the Gods on both sides staid</l>
            <l>Consulting how their friends the day might win.</l>
            <l>But neither side effectually would aid.</l>
            <l>For not a God amongst them durst begin.</l>
            <l>Now cover'd over was the Field with men</l>
            <l>Both Horse and Foot array'd in Armour bright.</l>
            <l>The Earth resounded with their feet. And then</l>
            <l>Two warriours in the midst stood out to fight,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> the two best.</l>
            <l>And first <hi>Aeneas</hi> with fierce looks went on</l>
            <l>With Spear in hand, and Shield before his breast.</l>
            <l>To meet him then advanced <hi>Thetis</hi> Son.</l>
            <l>As when to chace a Lion from the Plain</l>
            <l>The people of the Town with Weapons rise,</l>
            <l>The Lion looks upon them with disdain,</l>
            <l>As if he did their multitude despise;</l>
            <l>But when a Spear from any of them comes,</l>
            <l>He whips himself int' anger with his Tail,</l>
            <l>And terribly goes on, and yawns and foams,</l>
            <l>To kill, or to be killed if he fail:</l>
            <l>So at the seeing of <hi>Aeneas</hi> Spear,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> did himself to th'Fight provoke.</l>
            <l>And when they stood to one another near,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> first unto <hi>Aeneas</hi> spoke.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Aeneas,</hi> why (said he) come you away</l>
            <l>So far before the rest? To fight with me?</l>
            <l>Will <hi>Priam,</hi> think you, make you King of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>If by your hand perhaps I slain should be?</l>
            <l>No. He is wise, and Sons has of his own.</l>
            <l>Or will the <hi>Trojans</hi> set you out great Lands,</l>
            <l>Some to be planted, others to be sown</l>
            <l>When ever I am killed by your hands?</l>
            <l>But that I hope will never be. You know</l>
            <l>How once I made you run down <hi>Ida</hi> Hill</l>
            <l>Into <hi>Lyrnessus</hi> in great haste; and how</l>
            <l>You nere lookt back for fear of greater ill;</l>
            <l>And how the Town I won, and led away</l>
            <l>The women Captives; though 'twas then <hi>Jove</hi>'s will</l>
            <l>That from my hands you should escape that day,</l>
            <l>You must not look that you should do so still.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:93808:162"/>And therefore I advise you to be gone,</l>
            <l>And in the throng o'th'<hi>Trojans</hi> to abide.</l>

            <l>But if you'll know my Generation,</l>
            <l>I'll by my Father likewise count my Race.</l>
            <l>For first by <hi>Jove</hi> was <hi>Dardanus</hi> begot</l>
            <l>That rul'd the <hi>Dardans</hi> under <hi>Ida</hi> Hill</l>
            <l>In divers Towns. For <hi>Ilium</hi> yet was not.</l>
            <l>But at the foot of <hi>Ida</hi> they dwelt still.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Dardan Erichthonius</hi> begat,</l>
            <l>That was the wealthiest of mortal men.</l>
            <l>Three thousand Mares he had, and unto that,</l>
            <l>As many Foals all feeding on the Fen.</l>
            <l>And twelve of these were got by <hi>Boreas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That leapt their Dams in likeness of a Horse,</l>
            <l>And ore the ears of standing Corn could pass</l>
            <l>And never make them stoop; such was their force;</l>
            <l>And run upon the Sea and never wet</l>
            <l>Their hoofs, which very wondrous was to see.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Erichthonius</hi> did <hi>Tros</hi> beget.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Tros</hi> the Father was of Children three,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ilus, Assaracus,</hi> and <hi>Ganymed.</hi>
            </l>

            </l>
            <l>(So fair he was) and t'Heaven carried,</l>
            <l>To minister unto the Gods above.</l>
            <l>The Son of <hi>Ilus</hi> was <hi>Laomedon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And he <hi>Tithonus</hi> got and <hi>Priamus,</hi>

            <l>Then let us from reproachful words abstain,</l>
            <l>Whereof there is great plenty ev'ry where</l>
            <l>To serve all men that will them entertain,</l>
            <l>That as a man will speak, so he may hear.</l>
            <l>What need we like two women in the street,</l>
            <l>When they cannot agree, to rail and scoff?</l>
            <l>Who, say they true or false, are undiscreet.</l>
            <l>For from my purpose you'll not put me off</l>
            <l>With scornful words, before your force I try.</l>
            <l>Let's therefore here no longer talk but fight.</l>
            <l>And as he spake his Spear he letteth fly,</l>
            <l>Which on <hi>Achilles</hi> mighty Shield fell right,</l>
            <l>And terribly it made the same resound.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> far before him held his Shield,</l>
            <l>For fear <hi>Aeneas</hi> through it might him wound;</l>
            <l>Though Heav'nly Arms to mortals will not yield.</l>
            <l>But that he thought not on Nor did the Spear</l>
            <l>Well driven as it was and strong, pass through.</l>
            <l>For of five plies that labour'd in it were</l>
            <l>By <hi>Mulciber,</hi> it pierced only two,</l>
            <l>And those were Brass. There still remained three,</l>
            <l>The one of Gold, the other two of Tin;</l>
            <l>And stopped by the Brass it could not be;</l>
            <l>But coming to the Gold it there stuck in.</l>
            <l>And then <hi>Achilles</hi> threw his Spear at him,</l>
            <l>Which flying with great force pass'd through his Shield,</l>
            <l>Where thin the Brass and Hide was near the Brim,</l>
            <l>And over him it flew into the Field.</l>
            <l>For when <hi>Aeneas</hi> coming saw the Spear,</l>
            <l>He crouched low, and held his Buckler high;</l>
            <l>And though the same proceeded but from fear,</l>
            <l>It made the Spear above his head to fly.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Aeneas</hi> at the first amazed stands.</l>
            <l>But when <hi>Achilles</hi> with his Sword came on,</l>
            <l>He stoopt, and from the ground took in his hands,</l>
            <l>That neer unto him lay a mighty stone,</l>

            <l>And by <hi>Achilles</hi> Sword himself been slain,</l>
            <l>If it had not by <hi>Neptune</hi> been foreseen.</l>
            <l>Who speaking to the Gods did thus complain.</l>
            <l>O Gods, said he, great pain I now am in</l>
            <l>To see <hi>Aeneas</hi> by <hi>Achilles</hi> slain,</l>

            <l>Who will not help him though he set him on.</l>
            <l>But wherefore should we let <hi>Aeneas</hi> die</l>
            <l>Others to please, when he no fault has done?</l>
            <l>Let's therefore save him lest we <hi>Jove</hi> offend,</l>
            <l>Who now the off-spring of King <hi>Priam</hi> hates.</l>

            <l>That neither of us shall a <hi>Trojan</hi> aid,</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Ilium</hi> it self were in a flame.</l>
            <l>Away went <hi>Neptune</hi> soon as that was said,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> came.</l>

            <l>And to <hi>Achilles</hi> that he carried,</l>

            <l>Then through the <hi>Argive</hi> Ranks he went, and said,</l>
            <l>No longer of the <hi>Trojans</hi> be so shy,</l>

            <l>Why should you of <hi>Achilles</hi> be afraid?</l>
            <l>With words 'tis easie 'gainst the Gods to fight,</l>
            <l>That are too strong to fight with with a Spear.</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Achilles</hi> now I mean to go,</l>
            <l>Though Fire his hands, and Steel his body were.</l>
            <l>For more by half he says than he can do.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Hector</hi> to the <hi>Trojans</hi> this had said,</l>

            <l>And then for <hi>Hector Phoebus</hi> was afraid,</l>
            <l>And presently came in, and standing nigh,</l>

            <l>Take heed. With <hi>Thetis</hi> Son fight not at all</l>

            <l>And straight <hi>Achilles</hi> thundring to him flew.</l>
            <l>But then <hi>Apollo</hi> snatcht him from the ground.</l>
            <l>Which is by any God done in a trice;</l>
            <l>And in a Mist conceal'd him from his sight.</l>

            <l>With his great Sword, the other with his Spear.</l>
            <l>And next he killed <hi>Tros Alastor</hi>'s Son,</l>
            <l>Who not resisted but fell at his knee,</l>
            <l>And beg'd his life, for being of his age,</l>

            <l>But that <hi>Achilles</hi> wrath could not asswage.</l>
            <l>He quite mistook his nature like a child.</l>
            <l>For cruel was <hi>Achilles</hi> and hard-harted;</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then came furiously on,</l>
            <l>And with his Sword he skim'd his head away</l>
            <l>Helmet and all. Then <hi>Regmus</hi> with a wound</l>
            <l>Upon the belly he slew with his Spear,</l>

            <l>And by her had me and another Son,</l>
            <l>And both of us must by you now be kill'd.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Polydore</hi> you have already slain,</l>
            <l>Whilst like a Child he ran about the Field.</l>
            <l>And for my self (I fear) I pray in vain.</l>
            <l>But what am I that must no Quarter have?</l>
            <l>Though by the Father I am <hi>Hector</hi>'s Brother,</l>
            <l>That sent the good <hi>Patroclus</hi> to his grave,</l>
            <l>Yet I am nothing to him by the Mother.</l>
            <l>Thus pleaded he. <hi>Achilles</hi> then replied,</l>
            <l>Tell me no more of Ransome or of Quarter.</l>
            <l>'Tis true, I did before <hi>Patroclus</hi> died,</l>
            <l>Suffer some <hi>Trojans</hi> for their lives to barter.</l>
            <l>But now if any of the <hi>Trojans</hi> fall</l>
            <l>Into my hands before the Town of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And those of <hi>Priam</hi>'s Race the least of all</l>
            <l>Must from me hope to get alive away.</l>
            <l>But wherefore (friend) should you think much to die?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> a much better man is gone.</l>
            <l>You see how strong and tall a man am I,</l>
            <l>And of a noble Father am the Son,</l>
            <l>And have a Goddess for my Mother. Yet</l>
            <l>At morn, or noon, or night, with Shaft or Spear</l>
            <l>I'm sure by one or other to be hit</l>
            <l>And lose my life. Why therefore should you fear?</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Lycaon</hi>'s heart and limbs both fail'd,</l>
            <l>And of the Spear let's go his hold, and wide</l>
            <l>His hands he spread and his sad fate bewayl'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then his Sword drew from his side,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:93808:167"/>And gave him on the neck a mighty wound.</l>
            <l>The Swords whole bredth into his neck he took,</l>
            <l>And presently he fell dead to the ground.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> threw him then into the Brook,</l>
            <l>And said insulting, Go now to the deep,</l>
            <l>And feed the Fishes that will lick your blood;</l>
            <l>Your Mother over you shall never weep,</l>
            <l>But to the Sea you go shall with the Flood,</l>
            <l>Where to the curled water leaps a Fish,</l>
            <l>Upon <hi>Iycaon</hi>'s dainty fat to feed.</l>
            <l>And until <hi>Troy</hi> be by us won, I wish</l>
            <l>That th'other <hi>Trojans</hi> may no better speed,</l>
            <l>But flying, by my Spear be tost like Hay</l>
            <l>(<hi>Scamander</hi> shall afford them little aid,</l>
            <l>Though to his Stream they Bulls and Horses slay)</l>
            <l>Till for <hi>Patroclus</hi> death they all have paid.</l>
            <l>With these his haughty words <hi>Scamander</hi> griev'd,</l>
            <l>Contrived how <hi>Achilles</hi> to repel,</l>
            <l>And how the <hi>Trojans</hi> best might be reliev'd</l>
            <l>That to escape into his water fell.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> spi'd</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pelegons</hi> Son the Son of <hi>Axius,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of <hi>Axius</hi> the River deep and wide</l>
            <l>By th'Daughter of King <hi>Acessamenus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And to him with a mind to kill him went</l>
            <l>As he was newly come out of the water.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Xanthus</hi> gave him such encouragement</l>
            <l>(Because <hi>Achilles</hi> fill'd his Stream with slaughter)</l>
            <l>That there <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> for him staid,</l>
            <l>And both in right and left hand had a Spear</l>
            <l>And never sought the Combat to avoid.</l>
            <l>And when they were to one another near,</l>
            <l>Who are you (said <hi>Achilles</hi>) and whose Son,</l>
            <l>That in my anger dares approach me so?</l>
            <l>For I in Arms encountred am by none</l>
            <l>But those whose Parents destin'd are to wo.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> to him then repli'd.</l>
            <l>Why ask you me whose Son and who I am?</l>
            <l>The Forces of <hi>Paeonia</hi> I guide;</l>
            <l>To whom eleven days since I hither came.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:93808:168"/>Of my descent the Author <hi>Axius</hi> is,</l>
            <l>The fairest Stream that on the Earth doth run.</l>
            <l>His Son was <hi>Pelegon,</hi> and I am his.</l>
            <l>Thus who I am 'tis told you, and whose Son.</l>
            <l>And now, <hi>Achilles,</hi> it is time to fight.</l>
            <l>This said, from his two hands his two Spears fly</l>
            <l>(For both <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> hands were right)</l>
            <l>The one of them his mighty Shield did try</l>
            <l>But pierc'd it not; the plate of Gold withstood.</l>
            <l>The other gave his arm a little wound</l>
            <l>Neer to his elbow, and fetcht out some blood,</l>
            <l>And so beyond him went and stuck i'th'ground.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then his Spear with all his strength</l>
            <l>Incensed at <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> threw,</l>
            <l>Which missing into th'Earth went half its length.</l>
            <l>Then from his side his Sword <hi>Achilles</hi> drew.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> to <hi>Achilles</hi> Spear</l>
            <l>Went back, and at it thrice he pluckt in vain;</l>
            <l>Then thought to break it; but <hi>Achilles</hi> there</l>
            <l>Was with his Sword, and with that he was slain.</l>
            <l>For by the Sword his belly was so ript,</l>
            <l>That all his bowels issu'd at the wound.</l>
            <l>There him <hi>Achilles</hi> of his Armour stript,</l>
            <l>And ore him crow'd as he lay on the ground.</l>

            <l>With th'off-spring of the blessed Gods above?</l>
            <l>The Issue of a Brook, you say, you are,</l>
            <l>But I the Issue am of mighty <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For <hi>Peleus</hi> my Father was, and his</l>
            <l>Was <hi>Aeacus</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> begot.</l>
            <l>But greater he than any River is,</l>
            <l>Then equal to his Race, their Race is not.</l>
            <l>A River great enough you had at hand,</l>
            <l>But that you found had done you little good.</l>
            <l>For nothing can the Pow'r of <hi>Jove</hi> withstand;</l>
            <l>Not <hi>Achelous</hi> with his Royal Flood,</l>
            <l>Nor th'Ocean it self of Waters King,</l>
            <l>From whose abundance Seas their water take</l>

            <l>From <hi>Jove</hi> some danger presently they dread.</l>
            <l>This said, from th'Earth he pulled out his Spear,</l>
            <l>And left o'th'Sands <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> dead.</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Xanthus</hi> from his wound shall wash the blood,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then pursued those that stood</l>
            <l>Upon <hi>Scamander</hi> Bank amazed at</l>
            <l>The fury of the giddy Stream; and when</l>
            <l>They saw their Leader killed in their sight</l>
            <l>By th'hand of terrible <hi>Achilles,</hi> then</l>
            <l>They ev'ry one betook themselves to flight.</l>
            <l>Then with his Sword he slew <hi>Thersilochus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And after him the stout <hi>Astypylus,</hi>
            </l>

            </l>
            <l>And had shed yet much more <hi>Paeonian</hi> blood,</l>
            <l>But that <hi>Scamander</hi> at it took offence,</l>
            <l>And like a man above his water stood,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Achilles</hi> spake his mind from thence.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles,</hi> truly you excel in might,</l>
            <l>And Acts you do of great iniquitie,</l>
            <l>And by the Gods assisted are in fight.</l>
            <l>But though by <hi>Jove</hi> you should allowed be</l>
            <l>To kill the <hi>Trojans,</hi> kill them on the Plain.</l>
            <l>My Stream so choaked is with Carcasses,</l>
            <l>I cannot drive my waters to the Main.</l>
            <l>I wonder you should do such deeds as these.</l>
            <l>Let those you kill be killed openlie.</l>
            <l>Go therefore from me. Thus <hi>Scamander</hi> said.</l>
            <l>And then unto the River answer'd he,</l>
            <l>Divine <hi>Scamander,</hi> you shall be obey'd.</l>
            <l>But to pursue the <hi>Trojans</hi> I mean still,</l>
            <l>Till I have chas'd them up to <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And fight with <hi>Hector,</hi> if he stay, I will,</l>
            <l>And see if his or my last day be come.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Scamander</hi> then unto <hi>Apollo</hi> spake:</l>

            <l>At which <hi>Scamander</hi> swelling lifts his Waves,</l>
            <l>And out he throws the bodies of dead men,</l>
            <l>And from <hi>Achilles</hi> hand the living faves.</l>
            <l>Then throws a Billow on <hi>Achilles</hi> head.</l>
            <l>And heavie on his Shield the Current lay;</l>
            <l>And on the ground by no means he could tread,</l>
            <l>So fast the River carri'd him away.</l>
            <l>But ore the water hung an Elmen limb</l>
            <l>Which he laid hold on. Then fell down the Tree</l>
            <l>Into the River. And that saved him,</l>
            <l>And served as a Bridge to set him free.</l>
            <l>And swiftly then <hi>Achilles</hi> from him ran.</l>
            <l>But after him <hi>Scamander</hi> sent his water,</l>
            <l>Resolv'd to quench the fury of the man,</l>
            <l>And save the <hi>Trojans</hi> in his Stream from slaughter.</l>
            <l>And then as far as one can throw a Spear</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> from the Flood obliquely flies</l>
            <l>Swift as a Hawk; but yet was ne'r the near;</l>
            <l>For still he water has before his eyes.</l>

            <l>So <hi>Xanthus</hi> was before <hi>Achilles</hi> still.</l>
            <l>And ever as <hi>Achilles</hi> turn'd or stood</l>
            <l>To see if any God would by him stand,</l>
            <l>Above his shoulders rose the mighty Flood,</l>
            <l>And while he starts from's feet removes the Sand.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then himself bewailing said,</l>

            <l>Let some God 'gainst this River give me aid,</l>

            <l>And I will <hi>Zephyrus</hi> and <hi>Notus</hi> call</l>
            <l>From Sea, that for you shall so blow the flame;</l>
            <l>That th'Armour, and the heads o'th'<hi>Trojans</hi> all</l>
            <l>Shall not be able to endure the same.</l>
            <l>Go to his Bank, and burn up ev'ry Tree,</l>
            <l>And then throw fire on him, and never fear,</l>
            <l>Nor by his threats or pray'rs perswaded be</l>
            <l>To cease, until again you from me hear.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Vulcan</hi> then made ready a huge flame.</l>
            <l>And first the dead he burnt upon the Plain.</l>
            <l>Then to the water with his fire he came</l>
            <l>To send it to the Channel back again.</l>
            <l>As when a field new moistned is with rain</l>
            <l>In Summer-time, 'tis quickly dri'd agen</l>
            <l>By <hi>Boreas</hi>; so soon dri'd was the Plain,</l>
            <l>And burnt the bodies were of the dead men.</l>
            <l>And to the River then his flame he turn'd,</l>
            <l>Where th'Elms and Willows, Tamarisks, and Lote,</l>
            <l>Sedges, and many other Plants he burn'd</l>
            <l>That in or by the River grew about.</l>
            <l>And Eels and Fishes in the water hote</l>
            <l>Tumbled and turn'd their bellies up with heat;</l>
            <l>Into such pain by <hi>Vulcan</hi> they were put;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Xanthus</hi> fainting cover'd was with sweat,</l>
            <l>And then to <hi>Vulcan</hi> spake. <hi>Vulcan,</hi> said he,</l>
            <l>No God is able to resist your might.</l>
            <l>What are the <hi>Trojans</hi> or the <hi>Greeks</hi> to me?</l>
            <l>Give over. I'll no longer with you fight.</l>
            <l>Thus spake <hi>Scamander,</hi> boyling all the while.</l>
            <l>As when upon a fire of well-dri'd wood</l>
            <l>The grease of a fat Swine is made to boil;</l>
            <l>So boiled he, and went not on, but stood</l>
            <l>Making to <hi>Juno</hi> his complaint, and said,</l>
            <l>Why does your Son on me more fiercely fly</l>
            <l>Than on the rest that do the <hi>Trojans</hi> aid,</l>
            <l>And to be blamed more deserve than I?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:93808:170"/>Let him give over, and I'll do so too;</l>
            <l>And swear besides, if you my Oath require,</l>
            <l>That I will nothing for the <hi>Trojans</hi> do,</l>
            <l>Although the <hi>Greeks</hi> should set the Town on fire.</l>
            <l>This <hi>Xanthus</hi> said; and <hi>Juno</hi> hearing it,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Vulcan</hi> with a loud voice spake agen,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Vulcan</hi> now hold your hand. It is not fit</l>
            <l>T'offend a God too much, to pleasure men.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Vulcan</hi> hearing her his fire puts out;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Xanthus</hi> back into his Channel went.</l>
            <l>Thus were they parted and no longer sought;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Juno,</hi> though in choler, was content.</l>
            <l>And then the Gods amongst themselves fell out,</l>
            <l>And one against another stood in Duel,</l>
            <l>And Heav'n and Earth resounded as they fought.</l>
            <l>Giving each other many wounds and cruel.</l>
            <l>And up unto <hi>Olympus</hi> rise the Cry,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Jove</hi> sat on his Throne in Majestie,</l>
            <l>And casting on the Fields of <hi>Troy</hi> his eye,</l>
            <l>Laughed to see them fight that could not die.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Mars</hi> first began, and to <hi>Athena</hi> said,</l>
            <l>You, Impudent, that to engage in fight</l>
            <l>The Gods amongst themselves are not afraid,</l>
            <l>To satisfie your pride and endless spight,</l>
            <l>Remember how you on me set <hi>Tydide</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To throw his spear at me, and openly</l>
            <l>Unto my body you the same did guide</l>
            <l>With your own wicked hand, and wounded me,</l>
            <l>I'll pay you now, which was no sooner spoken,</l>
            <l>But <hi>Mars</hi> his Spear was at <hi>Athena</hi>'s Shield,</l>
            <l>Which not <hi>Jove</hi>'s Thunder-bolt could ere have broken.</l>
            <l>Then took she up a stone that lay i'th'Field,</l>
            <l>Great, knobby, black, that had been heretofore</l>
            <l>Set there, of some mans land to shew the bound.</l>
            <l>And with the same she strook <hi>Mars</hi> ore and ore.</l>
            <l>There lay he, and sev'n Acres hid of ground.</l>
            <l>And over him insulting, then said she,</l>
            <l>Lie there, and know I can you overcome;</l>
            <l>And that your Mother glad of this will be</l>
            <l>For fighting 'gainst the <hi>Greeks</hi> for <hi>Ilium</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:93808:171"/>This said, she from him turn'd. Then to him went</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Venus,</hi> and led him groaning from the place.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pallas</hi> (said <hi>Juno</hi>) see that Impudent</l>
            <l>That leads him out, and do her some disgrace.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Pallas</hi> to her went, and with her hand</l>
            <l>Hit her o'th'breast; then both fell on the Plain;</l>
            <l>For <hi>Mars</hi> without her could no longer stand.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Pallas</hi> over them insults again.</l>
            <l>So may, said she, lie all that stand for <hi>Troy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As these do here. Had it not been for them,</l>
            <l>The War had ended been; we come away;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Troy</hi> destroyed with all <hi>Priam</hi>'s Stem.</l>
            <l>This <hi>Pallas</hi> said, and <hi>Juno</hi> smil'd; and to</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo Neptune</hi> straightway neerer came.</l>
            <l>Why fight we not, said he, since others do?</l>
            <l>If we stand still, we cannot without shame</l>
            <l>Return to <hi>Jove,</hi> where scorned we shall be.</l>
            <l>Have you forgot how to <hi>Laomedon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To work for him, <hi>Jove</hi> once sent you and me,</l>
            <l>And how our wages was agreed upon,</l>
            <l>How I built houses for the <hi>Trojans</hi> all,</l>
            <l>As he direction gave me standing by,</l>
            <l>Besides, how hard I labour'd at the Wall,</l>
            <l>How fair I made it, and how strong and high,</l>
            <l>And how he sent you <hi>(Phoebus)</hi> to attend</l>
            <l>His Herds of Kine upon Mount <hi>Ida</hi> side,</l>
            <l>And when our work and th'year was at an end</l>
            <l>How proudly he our wages us deni'd</l>
            <l>And threatned you to bind you hand and foot,</l>
            <l>And sell you in some Island for a slave,</l>
            <l>And cut off both your and my ears to boot,</l>
            <l>And forc'd we were by flight our selves save?</l>
            <l>Yet for his people you have ever fought,</l>
            <l>Though by you they deserve to be destroy'd,</l>
            <l>And will not joyn with us to root them out.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Neptune Phoebus</hi> then repli'd and said,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Neptune,</hi> you would think me mad, if I</l>
            <l>Should fight with you for such a thing as man.</l>
            <l>They are but leaves, now fresh, to morrow die.</l>
            <l>And when he this had said, away he ran.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:93808:171"/>For with his Uncle loth he was to fight.</l>
            <l>His Sister then <hi>Diana</hi> to him came,</l>
            <l>That angry was to see him put to flight.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> (said she) is it not a shame</l>
            <l>Thus easily to give the Victory</l>
            <l>To <hi>Neptune?</hi> Wherefore carry you a Bow</l>
            <l>And Arrows, and to nothing them apply?</l>
            <l>D'ye carry them like Children for a show?</l>
            <l>Let me not hear you boasting any more</l>
            <l>That you to fight with <hi>Neptune</hi> did not fear,</l>
            <l>As in my Father's house you did before.</l>
            <l>Thus she. But <hi>Phoebus</hi> did not answer her.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Juno</hi> angry to <hi>Diana</hi> came,</l>
            <l>Bold-face, said she, how dare you with me fight</l>
            <l>That stronger than you are a great deal am?</l>
            <l>D'ye think that in your Bow there is such might?</l>
            <l>I know to women you a Lion are,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> permits you which you will to kill.</l>
            <l>But me to overcome 'tis harder farre</l>
            <l>Than t'hunt a Stag or Boar upon a Hill.</l>
            <l>But since you have a mind to understand</l>
            <l>What I can do, I'll let you see it now.</l>
            <l>Then both her wrists she seiz'd with her left hand,</l>
            <l>With th'other from her shoulders took her Bow,</l>
            <l>And beats her with the same about the ears,</l>
            <l>And laught to see her wrigling strive to fly.</l>
            <l>At last she freed her self, and shedding tears</l>
            <l>She fled (leaving her Bow and Shafts to lie</l>
            <l>Upon the ground dispersed here and there)</l>
            <l>Then forth came <hi>Hermes</hi> and <hi>Latona</hi> bright.</l>
            <l>And when they were to one another neer,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Leto,</hi> said he, I will not with you fight</l>
            <l>That are <hi>Jove</hi>'s Mistriss. Boast amongst the Gods</l>
            <l>That you have got the Victory in fight,</l>
            <l>And by no other means but the great ods</l>
            <l>You have in strength; and I will not deny't.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Latona</hi> gather'd up the Bow</l>
            <l>And Arrows of her Daughter <hi>Artemis.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To <hi>Jove</hi> went <hi>Artemis</hi> to let him know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>How ill she had been us'd; and at his knees</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:93808:172"/>She weeping sate. And <hi>Jove</hi> then made her rise,</l>
            <l>And to her said, Dear child, what God was that</l>
            <l>That was so rash as t'use you in this wise,</l>
            <l>As one that openly had done a fault?</l>
            <l>'Twas <hi>Juno</hi> (then said <hi>Artemis</hi>) your Wife;</l>
            <l>And she it was that was of all the first</l>
            <l>To set the Gods amongst themselves at strife.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Jove</hi> and she between themselves discourst,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Phoebus</hi> went into the Town of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For still he had a care to guard the Wall,</l>
            <l>For fear the <hi>Greeks</hi> the City should destroy.</l>
            <l>But to <hi>Olympus</hi> th'other Gods went all,</l>
            <l>One part triumphing, th'other discontent,</l>
            <l>And sate down by their Father <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Mean while <hi>Achilles</hi> fiercely forward went</l>
            <l>Killing of Men and Horses with his Spear.</l>
            <l>As in a Town on fire the people all</l>
            <l>Are busie, and the most of them undone,</l>
            <l>So did it with the <hi>Trojans</hi> then befal;</l>
            <l>Some slain were by <hi>Achilles,</hi> and some run.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Priam</hi> standing was upon a Tower,</l>
            <l>And saw the <hi>Trojans</hi> by <hi>Achilles</hi> chac'd,</l>
            <l>And that to turn again they had no power.</l>
            <l>And down unto the Gates he came in haste;</l>
            <l>And to the Porters order gave, and said,</l>
            <l>Open the Gates and let the people in,</l>
            <l>That from <hi>Achilles</hi> hither fly dismai'd,</l>
            <l>And shut them when you see they are within.</l>
            <l>For if that cruel man should with them get</l>
            <l>Within the Wall, 'twould be a dismal day.</l>
            <l>The Porters then the Gates wide open set.</l>
            <l>Then to the Gates the <hi>Trojans</hi> took their way,</l>
            <l>Pursued by <hi>Achilles</hi> as they fled.</l>
            <l>And sure he taken had the Town of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But that <hi>Apollo</hi> then encouraged</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Agenor</hi> to oppose him by the way.</l>
            <l>And lest he should be by <hi>Achilles</hi> slain</l>
            <l>He at the Beech-tree neer him took his stand</l>
            <l>When need should be to bring him off again</l>
            <l>Unwounded from <hi>Achilles</hi> heavie hand.</l>
            <l>

            <l>He troubled was, and to himself thus spake.</l>
            <l>What shall I do? if from him I should fly</l>
            <l>To <hi>Ilium</hi> the way that others take,</l>
            <l>He'll overtake me and cut off my head.</l>
            <l>For swifter much he is of foot than I.</l>
            <l>What if I let him on the <hi>Trojans</hi> tread,</l>
            <l>And I some other way to <hi>Ida</hi> fly,</l>
            <l>And hide my self i'th'Bushes there till night?</l>
            <l>But why do I discourse thus foolishly?</l>
            <l>I cannot pass the Plain but in his sight;</l>
            <l>And then I lost am without remedy.</l>
            <l>But if I stay and fight with him, what then?</l>
            <l>His body is not made of Steel nor Brass,</l>
            <l>But mortal is (they say) like other men,</l>
            <l>And like to other men but one life has.</l>
            <l>His glorious Acts are <hi>Jupiters,</hi> not his.</l>
            <l>This said, he for <hi>Achilles</hi> coming staid</l>
            <l>As when i'th'Woods a Panther rowsed is,</l>
            <l>At hearing of the Hounds he's not afraid,</l>
            <l>But to the Hunter goes for all his Spear:</l>
            <l>And though pierc'd through therewith will to him fly</l>
            <l>Upon the Spear it self; that being near</l>
            <l>He either may revenged be or die,</l>
            <l>So resolutely then <hi>Antenor</hi>'s Son</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Agenor</hi> for <hi>Achilles</hi> waiting staid,</l>
            <l>And at him aim'd his Spear as he came on.</l>
            <l>And lifting up his voice unto him said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles,</hi> Oh, you think this day to win</l>
            <l>The Town of <hi>Troy.</hi> There's yet much work to do.</l>
            <l>For many mighty men there are therein,</l>
            <l>And many dangers to be waded through.</l>
            <l>They of their Wives and Parents will take care,</l>
            <l>And little Babes; but you shall perish here</l>
            <l>As terrible and mighty as you are.</l>
            <l>And as he spake, he at him threw his Spear;</l>
            <l>Which on his leg below the knee did light,</l>
            <l>And with the stroak resounded then the Tin.</l>
            <l>But the Celestial Arms were of such might,</l>
            <l>That it rebounded back and went not in.</l>

               <hi>Achilles</hi> hand, and save themselves in <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He took upon himself <hi>Agenor</hi>'s shape,</l>
            <l>And put himself into <hi>Achilles</hi> way.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> then pursues, and <hi>Phoebus</hi> flies</l>
            <l>Along <hi>Scamander</hi>'s Bank upon the Plain,</l>
            <l>And kept before him still, but in such wise,</l>
            <l>As t'overtake him he might hope in vain.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> thus by <hi>Phoebus</hi> was deceived</l>
            <l>Till from the Town he far was led away.</l>
            <l>Mean while the flying <hi>Trojans</hi> were received,</l>
            <l>And thronging got within the Gates of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For none of them without the Gate durst stay</l>
            <l>To ask, who had escaped and who not;</l>
            <l>So glad they were of getting into <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That how all others sped they never thought.</l>

            <l>THus were the <hi>Trojans</hi> driven into <hi>Troy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Like Deer, and up unto the Wall they went,</l>
            <l>And from their bodies rub'd the sweat away,</l>
            <l>And with good Wine renew'd their Spirits spent,</l>
            <l>And to the Wall advancing was the Fo.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> hamper'd by his cruel Fate</l>
            <l>Into the Town of <hi>Troy</hi> refus'd to go,</l>
            <l>And staid without, before the <hi>Scaean</hi> Gate.</l>
            <l>Then to <hi>Achilles Phoebus</hi> spake, and said,</l>
            <l>Why do you thus pursue me (<hi>Peleus</hi> Son)</l>
            <l>That am a God? which but by passion swai'd</l>
            <l>You might have known; but rashly you run on,</l>
            <l>And only look how you may slaughter men.</l>
            <l>For else, why could you not contented be,</l>
            <l>When you had pent the <hi>Trojans</hi> up; but then</l>
            <l>Must leave your way so far to follow me,</l>
            <l>And cannot kill me; for I cannot die?</l>
            <l>At this <hi>Achilles</hi> vext was at the heart;</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Apollo</hi> answer'd angerlie;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> thou the most pernitious art</l>
            <l>Of all the Gods, that hast me thus misled.</l>
            <l>For had I unto <hi>Ilium</hi> kept my way</l>
            <l>I strowed had the Field with <hi>Trojans</hi> dead</l>
            <l>Before they could have entred into <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>

            <l>This said, to <hi>Troy</hi> he went a mighty pace,</l>
            <l>And mighty things conceived in his mind,</l>

            <l>For brightly from afar his Armour shin'd</l>
            <l>Like the fair Star that does in Autumn rise,</l>
            <l>But Agues brings, and is to men unkind,</l>
            <l>And called is <hi>Orion</hi>'s Dog. So bright</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> in his Armour did appear,</l>
            <l>And put the old man <hi>Priam</hi> in affright,</l>
            <l>And made him groan and roar and tear his hair.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Hector</hi> then he cri'd aloud and said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector</hi> come in, come in my dearest Son;</l>
            <l>For mightily I for you am afraid,</l>
            <l>Fight not against that cruel man alone.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> stronger is than you by ods;</l>
            <l>Lose not your life to give him Victorie.</l>
            <l>Oh that he were beloved by the Gods</l>
            <l>No better than he is belov'd by me!</l>
            <l>He eaten had ere now been on the Plain</l>
            <l>By Dogs and Fowl, and I been comforted</l>
            <l>A little, for my Sons whom he hath slain,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Lycaon</hi> now I miss and <hi>Polydore.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They came not into <hi>Troy</hi> with them that fled.</l>
            <l>Their Mother brought me with her wealth good store</l>
            <l>To pay their Ransom if they be not dead.</l>
            <l>If they be slain, 'tis then remediless.</l>
            <l>Their Parents and the people all will grieve;</l>
            <l>But yet their sorrow will be much the less</l>
            <l>If <hi>Hector</hi> still preserved be and live.</l>
            <l>Come therefore quickly in (dear Child) and save</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> and their Wives, your self and Wife;</l>
            <l>And do not let <hi>Achilles</hi> th'honour have</l>
            <l>Alone to have deprived you of life.</l>

            <l>The cruel slaughter of my Sons must see,</l>

            <l>That at my Table dayly take their food.</l>
            <l>When young men slain are by the chance of Warre,</l>
            <l>There nothing is whereof to be ashamed;</l>

            <l>There's nothing to a man more miserable.</l>
            <l>Thus said old <hi>Priam</hi> tugging his gray hairs.</l>
            <l>But to prevail with <hi>Hector</hi> was not able.</l>
            <l>And to him then his Mother spake with tears,</l>
            <l>And from her bosom layed out a Teat,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> if this ere pleased you (said she)</l>
            <l>Dear Son, I pray you into <hi>Troy</hi> retreat,</l>
            <l>And have compassion on my miserie.</l>
            <l>Come in; between you let there be a Wall.</l>
            <l>For if you should be slain, your Wife and I</l>
            <l>Shall not lament you at your Funeral;</l>
            <l>But at the Ships a prey for Dogs you'll lie.</l>
            <l>Thus weeping he and she to <hi>Hector</hi> pray'd,</l>
            <l>And nothing to them answer'd he agen;</l>
            <l>But obstinately for <hi>Achilles</hi> stay'd.</l>
            <l>And as a Snake roll'd up before his den,</l>
            <l>With venom fed, when coming towards him</l>
            <l>He sees a man, and stirred is his gall,</l>
            <l>Looks cruelly; so <hi>Hector</hi> looking grim</l>
            <l>Staid with his Shield set up against the Wall;</l>
            <l>And grieving, to himself he spake, and said,</l>
            <l>If I should now into the City go,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Polydamas</hi> the first would me upbraid,</l>
            <l>That yesternight advis'd me to do so,</l>
            <l>Then when <hi>Achilles</hi> in the Field was seen.</l>
            <l>But his good counsel I refused then,</l>
            <l>Which to have follow'd had much better been;</l>
            <l>Lost by my folly are so many men.</l>
            <l>And now I fear the <hi>Trojans</hi> and their Wives</l>
            <l>Will censure me, and some man worse than I</l>
            <l>Say I have cast away the peoples lives,</l>
            <l>Presuming on my strength so foolishly.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:93808:175"/>So they will say. And therefore better 'tis</l>
            <l>To venture on <hi>Achilles,</hi> though I die,</l>
            <l>A better way I cannot take than this.</l>
            <l>For should I lay my Shield and Helmet by,</l>
            <l>And leave my Spear set up against the Wall,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Achilles</hi> thus disarmed come,</l>

            <l>The wealth she with her brought to <hi>Ilium</hi>;</l>
            <l>And to the <hi>Greeks</hi> give half the goods of <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And take an Oath that we will nothing hide,</l>
            <l>Nor any thing out of their sight convey,</l>
            <l>But bring it forth and faithfully divide.</l>
            <l>But whither to no purpose runs my mind?</l>
            <l>I will not do't. For it were but in vain.</l>
            <l>I ne'r the sooner should his favour find,</l>
            <l>But by him so much eas'lier be slain.</l>
            <l>I cannot with him talk from Hill nor Tree,</l>
            <l>As boys and wenches do. He is too nigh.</l>
            <l>And therefore here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I'll stay for him, and see</l>
            <l>Whether my Fate it be or his to die.</l>
            <l>Whilst yet he spake <hi>Achilles</hi> near him was,</l>
            <l>As terrible as <hi>Mars,</hi> and shook his Spear;</l>
            <l>As flaming fire relucent was the brass,</l>
            <l>Or as the Sun at morning doth appear.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> durst no longer stay, but fled.</l>
            <l>Fear nimbly made his feet and knees to move.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> no less swiftly followed.</l>
            <l>As when a Hawk is flying at a Dove,</l>
            <l>The Dove flies out aside, her self to save;</l>
            <l>But by the Hawk agen is followed,</l>
            <l>That gives not over till the prey he have;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> so pursu'd and <hi>Hector</hi> fled,</l>
            <l>Keeping the Cart-way still under <hi>Troy</hi> Wall;</l>
            <l>And to the Watch-tow'r came and Sycamore,</l>
            <l>And the two Springs that into <hi>Xanthus</hi> fall,</l>
            <l>Whereof the one is always cover'd ore</l>
            <l>With smoak as if upon a fire it were,</l>
            <l>And with hot water all the year doth flow.</l>
            <l>The water of the other all the year</l>
            <l>As cold is as the Hail, or Ice, or Snow,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:93808:175"/>And two fine Washing-places built were there,</l>
            <l>To which the <hi>Trojan</hi> women us'd to come,</l>
            <l>And wash their Garments when they sully'd were</l>

            </l>
            <l>This way they ran, and swifty mov'd their thighs.</l>
            <l>For 'twas not for a piece of flesh or hide,</l>
            <l>Which of Foot-races is the usual Prize,</l>
            <l>But for the life of <hi>Hector</hi> that they vi'd.</l>
            <l>As when Race-horses run for some great Prize,</l>
            <l>That used to it are, most swiftly run;</l>
            <l>So <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> now ran thrice</l>
            <l>About <hi>Troy</hi> Wall, the Gods all looking on.</l>
            <l>Then (speaking to the Gods) Behold, said <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I <hi>Hector</hi> see in danger to be slain,</l>
            <l>A good and pious man, and whom I love;</l>
            <l>And for him now my heart is in great pain.</l>
            <l>For he hath made me many a Sacrifice</l>
            <l>Both in my house on <hi>Ida</hi> and in <hi>Troy</hi>;</l>
            <l>And now before the swift <hi>Achilles</hi> flies.</l>
            <l>Say, shall he die, or be convey'd away?</l>
            <l>Father, said <hi>Pallas</hi> then, what's this you say?</l>
            <l>He's Mortal, and by Fate condemned is,</l>
            <l>And will you now the Execution stay?</l>
            <l>You may. But th'other Gods will take't amiss.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> to <hi>Pallas</hi> then again repli'd,</l>
            <l>Sweet Child, it was not seriously meant,</l>
            <l>But only said. You shall not be deni'd.</l>
            <l>Do what you please your self; I am content.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Athena</hi> glad leapt down to <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles Hector</hi> still pursu'd; and as</l>
            <l>A Hound in view pursueth all the way</l>
            <l>A frighted Hare, so coursed <hi>Hector</hi> was.</l>
            <l>Nor suffer'd was to double or to squat.</l>
            <l>For when he to the Gate ran for defence,</l>
            <l>Between the Gate and him <hi>Achilles</hi> gat,</l>
            <l>So that he could not stay for help from thence.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> never would the Wall forsake;</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> still upon the Cart-way fled.</l>
            <l>As men can neither flie nor overtake</l>
            <l>When in a Dream they think it in their bed;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:93808:176"/>So <hi>Hector</hi> from <hi>Achilles</hi> could not fly,</l>
            <l>Nor could <hi>Achilles Hector</hi> overtake.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Phoebus Hector</hi> did with strength supply.</l>
            <l>But of him then no further care did take.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> by a signe all else forbad</l>
            <l>To throw a Spear, for fear the greatest glory</l>
            <l>Some other of the <hi>Argives</hi> should have had,</l>
            <l>And he come after but as accessory.</l>
            <l>When to the Springs the fourth time they were nigh,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> took his golden Balance up, and laid</l>
            <l>In one o'th'Scales <hi>Achilles</hi> Destiny,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi>'s in the other; and them weigh'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector</hi>'s was heaviest, and down fell the same</l>
            <l>As low as Hell, so much it overweigh'd.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Phoebus</hi> parted. And t'<hi>Achilles</hi> came</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Athena</hi> nigh, and speaking to him said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles,</hi> now (I think) we shall not miss</l>
            <l>Of killing <hi>Hector,</hi> but with honour go</l>
            <l>To th'Ships, as greedy as of Fight he is.</l>
            <l>For sure I am he cannot scape us now.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> in vain to <hi>Jove</hi> shall for him pray.</l>
            <l>But stay you here and breathe a while. For I</l>
            <l>Will to him go and make him for you stay,</l>
            <l>And so encourage him he shall not fly.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Achilles</hi> leaning on his Spear</l>
            <l>Staid where he was. To <hi>Hector Pallas</hi> came.</l>
            <l>So like <hi>Deiphobus</hi> she did appear</l>
            <l>In shape and voice, he took her for the same.</l>
            <l>And when she with him was, she to him said,</l>
            <l>Brother, you still are by <hi>Achilles</hi> cours'd</l>
            <l>About the Wall of <hi>Troy.</hi> Be not afraid.</l>
            <l>I'll by you stand, and let him do his worst.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Deiphobus,</hi> said <hi>Hector,</hi> who before</l>
            <l>Was dearest to me of my Brothers all,</l>
            <l>I bound am now to honour you much more,</l>
            <l>That t'aid me durst appear without the Wall</l>
            <l>When all the rest remain within for fear.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pallas</hi> to <hi>Hector</hi> then repli'd and said,</l>
            <l>Brother, my Father and my Mother dear,</l>
            <l>And friends with their entreaties had me staid,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:93808:176"/>So dreadful is <hi>Achilles</hi> to them all.</l>
            <l>But I would not. But come, let's go and trie</l>
            <l>Whether it be our fate by him to fall,</l>
            <l>Or his by <hi>Hector</hi>'s hand and Spear to die.</l>
            <l>This said, she went before him with her Spear,</l>
            <l>Lest he some fraud mistrusting should have staid.</l>
            <l>And when they were unto <hi>Achilles</hi> near,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector</hi> spake first, and to <hi>Achilles</hi> said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pelides</hi> though before you I have fled</l>
            <l>Now thrice about the Wall, and durst not stay,</l>
            <l>Yet now to stand I am determined</l>
            <l>And fight till either I be slain or slay.</l>
            <l>But come, let's first the Gods to witness call</l>
            <l>Of what shall be agreed 'twixt you and me.</l>
            <l>If by my hand it be your chance to fall,</l>
            <l>Your body dead shall not abused be.</l>
            <l>I'll take your Arms and send them into <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Your body dead the <hi>Greeks</hi> shall have again</l>
            <l>Entire and not disgraced any way.</l>
            <l>Do you the like to me if I be slain.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> sowrely looking said agen,</l>
            <l>Talk not of Oaths and Covenants to me,</l>
            <l>That nothing worth 'twixt Lions are and Men,</l>
            <l>And Wolves with Lambs on nothing can agree.</l>
            <l>And you and I shall one another hate,</l>
            <l>Nor Oaths and Pacts between us will stand good</l>
            <l>Till we blood-thirsty <hi>Mars</hi> shall satiate</l>
            <l>Either with <hi>Hector</hi>'s or <hi>Achilles</hi> blood.</l>
            <l>It now behoves you all your Pow'r to show,</l>
            <l>And be an able man of War indeed.</l>
            <l>You cannot, as you did, run from me now,</l>
            <l>Although (I think) you never had more need.</l>
            <l>For by <hi>Athena</hi> slain you shall be here,</l>
            <l>And for the slaughter of the <hi>Greeks</hi> be paid.</l>
            <l>This said, he at him threw his heavie Spear.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> stooping did the same avoid.</l>
            <l>And ore his head the Spear then harmless flew.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Pallas</hi> quickly snatcht it from the sand</l>
            <l>Invisibly, which <hi>Hector</hi> never knew,</l>
            <l>And put the same into <hi>Achilles</hi> hand.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:93808:177"/>Then <hi>Hector</hi> to <hi>Achilles</hi> spake and said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles,</hi> you have miss'd. My Fate unknown</l>
            <l>Is to you yet. And me to make afraid,</l>
            <l>You have devised fables of your own.</l>
            <l>Upon my back your Spear shall never fall.</l>
            <l>If by it to be slain my fate it be,</l>
            <l>It shall be on my breast or not at all.</l>
            <l>But how my Spear will speed now let me see.</l>
            <l>Oh that it would into your body go!</l>
            <l>The <hi>Trojans</hi> would the War much better bear,</l>
            <l>Since from your hand proceeds the greatest wo.</l>
            <l>And as he spake away he sent his Spear.</l>
            <l>And on <hi>Achilles</hi> Shield it lighted just,</l>
            <l>But enter'd not; and other he had none.</l>
            <l>Upon <hi>Deiphobus</hi> lay all his trust.</l>
            <l>But when he call'd <hi>Deiphobus</hi> was gone.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hector</hi> then perceiv'd his death was neer;</l>
            <l>And Oh (said he) the Gods now for me call.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Deiphobus</hi> (I thought) stood by me here.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Pallas</hi> 'twas. He's still within the Wall.</l>
            <l>I shall not scape. I see, <hi>Jove</hi> heretofore,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Phoebus</hi> too, did mean it should be so.</l>
            <l>They sav'd me oft, but will do so no more.</l>
            <l>But let me somewhat do before I go;</l>
            <l>That men may speak of me in time to come;</l>
            <l>And not ignoble die. And at that word</l>
            <l>He roused up his fainting heart, and from</l>
            <l>His side he drew his great and heavie Sword.</l>
            <l>As when an Eagle stoopeth to the plain</l>
            <l>From a dark cloud, a tender Lamb t'invade,</l>
            <l>Or fearful Hare; so <hi>Hector</hi> went amain</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Achilles</hi> brandishing his shining Blade.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> angry on the other side</l>
            <l>Came on, and cruel thoughts had in his mind,</l>
            <l>And up he kept his Shield his breast to hide,</l>
            <l>And on his head like fire his Helmet shin'd.</l>
            <l>And as he went at ev'ry step he trod,</l>
            <l>His Plume by <hi>Vulcan</hi> made of golden hair,</l>
            <l>And to his Crest applied, gave a nod,</l>
            <l>And ore his shoulders terribly did flare.</l>

            <l>The brightest Star that shineth in the Sky;</l>
            <l>So gloriously the point shin'd of his Spear.</l>
            <l>Thus terribly to <hi>Hector</hi> he drew nigh.</l>
            <l>And view'd his Arms to see which way his Spear</l>
            <l>Might with most ease unto his body pass.</l>
            <l>But ev'ry where entire and close they were,</l>
            <l>Save at the neck a little gap there was.</l>
            <l>At that he aim'd, and with great force he smot</l>
            <l>Him with his mighty Spear clean through the neck;</l>
            <l>And yet the Spear his wind-pipe wounded not.</l>
            <l>Then down he fell, but able was to speak.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> over him insulting said,</l>

            </l>
            <l>You safe were, and of me were not afraid,</l>
            <l>Because you knew I was not in the Field</l>
            <l>And like a fool ne'r thought of what a frier</l>
            <l>To take revenge he left had at the Fleet.</l>
            <l>Who now has brought you to an evil end,</l>
            <l>For Dogs to eat, whilst he has burial meet.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hector</hi> feebly to him said again,</l>
            <l>Let not by Dogs my body eaten be,</l>
            <l>But be contented that you have me slain.</l>
            <l>My friends at any price will ransome me.</l>
            <l>Take Brass and Gold as much as you require;</l>
            <l>And to my Father send my body home,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Hector</hi> said. <hi>Achilles</hi> answer'd to't,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector</hi> you Dog, speak not of Price to me.</l>
            <l>If I my self could eat thee I would do't.</l>
            <l>But by the Dogs I'm sure you'll eaten be.</l>
            <l>If they would give me twenty times as much,</l>
            <l>Or buy thy body weight for weight with Gold,</l>
            <l>And promise as much more, your deeds are such,</l>
            <l>Your body shall not at that price be sold.</l>
            <l>Nor shall your Mother lay you on a bed,</l>
            <l>And over you lamenting stand and howl;</l>
            <l>But in the open field you shall lie dead</l>

               <hi>Hector</hi> repli'd (though ready now to die)</l>
            <l>I knew you had a heart as hard as steel.</l>
            <l>But thus much to you I will prophecie,</l>

            <l>Leaving his Limbs, his Soul bewailing flew.</l>
            <l>And yet <hi>Achilles</hi> did agen reply,</l>

            <l>And when the Gods call for me so will I.</l>

            <l>Since when unto the Ships he came with fire.</l>
            <l>Then spake <hi>Achilles</hi> to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and said,</l>
            <l>My Friends, that in the Army have command,</l>
            <l>Since by the Gods this great man is destroy'd,</l>
            <l>And lies before you killed by my hand,</l>
            <l>Who did the <hi>Argive</hi> people more annoy</l>

            <l>Or still defend the same without him will.</l>
            <l>But why should this come now into my head</l>

            <l>And all the comely Dressings of her head,</l>
            <l>Veil, Kerchess, Rubans, Knots to th'ground came down,</l>
            <l>And Coronet unto her given by</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Venus,</hi> when she with <hi>Hector</hi> married.</l>
            <l>Her Sister laws that stood about her nigh</l>
            <l>Then took her up with sorrow almost dead.</l>
            <l>And when again her Spirits to her came,</l>
            <l>She wept, and spake, and stopt and spake agen.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hector,</hi> of women I most wretched am;</l>
            <l>And you the most unfortunate of men,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:93808:179"/>Both born to one and the same evil fate,</l>
            <l>You here in <hi>Ilium</hi> King <hi>Priam</hi>'s Son.</l>
            <l>And I in <hi>Thebe</hi> child infortunate</l>
            <l>Of the infortunate <hi>Eëtion.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And you now to the Shades below are gone,</l>
            <l>And me a woful Widow here have left,</l>
            <l>And with me my sweet Babe your tender Son,</l>
            <l>And cannot (since you are of life bereft)</l>
            <l>Do to him any good, nor he to you.</l>
            <l>And though he should escape the <hi>Argives</hi> now,</l>
            <l>Yet poverty and woe will him pursue,</l>
            <l>And other men his goodly fields will plough.</l>
            <l>A Child that is an Orphan has no friend;</l>
            <l>And (though with tears) must stoop to whatsoere</l>
            <l>To the supplying of his need shall tend</l>
            <l>When he his want of Food no more can bear.</l>
            <l>So to your friends my Child shall go, and take</l>
            <l>One by the Cloak, another by the Coat,</l>
            <l>That give him may some Wine for pity's sake,</l>
            <l>Enough to cool his lips, but not his throat.</l>
            <l>Or else some Son of them that sit at meat</l>
            <l>May rate, or give him a good box o'th'Ear,</l>
            <l>And bid him quickly out o'th'Hall to get,</l>
            <l>And tell him that his Father dines not there.</l>
            <l>Then weeping comes <hi>Astyanax</hi> to me,</l>
            <l>That us'd was by his Father to be fed</l>
            <l>With Mutton fat and Marrow on his knee,</l>
            <l>And with his Nurse repose on a soft Bed.</l>
            <l>But since his Father now is dead and gone,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Astyanax</hi> (whom so the <hi>Trojans</hi> call</l>

            <l>(When you were here) the <hi>Trojan</hi> Gates and Wall)</l>
            <l>Intolerable grief is like to find,</l>
            <l>Since at the Ships you dead and naked lie</l>
            <l>For Worms to feed on when the Dogs have din'd,</l>
            <l>While all your precious Garments here have I</l>
            <l>Of womans work, and burn them will, since you</l>
            <l>Now never in them likely are to lie,</l>
            <l>'Tis to the Wives of <hi>Troy</hi> an honour due.</l>
            <l>This weeping spoken made the women sigh.</l>

            <l>THus wayl'd the <hi>Trojans</hi> then in <hi>Ilium.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To <hi>Hellespont</hi> th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> streight went down,</l>
            <l>And when they to their hollow Ships were come</l>
            <l>Dispers'd themselves each man unto his own.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> only staid his <hi>Myrmidons</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Upon the place; and thus unto them spake.</l>
            <l>You, <hi>Myrmidons</hi> my stout Companions,</l>
            <l>You must not from your Chars your Horses take.</l>
            <l>With Horses and with Chars we first must go,</l>
            <l>And for <hi>Patroclus</hi> weep about his Biere.</l>
            <l>And when we have by weeping eas'd our wo,</l>
            <l>Unty your Horses and we'll all sup here.</l>
            <l>This said, they wayl'd. <hi>Achilles</hi> first began;</l>
            <l>And thrice about <hi>Patroclus</hi> Biere they drave.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Thetis</hi> (fallen was so great a man)</l>
            <l>Amongst them stood, and tears unto them gave</l>
            <l>Which down their Armour fell into the Sand.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> bad him then with tears, farewel.</l>
            <l>And laying on <hi>Patroclus</hi> breast his hand,</l>
            <l>Rejoyce, said he, <hi>Patroclus</hi> though in Hell.</l>
            <l>For now I to you shall my word make good,</l>
            <l>Since hither I have <hi>Hector</hi> dragged dead,</l>
            <l>For Dogs to eat. And to revenge your blood,</l>
            <l>Twelve <hi>Trojans</hi> I will at your Pile behead.</l>
            <l>This said, he <hi>Hector</hi> laid upon his face</l>
            <l>I'th'dust before the Biere disgracefully.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Myrmidons</hi> mean while their Arms unlace,</l>
            <l>And th'Horses from the Chariots unty.</l>
            <l>And then down by <hi>Achilles</hi> Ship they sat,</l>
            <l>Who gave unto them all a Fun'ral Feast,</l>
            <l>And for them flew both Goats and Muttons fat,</l>
            <l>And Swine good store, and many a well-fed Beast.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:93808:180"/>But to <hi>Achilles</hi> then came in the Lords,</l>
            <l>To wait upon him t'<hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Tent,</l>
            <l>That he might try with comfortable words</l>
            <l>If he could mitigate his discontent.</l>
            <l>When they were there <hi>Atrides</hi> first commands</l>
            <l>His Ministers to bring in water hot</l>
            <l>To wash the gore from off his face and hands.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> peremptorily said, Not</l>
            <l>And swearing, unto <hi>Agamemnon</hi> said,</l>
            <l>By <hi>Jove</hi> that is of all the Gods most high,</l>
            <l>Till I <hi>Patroclus</hi> in the fire have laid,</l>
            <l>And rais'd him have a Tomb wherein to lie,</l>
            <l>And with him burnt these Locks of mine, not hand</l>
            <l>Nor face shall washed be by me. But now</l>
            <l>Let's sup. I'th'morning I will give command</l>
            <l>That for his Pile we may have wood enough,</l>
            <l>That speedily the body we may burn.</l>
            <l>And when out of our sight we have it laid,</l>
            <l>The people to their business may return.</l>
            <l>Thus he advised, and it was obey'd.</l>
            <l>The people then in haste to supper went,</l>
            <l>And had good chear, and heartily they fed.</l>
            <l>And when their hunger and their thirst was spent,</l>
            <l>Into their Tents went ev'ry man to bed.</l>
            <l>Down went <hi>Achilles</hi> to the waters side</l>
            <l>Attended on by many <hi>Myrmidons,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And in a place clean washed by the Tide</l>
            <l>He laid him down to sleep upon the stones.</l>
            <l>Nor was it long ere sleep upon him crept.</l>
            <l>For labour'd very hard he had that day.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Hector</hi> him in exercise had kept</l>
            <l>Running before him round the Wall of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And then the Spirit of <hi>Patroclus</hi> dead,</l>
            <l>Like him in Stature, Garments, Voice, and Eyes</l>
            <l>Appeared to him standing at his head,</l>
            <l>And speaking said unto him in this wise.</l>
            <l>You sleep, <hi>Achilles,</hi> and have me forgot,</l>
            <l>Though when I was alive you lov'd me well.</l>
            <l>Pray bury me, these Spirits here will not</l>
            <l>Let me come in within the Gates of Hell,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:93808:181"/>Nor let me mix with those beyond the River,</l>
            <l>But make me wander 'bout the house of <hi>Dis.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Give me your hand upon't, for I shall never</l>
            <l>Return, when once my body burned is.</l>
            <l>We shall no more together counsel take,</l>
            <l>Since by my Fate I taken am away,</l>
            <l>And you your self, divine <hi>Achilles,</hi> make</l>
            <l>Account to die before the Walls of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And then the favour let me have, I pray,</l>
            <l>That when my flesh consum'd is in the flame,</l>
            <l>My bones with yours you will be pleas'd to lay,</l>
            <l>And let the Urn that holds them be the same;</l>
            <l>That golden Urn which <hi>Thetis</hi> gave to you.</l>
            <l>We long with one another lived have.</l>
            <l>For when <hi>Amphidamas</hi> his Son I slew,</l>
            <l>Unto your house I fled my life to save,</l>
            <l>From <hi>Opus</hi> being little past a boy,</l>
            <l>And childishly the quarrel took at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hess;</l>
            <l>And never meant him ill before that day,</l>
            <l>And sorry was I for my foolishness.</l>
            <l>Your Father to his House then took me in,</l>
            <l>Made me your man, and lov'd and cherisht me,</l>
            <l>And since so long we have together been,</l>
            <l>Why should not now our bones together be?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> to the shadow then repli'd,</l>
            <l>Sweet friend, what need had you to come from Hell</l>
            <l>To tell me this? I for you do provide</l>
            <l>That all you say may be performed well.</l>
            <l>Come neerer to me that embrace we may</l>
            <l>A little while, and one another moan.</l>
            <l>This said, his arms he spreads; and then away</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> sunk, and left him there alone.</l>
            <l>At this amazed up <hi>Achilles</hi> starts.</l>
            <l>Oh, oh, said he, I see 'tis certain then,</l>
            <l>In Hell there Souls are, though they have no hearts,</l>
            <l>But Idols only are, and Forms of Men.</l>
            <l>For by me standing was the Soul all night</l>
            <l>Of my <hi>Patroclus</hi> to me dictating,</l>
            <l>And wonderfully like him 'twas to th'sight;</l>
            <l>And what he wanted told me ev'ry thing.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:93808:181"/>This said, again about the body dead</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> and the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> lament,</l>
            <l>And so continu'd till the day was spread;</l>
            <l>But to the Wood then <hi>Agamemnon</hi> sent</l>
            <l>From ev'ry part of th'Army men to <hi>Ide,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whereof some Axes carri'd in their hands,</l>
            <l>And others Ropes. And with them goes for Guide</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Meriones,</hi> and, as their Chief, commands.</l>
            <l>Ore Hills and Dales then to the Woods they went</l>
            <l>Driving their Mules before them all the way;</l>
            <l>And lusty Oaks unto the ground they sent,</l>
            <l>And cleft them into pieces as they lay.</l>
            <l>And those unto the Mules with Ropes they ti'd,</l>
            <l>And ev'ry one of them took in his hand</l>
            <l>Either a heavie Bough or Limb beside.</l>
            <l>For so <hi>Meriones</hi> had giv'n command.</l>
            <l>This done, they back descended to the Plain</l>
            <l>Fast as they could through Bry'rs and Bushes store;</l>
            <l>And quickly at the Ships they were again,</l>
            <l>And laid their wood in order on the shore.</l>
            <l>Then to the <hi>Myrmidons Achilles</hi> spake,</l>
            <l>You <hi>Myrmidons</hi> put on yor Armus, said he,</l>
            <l>And Horse-men all your Charrets ready make,</l>
            <l>And mount into your Seats and follow me.</l>
            <l>When they were ready, foremost went the Horse,</l>
            <l>And by a Cloud of Foot were followed.</l>
            <l>I'th'midst between them carri'd was the Corse</l>
            <l>With locks of hair thrown on him covered,</l>
            <l>Which the sad Mourners from their heads had shorn.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> went himself next to the Biere,</l>
            <l>Who for his friend did principally mourn.</l>
            <l>When at the place of Funeral they were,</l>
            <l>Upon the ground they layed down the Biere,</l>
            <l>And quickly in a Pile they heapt the wood.</l>
            <l>Then cuts <hi>Achilles</hi> off his yellow hair,</l>
            <l>And from the body at a distance staid,</l>
            <l>And towards <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Phthiae</hi> turn'd his eye,</l>
            <l>And speaking to <hi>Spercheius</hi> River said,</l>
            <l>My Father to you made a Vow, when I</l>
            <l>Return'd, his hair should unto you be paid,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:93808:182"/>And to the other Gods a Hecatomb,</l>
            <l>And fifty fat Rams at your Spring to slay.</l>
            <l>Thus vowed he. But I shall ne'r come home,</l>
            <l>But here must die before the Gates of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Since then my Fathers wish you not fulfil,</l>
            <l>Nor I return into my native Land,</l>
            <l>My hair now to <hi>Patroclus</hi> give I will.</l>
            <l>And at that word he puts it in his hand.</l>
            <l>At this the <hi>Greeks</hi> a weeping fell agen,</l>
            <l>And wept had till the setting of the Sun,</l>
            <l>But that <hi>Achilles</hi> spake t'<hi>Atrides</hi> then,</l>
            <l>And pray'd him that the people might be gone.</l>
            <l>King <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> will the <hi>Greeks,</hi> said he,</l>
            <l>Be never with lamenting satisfi'd?</l>
            <l>'Tis in your pow'r; let them dispersed be</l>
            <l>Unto their Ships their suppers to provide,</l>
            <l>For we will of the Fun'ral take a care.</l>
            <l>But let the Leaders of the Army stay,</l>
            <l>And such as specially concerned are.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Atrides</hi> sent the rest away.</l>
            <l>And then the wood into a Pile they laid.</l>
            <l>A hundred foot it was from side to side;</l>
            <l>And on the top the Corps. Then kill'd and flaid</l>
            <l>Both Sheep and Beeves, and with their fat they hide</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patroclus</hi> body dead from head to foot.</l>
            <l>And by it laid the Cattle flaid to burn.</l>
            <l>To th' Biere <hi>Achilles</hi> went and laid into't</l>
            <l>Of Honey one, of Oyl another Urn.</l>
            <l>And of <hi>Patroclus</hi> Horses four he slew;</l>
            <l>And of nine little Dogs he kept kill'd two.</l>
            <l>And those into the Fun'ral pile he threw;</l>
            <l>And last of all twelve <hi>Trojans</hi> adds thereto.</l>
            <l>This done, again he to <hi>Patroclus</hi> said,</l>
            <l>My dear <hi>Patroclus,</hi> once again, farewel.</l>
            <l>Twelve lusty <hi>Trojans</hi> on your Pile are laid.</l>
            <l>I'm faithful to you though you be in Hell,</l>
            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> for the Dogs shall be a prey.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Venus</hi> 'nointed him with Oyl of Rose,</l>
            <l>And so preserved him both night and day,</l>

            <l>And then <hi>Achilles</hi> a new bus'ness finds.</l>
            <l>He could not set on flame the new-sell'd wood,</l>

            <l>And blow the Fire until the flame did rise.</l>
            <l>This <hi>Iris</hi> hearing went unto the Winds</l>

            <l>And at good chear in <hi>Zephyr</hi>'s house them finds,</l>
            <l>And fain they would her with them there have staid,</l>
            <l>And made her sit; but she refused that.</l>
            <l>The Gods, said she, feast at a Hecatomb</l>
            <l>In Blackmoor-land, and I must be thereat,</l>

            <l>They'll set the Pile whereon <hi>Patroclus</hi> lies.</l>

               <hi>Achilles</hi> standing by it all the while</l>

            <l>And th'Earth with Wine by Cupfuls watered.</l>

            <l>By <hi>Jove</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> young man as you are,</l>
            <l>The Rules of Horsemanship, I need not tell</l>
            <l>You of the Art, but pray you to take care.</l>
            <l>Though you know how about the Gole to wind,</l>
            <l>Their Horses somewhat are than yours more swift.</l>
            <l>I fear you will in that some damage find;</l>

            <l>'Tis care not strength makes a good Carpenter,</l>
            <l>And Ships at Sea are governed by care;</l>
            <l>Force in soul weather little helps to steer.</l>
            <l>Best Charretiers are they that best beware.</l>
            <l>A man that on his Horses speed relies</l>
            <l>May from the high way sometimes drive aside,</l>
            <l>But not come in again. But he that's wise</l>
            <l>Will always tow'rds the Gole directly guide,</l>
            <l>And have an eye on him that goes before.</l>

            <l>Be sure you drive your Horses to it close,</l>
            <l>And leaning, press a little th'inner Rein,</l>
            <l>And let the farther Horses Rein go loose.</l>
            <l>But let the neer Horse to it go as near</l>
            <l>As can be; so the Stones you still avoid.</l>
            <l>You'll wound your Horses else and Charret tear,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:93808:185"/>
               <hi>Antilochus,</hi> you drive too carelesly,</l>
            <l>The way's too narrow. Pray a little stay</l>
            <l>Your Horses; broader 'twill be by and by,</l>
            <l>Lest both our Chars lie broken on the way.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antilochus</hi> then whipt his Horses on</l>
            <l>So much the faster, seeming not to hear.</l>
            <l>And when they were a little further gone,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> held his Horses in, for fear</l>
            <l>Their Chars should clashing overturned be,</l>
            <l>And with them they be thrown into the dust,</l>
            <l>And to him spake, reviling. Go, said he,</l>
            <l>Of all the men I know the most unjust,</l>
            <l>And not so wise as th'<hi>Argives</hi> thought you were.</l>
            <l>But yet the Prize you shall not so obtain;</l>
            <l>But for it first you shall be put to swear.</l>
            <l>And then his Horses he drave on again.</l>
            <l>And to encourage them, unto them said,</l>
            <l>His Horses cannot keep before you long;</l>
            <l>They old are both; strain hard. Be not dismay</l>
            <l>For both of you brave Horses are and young.</l>
            <l>This said, at highest speed agen they fly,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Antilochus</hi> came up again.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Argives</hi> on the Race now sat to spy</l>
            <l>Who foremost coming was upon the Plain.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idomeneus</hi> sat in a place more high</l>
            <l>Without the Race, and heard a Charretier</l>
            <l>Whose voice he knew unto his Horses cry,</l>
            <l>And presently two Horses did appear.</l>
            <l>Of one of them the colour was bright Bay,</l>
            <l>But on his forehead had a spot of white,</l>
            <l>And as the Moon at Full round ev'ry way,</l>
            <l>And from afar conspicuous and bright.</l>
            <l>Then to the <hi>Greeks</hi> he said, Is there no more</l>
            <l>That see these Horses coming back but I?</l>
            <l>They are not those that foremost were before;</l>
            <l>And 'tis another Charretier I spy.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Eumelus</hi> some mischance has had I fear;</l>
            <l>And yet about the Gole he turned well.</l>
            <l>But now I cannot see them any where.</l>
            <l>Perhaps out of his hands their Bridles fell;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:93808:186"/>No longer would the Horses then obey,</l>
            <l>But thrown him somewhere have o'th'field; or born</l>
            <l>Him in their fit by violence away,</l>
            <l>And have his Charret overturn'd, or torn.</l>
            <l>Stand on your feet your selves and mark him well,</l>
            <l>Whether or no it <hi>Diomedes</hi> be</l>
            <l>The Son of <hi>Tydeus</hi>; for I cannot tell,</l>
            <l>He like him is, and I believe 'tis he.</l>
            <l>The lesser <hi>Ajax</hi> then <hi>Oïleus</hi> Son</l>
            <l>With evil words t'<hi>Idomeneus</hi> repli'd,</l>
            <l>The Mares upon the Field are coming on,</l>
            <l>But you must talk, though from the purpose wide.</l>
            <l>Your eyes are now grown old and less can see,</l>
            <l>And yet to talk you love so much the more;</l>
            <l>Though at discerning many better be.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Eumelus,</hi> as at first, is still before.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> (said he) of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> the worst</l>
            <l>Except at railing, let's a wager lay,</l>
            <l>A Tripod or a Caldron who comes first,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> judge, that you may know and pay.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Ajax</hi> then about was to reply;</l>
            <l>Nor had the quarrel 'twixt them there been staid,</l>
            <l>But that <hi>Achilles</hi> who was sitting by,</l>
            <l>Rose from his Seat, and coming to them said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idomeneus</hi> and <hi>Ajax</hi> 'tis a shame</l>
            <l>For you in evil Language to contend,</l>
            <l>That others when they do so ought to blame.</l>
            <l>Sit down, and but a little while attend.</l>
            <l>They'll soon be here. They strive for Victory,</l>
            <l>And driving are as fast as ere they can;</l>
            <l>Discerned then it will be easily</l>
            <l>Which is the foremost, which the hindmost man.</l>
            <l>This said, they saw <hi>Tydides</hi> very neer</l>
            <l>Plying his Whip; his Horses seem'd to fly;</l>
            <l>And cover'd was with dust the Charretier;</l>
            <l>And hard it was the track o'th'Wheels to spy.</l>
            <l>Then coming in, before the Lords he stopt,</l>
            <l>And to the ground leapt from his Chariot;</l>
            <l>With sweat his Horses breasts and shoulders dropt.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Sthenelus</hi> the Prize neglected not,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:93808:186"/>But nimbly from his place he to it skips,</l>
            <l>And by his friends there standing by his side</l>
            <l>Sent th'woman and the Tripod to the Ships;</l>
            <l>And having done, the Horses he unti'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antilochus</hi> next to <hi>Tydides</hi> was,</l>
            <l>That not by vertue of his Steeds but slight</l>
            <l>Advantage gotten had of <hi>Menelaus</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When for them both he found the way too streight.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Menelaus</hi> to him was so neer</l>
            <l>As is a Charret-horse unto the Wheel,</l>
            <l>Which of his Tayl doth sometimes touch the hair,</l>
            <l>And makes the Horse to run that does it feel.</l>
            <l>So neer unto him was <hi>Atrides</hi> then,</l>
            <l>That was behind once a Coyts cast or more.</l>
            <l>But quickly to him he came up agen.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Aethe</hi> now ran faster than before.</l>
            <l>And had they but a little longer run,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Atrides</hi> by <hi>Antilochus</hi> had pass'd,</l>
            <l>And without doubt the second Prize had won.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Meriones</hi> behind was a Spears cast.</l>
            <l>Slow Steeds he had and but small skill in Courses.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Eumelus</hi> whom <hi>Athena</hi> overthrew</l>
            <l>Came hindmost and before him drave his Horses,</l>
            <l>And with his hands behind, his Charret drew.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> mov'd with pity was at this,</l>
            <l>And spake unto the <hi>Argives</hi> in this wise.</l>
            <l>Although he come the last, the best he is;</l>
            <l>'Tis fit he have at least the second Prize,</l>
            <l>But <hi>Diomed</hi> the first, that has it won.</l>
            <l>And just it seemed in the <hi>Argives</hi> sight.</l>
            <l>And from <hi>Antilochus</hi> the Prize had gone,</l>
            <l>Had he not pleaded for it as his right.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antilochus</hi> then to <hi>Achilles</hi> spake,</l>
            <l>Though well, said he, in pity you incline</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Eumelus,</hi> yet my Prize he must not take;</l>
            <l>I won it have, and 'tis not yours, but mine.</l>
            <l>His Horses good, and Horse-man good he is;</l>
            <l>And he and they upon the ground were laid</l>
            <l>By some mischance; I'm not concern'd in this.</l>
            <l>He should unto th'Immortal Gods have pray'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:93808:187"/>But you, that pity him, and at your Tent</l>
            <l>Have Gold, Brass, Horses, Women, Cattle store,</l>
            <l>May out of that when you think fit content</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Eumelus</hi> with the value, or with more.</l>
            <l>For whosoever means to have the Mare</l>
            <l>Must for her with me fight. Thus pleaded he.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> that great love unto him bare,</l>
            <l>Was glad, and said, Since you so counsel me,</l>
            <l>The Breast plate I will to him give of Brass</l>
            <l>That hem'd is all about with shining Tin,</l>
            <l>With which <hi>Asteropaeus</hi> armed was.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Automedon</hi> into my Tent go in,</l>
            <l>And quickly to me bring the Breast-plate forth.</l>
            <l>And then <hi>Automedon</hi> no longer stands,</l>
            <l>But fetches out the Armour of great worth,</l>
            <l>And puts the same into <hi>Eumelus</hi> hands.</l>
            <l>Then up <hi>Atrides Menelaus</hi> stands,</l>
            <l>And in his hand the Cry'r a Scepter laid,</l>
            <l>And silence to be kept i'th'Court commands.</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Antilochus</hi> then <hi>Menelaus</hi> said,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Antilochus,</hi> what made you me disgrace</l>
            <l>Justling my Horses in the hollow way</l>
            <l>When there was so much danger in the place,</l>
            <l>That 't had been best for both of us to stay?</l>
            <l>But you the Princes hear the Cause I pray,</l>
            <l>And judge between us both impartially,</l>
            <l>Lest any of the <hi>Greeks</hi> hereafter say</l>
            <l>I did t'<hi>Antilochus</hi> an injury,</l>
            <l>And from him got the Mare by fraud or might;</l>
            <l>And that his Horses than mine better were.</l>
            <l>But come, I now know how my self to right.</l>

            <l>By <hi>Neptune,</hi> that you did not willingly</l>
            <l>And with prepensed malice cross my Charre.</l>
            <l>To this <hi>Antilochus</hi> did then reply,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Menelaus,</hi> since you elder are,</l>
            <l>You know our faults upon the sudden rise,</l>
            <l>And that before-hand young men study not;</l>
            <l>Their Wits are present, but the old are wise.</l>
            <l>To do you injury I never thought.</l>

            <l>And out of <hi>Menelaus</hi> favour live</l>
            <l>This said, he put the Mare into his hand,</l>

            <l>As Dew that on the growing Corn doth stand</l>

            <l>Sweet Son, you nothing but the truth have said.</l>

            <l>My hands I scarce can to my shoulders raise,</l>

            <l>For sitting on the Charret they both whipt,</l>

            <l>Such then I was. But now to younger men</l>
            <l>That work I leave. Old age I must obey.</l>

            <l>A Prize for him that won at Fist and Ball,</l>

            <l>As for the vanquisht, he assign'd to him</l>
            <l>A lesser Prize which was a silver Cup,</l>

            <l>Since <hi>Mars</hi> of these depriv'd me has agen,</l>
            <l>And now I none have left me but the worst,</l>
            <l>Domestick Wolves, the bane of Lamb and Kid,</l>

            <l>Why stand you still? Were you not by me bid</l>
            <l>The Waggon to prepare? Then out they flye,</l>
            <l>And speedily the Waggon forth they bring,</l>
            <l>And Yoak well fitted with an iron Pin;</l>
            <l>And fixt it to the Poles-end with a Ring,</l>
            <l>And Cord nine Cubits long to keep it in;</l>
            <l>Which thrice about the Boxen Yoak they wind,</l>
            <l>And to the Waggon laid the Ransome in;</l>
            <l>And to it then the lusty Mules they bind,</l>
            <l>Which by the <hi>Mysians</hi> given him had been.</l>
            <l>That done, King <hi>Priam</hi>'s Horses to his Charre</l>

            <l>That while they fed he stayed by their side.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hecuba</hi> came to them with a Cup,</l>
            <l>A golden Cup of pleasant Wine, that they</l>

            <l>This counsel (Wife) of yours with reason stands.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> pleased is when to him men look up.</l>
            <l>For water then he call'd and washt his hands,</l>
            <l>And from his Wife receiv'd the golden Cup.</l>
            <l>Then looking up to Heav'n, O <hi>Jove,</hi> said he,</l>
            <l>Of all the Gods most glorious high and great,</l>
            <l>Grant me that I may well received be</l>

            <l>And that thereof I may be confident,</l>
            <l>Now shew me of your Bird a lucky flight.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Jove</hi> presently an Eagle sent,</l>
            <l>Of colour spotted over black and white.</l>
            <l>As wide as is a Princes Gate or more,</l>
            <l>So wide her Wings the mighty Eagle spreads,</l>
            <l>And as it over <hi>Ilium</hi> did soare,</l>
            <l>The people joy'd to see it ore their heads.</l>
            <l>The old man then went up into his Seat,</l>
            <l>And through the City to the Plain did pass.</l>
            <l>The Waggon wherein lay the treasure great</l>
            <l>Before him driven by <hi>Idaeus</hi> was.</l>
            <l>And so far went his Sons, and Sons-in-law;</l>
            <l>And then return'd agen into the City.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Jupiter</hi> upon the way him saw</l>
            <l>In this estate he moved was with pity;</l>
            <l>And unto <hi>Hermes</hi> turn'd his eyes and said,</l>
            <l>Since you mens company do most frequent,</l>
            <l>And whom you will can quickly hear and aid,</l>
            <l>Go and guide <hi>Priam</hi> to <hi>Achilles</hi> Tent.</l>
            <l>But so as to be seen by none, until</l>
            <l>He thither safely come. And <hi>Mercury</hi>
            </l>
            <l>No sooner understood his Fathers will</l>
            <l>But sets himself about it willingly.</l>
            <l>And first his Shoes unto his feet he binds</l>
            <l>Ambrosian Shoes that over Sea and Land</l>
            <l>Bear him as swift and lightly as the Winds;</l>
            <l>And then his Rod he took into his hand,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:93808:195"/>Wherewith he layeth sleep on Mortal eyes,</l>
            <l>And takes it off again when he thinks good.</l>
            <l>Then down to <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Hellespont</hi> he flies</l>
            <l>In likeness of a Youth of Royal blood</l>
            <l>When Doun begins t'appear upon his face.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idaeus</hi> now and <hi>Priam</hi> at the brink</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Xanthus</hi> were, and night came on apace.</l>
            <l>And there they made their Mules and Horses drink.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Idaeus</hi> neer them then saw <hi>Mercury,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And in great fear to <hi>Priam</hi> cri'd, I see</l>
            <l>A man (O <hi>Priam</hi>) coming. Let us fly,</l>
            <l>Or to him go and fall down at his knee.</l>
            <l>And horribly was <hi>Priam</hi> then afraid,</l>
            <l>His hair with fear upon him stood upright.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Mercury</hi> unto him came, and laid</l>
            <l>His hand on his, and to him said, 'Tis night;</l>
            <l>What makes you be abroad? Do you not fear</l>
            <l>Your Foes the <hi>Greeks?</hi> If any of them knew</l>
            <l>That you were with so great a Treasure here,</l>
            <l>In what a pitiful estate were you?</l>
            <l>For you and he that's with you both are old,</l>
            <l>And neither of you can himself defend.</l>
            <l>But as for any hurt from me, be bold.</l>
            <l>I hither come t'assist you as a friend,</l>
            <l>So like, me thinks, you to my Father are.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Priam</hi> then to <hi>Mercury</hi> repli'd,</l>
            <l>'Tis true you say. And yet the Gods a care</l>
            <l>Have of me still that send me such a Guide,</l>
            <l>So great a man, so comely, and so wise,</l>
            <l>That blessed are the Parents you begat.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Mercury</hi> to him again replies,</l>
            <l>Indeed old man, you say the truth in that.</l>
            <l>But whither bear you your best goods away?</l>
            <l>To some strange City till the War be done?</l>
            <l>Or are the <hi>Trojans</hi> all now leaving <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Since killed is the best of them, your Son</l>
            <l>That might with any of the <hi>Greeks</hi> compare?</l>
            <l>Tell me, said <hi>Priam</hi> (pray ye) who are you,</l>
            <l>And whence ye come, and who your Parents are,</l>
            <l>And how my Son and his hard Fate you knew.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:93808:196"/>You mean to try me now (said <hi>Mercury</hi>).</l>
            <l>At th'<hi>Argive</hi> Ships I <hi>Hector</hi> frighted saw,</l>
            <l>And how he made the <hi>Greeks</hi> before him fly,</l>
            <l>And how he tost them in the Field like straw,</l>
            <l>Where we stood by with wonder looking on.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> had forbidden us to fight.</l>
            <l>His man am I, by birth a <hi>Myrmidon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And stood amongst the rest to see the sight.</l>
            <l>My Father is <hi>Polyctor,</hi> very rich,</l>
            <l>But now an old man is and like to you.</l>
            <l>And seven Sons he has in all, of which</l>
            <l>I am the last. And Lots at home we drew</l>
            <l>Which of us with <hi>Achilles</hi> should be sent</l>
            <l>To th'War of <hi>Troy.</hi> The Lot then fell to me.</l>
            <l>And with <hi>Achilles</hi> in his Ship I went.</l>
            <l>And hither come the place of fight to see.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> by break of day will hither come,</l>
            <l>And try if now the City they can win.</l>
            <l>Impatient of their stay at <hi>Ilium</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They cannot by their Leaders be kept in.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Priam</hi> to him said again, Since you</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> Servant are, is <hi>Hector</hi> yet</l>
            <l>At th'<hi>Argive</hi> Ships, I pray you tell me true,</l>
            <l>Or cut in joynts thrown to the Dogs to eat?</l>
            <l>And <hi>Hermes</hi> unto this again replies,</l>
            <l>Nor Dogs nor Fowl upon him yet have fed,</l>
            <l>But at the Ships he still neglected lies,</l>
            <l>And though he have twelve days now there been dead,</l>
            <l>Yet is his body uncorrupt, and free</l>
            <l>From Worms that breed in other bodies slain.</l>
            <l>And though it ev'ry morning dragged be</l>
            <l>About <hi>Patroclus</hi> Tomb, doth whole remain</l>
            <l>And undefac'd, the bloud all washt away.</l>
            <l>You would admire to see him look so fresh,</l>
            <l>And clensed of the filth that on him lay,</l>
            <l>And at his wounds how closed is the flesh,</l>
            <l>Though many from the <hi>Greeks</hi> receiv'd he had.</l>
            <l>So kind the Gods were after he was dead.</l>
            <l>These words of <hi>Mercury</hi> made <hi>Priam</hi> glad.</l>
            <l>And thus again he to him answered.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:93808:196"/>Yes, yes, 'tis good to give the Gods their due,</l>
            <l>A thing that <hi>Hector</hi> never did omit.</l>
            <l>And therefore to him they this favour shew,</l>
            <l>Although his Soul be in th' Infernal Pit.</l>
            <l>But now t'<hi>Achilles</hi> Tent be you my Guide;</l>
            <l>And at my hand this handsome Cup receive.</l>
            <l>Again you try me (<hi>Mercury</hi> repli'd)</l>
            <l>I dare not tak't without <hi>Achilles</hi> leave.</l>
            <l>For of his anger in great fear I stand.</l>
            <l>Without a Bribe I'll with you go along</l>
            <l>To what place you think fit by Sea or Land.</l>
            <l>Though 'twere to <hi>Argos</hi>; none shall do you wrong.</l>
            <l>For sure, so wretchedly I do not look,</l>
            <l>But that a man may of me stand in fear.</l>
            <l>Then up he leapt, and in his hands he took</l>
            <l>The Whip and Reyns, and serv'd as Charretier.</l>
            <l>When they were come to th'<hi>Argive</hi> Ditch and Wall,</l>
            <l>The Watch that placed was the Gate to keep,</l>
            <l>Their Supper to provide were busie all,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Mercury</hi> there laid them all asleep,</l>
            <l>Took off the Bars, the Gate wide open laid,</l>
            <l>And in the Charret and the Waggon went</l>
            <l>With all the wealth for <hi>Hector</hi> to be paid;</l>
            <l>And forward pass unto <hi>Achilles</hi> Tent,</l>
            <l>Built for him by his <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> and high,</l>
            <l>With Fir-trees tall, and cover'd over head</l>
            <l>(To keep it out of danger from the Sky)</l>
            <l>With the deep vesture of the flowry Mead</l>
            <l>And to it had a great Court pal'd about,</l>
            <l>And in the Pale a high two-valved door</l>
            <l>For Chars and Waggons to go in and out,</l>
            <l>And one great Bar of Fir-tree and no more,</l>
            <l>So great that it requir'd three common men</l>
            <l>Upon the lofty Gate to set it on,</l>
            <l>And three such men to take it off agen.</l>
            <l>None but <hi>Achilles</hi> shut it could alone.</l>
            <l>This Gate then <hi>Hermes</hi> open to him laid,</l>
            <l>And with the Char and Waggon in he came,</l>
            <l>Then leaping to the ground to <hi>Priam</hi> said,</l>

            </l>
            <l>But by <hi>Achilles</hi> I'll not here be spi'd.</l>
            <l>Gods must not shew to men such open love.</l>
            <l>But go you to <hi>Achilles</hi> in, and try</l>
            <l>What favour from him at his knees you'll find,</l>
            <l>And put him of his Son in memory,</l>
            <l>And Father. That will work upon his mind.</l>
            <l>This said, t'<hi>Olympus Hermes</hi> went his way.</l>

               <hi>Achilles</hi> at his Supper now was set,</l>

            <l>And <hi>Priam</hi> to them then came in unseen,</l>
            <l>And kist the hands there of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that</l>
            <l>Of many of his Sons the death had been.</l>
            <l>As when a man that kill'd another has,</l>

            <l>Than th'hands that have my Children kill'd to kiss?</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Achilles</hi> wept. And from his knee,</l>
            <l>With his, the hands of <hi>Priam</hi> gently mov'd;</l>
            <l>And then aloud they both lamented. He</l>
            <l>For <hi>Peleus,</hi> and <hi>Patroclus</hi> whom he lov'd,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Priam</hi> for his own calamitie,</l>
            <l>And through the house were heard to sigh and groan.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles,</hi> when his fit of tears was laid,</l>
            <l>And eased was his heart, came from his Throne,</l>
            <l>And rais'd th'old man that on his knees yet staid,</l>
            <l>And to him spake. Alas, old man, said he,</l>
            <l>You much have suffer'd, and your pain I feel.</l>
            <l>But how alone durst you to come to me,</l>
            <l>That slew your Sons, unless your heart be steel?</l>
            <l>But come, sit down. In vain lamenting is,</l>
            <l>The hurt that's done tears cannot take away,</l>
            <l>Since so 'tis order'd by the Gods in bliss,</l>
            <l>That men shall live in pain, and they in joy.</l>
            <l>Two Barrels in his Cellar <hi>Jove</hi> has still</l>
            <l>Of Gifts to be bestow'd on mortal Wights,</l>
            <l>One full of Good, the other full of Ill.</l>
            <l>And usually to mingle them delights.</l>
            <l>For they that only ill receive from <hi>Jove</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Exposed always are to injurie,</l>
            <l>And begging up and down the world shall rove,</l>
            <l>And both by Gods and Men despised be.</l>
            <l>So <hi>Peleus</hi> at the first receiv'd much good,</l>
            <l>And did in wealth his Neighbours all surpass,</l>
            <l>And with his Subjects in great honour stood,</l>
            <l>And joyn'd in Wedlock to a Goddess was.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:93808:198"/>But after this the Ill unto him came</l>
            <l>To leave no Child behind him to succeed,</l>
            <l>But only me that so short lived am,</l>
            <l>And from him live to vex you and your seed.</l>
            <l>And you, O <hi>Priam,</hi> once were rich, they say,</l>
            <l>And all that was in <hi>Lesbos</hi> did injoy,</l>
            <l>And over all the <hi>Hellespont</hi> did sway,</l>
            <l>And that all <hi>Phrygia</hi> did you obey,</l>
            <l>And with great store of Children blest you were.</l>
            <l>But now you only fights and slaughter see,</l>
            <l>And patiently you <hi>Hector</hi>'s death must bear.</l>
            <l>He cannot with your tears revived be;</l>
            <l>Much sooner you may suffer greater ill.</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Achilles Priam</hi> then again replies,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Thetis</hi> Son, to sit I have no will</l>
            <l>Whilst at the Ships my Son unburi'd lies.</l>
            <l>But bring him forth that I my Son may see,</l>
            <l>And you the Presents I have brought enjoy.</l>
            <l>And prosperous unto you may they be,</l>
            <l>And safely I again return to <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> angry then, Old man, said he,</l>
            <l>Provoke me not. I'll put into your hand</l>
            <l>The body of your Son, because to me</l>
            <l>From <hi>Jove</hi> my Mother came with that command.</l>
            <l>And very well I know you <hi>Priam</hi> are,</l>
            <l>And that you hither had a God for Guide.</l>
            <l>What mortal to the Army come would dare?</l>
            <l>Or could have pass'd the Watch and not been spi'd?</l>
            <l>Or open to you could the Gates have set?</l>
            <l>Therefore take heed, and anger me no more,</l>
            <l>Lest the command of <hi>Jove</hi> I should forget,</l>
            <l>And without <hi>Hector</hi> send you out adoor.</l>
            <l>This said, old <hi>Priam</hi> was afraid and sat.</l>
            <l>Out went <hi>Achilles</hi> with <hi>Automedon</hi>

            <l>And from the Waggon in the Goods they brought,</l>
            <l>Only (wherewith the body dead to hide)</l>
            <l>They left behind a handsome Robe and Coat.</l>

            <l>Forgetting the Commandement of <hi>Jove.</hi>
            </l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> laid the body on a bed,</l>
            <l>Which his two Servants in the Waggon laid.</l>
            <l>This done, he to <hi>Patroclus</hi> spake and said,</l>
            <l>O my <hi>Patroclus</hi> if you hear in Hell</l>
            <l>That <hi>Hector</hi>'s body I have sent to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Forgive me, since I for it paid am well</l>
            <l>With Gifts, whereof what's fit to you I'll pay.</l>
            <l>This said, <hi>Achilles</hi> to his Tent retir'd,</l>
            <l>And sat upon the Seat from whence he ris,</l>
            <l>Your Son, said he, is freed as you desir'd,</l>

            <l>To morrow with him go by break of day.</l>

            <l>For <hi>Niobe</hi> twelve Children lost, they say,</l>

            <l>Six lusty Sons, six Daughters fair they were,</l>

            <l>But when of food they had no more desire,</l>
            <l>

            <l>
               <hi>Priam</hi> began, and to <hi>Achilles</hi> spake.</l>
            <l>Dismiss me if you please <hi>(Achilles)</hi> now,</l>
            <l>That I a little sleep at last may take.</l>
            <l>For since my Son was slain, I never slept,</l>
            <l>But rolling on the soiled grass have li'n</l>
            <l>Perpetually, and for him sigh'd and wept,</l>

            <l>

            <l>With handsome Coverleds of Purple, and</l>
            <l>With fine soft Blankets see it covered.</l>
            <l>The women quickly his Command obey'd,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> smiling then to <hi>Priam</hi> said,</l>
            <l>Old man I from my Tent must turn you out;</l>
            <l>Lest some man should from <hi>Agamemnon</hi> sent</l>
            <l>With counsel come and chance to see you here,</l>
            <l>And let him know that you are at my Tent,</l>

            <l>But ere you go, old man, pray tell me right</l>
            <l>What time is needful for his Obsequies,</l>
            <l>That I so long may keep the <hi>Greeks</hi> from fight.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Priam</hi> to <hi>Achilles</hi> thus replies.</l>
            <l>You know <hi>Achilles</hi> very well how farre</l>
            <l>The Hills and Woods are distant from the Town,</l>
            <l>And how afraid to go the <hi>Trojans</hi> are.</l>
            <l>We need nine days to fetch the fewel down.</l>

            <l>To this <hi>Achilles</hi> answered and said,</l>
            <l>Old man, the time you asked granted is.</l>
            <l>So long th'<hi>Achaeans</hi> shall from fight forbear.</l>
            <l>This said, in <hi>Priam</hi>'s hand he layed his,</l>
            <l>That of his faith he might not stand in fear.</l>
            <l>There in the Porch slept <hi>Priam</hi> and <hi>Idaeus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And then unto his bed <hi>Achilles</hi> went.</l>
            <l>And there he slept, and with him fair <hi>Brisëis</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Within an Inner Chamber of his Tent.</l>
            <l>The other Gods and Men slept all the night,</l>
            <l>But sleep approached not to <hi>Hermes</hi> eyes,</l>
            <l>But thinking lay on <hi>Priam,</hi> how he might</l>
            <l>Conduct him safely from his Enemies.</l>
            <l>Then up he rose, and went to <hi>Priam</hi>'s head</l>
            <l>And to him said, Ho, <hi>Priam</hi> sleep you here?</l>
            <l>Since you redeem'd have <hi>Hector</hi>'s body dead,</l>
            <l>You think you nothing farther have to fear.</l>
            <l>Although you for him paid a lusty price,</l>
            <l>Yet if alive <hi>Atrides</hi> find you here,</l>
            <l>Your Sons and friends shall pay that value thrice.</l>
            <l>This said, he suddenly awakt with fear.</l>
            <l>And calling to <hi>Idaeus</hi> made him rise.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hermes</hi> to the Waggon and the Charre</l>
            <l>Himself the lab'ring Mules and Horses ties.</l>
            <l>And now into their Seats they mounted are,</l>
            <l>And through the <hi>Argive</hi> Camp then <hi>Hermes</hi> drove</l>
            <l>Unseen till past <hi>Scamander</hi> ford they were.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hermes</hi> left them and return'd to <hi>Jove.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And now the morning was display'd and clear.</l>

            <l>But <hi>Hector</hi> to behold went to the Gate.</l>
            <l>First came his loving Wife and Mother down,</l>
            <l>And in the Waggon by him weeping sate.</l>
            <l>The people in a throng about him staid</l>
            <l>Lamenting and lamented had all day,</l>
            <l>But <hi>Priam</hi> from his Char unto them said,</l>

               <hi>Trojans,</hi> unto the body dead give way.</l>
            <l>And when within the house I have it laid,</l>
            <l>Then for him weep till you be satisfi'd.</l>
            <l>When this was said, the people him obey'd,</l>
            <l>And to make way, themselves they then divide.</l>
            <l>Then to the house they brought the body in,</l>
            <l>And plac'd it on a bed. Then Singers by</l>

            <l>Their Song they sung; to which the women sigh.</l>
            <l>Then to lament <hi>Andromache</hi> began.</l>
            <l>O my dear Husband you have lost your life</l>
            <l>Unhappily, that were but a young man,</l>
            <l>And made a wretched Widow of your Wife,</l>

            <l>This City first I fear destroy'd will be,</l>
            <l>Since you are gone that was our sole defence.</l>
            <l>T'<hi>Achaia</hi> now the Wives of <hi>Troy</hi> must go,</l>
            <l>And with them I. And you my Child must hence,</l>

            <l>For many of the <hi>Greeks</hi> has <hi>Hector</hi> slain.</l>
            <l>He went not to the Battle bashfully.</l>
            <l>For which the <hi>Trojans</hi> now are in great pain,</l>

            <l>And sold, and made to suffer slavery</l>
            <l>At <hi>Samos, Imbros, Lemnos,</hi> or elsewhere;</l>
            <l>But when of life he had deprived you</l>
            <l>Because his friend <hi>Patroclus</hi> you had slain,</l>
            <l>About his Monument he oft you drew,</l>
            <l>Though that could not bring him to life again.</l>
            <l>But now he sent it to me has again</l>
            <l>As fresh and as well colour'd as if by</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi>'s gentle Shafts he had been slain,</l>
            <l>This said, agen the people sob and sigh.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Helen</hi> took her turn. <hi>Hector,</hi> said she,</l>
            <l>Whom best I lov'd of all my Brother-laws</l>
            <l>(For you were so, since <hi>Paris</hi> marri'd me,</l>
            <l>Though when I marri'd him accurst I was)</l>
            <l>Now twenty years 'tis since I came to <hi>Troy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And never did an ill word from you hear;</l>
            <l>And when your Kindred of me ill did say,</l>
            <l>You took my part, and made them to forbear.</l>
            <l>Since you are gone my joy is at an end,</l>
            <l>And in your death I moan my own estate</l>
            <l>That now amongst the <hi>Trojans</hi> have no friend,</l>
            <l>Who hate me as the Author of their Fate.</l>
            <l>This said with tears, provokt the peoples pity;</l>
            <l>But <hi>Priam</hi> then unto them spake, and said,</l>
            <l>Go <hi>Trojans</hi> now and fetch wood to the City;</l>
            <l>You need not of the <hi>Argives</hi> be afraid.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> when I parted from his Tent</l>
            <l>Eleven days allow'd my Son t' inter</l>
            <l>And fetch down wood without impediment;</l>
            <l>So long the <hi>Argives</hi> should from fight forbear.</l>
            <l>This said, to th'Hills with Oxen and with Wains</l>
            <l>And Mules they went, and busie were about</l>
            <l>This work nine days together and took pains.</l>
            <l>Upon the tenth the body was brought out,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:93808:201"/>And on the top of the great wood-pile laid,</l>
            <l>And fire put to't; and all day long it burned</l>
            <l>And all the night. When morning was displai'd,</l>
            <l>Again the <hi>Trojans</hi> to the Pile returned,</l>
            <l>And th'Embers with black Wine extinguished.</l>
            <l>His bones then by his Brothers and his Kin</l>
            <l>Were from the ground together gathered,</l>
            <l>And by them to an Urn of Gold laid in.</l>
            <l>The Urn with Purple Robes then cover'd over</l>
            <l>Into a Grave (which soon was made) they laid.</l>
            <l>The Grave with many and great stones they cover.</l>
            <l>And last of all (because they were afraid</l>
            <l>Before their work were done the <hi>Greeks</hi> would come)</l>
            <l>They sent out Scouts on ev'ry side to spy.</l>
            <l>And ore his Grave in hast they raise a Tomb.</l>
            <l>This done, away they went, and by and by</l>
            <l>To <hi>Priam</hi>'s house they came again, and there</l>
            <l>He made a splendid Supper for them all.</l>
            <l>Then home they went well pleased with their chear.</l>
            <l>Thus ended noble <hi>Hector</hi>'s Funeral.</l>
