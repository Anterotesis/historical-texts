            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the kinges aucthoritie &amp; hirs, to make aunſwere vnto their requeſt in the name of theyr maieſties: of whoſe liberties I haue taken vpon me to be a defendour emongſt others. Truſtynge that if the foreſaide peticioners wyl not acknowledge theyr faulte, God wyl aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me, and fauour the good minde and purpoſe which he hath geuen me, &amp; that all the kynges good ſubiectes wil ioyne with me to delyuer this pore realme out of the handes of theym who woulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comme tyrantes ouer it.</p>
            <p>¶ In the beginning of their writing, to giue therby the more gloſſe and auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto their woordes they declare their qualities, they make mencion verye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourablye of their greate and faithfull ſeruices, and wil that according to their deedes hearetofore men ſhall preſentlye geue iudgemente of their myndes and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>¶ But they neded not to haue made ſoo goodlye a beginning (according to theyr owne iudgement) to bring to paſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo euyll an ende. For if they were yet greater than they are and their ſeruices
<pb facs="tcp:19883:13"/>
worthye more commendation than they ſpeake of, yet ſhoulde it not folowe that their fault which is preſent and ſo great and euydent ſhould therfore be coucred, much leſſe alowed as a good and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable work. And though ſome amongſt them haue done ſeruice (as ſurely I wil alwaies confeſſe that they haue) &amp; haue neuer receaued any recompence for the ſame: yet muſt they not preſently ſeeke it by the vndoynge of the kynge and the ruyne of his whole realme. But than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes be to god they be ſo good huſbandes all three, and ſo muche euermore regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their own profite that they haue not taryed ſo longe before they aſked and ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teined their rewarde. My witneſſes bere in are two hundreth and fyfty thouſand liures in rentes, and a Million of golde in mouables, whiche at this daye ouer &amp; aboue that whiche their fathers left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beſides three hundreth thouſande liures in rent which their kinſemen poſſeſſe of the goodes of the church. And if they be not content with the goodes &amp; honours which they haue receiued at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of our kings hertofore but for the ful aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of their naturall diſpoſition wee

muſt moreouer accompt emongſt the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes of reward certaine particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenges, in this behalf alſo they haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſatiſfied to the ful. Let them cal to their remembrance a number of good and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table men whiche onely at their requeſt without charge or informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue ben committed to priſon, a number of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes decayed and of honourable famelyes empoueriſhed during the raines of king Frauncis the firſt, Henry, and Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis the ſeconde. So that they haue vſed the fauours of their maieſties not onely in aduauncing and enrichinge them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: but alſo in enpoueriſhing of others and reuenging their priuate quarelles.</p>
            <p>And if they wyll (as they ſay) that their purpoſe be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by theyr doinges here tofore, it may be eaſely iudged that their enterpriſe is ſuch as all the kinges good ſubiectes and ſeruauntes oughte to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them ſelues vnto, and withſtande in all that they are hable.</p>
            <p>¶ Afterwarde they ſaye that an euident and ineuitable ruine is greatly to be fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red if it be not by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpedely preuented and remedied. And to this ende they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:19883:14"/>
certaine articles with all humilitie and reuerence. But if a man ſhoulde aſke them whoo were the cauſe of their ruine and who it is that hathe ſoughte and procured it? If they would ſaye the trueth they ſhoulde be compelled to lay the blame therof vpon them ſelues. For after the publication of the ſtatute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Ianuary there was an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall peace and quietnes throughoute all this realme. And a twoo coople of you (that is to ſay the Conſtable of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and the Marſhall. S. Andre) can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye but that ſo longe as they thoughte that thoſe whiche were of the reformed religion would not be content with the order taken ſo long they toke vpon them to be pleaſed with it and to alowe it and ſwore betwixt the Dueenes handes (as did alſo the king of Nauarre and all the reſte of the counſayle, that they woulde cauſe it to be mainteyned in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys appointed to their gouernaunce, &amp; that they wolde neuer ſpeake for diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or abrogation of the ſame for ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one parte or the other. But ſoo ſone as they ſawe and perceued that the profeſſours of the relygion aforeſayde,
<pb facs="tcp:19883:14"/>
obeyed readely the kynges commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they went about to exaſperate the contrary faction. Howebeit they had ſo fewe to folowe theym that they coulde fynde no man fytte to be their myniſter, but onely the Prouoſt of the marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Marcel, and. x. or. xii. porters, ſo that the Duke of Guiſe hym ſelfe was faine to take the matter in hand at Uaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and there to cutte in peeces the poore people as they were at their prayers.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable becauſe he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trappe the churche of Paris, wreaked his anger vpon the pulpittes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chours and vppon the houſes where the aſſemblies were made, whiche he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſette on fyer, and certayne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſuche as profeſſed the foreſaide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion to be ſpoyled. And it is not to be marueyled that the reuenge hath benne made vpon Images in diuerſe partes of this realme. wherefore if they thyncke that the diuiſion of the people be the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yne which they ſay is euydent, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues are the authours therof, &amp; ſo they ought to be taken and blamed therfore. And as for the humilitie and reuerence whiche they vſe towardes the kyng and
<pb facs="tcp:19883:15"/>
Queene, hitherto I haue not ſeene that they haue obeyed any commaundement geuen them by the ſaide lady. But well I wotte they haue al three refuſed to go vnto the countreis commytted to theyr charge and gouernaunce, and I knowe alſo well that they woulde not come to Monceaux as I my ſelfe dyd at the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes commaundement.</p>
            <p>¶ They cam to Paris in armes againſt her commaundement, and thence wolde they not depart for any prayer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mighte be made vnto them, where as I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thence obeyinge the willes of their maieſties. They went to the king and queene beinge accompanyed with a bande of men in armes, althoughe they had expreſſely ben forbede the ſame.</p>
            <p>They brought them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Fontaineblean to Melun, and from Melun to Paris, &amp; that wholly per force. In whiche thing I reporte my ſelf vnto the conſcience of the queenes maieſtie, and to her othe or word at ſuch time as ſhe ſhalbe at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo that ſhe may ſafely ſay the trueth. They had rather ſee ciuil warre within this realme, yea ſo farre forth that they
<pb facs="tcp:19883:15"/>
brynge forainers into the ſame, than be content to withdrawe them ſelues home to theyr howſes without deminiſhing of their goodes or eſtates. Loe this is the reuerence and humilitie of them whiche preſente the foreſaid requeſtes. This is the; eale whiche they beare to the ſaue-garde of the kinge as they ſaye, whome they loue &amp; honoure ſo much that rather than they wyll go home they will ſe his realme in daunger of ruyne which they ſaye is euident and not poſſible to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded. This is the loue whiche they beare to theyr countrey, into the which they brynge foraine power to pylle and ſpoyle it (and if god holde not his hande ouer it) to ſubdue and vtterly deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>¶ Syth they require a decree which ſhal remayne for euer vpon theſtate of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And where as wee required that that ſhoulde be obſerued whiche is alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made vntyll the kynge ſhoulde come to age, they aunſwered that it was an vnciuyle and an vnreaſonable requeſte, for that it is in the kynges power and wyll to change, lymitte, enlarge and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrayn his decrees when ſo euer he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb facs="tcp:19883:16"/>
good. And that we in requyrynge that that whiche is alredye decreed by him and his counſel ſhould be kept and obſerued durynge his nonage, deſyre to kepe his maieſtie in pryſon &amp; captiuitie. And yet this notwithſtanding they will that the decre which thei thre haue made ſhal remaine in force &amp; vnchanged for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But if the reaſon which they aledge againſte vs are to be receaued, we wyll alſo by the ſelfe ſame conclude that they them ſelues wil keepe the king priſoner both in his nonage and lawful age.

If they had ben mooued with a good and peaſible zeale (as they ſay) &amp; not ſedicious, with a zeale of religion and not of ambition,
<pb facs="tcp:19883:16"/>
they woulde neuer haue begon with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous puniſhement as they haue done, they woulde haue cume vnarmed and preſented them ſelues with all humility and reuerence: They would haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the cauſes which moued them to miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like the decre of Ianuary. They woulde haue humblye beſoughte the kinge and Queene to conſider with their counſel, with the aduyſe of the parlementes and of other eſtates.

for them that profeſſe the forſaid reformed religion. They are three whiche make an ordinaunce that can not be executed with out ciuile warre and with out putting the realme in daunger of euident ruine. And they them ſelues ſee it and confeſſe it. Lo thus is the realme bounde vnto them, and this fruit bringeth forth their konwledge and good zeale (or that I may more trulye ſpeake) their practiſes, their conueyaunces and ambition of rule and commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>¶ The Duke of Guiſe and hys bretherne takinge vpon theym this enterpriſe to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe awaye the profeſſours of the refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion, what good zele ſo euer they pretend to haue can not deny but that they willingly go aboute to trouble and bring into daunger this realme, wher as they ſe that in the lyke enterpriſe their matters had ſo euyle ſucceſſe in Scotlande. In the which contrey the one parte and the other liued in peace vnder the obedience of that good and vertuouſe princeſſe the queene dowagier, vnto ſuch time as it was by the aucthoritie of the forſayd Guiſe publiſhed and proclaymed that the kyng minded not to permit that any other religion wer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in the ſayde contreye but onely the
<pb facs="tcp:19883:18"/>
religion of the churche of Rome, whyche was cauſe that a certayne ſmal number of people of the common ſort riſe and put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues in armes, who were by the prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſaide lady and the helpe of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie within ſhort time diſperſed. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge might haue ſerued for an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the ſayde Guiſe of the daunger whiche mighte enſue of greater troubles, if they geue not ouer theyr enterpriſe, of whiche thinge yet not withſtandinge they would take no regarde at all: but (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe) beinge in greater heate than euer they were theretofore writ vnto the ſayde lady verye ſharpe letters blaminge her for that ſhe had vſed to much gentlenes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the quarell of religion. And that for the ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of her faultes paſſed it was needeful that ſhe ſhoulde bluddie her han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vpon them eſpecially whiche were the chefe. And for this purpoſe they ſente vnto her the biſhoppe of Amiens, and M. de la Broſſe, whoo to declare theym ſelues at their firſte cumminge good catholickes of the Romiſhe ſecte, they woulde haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained euery man to cum to maſſe. They obiected oftentimes to the ſaid lady and to M. de Oyſel that thei had marred al. They proclaymed their purpoſe which was that
<pb facs="tcp:19883:18"/>
they would vſe force and conſtraint in the matter. The biſhoppe of Amiens as the popes legate lokynge for the bulles of his legacie, promiſed that he would refourme the moſt parte of them which he ſaid were out of the way. M. de la Broſſe promiſed within the ſpace of one moneth to banyſh them which woulde not be refourmed.</p>
            <p>And for ſo much as couetouſenes is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the companion of crueltie, they caſt a pleaſant eye vpon the landes and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſions of the nobilitie. They wryte vnto them who had ſent them that by taxinge the people and putting to death out of the way ſuch gentylmen as fauoured and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reformed religion, meane might be found both to encreaſe the kinges reue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nues two hundreth thouſand crownes by yere, &amp; to furnyſhe a thouſand fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen with houſes &amp; goodes, who might continuallye dwell there and ſerue as an ordinarie garriſon of men of war. This condition was wyllingly receiued &amp; well lyked and alowed, to the great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of theym who were the authours therof. And notwithſtanding al demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations that the foreſaid lady and M. de Oyſel were hable to make, that the Scot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes coulde nat ſo eaſely be brought vnder
<pb facs="tcp:19883:19"/>
yoke, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wold put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues into the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of ſtrangers, by whoſe ayde to aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues of the whole they wold baniſhe the name and obedyence of the churche of Rome, &amp; that therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhulde put in danger the eſtate &amp; ſo much as aperteined to the aucthoritie of the king &amp; queene. Al this was miſlyked &amp; reiected. The queene was a good gentylwoman but ſhe hadde marred all. M. de Oyſell was but a fole without all vnderſtandynge, becauſe he wolde not loſe that whiche he had by his labour and diligence kepte ſo longe. In concluſion theſe gentilmen (who ſe ſo far in a mylſtone) handled the matter ſo wel by their wytty deuiſes, that the chief and greateſt part of the nobilitie aryſe and in armes &amp; ioyned them ſelues with their an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient (and that I maye ſo ſay) with their natural enemies. And within ſhort tyme dryue away all their prieſtes, who might wel inoughe haue liued and continued in their eſtate, if they coulde haue ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente with a common peace betwyxte the one parte &amp; the other. So that bothe the name of Guiſe &amp; the name of the churche of Rome was ſent backe agayne on thys ſide the ſea. And ſo thoſe folke which wold
<pb facs="tcp:19883:19"/>
haue had all to them ſelues loſt al.</p>
            <p>Hereof ſhuld the duke of Guyſe and his brethern haue taken exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple and haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged the fault which he committed in putting the realme of Scotland in dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gier, &amp; ſhulde haue kepte in thoſe wordes whiche ſo many times they haue reherſed and publiſſhed: whiche are that thone of theſe two religions muſte of neceſſitie be baniſhed out of the realme of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and that thone part muſt nedes geue place to thother. Theſe wordes are not ſitting to be ſpoken of a ſubiect or ſeruaunt. Theſe are the wordes of a king, being in his ful age &amp; auctoritie, who hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aduiſed not onely by his ordinaries cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, but alſo by the wiſeſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thre eſtates of this realme. For in ſuch a matter wherein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in queſtion the diminiſhing of the force of a king &amp; of the halfe (I ſpeke of the leaſt) of his nobilite &amp; of the people which is able to ſerue, we muſt not go ſo generally and roundly to work, as wel becauſe there is no king which feleth not as ſenſibly ſuch a loſſe, as if a man cut away the halfe of his limmes from his own bodye, as alſo conſideringe the daunger whiche ſhoulde enſue (at the leaſte at this preſente tyme) where as our kyng by reaſon of his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der
<pb facs="tcp:19883:20"/>
age ruleth onely according to the opinion and affection of an other man) that this halfe ſeinge it ſelfe perſecuted dyd not in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtede of departure and geuing place, take courage and driue out the other. And as concernyng the eſtate of the Romiſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion, they whiche go about by force of armes to plant the ſame onely in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, put it in danger of dimyniſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day more and more, in that they to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte it vnto the force and defence of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. And it had ben farre better to haue kept the one &amp; the other in peace &amp; vnion, &amp; not to haue diſputed of theſe matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wiſe but with paper &amp; parchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; not with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlaughter &amp; effuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of blud, which (peraduenture) hath prouoked the anger of god and called vpon his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce in ſuche ſorte, that the prieſtes and the other of their order (who might haue liued quietly in their charges and enidy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their goodes) ſhall be the fyrſte whiche ſhal ſuſteyne the daunger of the folly, and (that whiche is worſe) of the rage of the people. And what ſoo euer come to paſſe hereof, the protection of theſe gentilmen the peticioners can not but brynge vnto them a certain loſſe and the danger of an huge ruine. For ſeynge they were once
<pb facs="tcp:19883:20"/>
aſſured that they ſhoulde not be troubled or moleſted in their lyuing, in their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor in their goodes: they could not ſay that they hadde any occaſion at all to complaine, excepte they wyll take vppon them that they were moued with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhion for the loſſe of our ſoules. But how is it come to paſſe that they are lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo carefull, where as there is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther byſhop nor curet emongſt them who can proue that he hath heretofore regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theym any thynge at all.</p>
            <p>Seing therfore that it was of our parte determyned that no man ſhoulde in anye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe trouble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what neded you to name them in this quarell and to couer your ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues with the name of them &amp; of the church of Rome? Is not this the way to prouoke and kindle the one part againſt the other? Is not this the way to make this order o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſe to the whole people which already is to muche offended with it? Is not this the way to kyndle (if god do not ſet to his helping hand) emongſt them which lyued in peace, the lyke furyouſe hate vnto that which was in Scotlande. And what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer chaunce therof ſeinge it is ſo that one of the two partes muſt nedes be baniſhed &amp; that the petycioners wyl haue it ſo, ther
<pb facs="tcp:19883:21"/>

               </gap> a ſpectacle as that is lyke to be. Is there any profit in the world, is there any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, is there any power (yea and if it were for the king him ſelfe) that ought to be bought ſo deare and with ſuch a ruine and deſolation? What pardones, what in dulgences, what bulles of the pope can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer recompence the loſſe of the bloud whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che ſhalbe ſhedde for this quarell? Theſe thre peticioners may ſaye vnto the kinge ſometime hereafter that in the defence of that which no man did aſſault in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the religion of Rome (which no man troubled nor letted) they haue cauſed him or would haue cauſed him to loſe the halfe of his nobilitie and of the beſt of hys maieſties ſubiectes. A man may and that according to the trueth lay to their charge that euen as with their fayned and falſe opinions they put the realme of Scotland in daunger of an euident ruine, and were cauſers of a great and piteouſe effuſion of bloude, ſo wyth the ſame opynyons, the ſame purpoſe, the ſame mynyſters theye haue caſt the apple of diſcord amidde this realme, &amp; ſo haue inſtigate one againſt an other that theſe thre peticioners and their miniſters ſhalbe noted to poſteritie as the
<pb facs="tcp:19883:21"/>
onely authours of all the harmes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences which ſhal chaunce both to thoſe that be of the refourmed church and alſo of the church of Rome.</p>
            <p>Moreouer leaſt they ſhould faile to cauſe troubles ynough, they require that all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, whether they be of houſeholde, of ordinaunce, of iudgement, of finaunces, and others hauing adminiſtration or com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion, &amp; likewiſe prelates of the church ſhall make confeſſion of their fayth. And they which delay or refuſe the ſame, ſhall be depriued of their eſtates and penſions, and the men of the churche of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces. Theſe be three priuate perſonnes, which make a law contrary to the lawes of this realme. For it hath neuer ben ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeene or vnderſtoode that the kynges heretofore haue at any tyme conſtrayned their ſubiectes to make other confeſſyon of their Fayth eccept onely their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye beliefe or Credo. This lawe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lawes of the churche, I vnder ſtande of the churche as they do that is ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken of the general counſells and of thoſe auncient fath<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs whiche they allowe.</p>
            <p>Wherfore he who endyted theyr requeſt, who is of ſo great knowledge ſhuld haue brought ſome example therewith to haue

cloked his wycked pourpoſe, the whiche in dede he canne not do excepte he brynge into this realme the inquiſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Spain. The whiche was iudged ſo vniuſt of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations that not one emongeſt them all would vſe or accepte it. And yf I ſhall ſay the trueth this law is the trappe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they hadde ſette at Orleans ſumwhat before the death of king Frauncis lately deceaſſed, the which can tende to no other but to the ruine and vtter ſubuerſion of al the kinges ſubiectes. For the foreſaid pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticioners do knowe wel that there be ten thouſande gentle menne and an hundreth thouſand men after them able to beare ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moure, which neither for force nor autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will euer forſake the religion which they haue receaued. Neyther wil they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that eyther preachinge adminiſtration of the ſacramentes be taken from theym. And the kynge beinge vnder age as he is there is no man that hathe aucthoritye to commaunde them to avoyde the realme, yea they wyll defende theym ſelues with the ſworde againſte them who in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe wil abuſe the aucthoritie of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. This great and notable companye can not be ouercome ne vanquiſſhed, if it ſo come to paſſe (which god forbidde) with
<pb facs="tcp:19883:22"/>
out the ruine of theſe whiche ſhall aſſayle them. So that the ſtraungers the whiche they haue already called (which is treaſon and an offence worthy of death) ſhal beare away the fruict of this ciuile warre. And for a concluſion ſpeakinge as I doo bothe for my ſelfe and for a number of great lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of thys realme, and for ten thouſande gentelmen and other of oure trayne who will liue and die in thys quarrell. I ſaye that the forſayde decree was made by thre priuate perſons who by their aucthoritie haue broken them whyche were made by the kynge and hys counſell. And becauſe they woulde execute it before they had by lawful conſultacion approued it they put on armure &amp; toke by force the kinges per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I ſay moreouer that the foreſaide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre is againſt the lawes of this realme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cuſtome of whole chriſtendo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e againſte the decre of Ianuary, againſt the requeſte of the eſtates, againſt the quietneſſe &amp; ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of the kinges ſubiectes, &amp; agaynſt the concience, the honour, the life &amp; goodes of an infynite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of honeſte people, who haue ſought to brynge ſome to deathe, to driue others out of their contreys vnder y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cloke &amp; pretence of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cience and religion. This decre alſo is made againſt the liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:19883:23"/>
of going to the general counſell. The which he that gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the aduiſe ſhould haue better marked. For if it be ſayd that in thys realme ſuche confeſſion of faythe as they require ſhall be made with decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion of maintenaunce of the doctryne and ceremonyes of the churche of Rome, it is a ſentence geuen againſt them of the refourmed churche. wherfore neyther our miniſters nor the miniſters of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſte not go to the generall counſel, ſeing they are condemned before they be hearde. But before that the ſaide duke of Guiſe and the Cardinall his brother can ſette foorth this decree of confeſſion they muſte renounce a number of artycles of the confeſſion of Auguſt which they agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon at Sauerne and promiſed a great prince of Almaine that they would cauſe theym to be obſerued in Fraunce. And if they wil denie this let them put it in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge and they ſhal be anſwered by them vnto whom they made the promiſe. The ſaide Cardinall muſt alſo put in writinge that it may be ſen and publiſſhed whether he remaine in the ſame minde the whiche he ones hertofore declared vnto the quene in the preſence of a great ſorte of honeſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶ In the requeſt not muche after thys is made mencion of the breakynge of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And requeſte is made by theym that preſented it that the damages ſhoulde be recompenſed and the offendors puniſhed. Where vnto I will aunſwere this worde that the bloudde of them who breoke the foreſayde Images the whiche was ſhedde by the handes of certayne of oure retinue who woulde haue ſtayed them and ſyth by auctoritie of iuſtice in the ſame place of Orleans, wyll beare wytneſſe euermore before god and before men, howe greatly ſuche executions done by the ignoraunte people alwayes myſlyked me for manye reſpectes, and ſpecially becauſe the ſame was contrary to the decree of Ianuary, &amp; alſo to an aſſoſiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we had cauſed be publiſhed a fewe dayes before. But if the breakynge of Images deſerne any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and puniſhemente (becauſe it is done contrary to the kynges ordynaunce) what puniſhement loke they for who gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyſhe them ſelues ſo well with the name

In whiche places it is well knowen that betwixt men &amp; women there haue ben ſlayne aboue. v. hundreth perſones for none other occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

            <p>¶ Than the peticioners or (that I may ſpeake more truely) the commaunders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that their armure ſhalbe taken from them who haue borne the ſame withoute the expreſſe commaundement of the kinge of Nauarre, and that they whyche haue worn armure in that manner be declared rebelles and ennemyes to the kynge and realme.

For they ſay not that they which will not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of their armoure, but that they which be in that ſorte armed, ſhalbe declared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles. Which is an article that deſerueth an other maner of anſweare than by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, wherfore I truſt within fewe daies to go and meete with theym, and diſpute with them with the ſworde whether it be meete that an outelandiſhe manne with a couple of meane mates ſuch as they are to pronounce a prince of the bloudde roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and the two partes of the nobilitye of this realme rebelles and ennemyes to the king. Neyther behoueth it them to vſe the name and authoritie of the kinge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, to whom they haue bene continual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly deadly ennemies euen from the time of other kings. They haue thruſt him backe and kept him behind ſo muche as poſſibly they mighte, yea in ſoo muche that they wold not make mention of him ne of hys rightes at ſuch time as queſtion hath ben as concerninge the concluſion of a treatie of peace.

And for to make vp the matter, in the time of king Frauncis laſt deceaſſed they made as little count of him as if he had bene the pooreſt gentilman in this realme, and ſince they cauſed him by threatnings to come vnto them, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that no man durſt be ſo bolde as to go out of Orleans to mete him. They forbed all knightes of the order and other gentil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men to vyſite hym or communycate with him in any wiſe. They ſent a marſhall of Fraunce with a bande of horſemen &amp; ſore men to ſeaſe vpon his whole landes, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led in ſtraungers to the ſpoile of the ſame as it is wel knowen to al the world. And ſeing their enterpriſe broken by the death of the forſayd late kyng Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis it is wel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>knowen what counſelles they helde to be faite him all together.</p>
            <p>They continually ſo withſtode him that he neuer could haue authority to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand The foreſaide prince of Guiſe by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of the Conſtable, ſaide nowe a yeare ago that he woulde not departe from the court neyther at the requeſt nor comman<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demente of the kinge of Nauarre. The

marſhal of S. Andre ſaid vnto him in full cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel. I wil obey the king and the quene &amp; none other. And nowe they wyl vſe his name for their profyte. Whome in times paſte they haue ſo naughtely entreated. And they intende to vſe the auctoritie of his name, therby to deſtroy his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther. And where as the foreſaid lord king of Nauarre was ſo wel loued (as euer he was) they ſeeke meanes to make him ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the moſte parte of the nobilitie and people hoping that if they can wholly put him out of conceyte with them who haue ſo long and faithfully loued him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they may well inough ſet him at naughte and handle him at their pleaſure as they haue done in times paſt: but the deceipt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they thought to come to their purpoſe is diſcloſed and wel knowen &amp; ſhal ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſet forth and publiſhed throughoute all chriſtendome, to the ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuche as haue bene the mynyſters thereof.</p>
            <p>As touching their requeſt that the king of Nauarre maye aſſemble force to put in execution the things before reherſed, they therin ſhewe euidently eyther great folye or a great deſire that we neuer come toa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny agremente. For ſeynge they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb facs="tcp:19883:26"/>
to conſtrayne by force of armes them of the reformed religion, to do that which they require they ſhoulde not haue tolde vs ſo before we had laide apart oure armes. For ſeinge they haue ſo plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geuen vs to vnderſtande their purpoſe we wil take hede that we be not deceiued and wil not lay of our harneſſe (but with very good tokens.)</p>
            <p>¶ Theye require alſo that certaine other articles whiche ſhalbe geuen by the court of parleament of Paris may be receaued, wherin they declare the littel regard that they haue to the queene and king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre &amp; the kynges counſell. And I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile greatly that at the leaſt they had no reſpect to the ſixe great wiſe perſonages which they placed in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, at whoſe handes I doubt not but a man might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelye receiue good and notable aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I doubt not at all but that in the ſaide parlemente there be many good men, who in vertue and knowledge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the auncient integritie of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Howebeit the thre peticioners haue taken ſo good order therin that partly by benefices, partly by offices ſome ſold and ſome halfe geuen and by other vnlawfull meanes, and not to be ſuffered in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme,
<pb facs="tcp:19883:26"/>
they haue made ſuche a number of friendes, that the good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be many times ouerlaide by the badde. And concernynge this matter it ſhalbe ſufficient to all edge that the legation hath ben twiſe refuſed, folowing the edicte made and confirmed at the requeſte of the ſtates, publiſhed and proclaymed in all the courtes of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. And (that whiche is more) their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall was grounded vpon their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the conſcience of the kynge. And yet without loking for any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement but of a ſymple letter of the ſeale they haue receiued &amp; approued it through the ſollicitation and practiſes of theſe. iii. and their miniſters. Loo what hope we haue that wee ſhall there fynde good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and counſell.</p>
            <p>¶ By a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce preſented with their requeſte they deſire that the townes may be rendred into the kinges handes with newe othe of fidelitye. And they woulde gladlye (as they dyd in the tyme of kynge Frauncis lately deceaſſed) perſwade the world that al they which will not endure their tirannie are the kinges enemies. It myghte ſuffice the duke of Guiſe and hys brethern that they haue ones already had the vſe of thys craftye inuencion, to the
<pb facs="tcp:19883:27"/>
greate diſpleaſure of a number of honeſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> men. Whereas to defende them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuche as ought them euil will they couered theyr priuate quarell with the kynges. If anye manne were eyther by priuate or publicke iniury ſuſſpected one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue ſpoken euyl of anie of them, he was ſtreight waye empriſoned, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by letters patentes declared enne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie to the kynge and to the eſtate. And bycauſe this goodlye inuencion of theirs hathe once hadde good ſucceſſe (wherwith they hadde brought to paſſe greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters if god hadde not put to hys helpinge hande) they would nowe returne agayne to the ſame and although there be at this day no manne within this realme (at the leaſte emongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche be of our ſide) which is not readie to endaunger his lyfe and goodes in the ſeruice of the kinge, yet for al that they call vs rebelles. There is no man of oure parte (as god is oure wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe who woulde not with all hys heart hazarde his lyfe) to ſaue and preſerue hys maieſtie from harme or daunger, whome we loue derely and honoure as a ſinguler and preciouſe gift whiche god hath geuen vs. There is none emongeſt vs whyche hathe taken armes to aſke anye thinge at

               </gap>wiſe our men haue neuer murniured what but then ſo euer haue bene layed vpon them. And they haue offered and preſently offer, that they wyll wyth all their harte agree vnto al that it ſhal pleaſe him to require, ſo farre as their goodes and landes wyll ſtretche. The townes which are named to be rebelliouſe, haue not chaunged their maiſter ne lorde, but acknowledge more gladly than euer heretofore the obedience whyche they ought vnto oure kinge. And who ſo ſhal ſe the Aunſwere whiche they haue made, ſhal eaſely perceiue that their armes were not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand againſt the kinge. They ſhall perceaue that we haue not required any thing which concerneth the perſon aucthority the gouernaunce or life of hys maieſtee. They ſhall perceaue that oure armes are borne againſte the
<pb facs="tcp:19883:28"/>
houſe of Guiſe, the Couſtable and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall S. Andre. And that doone with ſuch modeſtie that wee ſeeke not their goodes their liues nor their eſtates. Wherfore he that wil ſay that we beare armes againſt the kinge (as they woulde make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue) muſte needes confeſſe that hee is a ſlaunderour, or rather that he is willinge to helpe theym forwarde to vſurpe thys realme, and to take vppon them the name and doynges of the kinge. And thoſe that ſhall counſell the kynge to receaue their protection, to graunte vnto them the vſe of his name and aucthoritie, to lend them men and money againſt vs as though we made warre againſte hys maieſtye: ſuche counſellours I ſay (chaunce whan it wil) ſhal one day be called to iudgement wher they muſt declare howe they coulde ioyne the quarell of three priuate perſons wyth the quarrell of hys Maieſtye and of the whole realme. They muſte alſo make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes of the money which ſhalbe ſpent in thys warre, agaynſte the decree of the eſtates and of the kynges counſel, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende that which pleaſeth theſe three pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons: for it is none other but their pleaſure, that is to ſay, to be at the court or at home at theyr houſes. And if ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:19883:28"/>
counſaylours haue goodes wherewith to make aunſwere. I truſte that at the ende<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the warre ſhalbe made vppon their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the charges of ſuch as be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall authours therof. Upon whoſe goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des I hope to take ſo much as ſhalbe ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and to reſtore the ſame vnto the kynges treaſure to the comfort of the people.</p>
            <p>¶ For thend &amp; concluſion of their requeſt they proteſt that if that which they deſire be fully executed, they are ready to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe them ſelues home to their houſes. Yea (if nede be) to go to the worlds end. So that we nowe vnderſtande when we may truſt that they wyl withdrawe them ſelues. Than (ſay they) when the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges beforeſaid ſhalbe done, accompliſhed, and executed. That is to ſaye, when the decree of Ianuary ſhal by their auctoritie be broken, when by their ordynances all the miniſters ſhall be banyſſhed, when they which be of the reformed religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal not be ſuffered to heare any ſermon, nor to receiue the ſacrament but of theym of the churche of Rome. When all that be of the foreſaid religion ſhalbe depriued of their eſtates, of their charges, of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces, and moreouer ſpoyled &amp; ſent home to their houſes in open danger of the rage
<pb facs="tcp:19883:29"/>
of them who wyll deuoure them, &amp; cauſe them to leſe their lyfe with their libertie if they incurre any offence. Interpreting offence (as they haue in tymes paſt done) not to come to the maſſe, the aſſembly of neyghbours together to make their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to god. Lo this is it that they call an offence. When we ſhalbe proclaymed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles and ennemies to the kynge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, becauſe we haue borne armoure and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei haue taken away the ſame from vs, and that no man maye beare it but in the execution of their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Loo theſe be the conditions whiche we may loke for at theſe noble mens han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des. Lo this is the moſte honeſt pourpoſe that they pretend. But they are wiſer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to declare to what pas they purpoſe after warde to attaine. Nowe let my requeſte be reported and ſet in compariſon againſt theirs. I require the maintenance of the decree of Ianuary, and they wyl by their auctoritie breake it and diſanull it. They require the decay and ruine of an infinite number of houſes, as well of the nobyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as of the thirde eſtate. I require &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that all the kynges ſubiectes of what ſorte ſo euer they be, may be mainteyned and kept in their eſtate and goodes, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb facs="tcp:19883:29"/>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all iniurie and violence. They purpoſe to baniſhe all them that be of the reformed religion: And I deſire that we may be reſerued til the time that the king be come to full age, at what time we wil be ready to obey al that it ſhal pleaſe him to commaunde vs: &amp; in the meane ſeaſon that thei which be of the Romiſhe church be not troubled, moleſted, ne hindred, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theyr goodes, nor in the exercyſe of their charges. They require an armye, wherwith to execut that which they haue taken in hand, and conſider not that they ſhal conſtrain an infinite number of good men to defende them ſelues. They conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the lacke of expenſes: neyther the incommodities and ruines whiche ciuile warre bringeth with it. And (that which is the worſt of all) they haue ſent for and haue agreed together to cauſe forrain ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours to come into the countrey, whiche is to ſay in plaine language, to geue this realme in praye vnto forayners. On the contrary parte I require not to haue men of warre remaine with mee. I ſpende not the kynges money, I call not ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into my countrey: but haue refuſed to receaue ſuche as were offered me, as god is my witneſſe. I prayed them that
<pb facs="tcp:19883:30"/>
they ſhulde not come, and that they wold let others to comme eyther with me or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt me. And I require (as I haue done euer heretofore) that we may put awaye our armes as wel on the one parte as the other, beinge aſſured that on oure parte there ſhall neyther be rebellion ne diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp; that on our behalfe armes ſhall neuer be of ſuch force and efficacie as the loue, the fidelitie, the obedience whiche we ought vnto our kynge, for whoſe ſake we will neuer ſticke to haſarde our lyues and goodes. And we haue geuen to vnder ſtande that we are not Ideotes, as it was reported, and that we are more hable to do hym ſeruice in his nede than they who wolde banyſſhe vs, with all their trayne and practiſes. They require that we may be proclaimed rebelles, they require oure lyues, our honours and conſciences. We require nothing at al parteyning to their lyues, to their honours, to their goodes, nor to their conſciences: neyther do wee wyſhe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any more harme than that whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che we will binde our ſelues vnto, which is that they and we withdraw our ſelues home to our houſes, folowing wholly the conditions which are written at large in oure declaration and proteſtations made
<pb facs="tcp:19883:30"/>
heretofore, and ſent to the kyng &amp; queene. And thei can not ſay that their honour is therin any thinge touched at all. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge we alſo accept the ſame condicions, there remayneth no place for them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine or diſcontent them ſelues. Our re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſt is iuſt, for ſo much as they came to their kynge (as hath ben ofte reheried) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than accordynge to their duety, and with ſuche purpoſes as haue ben the cauſes of the troubles which we preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſe. And they haue required and ſought the vndoynge of ſo many good men, that notwithſtandinge our requeſte were not vpon ſo good a grounde as we ſuppoſe it is, yet ought we rather to diſpleaſe. v. or vi. (for ſo many they be) than offende th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> two parts of the whole realme. And they whiche be of the lyke ſorte and force as be they them ſelues, who wolde baniſhe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknowledge and confeſſe this daye that there is no way to aſſault the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, much leſſe to ouercome theym, without the ayde of forraines and ſtraungers.</p>
            <p>¶ And although ther be no like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of the on requeſt vnto thother, forſomuch as the one is ful of iuſtice and equitie, the other of vniuſtice, tiranny and crueltie. And that they who preſente the blouddy &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:19883:31"/>
violent requeſte, meane for their pleaſure &amp; to bryng their purpoſes to paſſe to trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble this royalme: The other require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elles but a common reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and haue not taken armes but vpon conſtraynt and for to defende their lyues, their honours and their conſciences. The queene may iudge which of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> two requeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes oughte to be receaued or denied. And wheras preſently either becauſe ſhe is not at lybertye (as ſhee is not in deede at thys time) or for ſome other conſideration ſhee can not gyue iudgemente hereof, neyther would diſpleaſe them who haue preſented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. May it pleaſe her maieſtie, that theſe troubles may the rather be brought to an end, to cauſe the foreſaid two requeſtes to be regiſtred in the court of parlemente at Paris. That the decree of Ianuary bee mayntayned and kepte, and that the one parte and the other lay away their armes and withdrawe them ſelues to their how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes till the kynge be come to ful age, that he may iudge who hathe done well &amp; who euyll. Orelles that the queenes maieſtie will geue iudgement herein with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the eſtates whiche ſhall for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent be caulled together. This remedy is common to vs all, and no man ſhall haue

occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to complaine or diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him ſelf therwith. And may ſoo eaſely and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely be executed that he who wil not agre therunto, cannot deny but that he is enne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie vnto the kyng and realme. And it is not to be iudged that there is any man in the world (if he be not caried away<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And for ſo muche as in all ciuill war none other ende can be loked for, but ſuch as is full of all miſery and calamity, and that it is a harde matter to ſtape the handes and affections of Souldiours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prouoked againſt them who would be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come tirannes ouer them. I proteſt before god and before al men, that I am greatly ſory &amp; agreued to take armes and to leade theym who beare the ſame. And that I would wyth my bloud if I coulde take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye the myſerable effectes wherewyth

the warre threateneth vs. But ſyth my requeſte is not regarded, ſithe mine enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will be my iudges and commaunde nowe adaies vnder the name and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the kinge. I proteſt that my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe tendeth to none other ende but to ſet the king at ſuch liberty as he was in now ſixe monethes paſſed, to reſtore the gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente to the queenes handes with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the king of Nauarre as was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But I wyll referre all my doinges and the grace whiche god wyll geue me, vnto the honoure of god, to the ſeruyce of the kyng, and to the quietneſſe and comforte of all his ſubiectes.</p>
