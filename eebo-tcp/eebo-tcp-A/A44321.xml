            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SYNOPSIS.</head>
            <p>THE Comet seen <hi>April</hi> 21. 1677. between the Triangle
and the Cloud of ♈, its tail not directly opposite to the
☉, its Magnitude, Brightness, Head, Nucleus, Blaze,
(1.) Why sometimes shorter, sometimes longer; without sensible
motion of parts. Explanation of the first figure, as seen by the eye.
(2.) Of the second Figure, as seen through a glass, of a parabolick
termination, differing from the representations of Mr. <hi>Hevelius.</hi>
(3.) The Medulla, and blaze with the manner of shortning and
lengthening, explained by the third figure; not seen the 22d. but
the 23d. The bigness of the Nucleus and Head through a Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
compared with the top of a Tower. (4.) The place it
then appeared in. Why the motion was not more exactly observed.
Its blaze still not opposite to the Sun. The 24th. not seen, nor 25th.
(5.) though the Sky clear by reason of the height of Vapors. How
they do lengthen the <hi>Crepusculum.</hi> Why Physical Remarks only
were made. (6.) Published in order to understand Objections, and
propound pertinent Queries. Some Observations, Notes, Queries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> concerning the Comets in 1664. and 1665. here. Collected
out of several scattered Papers and Lectures of them formerly read
here imperfect. Queries of its substance, magnitude, density, muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
dissolution, fluidity, gravity, light, figure, motion bended or
straight, (7.) with equal or unequal velocity, in the Atmosphere or
Aether, above or below the Moon. Whether it wasts, or lasts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
The Star of a compacted light (8.) varied possibly from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
partly from real change, Tail transparent, Body supposed
more dense, side toward the Sun evenly defin'd, Encompassed with
a fluid yielding to motion, but dissolving its parts. Its light from its
self. (9.) Its Nucleus supposed dense possibly as the middle part of
the Earth, of which some conjectures. Dissolved by the Aether as
in our Atmosphere. (10.) Argument for the looseness of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
parts of the Earth from the variation of magnetical direction.
(11.) The Nucleus of Comets possibly the same. Internal motion
may weaken gravitation. Parts separated may be agitated by the
gravitation of the ☉. Tail made not so much by the particles rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the Stars approaching the Sun. (12.) How the Comet
may first lose its Orb in the Universe, and passing through the
<pb facs="tcp:40537:10"/>
spheres of Activity of several central bodies is deflected and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by them, and the Blaze raised to a prodigious length.
(13.) The bodies being attracted by some gravity, Blaze expelled by
levity, explained by smoke, and steams. Somewhat for positive
levity. (14.) A digression concerning the method of specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the great and first principles of the Universe. The <hi>Coma</hi> and
Blaze like smoke or flames. (15.) Shining particles a shining
point, not a line of light. Considerations and Experiments about
the ways light is augmented by, as by swift motion, adjacent
dark <hi>medium,</hi> Flame explained. Why the Particles coalesce into
a stream. (16.) Enquiry about the magnitude and place of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.
Many supposed them sublunary. <hi>Tycho</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> proved
them coelestial. How far we may rely upon Observations for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallax.
Parallax and its effects described. (18.) <hi>Tycho</hi> supposed
the Comet of 1577. to move about the Sun. <hi>Kepler</hi> that of 1607.
to move in a straight line; that of 1664. had no sensible Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax
by what means it was found. (19.) Refraction in this way
varies little. Theory of Comets defective as to Parallax hitherto.
Parallax not to be enquired from the Observations of several men.
Errors creep in from the Press and the Graver, as in <hi>P. Gottignies</hi>
Plates. (20.) Nothing to be concluded from Observations
made by persons in differing places for want of accurate Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Observations. (21.) Even the best as <hi>Hevelius, Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignies,
Petit,</hi> or <hi>Auzout</hi> err. Some reason for this assertion. Most
of the rest altogether insignificant. (22.) Want of Observers,
Instruments, and Tables the cause. How these wants are to be
supplied. What the world expects from Mr. <hi>Hevelius.</hi> (23.) And
of how great use his Tables and Projections made by them will
be. Parallax from diurnal motion failing. (24.) Other Parallaxes
arising from other hypotheses of the proper motions either of the
Earth, or Comet, or both together considered arise to a certainty.
(25.) Others depending upon other suppositions define nothing of
the magnitude or distance of Comets. The inconvenience of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s,
and also of <hi>Kepler</hi>'s Hypotheses explained. A third way I have
taken. What consequences follow from it, (26.) As that it moves
in a Circle that comes within the Earth Orb in ♌, and without
♃ Orb in ♒, a sextant in 130 days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This not relied on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there may be other hypotheses to solve the phaenomena; as
that the Earth is unmoved, and the Comet moved in a Circle, whose
convex side is toward the Earth. (27.) This hypothesis explained
by the sixth figure. (28.) The distance and bigness of the Circle
of the Comet undeterminable this way without a diurnal parallax,
since the appearances may be solved by Circles of any bigness, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the eighth figure, (29.) Allowing inequality of motion, or
<pb facs="tcp:40537:10"/>
more compound curve lines, nothing can be determined. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Orb it seemed the most probable solves <hi>Kepler</hi>'s acceleration,
according to the increase of a line of Tangents. (30.) A gravitation
towards the Sun makes out the motion of the Comet, and Planets,
and of the Blaze. The Blaze explained by experiment of ♂ dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in oyl of Virt. (31.) This experiment and hypothesis farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
and applied to explain the Blaze which is from thence bent,
brighter on one side than the other, not direct from the Sun.
(32.) Cometical body and motion as old as the world, yet wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Aether; explained by fire. Dissolution by <hi>menstruums.</hi>
(33.) Thence the proprieties of Comets conjectured, and the sum of
the foregoing discourse repeated, being the end of a Lecture. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi>'s Observation (34.) for making out the Comets
Orb. His supposing its motion unequal without reason a shift. Mr.
<hi>Horrox</hi> his hypotheses in the ninth figure a product of chance.
(35.) A discourse on it, and some objections against <hi>Tycho</hi>'s.
(36.) <hi>Kepler</hi>'s hypothesis examined by these Observations of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s,
found the most likely, but with some alteration. Line of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
bent a little. Motion accelerated towards the Sun, retarded
from it. (37.) The swifter and further off the Comet from the
Sun, the less the bend, explained by the tenth figure. (38.) The way

(51, 52, 53.) But would have been further examined by
<pb facs="tcp:40537:11"/>
Observation if there had been opportunity. (54.) That these assertions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <head>COMETA,
OR,
Remarks about Comets.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, <hi>April</hi> 21. 1677.
I first saw the Comet, of which I
had been advertised the day before.
It appeared in the Sign <hi>Taurus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the base of the Triangle, and
the unformed Stars in the Cloud of
<hi>Aries,</hi> dignified by <hi>P. Pardies,</hi> with
the figure of the Flower-de-luce.
The head of it was in a right line, with the heart of
<hi>Cassiopea,</hi> and <hi>Alamak,</hi> or the South foot of <hi>Andromeda.</hi>
and as near as I could judge by my naked eye (having
no Instrument or help by me) it was ⅙ of the distance
between the feet and the Girdle of <hi>Andromeda,</hi> distant
from the said <hi>Alamak</hi> towards the South.</p>
            <p>Its tail sometimes as the Air was clearer and darker,
extended about three quarters of its distance from the
aforesaid <hi>Alamak,</hi> and pointed directly at the Star in the
nose of <hi>Cassiopea</hi> of the fourth Magnitude, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the head of the Comet pointed not directly at
the Sun (the Sun then being about the eleventh degree
of <hi>Taurus)</hi> but rather towards the fourteenth degree of
the same Sign. Its appearance was very small and slender,
and as people commonly ghessed, about two yards long;
and the head about the bigness of a Star of the first
magnitude, but of a much fainter and duller light. Its
blaze about three o'the clock seemed to rise straight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40537:14"/>
before that about half an hour after two it lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a little Eastwards, or towards the right hand, and
after three, as it rose higher, inclined towards the left
side or Westwards. The head to the naked eye was
brighter than the blaze, and seemed to be somewhat
bigger than that part of it which immediately joyn'd to
the head; but those parts of it which were farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
were of a much greater breadth; spreading wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and wider, as they were more remote from the
head, and in the same proportion also growing fainter
and fainter in their light, especially towards the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:
but the middle parts of <hi>medulla</hi> appear'd much
longer, and the brightness much greater, which made
the whole blaze to seem to taper, or be pointed towards
the top.</p>
            <p>The length of the Blaze appeared sometimes shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and sometimes longer, by several vicissitudes; and
as the day-break, or dawning increased, so the Blaze
shortened, and especially towards the sides near the top,
and shortly after before the Sun rose, disappeared.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this shortning and lengthening
of the Blaze, I could not perceive any kind of motion in
the parts of it, such as is observable in flame, smoke,
or other steams rising from a burning or hot body: but
the same parts of the Blaze seemed to appear and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in their proper places as if they had been fixed and
a solid body.</p>
            <p>The first Figure I have here annexed will with some
short explications, represent the appearance of it to the
eye, more plainly than by a multitude of words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it 'tis possible to express.</p>
            <p>A, represents the head of the Comet, the middle of
which appeared brighter than any other part; about
which was a hazy light somewhat like the shining of a
Star through a thin cloud; the lower part of which was
pretty round and defined. B, the neck of it, which
seemed to the naked eye of less Diameter, and less
bright than the head, but through a six-foot glass, as I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40537:14"/>
shall mention by and by, it appeared bigger, though
not so bright. The middle of this was very bright, and
seemed to issue from the <hi>Nucleus</hi> or Star in the middle
of the head. C, the brushy parts which were fainter
and paler towards the sides, especially nearer the top,
which made the whole seem to taper and resemble the
Figure here exprest: Observing it with Telescopes (one
of which was fifteen foot, and the other six foot long)
I found the shape of it much like this, which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in the second Figure.</p>
            <p>It had a pretty bright Star (if I may so call it) near
the middle of the head, seeming much about the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of ♄ when near the Horizon, and was about 25
seconds in Diameter; as is represented by A, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
defined, but hazy; the cloudy part or beard of
the body encompassing it on all sides: but that part of
the <hi>Coma</hi> B, which was next towards the Sun, was the
narrowest: nor was this <hi>Coma</hi> well defined, but the
outward parts of it were fainter and fainter. However
they were regularly enough terminated to make the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardmost
bounds of it of a kind of Parabolical figure;
the most bent part of which was towards the Sun,
and most defined: And the bright Star of it was, as I
have expressed it about four of its Diameters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the said parabolical limb. The light parts of
the ambient Cloud seemed to spread gradually towards
that side of it, which was opposite to the Sun; but those
which were next the middle were the brightest: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
as they were farther and farther from the Star in
the head, the fainter and paler they were.</p>
            <p>I could not observe any representations like those
which are given us by Mr. <hi>Hevelius,</hi> in his Cometogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
neither in the Head, nor the Blaze, no more than
I could in those which appeared in the years 1664. and
1665. as may be easily taken notice of by comparing
these which I have delineated with those.</p>
            <p>The middle part of the Blaze CC, which ascended
from the Star in the middle, seemed the brightest, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40537:15"/>
of this <hi>medulla</hi> or stem, those parts were brightest which
were nearest situated to the said Star. The sides of it
grew fainter and fainter, as they were farther from the
head; and though they had brightness enough to make
them appear in a dark and clear sky, yet the dawning
quickly made them vanish, and disappear, as did any
haziness of the Sky: and according as the light increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
so was the Blaze diminished, after the order of
the tapering prickt lines exprest in the third Figure by
aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and even in a clear and
dark Sky, towards the farther end of the Blaze they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
disappeared for some short space of time, though
the middle or stem continued; and so it caused the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
appearance to resemble the figure of a very
slender birchen whisk or brush, much like that represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the first figure.</p>
            <p>The 22. from half an hour after two, till half an hour
after three, the North-east part of the Heavens to me
was cloudy, and the Sky between the Clouds was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy,
and the dawning struck much higher than the day
before, so that I could not find it.</p>
            <p>The 23. with several friends I observed it again, the
Sky being clear, and confirmed my self in all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
observations, taking again diligent notice of all
circumstances remarkable, both with my naked eye, and
with Perspective-glasses. And I had this morning a very
notable observation in order to measure the bigness of
the Star and its <hi>Coma</hi> which encompassed it, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with somewhat fixt: for some few minutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
three of the Clock the head of it past just behind
the type or top-post of a tower not far distant, and was
quite eclipsed by it; and as soon as it appeared to have
past it, seeming yet contiguous, I observed it with my
six foot Telescope, and found the Coma or whole head
to appear full as big as the said type or timber post, and
the <hi>Nucleus</hi> or Star in the middle of it, to be very near
of the same bigness of the iron spindle, upon which the
weather-cock was fixt. Whence upon examining the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40537:15"/>
bigness of the said parts, since by an accurate Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I judge the head or Coma was about 4 ⅙ minutes
in Diameter, and the <hi>Nucleus</hi> or Star about 25 seconds.
I took notice this morning that it had much altered the
position in the Heavens, which it had upon Saturday
morning, and that the Blaze of it was very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
out of the line it appeared in the last time. And
with a small crossstaff, taking the distance of it from
<hi>Alamak,</hi> and from <hi>Genib,</hi> in the left side of <hi>Perseus.</hi> I
judged it to be in the mid-way between the Flower-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce
aforesaid, and <hi>Algol,</hi> or the head of <hi>Medusa,</hi> that
is, about 14 degrees of ♉, and 17 degrees of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Latitude: so that I judged its motion almost East,
but a little deflecting South. I was not much solicitous
of making observations of its true place, as not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
my present enquiry to be for what kind of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it had, conceiving its motion to be towards the Sun,
and so of very little duration: and expecting to hear
an account of that from other places, and persons that
were better furnished with Instruments and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for observations of that kind than I was then.</p>
            <p>The Blaze extended it self in a right line towards the
Star in the right thigh of <hi>Cassiopea,</hi> being a Star of the
third magnitude. Its length at first was about 7 or 8
degrees, and did sometimes seem longer, sometimes
shorter, as I noted before, without seeming to have any
other motion in it but the Diurnal motion, the same with
the fixt Stars on Earth. Whence I collected, that the
head of it pointed towards the seventeenth degree of
<hi>Taurus</hi> in the Ecliptick, though the Sun at that time
was about the thirteenth degree of the same Sign.</p>
            <p>The 24. with several others, I attended the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it, but the Sky in that part of the Heavens was
over-cast with Clouds.</p>
            <p>The 25. I expected to have a farther Observation of
it from half an hour after two, till a quarter after four;
but notwithstanding the South-easterly wind, and the
clarifying quality of the air, which before half an hour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40537:16"/>
after three had partly carried off, and partly dissolved
the black thick Clouds (with which the North-east
parts of this Horizon was over-cast about three of the
Clock) and left that part of the Heavens where the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
should have appeared clear, and without Clouds.
Yet the air being very high and heavy, as the Barome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shewed, the upper parts of it were so filled with the
dawning light of the morning, that neither the Blaze
head or Star of the Comet appeared to me in the least:
nor had I any sight of it since.</p>
            <p>The like appearance of the great height of vapors in
the air, when it is very heavy, I have often taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, and have observed, that the twy-light and
dawning between the night, and appearing of the Sun
is very much altered thereby. And that a heavy air,
when the vapors are raised high, will make the length
of them much greater, and consequently the night short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
And a light air, on the contrary, shortning them,
doth lengthen the night.</p>
            <p>These were the most remarkable circumstances I took
notice of in this Comet, being altogether Physical, and
designed only for enquirng into the constitution of these
wonderfull bodies: the accounts and opinions we have
hitherto had of them of that kind, being very unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.
Though other Observations, to wit, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
of the way, celerity, and magnitude of Comets
have been prosecuted with very much care, and great
skill; such as those of the noble <hi>Tycho,</hi> and the learned
and diligent <hi>Hevelius,</hi> insomuch that I could not expect
to have better; yet as to Physical remarks, I wanted
much information to be able to satisfie many difficulties
that occurr'd to my thoughts, upon enquiry into the
particular natures of them. I did therefore, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
employ all the time I could get of observing this
Comet, in taking notice of such circumstances as I
judged would be pertinent to resolve any of those Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
I had formerly made, in order to find out the nature
of Comets in general. And though the little oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40537:16"/>
I now had, and the disadvantageous appearance
of this last were very short of giving me that satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in many particulars which I wish'd for, and expected at
first, yet since they may possibly serve for hints to others
that may hereafter have better oportunity than I, and
that I might understand what material objections could
be made by observers from preceding Comets, and that
they might for the future more diligently take notice
of what from these queries and hints may be judged sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
to this design, such as they are I have here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
as I had done formerly by my Lectures in <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi>-Colledge,
those which I had made of those in 1664.
and 1665.</p>
            <p>Now before I come to make reflexions upon these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
I thought it might not be improper to add some
few of those things concerning those two former Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
observed by me in the said years. I say, some few,
because it would be needless to set down all, especially
such of mine as do agree with others since published.
I did therefore soon after I had seen the first Comet, to
wit, <hi>December</hi> 23. 1664. propound to my self certain
Queries necessary to be answered, in order to find out
a true theory of them, and directed my Observations
accordingly; and they were these.</p>
            <p>Of what substance its body, beard, and blaze is? and
next, of what magnitude each of those parts appear,
and of what real magnitude they are?</p>
            <p>Other Queries were concerning its density and rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
its mutability or immutability; that is, whether it
dissolved and wasted or not? whether it were fluid or
solid? whether it participated of gravity or levity?</p>
            <p>Whence it had its light, colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was the figure of the Star, Radiation, Blaze, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the Blaze were always opposite to the Sun,
or deflected? whether straight or bended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What kind of motion it was carried with? whether
in a straight or bended line? and if bended, whether
in a circular or other curve, as elliptical or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40537:17"/>
line, whether the convex or concave side of
that curve were turned towards the earth? Whether in
any of those lines it moved equal or unequal spaces in
equal times?</p>
            <p>Through what parts of the universe it moved, and
how far distant it was at several times? Whether in the
lower Regions near the Earth in the Atmosphere, or
near it, or in the Heavens, or fluid Aether, with which
the space of the Heavens is filled? Whether above or
below the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it wasts, and is dispersed and consumed? or
whether it lasts and endures for a longer time? If it
lasts, Whether it ever appears again, being moved in
a circle; or be carried clear away, and never appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
being moved in a straight or paraboloeidical line?
Whether it be collected or generated when it first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears?
and dissipated or destroyed when it disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;
or whether the several distances of it do not
make that appearance?</p>
            <p>Whether it may not have some such propriety, as the
Star in <hi>Cete,</hi> whereby it may shine and appear for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
period, and again lose its light, and disappear
by several vicissitudes? and whether that may not
give some account of the appearance of so many Comets
about <hi>Aries?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, As concerning the matter or substance of the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleus</hi>
Star or body, of the hazy shining part encompassing
it, and of the Tail or Blaze: I say, that by comparing
all the circumstances that I was able to take notice of
from the beginning to the end, I found that the Star in
the head was of a very compacted and dense light, and
almost equalled that of <hi>Saturn;</hi> though it were not like
that confined by an equal limb: that there were some
parts distinguishable in this body, some having a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
others a fainter light. That these parts did not
continue the same, but considerably varied, which might
in part be caused by the differing position of those parts
which were seen before, from the same seen afterwards,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40537:17"/>
in respect of the eye, situate on the surface of the
Earth, moved one way, and the Comet moved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
though I do not conceive it wholly ascribable to
that, but partly also to a real alteration of the parts of
the Comet. That I did very diligently watch to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
if it were possible, when it pass'd over any fix'd
Star to find whether it were transparent; as I had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times observed the tail of it to be even in its
brightest parts, but I had not the opportunity; but that
I did several times observe the tail of it transparent, not
only with the naked eye, but through a Telescope: if
at least the fixed Stars be above it, which I think few
doubt, that the light diminish'd by degrees towards
the extremes of the hazy part encompassing it; and yet
the extremes of it as to that part of it which respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the Sun, seemed pretty evenly and smoothly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
especially through a Telescope: From all which
remarks, and from the velocity of its motion, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
it to be made up of solid matter, not fluid; that
the body of it especially, is considerably dense, but
that the haziness or <hi>Coma</hi> about it is much more rarified,
and the tail thereof is most of all. That this body is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
with a body most fluid, and easily permea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and which doth with very little resistance give
way to the motion of it, or any other body through it,
that it doth easily admit at least (if not actually take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it self) the parts of this body, <hi>Coma,</hi> and Blaze. I
say, admit at least, (though there may be many reasons
alledged that it doth actually prey upon, and dissolve
those parts into it self, as I shall shew by and by) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that we find that the extreme parts do extend but
to such a distance, and beyond that there is no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of light, and that the light is from it self, and
not produced by refraction or reflexion of the beams of
the Sun, I shall shew reasons by and by. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where there is most light appears, there are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
number, and there is the greatest density of the
Cometical parts. The middle of the body may be as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40537:18"/>
dense as the body of the earth; and I have not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my self, nor met with any body else that hath taken
notice of any thing to the contrary: If I could have
seen any Comet to have covered any Star in its way, it
would have afforded a very circumstantial information,
especially if for this purpose it had been taken notice
of with a good Telescope. What the density of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost
parts of this Earth we live on is, none knows;
for though we find the parts on which we tread to be
very compact, and though by the industry of Miners it
hath been proved so also to the depth of many hundred
foot, as <hi>Georgius Agrieola</hi> relates: and though it hath
been found so even to a greater depth by the soundings
of the bottom of the Sea, yet none can bring an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
proof that the same is so solid to 25 miles deep;
much less that it is so to the center: if therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
shell of this Globe were broken, and removed,
'tis not impossible but that the middle parts thereof
may be of the same nature with the middle parts of the
Comets body; and that those parts (were the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
parts or shell removed) might, like these of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
expand themselves into the encompassing Aether.
Nay we find, that notwithstanding the compacted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the superficial parts of this Earth, yet the Aether
is able to take up into it self vast quantities of them, and
to keep them suspended, some of them, even to the
height of many miles, if any argument may be drawn
from the height or length of the dawning o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi>
and this, notwithstanding the attraction of the
Earth in its perfect vigor, or the gravitation of these
parts thus taken up, or their endeavour towards the
center of the Earth. How much more freely then
might we imagine the encompassing Aether to prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and take up into it self the internal parts, if they
were of a loose and pervious texture, and almost in a
state of fluidity, like a heap of Sand, or a vessel of Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baster-dust
in boyling, and were not so firmly united by
the bonds of gravity, and the <hi>vinculum</hi> of petrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40537:18"/>
as we find the superficial parts of the earth now
are. There is one argument to prove to us, that there may
be such a looseneſs of the internal parts of the earth, and
that is that the magnetical virtue varies, which virtue
without controversie diffused through the whole body
of the Earth, and which hath a relation to the whole
Globe, and to every magnetical part ther<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>of. For by
observation 'tis found, that the magnetical virtue, acts
upon a needle without it, as the magnetical virtue of
a round Loadstone doth on a Needle applied without
that, which, as I may elsewhere shew, hath a respect to
the center of the stone differing from all the respects
that Authors have hitherto ascribed to it, even of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
Kepler, Kircher, Descartes,</hi> and our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Mr. <hi>Bond,</hi> who I think was the first man that
endeavoured to reduce the variations observed by
<hi>Wright, Gellibrand, Coster,</hi> &amp;c. into a Theory and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Now this magnetical virtue, (which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
one emanation of the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> as gravity may
be called another) being diffused through every part of
it, and seeming to be, as it were <hi>Tota in toto &amp;
tota in qualibet parte,</hi> and to be more spiritual, and
to act more according to Magical and Mystical Laws
than Light, Sound, or the like, it giving to every mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical
body, and every piece of it, though infinitely
divided, the same proprieties it hath it self; This
magnetical virtue, I say, having such a relation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced thus to vary, 'tis very probable that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
parts to which it hath a respect, have a variation
likewise; and consequently, that these internal parts
which are supposed generally very dense, compact, and
very closely and solidly united, may be notwithstanding
more loose, and ununited, and movable from certain
causes.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore, I say, that it seems very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to me, that the body of Comets may be of the same
nature and constitution with that of the internal parts
of the Earth, that these parts may, by the help of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40537:19"/>
Aether, be so agitated and blended together, as to make
them work upon, and dissolve each other in the same
manner, as we have often had examples of some of
the parts of the Earth; a late instance of which was at
<hi>Mongibel</hi> or <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the Fire continued
for a long time, and produced very considerable effects.
That this internal agitation may confound the gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
principle, and so leave the parts in a greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be dissolved by the encompassing Aether, which
is the agent that sets the other two at work to destroy
each other, that it may at length prey upon both, and
dissolve them both into it self; and consequently, not
only the parts thus dissolved are elevated to a greater
distance from the center of the Star or <hi>Nucleus,</hi> or the
superficies of it, whose gravitating or attractive princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is much destroyed, the <hi>Coma</hi> being in this Comet
four or five Diameters of the Star or <hi>Nucleus:</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given those parts leave thus far to ramble, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitating
principle of another body more potent acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and makes those parts seem to recede from
the center thereof, though really they are but as it
were, left behind the body of the Star, which is more
powerfully attracted than the minuter steaming parts:
for, I suppose the gravitating power of the Sun in the
center of this part of the Heaven in which we are, hath
an attractive power upon all the bodies of the Planets,
and of the Earth that move about it, and that each of
those again have a respect answerable, whereby they
may be said to attract the Sun in the same manner as the
Load-stone hath to Iron, and the Iron hath to the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.
I conceive also that this attractive virtue may act
likewise upon several other bodies that come within the
center of its sphere of activity, though 'tis not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
also but that as on some bodies it may have no effect
at all, no more than the Load-stone which acts on Iron,
hath upon a bar of Tin, Lead, Glass, Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so on
other bodies, it may have a clean contrary effect, that
is, of protrusion, thrusting off, or driving away, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40537:19"/>
we find one Pole of the Magnet doth the end of a
Needle touched on the opposite part; whence it is, I
conceive, that the parts of the body of this Comet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confounded or jumbled, as 'twere together, and
so the gravitating principle destroyed) become of
other natures than they were before, and so the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
may cease to maintain its place in the Universe,
where first it was placed. Whence instead of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to move round some central body, whether Sun or
Planet, as it did whilst it maintained it self entire, and
so had its magnetical quality (as I may so call it) uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
it now leaves that circular way and by its
motion (which always tends to a straight line, and
would be so were it not bended into a curve by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
virtue of the central body) it flies away from
its former center by the Tangent line to the last place,
where it was before this confusion was caused in the
body of it. In this line ('tis probable) it passes from
one part of the Heavens to another, and so passes
through the spheres of the activity of multitudes of
central bodies; in the passing through which spheres,
'tis not improbable that those parts which by their disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
are made of a nature differing from the body in
the center, are rather expelled from, than attracted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it; and so being by this dissolution rarified, and
loosened from the middle, and by their acting upon one
another, and dissolution of the Aether made of another
nature, after they have every way dispersed themselves
to a considerable distance from their proper body, are
converted and driven in a way almost opposite to that
expelling body, and so continue to be driven away
to such a vast distance, as to make out that prodigious
length of the tail or Blaze of some Comets (such as
was that of 1618. which, as <hi>Kepler</hi> reports, was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to 70 degrees from the body or head of it) till at
last they are dissolved also, and commixed with the
Aether within them. So that though I suppose the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
power of the Sun, or other central body may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40537:20"/>
draw the body towards it, and so bend the motion of
the Comet from the streight line, in which it tends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a kind of curve, whose concave part is towards the
Sun, by reason that there are some central parts of it,
which are not yet destroyed, and so retain somewhat of
its gravitating principle: yet I conceive that all those
parts of the Comet which are thus wrought upon by
the other, and changed into another state, and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much rarified, and produce light, are of a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
nature, and recede from the center of the Sun:
much after the same manner as we find any combustible
body with us; as Coal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where we find that the
body of the Coal, before it be resolv'd into smoke, is
a very dense, and very heavy body, and tends to the
center of the earth; but the parts thereof agitated by
the Air and Aether into steams and smoke, and those yet
farther dissolved into flame, do tend upwards, and from
the center of the earth. Now though one cause of
the recess of flame from the center of the Earth be
the gravity of the ambient Air. Yet 'tis not impossible,
but that there may be somewhat also of positive levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conjoyned therewith. Most certain it is, that there
must be a tendency of receding, as well as a tendency
of approaching the center of the Earth, and other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
body. And there may be much said for the
supposition, that the recess of the purest Aether, from
the center, is the cause of the motion of the grosser
Aether, and of all other bodies towards it, though
there are also very considerable arguments against
it. But this discourse is not my present business, though
it may hereafter be the subject of a Lecture in this place;
for upon it do depend some of the greatest operations
in the universe. And as in the History of the Creation,
we have an account of the production of light, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the making of matter, which is a motion
of recess from the center of the shining body. Next
that, a Firmament which divided between the waters or
the fluids of the one, and the fluids of another part of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40537:20"/>
the world. And in the third place, the collections of
particular fluids to one center, as the center of the
Earth: and lastly, out of that collection of fluids ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
the dry and solid land. So I conceive the most
proper way of speculating on these great productions
of the omnipotent Creator, may be to begin with the
consideration of light, or the motion of recess from the
center of a body. Next, with the consideration of
the cause of the separating of fluid from fluid, as Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Aether, as I may so call differing Aethers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have not yet distinct names in use, and the
reason of their conglobation, the Aether from the Air,
the Air from the Water, the Water from Quicksilver,
Oyl, or other fluid. Thirdly, the cause of the conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
property of each of these fluids when separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
how they accept and embrace <hi>Homogenea,</hi> and
reject or expel <hi>Heterogenea.</hi> And fourthly, how they
condense and settle together, and produce a solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
whence proceeds the confirmation of attraction or
gravitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to digress no further, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this part of enquiry in short, I suppose the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleus</hi>
or Star of the Comet may be much of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the central parts of the Earth, Moon, <hi>Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn,</hi> or other Planets, but much impaired
in its attractive or gravitating power.</p>
            <p>Next, that the <hi>Coma</hi> or Hazy Cloud about it, may be
of the nature of the Atmosphere or Air about the Earth,
or the Smoke or steams about a heated or burning body,
before they are quite kindled, converted into Flame, or
dissolved into the ambient Air.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Tail or Blaze is much of the nature
of the parts of Flame, though with those differences I
conceive, that the parts of these steams are not so close
together, as are those of Smoke: nor doth the motion
of them, though much swifter upwards than that of our
Flame, serve to make them appear a shining line; but
being at that distance, they appear much slower to the
eye, and so discontinue the appearance; whence every
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40537:21"/>
shining particle appears only a shining point, though in
the parts of flame (where notwithstanding the motion
be much flower, yet being nearer, and so varying the
position to the eye much quicker) each of the shining
parts makes an appearance of a line of light, and all of
them passing pretty near together, make the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a continued fluid flame; though that indeed
be nothing but a great number of single parcels of the
burning body, raised up in the particles of Smoke.
This will appear evident if we consider the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
easily to be taken notice of in light: for 'tis obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
from multitudes of experiments, that any shining
body, as a candle or brands end, being moved very
quick, makes the same impression on the eye, that a line
of light doth standing still: And as obvious also that
any very light body incompassed with a dark <hi>medium</hi>
appears to the eye under an angle bigger than really it
is, and a dark body encompassed with a light <hi>medium</hi>
much less. This any one may presently find, if he make
a small hole through a thin plate of metal, and holding
it first between the light and the eye, and so seeing the
light appear through it, and then placing it so as there
is nothing but darkness appears through the said hole,
for he will plainly perceive that the same hole will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
much bigger in the former position than in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Upon this account indeed each of the shining
parts of the Comet seems to fill and occupy a much
greater space than really it doth: and so, as 'tis obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in the milky way, a great number of these small
shining bodies though dispersed at a pretty distance one
from another, yet by reason of the imperceptibleness of
each of them they all seem to coalesce into a stream or
Blaze of light, the brightness of which is yet farther
augmented by a clear and unenlightened air, and by
such a part of the Heaven wherein there appears fewest
of the Stars, whether they be greater or lesser.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40537:21"/>
To the Query, <hi>Of what magnitude the Body,</hi> Coma, <hi>and
Blaze of Comets may be?</hi> No answer can be given until an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
question be first answered; and that is, <hi>What is the
place of Comets, and what is their distance from the Earth?</hi>
It was the opinion of most Modern Writers before
<hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> (I know divers of the Antients
thought otherwise) that Comets were sublunary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,
drawn up into the higher Regions of the Air,
and there set on fire, and so continued burning till the
Meteor were consumed; and as the matter increased,
or wasted, so did the appearance of the Comet. But
this noble <hi>Dane,</hi> and several others about that time
found by accurate observations made, that its Parallax
was less than that of the Moon; and consequently,
that it was farther distant from the earth: that it must
be a body of another magnitude, and nature, than most
before that time had imagined; and therefore that it
ought to be otherwise thought of than the generality
of mankind believed concerning it. Many had been
the attempts of former Writers concerning them, to
find out their parallax; and whether from their unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
instruments, or from their less skill and diligence
in using them, or from an imagination of the solidity,
and impenetrability of the Coelestial Orbs, or from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in their calculations, or from comparing Observations
made at distant places, one or both whereof were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate,
or from a prepossession of Tradition or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame, or from what other cause soever it were is
uncertain; but 'twas generally concluded by them,
that all Comets were sublunary Meteors: and there
are not even at this day wanting some of the same
opinion, though for what reason I know not. 'Twill be
hard to convince some of these, that the opinion they
have hitherto received for good, is not so, because they
will hardly give themselves the trouble of examining
strictly into the matter: And to understand the nature
of Parallaxes, and how significant they are in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the distances of bodies from the surface of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40537:22"/>
Earth, to certain degrees thereof; beyond which, by
reason of the imperfections in Instruments, and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
and the exceeding niceness and curiosity neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
they signifie very little. It is not my present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to explain what Parallax is, that I would suppose
my Reader to understand; otherwise there can be no
reason shewn him to convince him that 'tis possible to
prove that this or that Comet was not nearer than so
many semidiameters of the Earth, nor farther off than
so many. There are then two ways, by which we may
come to some certainty of what distance a Comet is; and
those are, first the Parallax of its Diurnal motion, or its
Parallax caused by the Diurnal motion of the Earth. And
secondly, the Parallax of its proper motion compared
with the Periodick or Annual motion of the Earth. The
first of these may be observed two ways; either by two
Observers at parts of the Earth very far distant from
each other, but as near as may be under the same Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:
as suppose the one in <hi>London,</hi> the other in St. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens;</hi>
both conspiring in their observing of the place
of the Comet amongst the fix'd Stars at the same time.
Or secondly, by one Observer in the same place, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the place of it amongst the fix'd Stars, in its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or setting, and in a greater, or if it may be, its
greatest height: The noble <hi>Tycho</hi> by very accurate
Observation of the Parallax, proves the Comet
of 1577. to be above the Moon. <hi>Kepler</hi> by his
own Observations proves that of 1607. at its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to be four times farther distant; and I doubt not but
some may have been above forty times farther. But I do
not yet find that any Observations have accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
that which is indeed the great help by which
we are inabled to judge of the nature, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accidents and proprieties of Comets. The <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian</hi>
Philosophy for a long time prevailing, made the
world believe them to be nothing but Exhalations from
the Earth, drawn up into the higher Regions of the Air.
But <hi>Tycho</hi> by his Observations of their Parallax, raises
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40537:22"/>
them out of that confinement, but yet he seems to place
them in an Orb about the Sun. But <hi>Kepler</hi> frees them
from that confinement, and assigns them the Universe
to expatiate in. But none of all these do accurately
prove the true distance of them, their Parallax being
for the most part so very small, that I fear Instruments
with common lights will hardly reach them. But we
must expect from future observations made with Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopical
Instruments to receive a certain Answer to this
Query. Certain I am, that the Comet which began
to appear in <hi>November</hi> 1664. and disappear'd in <hi>March</hi>
following, was far removed beyond the distance assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Kepler.</hi> For by my own Observations divers
times repeated, I could not find any sensible Parallax,
though I endeavoured by a new method to make my
Observations more accurate. Now though I had not
the convenience of making use of a Quadrant, or any
such Instrument, to observe its place when near the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
yet the way I took, would, I think, be as good;
which was this: With a very good six foot Perspective-glass
or Telescope, I observed the place of the Comet,
in respect of the adjacent small Stars, as soon as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and so traced its way till it disappeared in the
vapors of the Horizon: the like I did several other
days successively, taking notice by what degrees, in
what times it made its progress, to see whether by its
Parallax, when near the Horizon, it would have been
deprest below that line of its motion, which it kept,
when at a greater height above it. But though I tried
this several times, yet I was not able to discern that the
Parallax of it caused either any sensible bending of the
line, or any sensible inequality in its progress, by which I
should have sooner found it, than by taking its altitudes
with common Instruments: though I confess these Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
were made when the motion of the Comet was
slow, and consequently, when in probability it was
far distant from the earth. To me there seems no doubt
but that it was a long way removed above the Moon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40537:23"/>
when I made these Observations: for had it been of an
equal distance with that they allow the Moon, it must
this way have manifested a very sensible Parallax of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
minutes: but whereas I could not certainly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
any sensible at all, it must be many times higher
than the Moon. Now that this way is abundantly to
be preferred before an Observation made with a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant
for the taking of its altitude, is pretty evident;
because, by this means the greatest part of the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
caused by the refraction or inflection of the Air
is removed; for by this means, though the Parallax be
very large, yet the refraction or inflection of the Air
will not amount to many seconds, both the objects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almost equally raised by refraction, especially when
5 or 10 degrees high; nearer than which the small Stars
vanished out of sight by the thickness of our air. It
follows therefore that a Semidiameter of the Earth
must be a very inconsiderable measure in its distance.</p>
            <p>This part therefore of the Theory of Comets hath
been much defective hitherto. If we enquire the
Parallax of them from the Observation of divers men
made in differing places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall find them so differing
one from another, that there is great reason to suspect
them all: Nay, not only so, but in this Comet of 1664.
by comparing two Tables or Charts of the Stars, and
Constellations of that part of the Heavens, through
which the Comet past, on which was also markt out
its way and place from day to day, both of them Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Copper Plates, I find that strange errors and
mistakes may be created, notwithstanding all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
care and accurateness possible, from the carelesness
or neglect of the Graver: This I noted in the two
Tables of the learned and accurate Mathematician,
<hi>P. Aegidius Franciscus de Gotignies,</hi> (whose skill and
care from other works of his and other Observations of
this Comet I am sufficiently assured of) and found
that by the first table upon the 21/31 of <hi>December,</hi> 1664. it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40537:23"/>
was in 4½ of ♊ in Longitude, and in 33⅔ of Southern
Latitude; but by the second it is placed at the same
time in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> ♊ for its Longitude, and in 34½ of South La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
And this error is not only committed in the
place of the Comet, but also in the place of the fix'd
Stars: for <hi>Riget</hi> in the first Table is placed in 30¾ South
Latitude, and in 12¼ ♊ for Longitude, but in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in 31½ South Latitude, and in 11½ ♊ for Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
both which differ considerably from the place
of it assigned by <hi>Riccioli</hi> and <hi>Grimaldi;</hi> according to
whose Observations it should be in 31. 11′ South La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and 12°. 11′. 40″. ♊ in Longitude.</p>
            <p>Now if there be these differences to be remarked in
the Observations of one, we cannot but expect that
much more disagreement should be found between
those which have been made by differing persons in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
places, and with differing ways, and differing
Instruments. And upon examination I have found it no
better: for from comparing such Observations as I
have received from several parts of the world, even of
those which have seemed more than ordinarily exact, I
find them for the most part so unaccurate, that though
they sufficiently manifest that the Comet of 1664.
which lasted above four months, was visible in most
parts of the world, and seen to pass in all those places
pretty near in the same way amongst the fixed Stars.
Yet they are so far from manifesting the Parallax, that
some of them make the place of the Comet to be quite
contrary to what Parallax would make it; some of the
Southern Observators placing it much more South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
than those of the North. Others indeed of
them make the Parallax so great, that one might ghess
it to be not so far removed from the Earth. Something
indeed in the general might be ghest of the way of that
Comet amongst the fix'd Stars, especially when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
them pretty near: but for exactness of Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Parallax, they were no way useful. And even
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40537:24"/>
in the former use too it seems very doubtful for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Charts of the Comets way amongst the fix'd
Stars published by that diligent and unwearied Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Mr. <hi>Hevelius</hi> of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> the above-mentioned
<hi>P. Gottigies,</hi> Professor at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Petit</hi>
of <hi>Paris,</hi> I find, that the two former make the way of
the Comet to lie below the Star in the Bill of <hi>Corvus;</hi>
whereas the later, though in a Latitude interposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the parallels of the former, makes it to lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
or to the North of it: and with him agree some
Observations which I have seen of Monsieur <hi>Hugenius.</hi>
Other disserences I found between those Tables in the
way of the Comet of 64. near the middle of its arch;
wherein Monsieur <hi>Hevelius</hi> all the way places it more
Southward than either Monsieur <hi>Petit,</hi> or <hi>P. Gottig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:</hi>
for whereas both <hi>P. Gottignies,</hi> and Mounsieur
<hi>Petit</hi> make it pass above the Star of the third magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in the right shoulder of <hi>Lepus,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Heve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
makes it move below it, which seem to be ascribable
to Parallax. But I fear much cannot be concluded of
certainty from them.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble the Reader with a multitude of
other Histories, which I have received concerning that
Comet of 64. nor with the disagreements of them one
with another, and perhaps of most with the truth.
They have given me sufficient trouble in the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, having little other benefit from them, save
only this, that I was thereby informed what a man
might think of a great number of Astronomical Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
that have been made: for, saving the exact Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of some few such, as Mr. <hi>Hevelius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aurout,
P. Gottingnies, &amp;c.</hi> truly diligent and accurate men,
the greater the Collections of Observations are, the
more trouble and difficulty is created to the Examiner;
they not only confounding one another, but perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those also which are real and perfect.</p>
            <p>Now the reasons or causes of these inconveniences
seem to be these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40537:24"/>
First, the want of accurate and knowing Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The scarcity of convenient Instruments.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Imperfection of the Tables of the fix'd
Stars.</p>
            <p>For the Observators, 'tis not enough to know how
to manage an instrument, or to have a good eye, or a
dextrous and steady hand; but with these there must
be joyned a skilfulness in the theorical and speculative
part, and add to all a love and delight in the thing it
self; and even all these will signifie but little, without
convenient and accurate Instruments, such as may be
easily manageable and sufficiently exact.</p>
            <p>The first of these the love of the study being in it
self the most excellent, or the encouragement of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Noblemen, and other Patrons of this Learning
must procure: and where both of these concur, thence
most is to be expected, and most fruit hath hitherto
been proceeded; though there are not wanting divers
eminent instances where the first reason hath been the
only inducement.</p>
            <p>As to the second, I have already in some of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Lectures described several convenient ones for
these purposes; and therefore I shall not here add any
more concerning it.</p>
            <p>But as to the third, I hope the indefatigable labour
and skill of Monsieur <hi>Hevelius</hi> will shortly supply the
present defect, though it had been much to be wish'd,
that the Instruments he had made use of had been fitted
with Telescopical sights. These Tables, if well done,
will alone (as to the business of Comets at least) supply
the place of all other Instruments almost, save only a
thread, especially if they be so delineated in Tables af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Tangent projection, as that the minutes of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
degree may be very distinguishable, which will not
swell the Maps of the Heavens into an extraordinary
large volume, and may possibly be the cheapest Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for this purpose an Astronomer can be furnished
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40537:25"/>
withal; for having such a volume of Tables, it will be
very easie with a thread and one's eye, screen'd only
with a spectacle made of a thin plate of Brass, with a
small hole through it, instead of a glass, to observe what
place the Comet possesseth amongst the fixt Stars: for
having by the help of the said thread observed what
two Stars lie in the same line with the Comet on one
side of it, and what other two Stars lie in a line with
it, which is at right angles (as near as may be) with the
former line, by finding out those four Stars in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
ordered according to the Tangent projection,
and with a Ruler, drawing lines over them respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where those lines do intersect, there will be the true
place of the Comet, from which it will not be difficult
to find out the true Longitude and Latitude of it by a
Sector with Tangents. Now as these Tables of all the
fixt Stars visible to the naked eye, would serve for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its place whilst very big and swift of motion; so the
like Tables of the small Telescopical Stars that lie near
its way, when almost disappearing, and moving very
slow, will by the help of a pair of measuring Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
placed within the eye-glass of the Telescope, and a
straight line or hair drawn cross it, serve to find the true
motion and way of it, when only visible with a Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope:
according to which method I made the annexed
Schemes, and Observations of the last appearances of
the Comet.</p>
            <p>Now since neither from my own, nor from any other
Observations that I have hitherto met with, there can
be any certain conclusion drawn of the distance of these
Comets, save only this, that their distance was very
great, and much higher than the body of the Moon,
because else there must have been a considerable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallax
caused by the Diurnal motion. The next enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
will be, what other ways there are of knowing its
distance. Now though none could be more demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
than the Parallax found this way by the Diurnal
motion, yet there are some other which seem more easie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40537:25"/>
arising from the consideration of the motions that may
be thought to be concern'd in the producing the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.
And though they be wholly hypothetical, and
so need some other arguments to prove the ground and
principles on which they are founded, yet since there
are not very many considerable ones wanting to
make them probable and rational, I shall here add
somewhat of my inquiries after the distance, position,
motion, magnitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of these Comets by these
means.</p>
            <p>Of these ways there are several depending upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
suppositions which produce very differing effects,
as to the magnitude, distance, motion, and way of the
same Comet.</p>
            <p>The suppositions are these:</p>
            <p>Either that the Earth moves in an annual orb about
the Sun, as the Sun is supposed by others to move
about the Earth: Or that the Earth is perfectly fix'd,
and hath no such motion.</p>
            <p>Next, that the Comet moves either in a straight line<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or in a curve line; and the curve is either a circle, or
some other regular or irregular curve.</p>
            <p>Further that the motion of the Comets in these lines
is either by equal or unequal spaces in equal times.</p>
            <p>Now according as we take this, or those of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
suppositions, and compound them together, so
will the product of them be strangely differing. Amongst
the great variety of compositions of these principles or
suppositions, these seem the most simple, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
being any otherwise proved, will best deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the true distance and way of the Comet.</p>
            <p>First, To suppose the Earth to stand still, and the
Comet to move equal spaces in equal times in a circle.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To suppose the Earth to move in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Orb about the Sun, and the Comet to move
through the Aether or <hi>Expansum,</hi> equal spaces in equal
times in a straight line.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To suppose the Earth to move (as above)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40537:26"/>
in its annual Orb, and the Comet also to move equal
spaces in equal lines in a circle.</p>
            <p>The other are indeterminate and infinite, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be concluded from them as to the distance,
magnitude, motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Comets; for the line or
way of the Comet may be placed at any distance, if we
will suppose it moved in an uncertain curve, with une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
degrees of velocity: And indeed, upon a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of an inequality of motion, nothing of its way or
distance can by any of these suppositions be found out.
This fault had that of <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> where he supposed
an unequal motion of it in its Orb about the Orb of
<hi>Venus,</hi> which was founded upon the first Hypothesis,
but had introduced into it some inequality of motion;
besides his own supposition, that it was moved about
the Sun, and the Sun about the Earth. See the fifth
Figure. <hi>Keplers</hi> way, which was after the second
Hypothesis, had the same fault; for he supposed the
annual motion of the Earth, and the motion of the
Comet in a straight line, but introduces an accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of motion in the Tangent towards the latter
end.</p>
            <p>The third way I have here taken, and from the best
observation I could meet with, I have delineated its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
or angles to the Sun: and accordingly supposing
it to move equal spaces in equal times, in a curve which
for so much of it as the Comet was observed to pass
was very near a Circle, I found this Circle would fall as
it is express'd in the seventh Figure, where 'tis obvious
to take notice, that when the Comet was nearest to
the Earth, namely, about the 19. or 20. of <hi>December,</hi>
that it was not nearer than an eleventh part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Sun; that on the 23, it was twice as far,
that on the 29. it was four times as far; that on the 15.
of <hi>January</hi> it was as far as the Sun, and on the 14. of
<hi>February</hi> it was above twice as far distant as the Sun.
That this way or Orb of the Comet is here bended so
as (if it were an entire Circle;) one part of it would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40537:26"/>
go without the Orb of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as the other which is
here delincated comes within the Orb of the Earth;
that the plain of this Orb is inclined to the plain of the
Ecliptick about 18 degrees, that if from several parts
this Orb perpendiculars be let fall upon the Plain of the
Ecliptick, those perpendiculars shall fall in an Ellipsis,
part whereof shall fall within the Orb of the Earth in
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the opposite without the Orb of ♃ in ♒. That
the Comet moves a Sextant of this Orb in about 130
days, and consequently if its motion should continue
the same in such a Circle, it would appear about <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,
March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> 1667. but being so far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
towards the South Pole, will here hardly be seen:
but by those that live towards the South, it may appear
to have some such motion by the South Pole, as that
of 1618. had by the North. And 'tis not impossible,
but that the Comet of 1618. might be the same with
this, if we suppose the Nodes of it to have a motion
contrary to the order of Signs: and that the same Node
which in this Comet, according to this supposition was
in ♊, was then about ♍ or ♐: but these as conjectures
I shall not insist on, because neither in this, nor in that
have we Observations sufficiently accurate to build
any Theory upon. Now though upon these suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the motion and appearances of the Comet seem to
be very regularly, and very naturally made out, yet
'tis not the only Hypothesis for that design: nor do I
believe it so evident a demonstration for that end, as
some would suppose; though for other reasons I am
apt enough to think that opinion of the Earths motion
very probable: but the motion of this Comet is so well
made out, by the contrary supposition, that I think it
may be alledged for a greater argument against the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth, than for it: for if we only grant
one of the former <hi>postulata,</hi> namely, that the body of
the Comet is moved equal spaces in equal times, and a
quite contrary <hi>postulatum</hi> to the former; namely, that
the Earth remains fix'd as to an annual motion, we may
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40537:27"/>
find all the observations of this Comet, especially the
most accurate of them, to happen so, that the Comet
being supposed to be moved in a great Circle, whose
convex side is turned towards the Earth, whose center
is extended towards the fix'd <g ref="char:stella">✴</g> in ♋ and whose Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
is about sixscore times the nearest distance of
the Comet from the Earth, and the Comet be supposed
to be moved very near equal spaces in equal times,
we shall find, I say, all the appearances most exactly
solved, and indeed much more exactly than by the
other supposition I was able to find any; for by this
supposition both the magnitude, longitude, latitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradation,
station, and direction of the Comet is
most exactly made out as any one might have found
that should have by this means examined with me the
observations I have hitherto either made or met with:
and indeed all the Observations hitherto have so well
answered this Hypothesis, that I do almost promise my
self to be able to see this Comet a month or six weeks
hence, after the Sun has past by it; if by its exceeding
elongation it be not quite grown out of sight, as it is
now indeed already so exceeding dim, and faint, that it
cannot be seen without a very good glass, which will
endure an exceeding big aperture: nor could I these
two last nights perceive it, though the Air were clear;
but the reason I attribute to its nearness to a fixed
<g ref="char:stella">✴</g> of ♈: This Hypothesis is explained in the seventh
Figure. By this supposition the return of the Comet
will be much longer, and the time of seeing of it much
more uncertain; because the curvature is so little that
the making the circle a twentieth, or a sixteenth part
bigger or less, does not much alter the regularity;
whence 'tis exceeding difficult, unless we had much
more accurate Observations than I have hitherto met
with, to determine exactly the bigness of the circle,
and consequently the time of the return. And by this
supposition the Comet may be supposed either nearer
or farther from the Earth at any distance, which is not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40537:27"/>
contradicted by a Diurnal Parallax; that is, it may be
supposed either above <hi>Saturn,</hi> or below the Moon, or
in any place between; by supposing only, that
the farther the nearest part of the Circle is distant from
the Earth, the greater must that Circle be, and the
swifter the motion of the Comet in it: to prove which
affirmation, let in the Eighth figure A be the Earth, BCD
the Orb of the Comet supposed very near the Earth,
and EFG the Orb of it supposed at a greater distance:
let H be the center of BCD, and I of EFG, and let
AC, be to CH, as AF, to FI, all the lines drawn from
the point A, so as to cut the Circles BCD and EFG,
shall divide those Circles EFG, and BCD, into simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
segments: as let ABE be a line drawn cutting
those Circles in B and E: I say, the Arch BC shall be
similar to EF. In which Hypothesis if we have toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the place of the Comet when stationary, the
place of it when in its greatest celerity, perige, or the
places of it when of the same celerity on each side of
its perige, we have from thence the proportion of the
Radius of its Orb to the perigean distance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all the other distances, the line in which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
when stationary, being the Tangent to the Circle
in which it moves, as ABE, to which a Perpendicular
raised at BBE, and produced till it cut the line AC,
(produced) at HHI, it gives the Center of its Orb
HHI, and the proportions of the lines AB, AC, BH=HC,
or of AE, AF, EI=FI, the Angle BAC,
being given by observation. So that by this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
the Phaenomena of the motion and bigness of
the Comet will be solved, though supposed of any
distance. Nor are these the only Hypotheses by which
the hitherto observ'd Phaenomena may be solv'd: for if
we will admit an unequal motion, such as is now gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all the Planets: and if further we will admit it
to be moved in an Elleipsis, or other such like curve,
there may be divers other Hypotheses that will solve the
Phaenomena; so that the Comet may be supposed to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40537:28"/>
have no motion at all as to Longitude, but only as to
Latitude: that is, it may be supposed to be moved in
an Elleipsis, described in a plain which shall be at right
Angles with the plain of the Ecliptick, and the ways
of the Earth in it: it may be supposed also to have been
mov'd direct, according to the order of the signs, that
is, to have been first about <hi>Gemini,</hi> in respect of the Sun,
and to be now in some part of <hi>Leo:</hi> And it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to solve the phaenomena of its periodick or proper
motion, though it be supposed not so high as the Moon,
and that the motion of the Earth passing by it did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alter its motions, had there not been made some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
about the Parallax of it, which prove it
higher: so that according to this or that Hypothesis
which we take, the time of its return, if permanent,
will be longer or sooner.</p>
            <p>And these Hypotheses may be so various, that till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by very exact Observation of the Parallax, 'tis
not to be hoped that the appearance of a Comet can be
certainly predicted: So that I fear the prophetick say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Seneca, Erit qui demonstret aliquando in quibus
Cometae partibus errent, cur tam seducti à caeteris eant, quanti
qualesque sint,</hi> will hardly be verified at this time by the
help of this present Comet. Though in truth I cannot find
by the examination of several of them, but that they all
seem to promise very fairly a return of it: for all the
Calculations I have hitherto made of its motion, seem
to cast it into a circular, and not a into straight line, as
<hi>Kepler</hi> supposed; and indeed upon examining even
<hi>Keplers</hi> own Calculations of those Comets which he
observed, and has endeavoured to make to move in a
straight line, I cannot find that any of them will be
found to move equally in such a line: but to solve the
appearances, he is fain to make them move in such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
straight lines, by a line of Tangents, that is, to make
the motion of Comets accelerated the further they are
moved; all which Phaenomena may be very easily
solved by supposing them to have moved equal spaces
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40537:28"/>
in a curve or circle. The physical reason indeed seems
pretty difficult, by what means it should be confin'd
or bound so as to move in a Circle: but this is no more
than is usually supposed in all the Planets, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
supposing a kind of gravitation throughout the
whole Vortice or <hi>Coelum</hi> of the Sun, by which the
Planets are attracted, or have a tendency towards the
Sun, as terrestrial bodies have towards the center of
the Earth. I cannot imagin how their various moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
can with any satisfaction be imagined, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted (for which had I now time, I could alledg
many reasons, and may do it hereafter on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
not only the reason of all the irregular motion of
the Planets may be easily found, but the reason
also of the strange and various motions of the Comets.
The reason why its Beard is for the most part opposite
to the Sun, which was another Query, of which I
have already said somewhat of my suppositions, and
shall now add, that the brighter spot or kernel in the
middle did seem to be some kind of body, which
though it be not actually burnt, may yet by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassing
fluid Aether be dissolved and wasted, and
those dissolved parts may ascend upwards, or from the
center of the Sun, (which seems indeed to be the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of gravitation throughout the whole systeme of it.)
To illustrate which explication, I could produce seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
experiments which would make a perfect represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the phaenomena of the body, and beard of
the Comet: I shall only instance in one. Take a very
clear long Cylindrical Glass, which may hold about a
quart of water; fill it three quarters full with water,
and put into it a quarter of a pound of Oyl of Vitriol,
and in the midst of this suspend by a small silver wire,
a small wax-ball, rould in filings of iron or steel, and
you may plainly observe a perfect representation of the
Head, Halo, and Beard of the Comet; for the <hi>menstruum</hi>
falling on, or dissolving the iron, there is a continual erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of small bubbles, and dissolv'd particles from all the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40537:29"/>
sides of this body; and after the eruption they all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
upwards from the center of the earth; for being
of a much lighter consistence than the anbient liquor,
they are by the greater gravity of that, continually
protruded upwards. The same appearance may be
made with any kind of <hi>menstruum,</hi> and a convenient
dissoluble body suspended in it; so that if we suppose
the Aether to be somewhat analogous to a <hi>menstruum,</hi>
and that there is a gravitation towards the center of
the Sun, if the <hi>Nucleus</hi> or head of the Comet be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
such a dissoluble substance, the phaenomena of
the shape of the Comet may, I think, be rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.
Now that the Aether may have such a kind
of propriety, seems to me to be argued from this, that
the Air about the Earth seems to owe its original to it,
it being only a dissolution of terrestrial bodies into the
Aether, the Aether being the principal fluid body, and
greatest part of this dissolution; and the substance of the
Air, some very few and small saline and earthy particles:
of which elsewhere. By this Hypothesis the phaenomena
of the Comet may be solved; for hence 'tis easie to
deduce the reason why the Beard grows broader and
broader, and sainter and fainter towards the top: why
there is a Halo about the body; for this will appear
clearly in the experiment: why the Beard becomes a
little deflected from the body of the Sun; for if the
dissolving Ball be by the wire mov'd either this way or
that way, the arising stream or bubbles will bend the
contrary: and to countenance this supposition, both
in those Comets observed by <hi>Tycho, Kepler,</hi> and also in
this last the beard was contrary to the motion; so that
the head or body going faster, seemed to leave the
beard or tail somewhat behind: by this supposition also
'twill be easie to explicate why the beard is sometime
bended, and not straight, and why it is sometimes
brighter upon one side than upon another? why the
bottom of it is more round, and the other sides more
undefin'd; and divers of the like phaenomena. Against
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40537:29"/>
this supposition it seems difficult to conceive whence
so vast a body should be generated; next, how it
should be able to supply such a constant stream of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
parts, and yet last so long as this has done, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a quarter of a year. Thirdly, Whence such a
newly generated body should receive so great a degree
of motion. In answer to which, I say, 'tis not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but that the body of it may be as old as the world,
and that it may have then received its first determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or laws of motion, and may have ever since pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them, that it may have been all this time also in
dissolution, and yet not be quite wasted; and that it may
continue yet for many ages before it be quite dissolved
into the Aether. And to make this probable, divers
experiments and reasons might be alledged, as that of
the slowness of the wasting of many bodies, by the
dissolution made on them by the fire: the slowness also
of the dissolution of multitudes of bodies in <hi>menstruums.</hi>
And I have already shewn how small a quantity of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
particles will be able to make as great a shew of
light: besides that, the motion of the ascending stream
or beard being but slow, there needs no very quick
supply of other parts. We see also into what a vast
quantity of smoke a small parcel of a combustible body
may be turn'd. From all which particulars, 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
but that the Comet may be a body moved with
a regular circular or elliptical motion as the Planets
are, that it may be a body of such a constitution, as
that the fluid Aether through which it passes, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
it much after the manner as a <hi>menstruum;</hi> (such as
<hi>Aquafortis,</hi> Spirit of Niter, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> does a dissoluble body;
that by this means there may be a slow, but continual
eruption of somewhat opacous parts, which may by
their dissolution afford a sufficient quantity of light to
make as great an appearance as any of the Comets, that
this stream or beard may by the resistance of the Aether
be a little deflected backwards in the same manner as an
ascending stream of smoke will be by the resistance of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40537:30"/>
the Air, if the burning body be mov'd this or that way
through it, that the body of the Comet may be both as
ancient and as lasting as the world; and that this which
has lately appeared may have appeared heretofore, and
may likewise hereafter appear again; that 'tis probable
the nearest distance of it was much greater than that of
the Moon, that the length of its Beard was longer than
its distance from the Earth, and consequently several
times longer than the distance between the Earth and
the Moon; that its visible way among the Stars was
very differing from a great circle, especially towards
the latter end, when it became retrograde; that its way
through the Aether could not be supposed equal in a
straight line, though it might be supposed equal in a
curve or circle, that the exact way of it could not
be certainly determined by the best Observations I have
yet met with: and that therefore the best help we have
to ghess of its way and distance, is by its manner of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as to appearance among the fixed Stars, which I
have already shewn to be explicable by various Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses:
for both the Earth and Comet may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be moved, either both one way, or contrary
ways, or cross ways, the Earth may be supposed to
stand still, and the Comet only to be moved, and the
like.</p>
            <p>These Requisites therefore being hitherto wanting
in the Observations I have met with of this Comet, all
that can be said of it will at best be but conjectural and
hypothetical; since nothing can be reasonably built
upon those Observations where the truth of them is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious;
wanting therefore sound materials to work upon
in this Comet, I had recourse to the Observations of
the noble Dane <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> being sufficiently satisfied
both of the ability, industry, and veracity of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Author, who left nothing unattempted for the
perfecting of such Observations as seem'd to him requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
for the compleating a History of that Comet which
appeared in 1577. And from those Observations of his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40537:30"/>
I endeavoured to trace the way of it according to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
hypotheses; and found, that supposing the Earth
not to be moved with an annual motion, but only a
diurnal about its own Axis, the way of Comets will fall
in a line very near approaching the nature of a circle,
though neither into an exact circle, nor an exact ellipse;
and therefore seems irregular, and not at all probable.
Again, supposing it moved about the Sun, as <hi>Tycho</hi> has
done, we find from his Calculation of it, he was fain
to allow it a quicker and slower motion in its Orbit, to
solve the Phaenomena, which seems to me but a shift,
that will serve to help out any lame Hypothesis what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
And that granted, and the Parallax of the
Comet unknown, I will undertake very easily to make
out almost any Hypothesis, which is the fault also of
Mr. <hi>Horox</hi> his Hypothesis, wherein he supposes the
Earth to be moved about the Sun, and the Comet like
a Rocket to be shot out of the Sun, and by degrees to
return to it again; in which Hypothesis indeed there
seems to be much more reason for an inequality of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though not in the manner as he has placed it;
'twas very rational that the motion of it at first, if cast
out of the Sun, should be very swift; but then it ought
likewise to have accelerated its motion in the same
manner in its return back to it again, which it does not
in his Hypothesis; for a stone or any other heavy body
being shot up into the Air, does make its return back
again to the Earth, almost by the same degrees of velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
by which it ascended from it: almost, I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the resistance of the Air does so far impede the
motion of the body through it, that it never suffers it
to acquire the same degree of velocity with which it
was first shot upward. This is sufficiently evident from
a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> which if it be thrown upwards, and be
suffered to return back, it will never rise again on the
opposite side to an equal height, with that it descended
from, on that side towards which it was thrown: but
besides, in his Hypothesis he seems to take no notice at
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40537:31"/>
all of the Latitude of the Comet, which seemed to
carry it much farther off from the Sun, when he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
it to be returning nearer. And indeed upon
the whole his Hypothesis seems rather a product of
chance than of any contrivance. For he in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to set off the Longitude of the Comet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Tables, and to trace its way by
supposing the Earths annual motion, making use al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
of the same Radius to set off the aspect, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
angle of it with the Sun, his line of Chords he
made use of did always direct the point of his Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to the place where he situates the Comet, as may
be easily found by examining the ninth figure; where
you may find that he places the Comet always equally
distant from the Earth, and that distance is always
equal to the distance of the Sun, which has so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
and improbabilities, that I shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
farther on it; especially since I do not find that he
bestowed any farther pains in explicating or cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this his Hypothesis, than only the bare delineati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this ninth figure. But to return to <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
if that be true, why did not the Comet
again appear after a certain space of time? and why
could not he have foretold when it should again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
as well as he could predict the appearance of
<hi>Venus,</hi> about whose Orb he supposes it to circulate?
I shall pass by several other very material objections
that might be made against that his supposition, because
many of them might be made also against his Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of the Heavens in general, which I shall the rather
omit, because I do not find he has many followers in
that supposition; the generality of Astronomers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
rather the <hi>Copernican</hi> System, especially as it is
refined and rectified by the ingenious <hi>Kepler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, I endeavoured to trace the way of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
from <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Tables, according to <hi>Keplers</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis;
which was, that the appearances of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Comet were ascribable to two causes;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40537:31"/>
namely, the motion of the Earth about the Sun in its
annual Orbit, and the motion of the Comet in a straight
line, not accelerated according to the proportion of the
increase of Tangents; but upon supposition that it
mov'd equal spaces in equal times: (for I cannot imagine
what reason he had to suppose its motion to be accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and much less why he should assert it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of Tangents, which in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time must necessarily come to move infinitely swift:
than which nothing is more hard to be granted.) And
I found it after many trials and essays to fall in a
straight line, inclining to the plain of the Ecliptick by
anangle of 47. 40. and cutting it in 9 degrees of <hi>Scorpio,</hi>
if computed out of the Sun, and moved faster by half
than the Earth in its Orb; and this to so great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
to answer all the Observations of <hi>Tycho,</hi> that
from a very large Scheme which I drew of it on a plain,
I could never find many minutes difference; so that I
concluded that to be the most likely Hypothesis for
that Comet, it seeming to solve all the several Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
of the motion and magnitude of the Comet, with
the least imaginable difficulty, and to be most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with my physical notions of Comets: For, first it
only supposes a solid body moved in a fluid, with an
almost direct motion. I say, almost direct, because for
some physical reasons, as I have said before, I imagine
it not exactly straight, but inflected a little towards the
curvity of a circle, which I shall presently endeavour
to explain farther in this Comet. Next, it supposes that
body to move in that line almost equal spaces in equal
times; I say, almost equal, because some of those equal
spaces may be increased by an accelerating cause or
principle, such as that of a gravitation towards the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Sun, placed in the center of its Vortice or
System, when the motion of the Comet carries it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sun, and may be diminish'd from other impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
causes, such as the impediment of the fluid me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
through which it passes, and the attraction of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40537:32"/>
Sun operating on it when its motion carries it farther
and farther off from it: besides, 'tis not unlikely, but
that the attraction of the Earth, or some of the other
Planets may have some kind of influence on it, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when its line of Direction does somewhat nearer
approach those attractive points. But the deflection
from a straight line is always so much the less by how
much the swifter the body is moved, and by how much
the farther off its line of trajection is perpendicularly
distant from those attracting bodies. According to
this supposition of mine, I have endeavoured to make
out all the appearances of this last Comet, taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in the best observations I have yet met with,
amongst which I find no one of the Parallax satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as in the tenth figure, let S represent the Sun, ORB,
the Orb of the Earth, ACDEF, a bended or curve
line in which the Comet is supposed to move: the
Comet then coming into the Sphere of the attractive
power of the Sun, by the straight line PAG, at A, the
power of the Sun worketh on it, and by degrees at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
it towards its own Center by that time the
Comet hath moved to C, the attractive power hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
its direct course from PAG, to CH, and so the
Comet would continue to move in that straight line
CH, but it is still deflected so, that at D, it moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I, but the gravitation of the Sun attracting it,
deflects it from that line towards E, and so from E to F,
when it begins again to Jet out of the attractive beams
of the Sun, and so it will continue to proceed, as if it
had come to that point by the line MFL, the reason
of which is the great velocity of these bodies, which are
generally much swifter in their motions than the Earth
or other Planets are supposed to be, in theirs. We
must seek out some other way therefore of finding of
the distance of Comets than the commonly used: I shall
therefore somewhat further explain the contrivance I
newly invented for this purpose, by which not
only the Parallax of the Comet but of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40537:32"/>
also may be found with great facility and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness.</p>
            <p>Having a large Telescope prepared (as I formerly
directed) with Eye-glasses capable of taking in an
Angle of about two degrees at once, and furnished
with a dividing Scale, observe when the motion of
the Comet or Planets is not too fast, the position and
distances of the small fixed Stars which are next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to the moved body whose Parallax you would
find; of these small fixed Stars you shall seldom miss a
sufficient number, which will be taken into the glass
at once, if at least the object-glass be allowed a very
large aperture; and having found such Stars as will be
convenient for your purpose, be very diligent in taking,
by the help of the dividing Scale, the exact distance
of them one from an other, and when the body is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
above the Horizon, <hi>viz.</hi> in or near the Meridian,
by the same means take the exact distance of it from
two or three of the nearest and most conspicuous fixt
Stars about it, and by the help of a plumb-line, hung
likewise within the cell, near the dividing Ruler, find
exactly the positions of all those bodies you take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of to the Perpendicular or Horizon, which may be
easily enough done, if together with a Plumb-line or
Perpendicular plac'd within the glass you have also a
small Diagonal thred fastned to a ring, whose circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is divided into 360 degrees, and moveable so as
by the finger easily to be turn'd any way, by which
means this Diagonal thred may be made to cross over
any two of the bodies you observe, and by observing
what division of this divided limb the Perpendicular
cuts, it will be easie to determine the exact position
of those Stars to the Horizon; this same may be
done by the dividing Scale also, if that be fixt in a
divided Circle which is movable, in the same manner
as the thred is supposed to be. This Observation, with
all other circumstances of it is likewise to be repeated
at the setting or rising of the Planet or Comet, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40537:33"/>
the next night when it comes to the Meridian,
and in each of those observations the exact time is to
be noted by a time-keeper, and the altitude by some of
those I have before described, for by comparing these
three observations together it will be very easie to find
what irregularity in its motion is ascribable to its Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax.
And this will be so much the easier because the
examination and reduction of it may be done (with as
great exactness as the observation can be made,) by the
help only of Ruler and Compasses, for all the distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will be set off by equal divisions of straight lines,
the line also of the periodick motion, whether of the
Comet or Planet, especially if the observations be made
when the body is near an opposition with the Sun,
which is much the best time, will be with sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
taken for a straight line, and the motion in
that line may be supposed by equal spaces in equal
times; for the difference between the Tangents of the
centesms of a degree to two degrees is not increased
much more then 2/1745 that is not a quarter of a centesm
of the hundredth part of a degree, which is much more
exact than I fear our observations will ever be.</p>
            <p>Another way of finding the Parallax may be by the
help of exact observations made by several persons at
the same time, in places much differing in Latitude,
though as near as may be under the same Meridian
(because of saving the trouble of Calculation, and for
being assured that the observations were both made
exactly at the same time) each person by the help of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long Telescopes observing the exact distance of the
body from the small fixt Stars next adjoyning.</p>
            <p>A third way of finding the Parallax of Comets is
wholly new, and though hypothetical (as supposing
the annual motion of the Earth, and the motion of
the Comet in a right line through equal spaces in equal
times) yet 'tis founded upon a Problem in Geometry
(invented by the incomparable Mathematician, Doctor
<hi>C. Wren)</hi> which is truly noble and wholly new, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40537:33"/>
though it had been of no use in Astronomy, deserves
none of the meanest places in Geometry, by the help
of which (which is much more than either of the
other ways is capable of) one may easily find the
true parallax of the Comet, from any four exact
observations of it, made at differing times in the same
place: Nor does it require so nice and accurate Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Observators as are altogether necessary in
the other ways. The Problem as I received it, is this.</p>

            <p>From the invention of which Problem 'twill be
very easie by any four observations Graphically to
describe, or Geometrically to calculate the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the line of the trajection of the Comet,
and consequently to answer all those questions that can
be demanded concerning the bigness of the body and
head, and concerning the bigness and length of the blaze,
and concerning the distance of it from the Earth in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of its way when it was nearest the Earth, when
nearest the Sun, where it cuts the Plain of the Ecliptick,
seen from the Sun, and where seen from the Earth,
with what Angle it was inclined to the said Plain, how
swift the motion was, that is, what length it passed, in
what time, when it must appear Stationary, when Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,
when disappear, and the like.</p>
            <p>According to this method I received at the same
time, (whilst it yet appeared very visible to the Eye, and
was not Retrograde,) the way of the first Comet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated
by the said person, which did very near solve
all the appearances preceding and subsequent, which
I have therefore here annexed in the Table expressed in
the 19. 20. and 21. figures, where in the 19. is delineated
the Place of the Sun in the Center of the Circle ♈, N,
D, I, ♎, which represents the annual Orb of the Earth
about the Sun, the points between N and D represent
the places of the Earth in that Orbit in the days of
<hi>November,</hi> and the lines drawn from them to the points
in the straight line, represent the lines in which the
Comet appeared in respect to the Sun; in like manner
the points between D and I, the places of the Earth
in <hi>December,</hi> and the lines drawn from them to the
straight line, as before the visible places of the Comet
at those times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The 20. figure represents singly
the several Longitudes of the Comet at several times
seen from the Earth. And the 21. represents the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Latitudes, at the several times, together with the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40537:34"/>
true distances of the Comet at those times, both which
are made out of the 19. figure, where E at the end of
the line represents the Center of the Earth, from which
to the figures in the prickt curve-line, are the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the Comet, the Perpendiculars from those fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
to the line EC are the signs of the Latitude of
the Comet from the plane of the Ecliptick EC, the
aforesaid distances being made the Radii.</p>
            <p>Now though according to my former Delineation
the Comet seemed to take a circuit, as if it would
within three years return to its former position, yet I
am not wholly convinced that it moves in a circle or
Ellipse, but I rather incline to the incomparable <hi>Kep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
opinion, that its natural motion tends towards a
straight line, though in some other suppositions I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from him.</p>
            <p>As first that the Comet perseveres exactly in a
straight line. Secondly, that after it has past its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige
it accelerates its motion in proportion to Tangents
of equal Angles. Thirdly, that it either is extinguisht
dissipated, broken in pieces, or burnt out into ashes.
Fourthly, that it receives all its light from the Sun.
Fifthly, that if the blaze were not made by the beams
of the Sun passing through the head of the Comet,
and so carrying the parts along with them, the blaze
would not be opposite to the Sun. Sixthly, that the
cause of the bending of the blaze is the refraction of
the Suns raies in the body, and their being bent by
the Aether as with a wind (which is the opinion that the
Ingenious <hi>Descartes</hi> follows also.) To these I cannot
consent, and I have many objections to several other
of his opinions concerning this matter, which would
be too tedious to insert; only I shall add, that
having traced several of the Comets according to the
best observations I could get, I found it very difficult
to make their motion fall in a straight line, unless it be
granted that their motions are really accelerated and
retarded in that line, which seems not so probable, at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40537:35"/>
least not in those parts of their transit where he places
them. And particularly by tracing the way of this
Comet of 1664. it is very evident that either the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
are false, or its appearances cannot be solved
by that supposition, without supposing the way of it
a little incurvated by the attractive power of the Sun,
through whose system it was passing, though it were
not wholly stayed and circumflected into a Circle, as
I have already mentioned.</p>
            <p>That it is not extinguisht or quite burnt out, when it
ceases to appear, I argue from this, that I was able to see
it with a Telescope above a month after it disappeared
to the naked Eye, as may be seen by the observations I
have annext in <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. and had not the cloudy weather
and the light of the Moon, and nearness of the <hi>Crepuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
hindred, I suppose I might have seen it much longer,
as I am apt to believe the great one in 1618. might have
been seen several months longer, if it had been diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followed with Telescopes, it disappearing in such a
part of the Heavens as might have been seen every clear
night between the <hi>Crepusculum</hi> and Dawning.</p>
            <p>Nor can I suppose it to receive all its light from
the Sun, since if so it would follow, that the <hi>Nucleus</hi>
in the head, would have a dark shadow opposite to
the Sun, the contrary of which has always been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
Nor can I well understand that the Sun
beams are like a stream of water, carrying the parts of
the Comet along with them so as to make its blaze,
since no such effect is found of them here with us upon
the Earth: Nor how they should come to be bended like
smoke, since we observe no such property of light in a
uniform medium, such as in probability the Aether is.</p>
            <p>These were my thoughts about those Comets
which appeared in 1664. and 1665. which I have
found in several loose papers of Lectures, read in
the beginning of 1665. And I have not had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of making many observations since, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Comets, save these two last, in which I had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40537:35"/>
not the convenience of observing any thing certain
concerning its motion or Parallax. And therefore I
applyed my self to mark as near as I could the true fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of it, through a six foot Telescope, and to take
notice of as many circumstances as the short time I had
would permit, which though they were very short and
transitory observations, and I wanted time to repeat
them so often as I could have desired, yet even from
them I was sufficiently satisfied, that I had reason to
adhere to my former conjecture, that the light of the
Comet did not depend wholly from the reflection of
the Sun beams, from the parts thereof, but rather from
its own light, for upon well considering of the form of
this Comet, I manifestly saw that the middle of the
blaze was brighter than the side parts thereof, and
especially that part which was immediatly opposite to
the Sun, was the brightest of all, which would have
been otherwise if the light had depended wholly from
the deflection of the rays of the Sun, for one might
rationally conclude that the <hi>Nucleus</hi> or Star in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
which reflected so great a quantity of light should
have caused a darkness in the parts behind it, as we see
all strong reflecting bodies do, and consequently that
the middle part of the stream or blaze, especially that
which was next the body should not have been so
bright as those other parts to which the light of the
Sun had a more free access, unless it may be said that
even the Star it self, though it seem so bright, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
not so Dense, but that it admits rays e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to pass through it unreflected, to inlighten the
parts behind it. But this seems not so likely, since be
the body of the Star supposed a thousand times thinner
than a Cloud (which yet tis hard to suppose, since it
gives so considerable a reflection,) yet it being in all
probability ten thousand times bigger in bulk, the rays
in passing through so great a bulk, must needs meet
with more obstruction than in the thinnest Cloud,
and yet we find that there is no Cloud so thin, but casts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40537:36"/>
shadow opposite to the Sun, and therefore in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
this would do the like, but I diligently observed
that there was no such appearance here, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that is, that where the shadow should have been,
there was the lightest part of all the blaze, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
in probability it did depend upon some other
cause than a reflection of light.</p>
            <p>It is a hard matter to assign the particular cause of
its light, but it seems from these circumstances to be
very probable that it was (in part at least) from its own
nature, whether that might be somewhat of that of
the Sun and Stars, or of that of our fire, or of that
of decaying fish, rotten wood, glow-worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
of that of the Ignis Fatuus, at Land or Sea, or
like that of Sea-water, or a Diamond, or like that of
the falling meteors, or Star-shoots, it will be very hard
to determine, unless one had a much greater stock of
observations to build upon. But it may possibly be
somewhat of the nature of them all, though it agree
not in all particulars with any one of them. All these
ways that I have named seeming to agree in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and that is an internal motion of the parts which
shine, whether that motion be caused by some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
menstruum dissolving it as in fire, and Ignes fatui,
or an external motion, stroke, or impulse as in a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
Sea-water, and possibly some Ignes fatui, or
from the parts of the bodies working and dissolving one
another, as in decaying fish, rotten wood, glow-worms,
or whether it be susceptible of a much more subtil
impulse, even from light it self, as the <hi>Bononian</hi> stone,
and <hi>Bladwines</hi> Phsophorus, which seems to be so harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
(as I may so speak) to the motion of light, that
a new motion is thereby raised in it, and continues
for some time to move of it self after the impulse or
influence ceases, not much unlike the unison string,
or other sounding body, which in Musick receives a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
and sound from the motion and sound of
the unison body, or string that is struck.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40537:36"/>
To me It seems most probable that the body and
parts of the Comet are in a state of dissolution, whether
that dissolution be caused by the parts of the Aether
through which it passes, after the manner as a Torch
is dissolved by the air, or whether by the internal
working of the constituent parts one upon the other,
as in Gun-powder, shining Fish and rotten Wood, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
determine; but I rather guess it to be in some
things analogous to the one, and somewhat to the other,
though not exactly the same with either. And this I
conceive from the figure and make of the shining parts,
for if it had been of the same nature with a Torch,
the blaze would have resembled that of the flame of
a Torch or Candle, that is, the sides would have been
brighter, and the middle darker, as I have shewn in
my <hi>Lampas;</hi> whereas it was very manifest that the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the blaze was brightest, and of that blaze that
which was next the Star or <hi>Nucleus</hi> was brighter than
that which was further off: whereas in flame the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is very observable, as I have in the said Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
shewn.</p>
            <p>From the shape of the figure, the manner of its disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
seems to be thus. The Star or <hi>Nucleus</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
seems to be the <hi>fomes</hi> or source from whence all the
light proceeds: this we suppose to be a dense body en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compast
with a very fluid body (such as the Aether seems
to be) but of such a loose and spongy nature, as that
the Aether doth cause those parts which are contiguous
to it, to be dissolved and expanded into it self. This
dissolution and expansion I conceive doth generate or
cause the light that seems to proceed from it, that
dissolution causing such a motion of the Aether, as is
necessary to produce the appearance of light; now so
long as any part thereof remains in dissolution, so
long doth it continue to shine, as is also observable in
the flame of any body burning in the air, but when
the part separated from the body is quite dissolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Aether, the effect of shining ceases, as it doth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40537:37"/>
also in the parts of flame. Now I have observed that
the blaze is so very much rarified, that first the Aether
I conceive comes very freely to every particle of the
body after it is separated from it, but especially to
the outermost, and continues to be incompassed with it
so long as till it be quite dissolved into it, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be at a little farther distance from the head than
the greatest length of the blaze seems to be to our sight.
And further I conceive that the outward parts being
thus incompassed more perfectly with the free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed
Aether, are sooner dissolved into it than those
of the middle, and consequently the sides seem first to
disappear, and the middle parts continue their shining
to a much greater distance from the Star in the head,
though somewhat also of that appearance may be
ascribed to the dispersing and rarity of the parts near
the sides.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nucleus</hi> or Ball in the middle of the head,
which I have called the Star, I conceive to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
equally on all sides, and the parts which are dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or separated from it, I conceive to fly every way
from the center of it, with pretty near equal celerity
or power, like so many blazing Granadoes or Fire-balls,
these continue their motion so far toward the way
they are shot, till the Levitation from the body of the
Sun deflect them upwards, or in opposition to the Sun
into a Parabolick curve, in which Parabolick curve, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
single particle continues its motion till it be wholly
burnt out, or dissolved into the Aether. These are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
succeeded by new separations from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
body in the same manner as tis observable in a
burning, steaming, or smoaking body in our air, or a
dissolving body incompassed with its proper menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
as I before mentioned, and will so continue until
the whole be at length dissolved into the Aether,
through which it passes.</p>
            <p>It hath been demonstrated by <hi>Torricellius,</hi> of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
or other bodies cast or shot upwards, that the same
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40537:37"/>
or equal bullets discharged or shot out from the same
point, with the same degree of strength, but with
differing degrees of inclination to the Horizon, each of
them shall be moved in a parabolical line, and every
one of those parabolical lines shall touch a paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
line, whose axis is the perpendicular, and whose
apex is distant from the said point, the full altitude of
the perpendicular shot: So that supposing in the twenty
second figure, A to be the point from whence all the
shots are made with equal velocity, AC the greatest
height of the perpendicular shot, and AD the greatest
Horizontal random at 45 degrees of inclination, and
suppose EDCDE a parabola passing through those
points DCD, all the shots made with equal bullets,
with equal velocity from A, but with all variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
between the perpendicular upwards, and the
perpendicular downwards that touch the said paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
line, and consequently if there be an indefinite
number of such balls continually flowing out of the
point A, with equal degrees of celerity every way
dispersing themselves equally <hi>in orbem,</hi> the whole ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
of such an emanation will make a solid para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
conoeid EDCDE. Now about the point
A, if we suppose a Sphere as BBBB, and from
this Sphere an indefinite number of such equal Balls
be thrown off perpendicularly to the superficies
of it, from every point thereof, with equal ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
at their leaving it, those emanations will form
also a conoeid, which will be very near the same with
the former: And if this Ball in the middle be supposed
a burning and shining body, and that all these emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have every one of them equal light in proportion
to the Globe BBBBA, the effect produced hereby
will perfectly resemble the appearance and figure of
Comets, if at least the Parabolical conoeid be inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
which will somewhat explain the manner how I
conceive the figure of the Cometical body is naturally,
and most proportionably formed; for if the effect of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40537:38"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40537:38"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:40537:39"/>
such an emanation of shining bodies be examined, it
will very plainly exhibit the exact and true apparent
figure of Comets, as they may be seen through a good
Telescope, which is to me a very great argument, that
'tis the genuine cause of its shape and figure: Now
though the Comets appearance be this way caused,
and so a man might conceive the Globous body
would in a little time (by so copious an emanation) be
consumed, yet I do not believe that it doth in a short
time wast and disperse the whole Ball, nor can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the disappearing of those blazing bodies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the latter end, does depend upon their dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(though possibly that may somewhat diminish them)
but that rather is to be ascribed to their distance and
position in respect of us: Though this I remember I
observed very manifestly in that of 1664. that the body
toward the latter end of its appearing was very much
less in proportion to the radiations about it, than it
seemed to be at the beginning, but whether that might
not be partly ascribed to the great distance it then was
from us, and the turning of the head pretty near to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, and thence the spreading of the Tail (appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond it,) might add to the breadth of the radia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the <hi>Nucleus,</hi> I will not positively determine.
Now though for explication sake, I have compared
the parts separated from the body of the Comet to
blazing Granadoes or Fire-balls, yet I would not be
understood to suppose these parts so separated to be
of any very large bulk, for I see no necessity to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them bigger than the Atoms of smoke, or the
particles of any other steaming body, or than the parts
of the Air, which make the body of it appear thick
and hazy; nor do I believe that all the light of the
Star, head, and blaze, does depend only upon the
shining of the dissolving body and particles thereof:
but I do suppose that it doth proceed both from the
reflection of the Sun-beams from those parts, and also
from an innate and momentaneous light produced by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40537:39"/>
the action of dissolution wrought on the parts by the
incompassing Aether.</p>
            <p>It may possibly seem very difficult to suppose that
the dissolution of the parts of the <hi>Nucleus,</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassing
Aether, should cause or impress so violent
a motion into the separated parts, as to make them
depart from it to the space of four or five Diameters,
before it be over-powered by the power of Levitation
from the body of the Sun, and so deflected into a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical
line upwards. It may likewise seem strange
to suppose that the Aether should have such power in
it, as first to dissolve a body into it self, and secondly
to cause a shining, and thirdly to cause a Levitation of
the dissolved parts upwards; whereas I supposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(and I think 'tis very manifest) that they cause a
gravitation downwards, towards the Center of the
Sun: But to these for explication, I answer that we
need not go far for instances to make these things
probable, the Atmosphere about the Earth, as I have
formerly mentioned in my <hi>Micrographia,</hi> I take to be
nothing else but the dissolution of the parts of the
Earth into the incompassing Aether; for the proof of
which, I could bring many arguments, were it here
a proper place, by which I could most evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the thing to be as I have asserted. It is here
evident that this Aether doth take up the particles of
bodies to a very great distance from the surface from
which they were separated, and it doth not only raise
them but susteins them at those heights, nor is this pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
only to the Aether when a menstruum, but to all
dissolving menstruums in general.</p>
            <p>As to give one instance, in stead of many, we find
that Gold (the heaviest of all Terrestrial bodies we yet
know,) being dissolved by <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> is taken up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and kept suspended therein, though the parts
of the Gold be fifteen times heavier than the parts of
the <hi>Aqua Regis.</hi> So Pit-coal though very heavy, is
yet taken up into the Air, and kept suspended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40537:40"/>
though it will be found to be some thousands of
times more ponderous than the menstruum of the Air
that keeps it suspended.</p>
            <p>Many reasons I could produce to shew the great
power of the Aether, and the universality of its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
almost in all sensible motions, but reserving them
for another Discourse hereafter, I shall at present, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention those suppositions which seem to have
the greatest difficulty, in this Theory, <hi>viz.</hi> how the
dissolution of the parts of the Star by the incompassing
Aether should cause light, and secondly how it should
cause an actual Levitation of the dissolving particles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
For the explication of these two difficulties,
I must at present crave favour to explain them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
taken from operations of Nature in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere
wherein we live, very similar and analogous
to them. First, for the production of light, we find
that the Air incompassing the steams of bodies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by heat or otherwise, and made fit for dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth so operate upon them, as to make them fly
and part asunder with a very impetuous motion, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the small particles or Atoms of the dissolved
bodies, do not only leave one another, but depart and
dart out with so great an impetuosity, as to drive off
all the incompassing Air from their Center from
whence they flew, and this I take to be the cause not
only of their Light, but also of their Levity upwards,
this may be seen very plainly by the small parts of
crackling Char-coal, which upon the blowing them
with Bellows, and so crowding a great quantity of the
fresh menstruum on them, fly and dart asunder with
great celerity and noise, but is abundantly more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the kindling of Gun-powder, where the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity
is so very great as to drive away not only all
the incompassing Air but all other bodies, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so solid, that hinder its expansion, in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which operation the Aether hath a great share,
as I may hereafter shew, 'tis very probable that the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40537:40"/>
Aether in the same manner dissolving the particles of
the Star, causeth the Atoms thereof to fly asunder
with so great an impetuosity as to leave a vacuity
even of the parts of the Aether, which flying asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
doth not only cause light by impressing on the
Aether a stroke or pulse which propagates every
way <hi>in Orbem,</hi> but maketh such an agitation of the
the Aether, as causes a rarefaction in the parts thereof,
whilst the parts that are once actually separated, by
continual rebounding one against another before
they come to be at rest and quietly to touch each
other, prolong that first separation or vacuity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>
            <p>This Explication, though it be somewhat difficult,
yet I hope it is intelligible, and may be, with proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
enough, supposed to be the true cause of the
appearance, whilst there is nothing therein supposed
which is not manifestly the method of Nature in other
operations; and though the supposition even of the
Aether, may seem to be a Chimera and groundless;
yet had I now time, I could by many very sensible
and undeniable experiments, prove the existence and
reality thereof, and that it doth actually produce not
only as sensible effects as these I have named, but very
much the same, and many others much more cosidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which by Philosophers have hitherto been ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to quite different causes.</p>
            <p>Had I been able to have made some other observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(which I designed, if I had had the opportunity of
seeing it, some of the succeeding Nights,) I should have
hoped to have explained several other difficulties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the nature of the body and blaze of Comets,
but being therein prevented, I must leave them till I
can make some further observations on some Comets
that may hereafter appear.</p>
            <p>In the mean time that what I have discoursed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the light of Comets, may not seem so altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
paradoxical and unintelligible as some may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40537:41"/>
I have here added an account of some trials and
observations made on shining substances of natures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
differing from those that are commonly to
be met withal. And this I the rather do, not only
because it affords an instance of shining where there is
no Air, but that hereby I may enlarge the limits of
their imagination, who shall consider of this subject.
For nothing is more apt to misguide our reasoning
than a narrow and limited knowledg of causes, we
are not to conclude the body of a Comet a sulphureous
vapour exhaled from the Earth and kindled above,
because here are such vapours observed and such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
produced, nor a collection of Sun beams made by
a Lentiformed vapour, after the manner of a Burning-glass
(as some eminent Writers have lately done,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some such appearances may be Artificially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in a smoaky or thickned Air; since if we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
inquire, we may find that light which is the
most sensible quality of Comets that affects our senses,
may be, and really is produced by very many, and
those very differing ways. In Nitre and Sulphur
kindling each other by heat, we have one way; in a
body burning in the Air a second, in a heated Iron or
Glass a third, in a piece of Iron hammered till red hot
a fourth, in rotten Wood and decayed Fish a fifth, in
Glow-worms, <hi>Scolopondras,</hi> and other living Worms,
and in the sweat and excrements of other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
a sixth, in a Diamond rubbed a seventh, in Dews
Ignes fatui, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> an eighth, in Sea-water a ninth, in the
<hi>Bononian</hi> stone, and in the Phosphorus <hi>Baldwini</hi> (which
I take to be much of the same nature) a tenth, in the
Phosphorus of Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> an eleventh, and possibly
wholly differing from all these, may be the light
of the Sun, a twelfth, and that of the Star may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from that of Sun, and the Comet may be differing
from all the rest. Whether they be so or not, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquainted with the several proprieties of them
will the better enable one to judg of what is perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40537:41"/>
to be observed in Comets, in order to find out
which is concerned.</p>
            <p>The Phaenomena of most of these shining bodies
are very common and obvious, and therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to be added; but that of the <hi>Bononian</hi> stone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and that of the <hi>Phosphorus Baldwini</hi> (lately
discovered by Mr. <hi>Baldwine)</hi> are rare and hard to be
got, and the effects of them are wholly differing from all
the ways I have yet met with, and will therefore prove
<hi>Experimenta Crucis,</hi> highly instructive in the Theory of
Light, of which more hereafter. As for the <hi>Phospho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros
Fulgurans</hi> of Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> (more scarce and rare than
the other) 'tis wholly differing from any of the rest,
and very strange and surprising, at least it appeared so
to me, who had the good fortune to be present at a
good part of the experiments made by the Author in
the presence and at the Chamber of the Honourable

I was after supper visited by Mr. <hi>Kraft,</hi>
a famous <hi>German</hi> Chymist, who was
pleased to come and shew me a strange
rarity he hath newly brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to the sight whereof he allowed me to invite se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
members of the Royal Society, he being desirous,
because the matter he imploys is very costly and of
difficult preparation, to be a good Husband of it, and
by shewing it to several curious persons at once, to
exempt himself from the need of showing it often.
The Company being met, the Artist took out of a
pretty large box he had brought with him, divers
Glass Vessels and laid them in order on the Table. The
largest of them was a Sphere of Glass, which I guessed
to be four or five Inches in Diameter, being hollow
and intire, save that in one place there was a little
hole, at that time stopt with sealing wax, whereat to
pour in the Liquor, which seemed to me to be about
two Spoonfuls or somewhat more, and to look like
muddy water made a little reddish with brick-dust or
some other powder of that colour, he also took out of
his Box three or four little pipes of Glass sealed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40537:43"/>
stopt at both ends, being each of them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bigger than a Swans quill, and about five or six
Inches long, and having at one end a small frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or two of that matter that was to shine in
the dark.</p>
               <p>He likewise laid upon the Table three or four Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of several sizes, but none of them judged capable
to hold above very few Ounces of water: in each of
which Vials there was some Liquor or other, that was
neither transparent nor well coloured, which Liquors I
confess upon his making no particular mention of what
they were to do, I was not curious to compare together,
either as to quantity or as to colour. Besides all these
substances which were fluid, he had in a small Crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
button Bottle, a little lump of matter, of which he
seemed to make much more account than of all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
and which he took out for a few moments to
let us look upon it, whereby I saw that it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
body, that appeared of a whitish colour, and
seemed not to exceed a couple of ordinary Pease, or
the kernel of a Hasel Nut in bigness, some other things
'tis possible Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> took out of his Box, but neither
I or (for ought I know) others of the Company took
notice of them, partly because of his hast, and partly
because the confused curiosity of many spectators in a
narrow compass, kept me from being able to observe
things as particularly and deliberately as I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have done, and as the occasion deserved. Which
Advertisement may I fear be but too applicable to a
great part of the following Narrative.</p>
               <p>The forementioned Glasses being laid in order upon
the Table, the windows were closed with wooden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuts,
and the Candles were removed into another
Room by that we were in; being left in the dark we
were entertained with the ensuing Phaenomena.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40537:43"/>
I. Though I noted above that the hollow Sphere of
Glass had in it but about two Spoonfuls (or three at
most) of matter, yet the whole Sphere was illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by it, so that it seemed to be not unlike a Cannon
bullet taken red hot out of the fire, except that the
light of our Sphere lookt somewhat more pale and
faint. But when I took the liberty to hold this
Glass in my hand and shake it a little, the contained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
appeared to shine more vividly, and sometimes
as it were to flash.</p>
               <p>II. I took one of the little pipes of Glass for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned, into my hand, and observed
that though the shining matter had been lodged
but at one end, yet the whole Glass was enlightened,
so that it appeared a luminous Cylinder, whose
light yet I did not judg to be always uniform, nor
did it last like that which was included in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
               <p>III. In the largest of the Vials next the Spherical
already mentioned, the Liquor that lay in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
being shaken, I observed a kind of smoke to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
and almost to fill the cavity of the Vial, and
near the same time there manifestly appeared as it
were a flash of lightning that was considerably dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
and pleasingly surprized me.</p>
               <p>IV. After this I took up that small Crystaline Vial
that I lately called (by a name familiar in our Glass-shops)
a Button-Bottle, wherein was contained the dry sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
which the Artist chiefly valued, as that which
had continued luminous about these two years, and
having held that Vial long in my hand, in the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in reference to my eye, and lookt attentively at
it, I had the opportunity to observe (what I think
none of the Company did) that not only this stuff
did in proportion to its bulk, shine more vividly than
the fluid substances, but thaat which was the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
I chiefly attended) though I could perceive no
smoke or fumes ascend from the luminous matter, yet I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40537:44"/>
could plainly perceive by a new and brisker light that
appeared from time to time in a certain place near the
top of the Glass, that there must be some kind of
flashy motion in the matter that lay at the bottom,
which was the cause of these little coruscations, if I
may so call them.</p>
               <p>V. The Artist having taken a very little of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
matter, and broken it into parts so minute, that
I judged the fragments to be between twenty and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he scattered them without any order about the
Carpet, where it was very delightful to see how vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidly
they shined; and that which made the spectacle
more taking, especially to me, was this, that not only in
the darkness that invironed them, they seemed like fixt
Stars of the sixth or least magnitude, but twinkled also
like them, discovering such a scintillation as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we distinguish the fixt Stars from most of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
And these twinkling sparks without doing any
harm (that we took notice of) to the Turky Carpet
they lay on, continued to shine for a good while,
some of them remaining yet vivid enough till the
Candles being brought in again made them disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>VI. Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> also calling for a sheet of Paper and
taking some of his stuff upon the tip of his finger,
writ in large Characters two or three words, whereof
one being <hi>DOMINI,</hi> was made up of Capital Letters,
which being large enough to reach from one side of
the page to the other, and being (at least as I guessed)
invigorated by the free contact of the external Air,
shone so briskly and lookt so oddly, that the sight
was extreamly pleasing, having in it a mixture of
strangeness, beauty and frightfulness, wherein yet the
last of those qualities was far from being predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
And this Phaenomenon did in more senses than
one afford us the most of light, since not only the
Characters shone very vividly upon the white Paper,
but approaching it to my Eyes and Nostrils, I could
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40537:44"/>
discern that there ascended from them a fume, and
could smell that fume to be strong enough, and (as it
seemed to me) to participate of the odour of Sulphur
and of that of Onions. And before I past from the
mention of these resplendent Characters, I must not
forget that either by their light, or that of the Globe,
or both by the one and the other a man might
discern those of his fingers that were nearest the
shining stuff, and that this being held to the face
though without touching it, some of the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuousest
parts, especially the Nose, were discovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>VII. After we had seen with pleasure, and not
without some wonder, the fore-going particulars, the
Artist desired me to give him my hand, which when
I had done, he rub'd partly upon the back of it, and
partly on my cuff, some of his luminous matter, which
as if it had been assisted by the warmth of my hand
shone very vividly, and though I took not notice of
any thing upon my skin, that was either unctuous or
rough, yet I often times tried in vain by rubbing it
with my other hand to take it off, or manifestly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
its splendor, and when I divers times blow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some of the smaller parts of it, though they seemed
at the instant that my breath beat upon it, to be
blown out, yet the tenacious parts were not really
extinguisht, but presently after recovered their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
splendor. And all this while this light that was
so permanent, was yet so mild and innocent that
in that part of my hand where it was largely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
spread, I felt no sensible heat produced by
it.</p>
               <p>By that time these things were done 'twas grown
late, which made Mr. <hi>Kraft,</hi> who had a great way
to go home, take leave of the Company after he had
received our deserved thanks for the new and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Phaenomena, wherewith he had so delightfully
entertained us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40537:45"/>
Because Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> had twice attempted to fire heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gun-powder with his Phosphorus, but without suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
probably because the powder was not very good
(as by some circumstances I conjected) and because it
was not sufficiently heated before the matter that
should set it on fire was put upon it, he promised me he
would come another time to repair that unsuccesfulness:
And accordingly, On the two and twentieth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
in the Afternoon I recived a visit from Mr. <hi>Kraft,</hi>
who told me he came to make good his promise of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me see that his shining matter was able to kindle
heated Gun-powder, and because no strangers were
present, I had the fairer opportunity to view it, which
I was able to do better by day light, than I had done
by its own light, for when he had taken it with a new
Pen out of the liquor with which he kept it covered
to preserve it, I perceived it to be somewhat less than
the nail of one of my fingers, and not much thicker
than a shilling, and I observed that when it had lain a
little while upon a piece of clean Paper and discharged
it self from its superfluous moisture, it began to emit
whitish fumes which seemed to be very ponderous,
since for the most part they did not ascend but surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter whence they issued, by their stagnation
made as it were a little Pond or small Atmosphere about
it; so that lest it should wast too fast, he was obliged as
soon as he had cut off a little corner less than half a
pins head, to put the stuff nimbly back into the Vial
out of which he he had taken it; where I observed it
for a very short time to send up exhalations into the
liquor that covered it, and quickly after, as it were,
quencht it. This done the Artist divided the little
corner he had cut off into two parts, one of which
he spread as far as it would reach upon a piece of white
Paper, which he presently after held at a distance over
a chafing-dish of burning Coals, by whose heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excited it presently flasht and burnt away, and I
having perceived that there was another part of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40537:45"/>
Paper which though not heeded by him, had been
lightly besmeared by the same matter, I held it over
the Coals, but at a considerable distance from them,
and yet this little matter nimbly took fire and burnt a
hole in the Paper. And to satisfie my self that the
heat did but excite the luminous matter, and that
twas this its self that lighted the Paper, I held the
rest of the same piece of Paper far nearer the fire and
kept it there a pretty while without finding it at all
scorched or discoloured. Lastly, the other part of the
divided fragment of the hitherto mentioned matter,
Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> put upon the tip of a quil, and having at a
distance from the fire, very well dryed and warmed
some Gun-powder upon another piece of Paper, he
laid that Paper upon the ground, and then holding
his quill upon it, as if it had been a match, within half
a minute (by my guess) that powder took fire and
blew up.</p>
               <p>'Twill not perhaps be impertinent to add that on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the operation I observed the Air to have
on the shining substance when freely exposed to it.
I took a rise to tell Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> that I presumed it might
be worth while to try whether his Phosphorus did
shine by virtue of a kind of real or (if I may so call
it) living flame, which like almost all other flames re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the presence and concourse of the Air to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, or whether it were of such a kind of nature
as the Phosphorus of the learned <hi>Baldwinus,</hi> which I
suspected to shine not like a flame or a truly kindled
substance; but like a red hot Iron, or an ignited piece
of Glass, wherein the shining parts are not repaired
by fewel, as in other burning bodies, but are put by
the action of the fire into so vehement an agitation as
whilst it lasts suffices to make the body appear lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.
This conjecture Mr. <hi>Kraft</hi> seemed much to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of when I told him that the way I proposed to
examine his <hi>noctiluca</hi> by, was to put a little of it into
our Pneumatick Engine, and Pump out the Air, whose
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40537:46"/>
absence, if it were of the nature of other flames, would
probably extinguish, or very much impair its light,
but yet since he offered not to have the trial made;
probably because he had but very little of his shining
substance left, I thought it not civil to press him.
But to countenance what I said of the nature of <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winus
Phosphorus,</hi> I shall recite an Experiment that I
purposely made, to examin whether the presence of the
Air were necessary to the shining of this Phosphorus,
as I had long since found it to that of some pieces of
shining wood.</p>
               <p>We exposed for a competent time to the beams of a
vigorous light, a portion of matter of about the breadth
of the palm of ones hand, which we had prepared to
be made luminous by them. And then causing the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
to be removed (for we chose to make tryal by
night) we nimbly conveyed the matter into a receiver
that was kept in readiness for it, presuming (as the
event shewed we might) that by using diligence the
light would last as long as the experiment would need
to do; making hast therefore to Pump out the Air,
we heedfully watched whether the withdrawing of
it would, contrary to my conjecture, notably diminish
the light of the shining matter. And after we had
thus withdrawn the Air gradually, we tryed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by letting it return hastily, it would produce a
more sensible change in the matter (which had been
purposely put in without any thing to cover it, that it
might be the more exposed to the Airs Action.) But
neither upon the gradual recess of the Air, nor yet
upon its rushing in when it was permitted to return,
could we certainly observe any manifest alteration in
the luminousness of the Phosphorus, other than that
slow decrement that might well be imputed to the
time during which the experiment was making. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well known that this luminous substance requires
no long time to make it decay, and by degrees to lose
all its light; so that though once there seemed to one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40537:46"/>
or two of the by-standers, upon the return of the
Air, to be some recovery of part of the lost splendor,
yet after repeated experiments it was concluded that
the presence of the Air was not at all <hi>necessary</hi> to the
shining of our matter, and it was judged most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the absence or presence of the Air, had <hi>no
manifest</hi> operation on it. I might add to this that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the presence of the Air is rather hurtful than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to this sort of lights, since for having had
a large Phosphorus that was much esteemed, and, whilst
I kept it, exactly protected from the Air did very well;
a part of the Glass that covered it, having by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
been somewhat crackt, though none of the
splinters appeared displaced, yet it seems some of the
Corpuscles of the Air made a shift to insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at these chinks (as narrow as they were) and in
not many days made the matter cease to be capable of
being made luminous as before. I cannot stay to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether this unfitness or indisposition may be
imputed to the bare moisture of the Air, or to some
other substance or quality that alone or in conjunction
with the moisture, may spoil that peculiar texture, or
constitution that fits the matter of the Phosphorus as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by the impressions of external light to become
luminous. This, I say, I cannot stay to examine,
though, That this Phosphorus is of a nice and tender
constitution, and easily alterable, I was induced to
think, by finding that the want of circumstances,
seemingly slight enough, would keep it from being
made; and I guess that a convention of circumstances
did more contribute to the production than any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and incommunicable nature of the matter: Because
having had the curiosity to make some trial upon so
obvious a material as quick Lime, though the success
did not answer my designs, yet, neither was it so bad,
but that some luminous quality was produced in the
Lime by the action of the fire, and a saline Liquor;
and I scarce question but other materials will be found
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40537:47"/>
capable of being made luminous by the same or the
like operation, that is imploy'd by <hi>Baldwinus,</hi> when
that learned man shall think fit to communicate his way
to the Publick. But to return to what I was saying,
that the contact of the Air might be rather hurtful
than advantagious to the Phosphorus, I shall only add
here as matter of fact, (for my conjectures about
Light belong to my yet unpublisht Notes, <hi>of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of Qualities)</hi> that whereas the contact of the
Air, though it were not free, did in a few days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the luminousness of a good Phosphorus, yet
having included another in a Receiver, whence we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
pumpt out the Air, this matter though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to the other in vividness was so little spoiled
by lying open in our Vacuum, that at the end of
not only some weeks, but some months, I found
that the beams of a Candle passing to it through
the Receiver, would notwithstanding the Vacuum
it yet continues in, suffice to re-excite in it a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
light.</p>
               <p>Thus far was the communication of this excellent
person, who it's hoped may be further prevailed with
to communicate those other accurate observations,
and curious researches he hath made concerning the
light of the <hi>Bononian</hi> Stone, and the <hi>Phosphoros Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wini,</hi>
which are indeed truly admirable, and very
much differing from the usual processes of Nature
for the exhibiting of light.</p>
               <p>Before I take leave of my Astronomical Readers,
I shall here acquaint them with some Collections I
have made of other Astronomical matters and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
which I hope will not be less pleasing to them
than they were at first to me. The Discoveries are
new, and not less significant. The first is,</p>

               <p>Conteining an account of his observation of Mercury
passing under the Sun.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gallet</hi> then acquaints Mr. <hi>Cassini</hi> with his observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ☿ <hi>sub</hi> ☉ and the whole method and process of
his observation. First, he fitted two excellent Telescopes,
the Glasses of which were given him by Mr. <hi>Jac. Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellius,</hi>
one of the Academy Royal of <hi>Paris.</hi> The one of
twenty three foot, he fitted with a Glass covered with
smooke, placed in the outward <hi>focus</hi> of the Eye-Glass:
The other of three foot he fixt to the Arm of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant
of the same Radius, this was so exquisite that
compared with one of <hi>Divini,</hi> which was chosen by
the care of <hi>Honorato Fabri,</hi> and procured by Monsieur
<hi>de Beauchamps,</hi> it was found to represent the objects
clearer: By this the figure of the Sun was cast on an
opposite Table, on which he had drawn a Circle of the
bigness proper to the Distance and Magnifying of the
Glasses to contain the whole Face of the Sun, and by
Parallel Circles had subdivided the same into digits
and Sexagesimals, he had also placed three threds in
the interior <hi>focus</hi> of the Glasses, that the middlemost
went through the Center, and the two outward
touched the Limb of the Sun by their shadow on the
Table, he had also a Pendulum Clock that vibrated
thrice in a second. Thus accoutred he watched the fifth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40537:48"/>
and sixth day, from Sun rising to Sun setting, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
after the Cloudy Sky had seemed to delude
his curiosity till Eleven a Clock almost, it then began
to open and discovered to him Mercury got within the
Eastern Limb of the Sun, about 1/10 of its Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
at length the Clouds being dispersed, the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
27° 45. high, or at 10 h. 54′ ☿ it self marked out
its own place in the disk of the ☉ by its own
shadow cast on the Table by the shorter tube. Then
he disposed the shadow of the aforesaid thred so Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel
to the Equator, that this figure of the Sun should
move between the outward ones, and that the middle
should mark out the Paralel described by the Center of
the Sun in motion, at the same time he took the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ☿ from this middle Parallel and the right Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by the number of Vibrations of the Pendulum,
from the Western Limb of the Sun, taken by the
shadow of a Perpendicular Cross-line to the other 3.
by the same means, also he measured the Diameter of
the Sun and of Mercury.</p>
               <p>Then to the end he might give less cause of doubt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his usual custom, he procured several friends
who were present and witnesses of all the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
after the fourth mentioned in the Table. During the
observation he took notice of these remarkable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
First, that Mercury through the long Tube was
very black, and of an Elliptical figure whose longest
Diameter was Parallel to the Equator, but in the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
through the lesser Telecope, it appeared round
and of a dusky red (like a spot observed by him in the
Sun from the Ninth to the Fifteenth of <hi>April.)</hi> Secondly,
that the Diameter of mercury going out of the Disc
of the Sun, when it toucht the periphery seemed to be
of four times the Diameter it appeared of through the
whole Phase, so that Mr. <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> who watched
the exit with the longer Tube, whilst he himself min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Quadrant in order to take the Altitude of the
Sun, at the time of the exit cried out, O how large do
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40537:48"/>
I see the Diameter of Mercury now, it does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave the Sun, but is confused with it, or as it were
melts into it, and presently it vanisht, the Sun being
then 13. 23′. high.</p>
               <p>He further adds that before he leaves to speak of the
Sun, he will here insert an observation that he had
made of four spots he had seen in the Sun in the first of
<hi>October</hi> last <hi>(St. No.)</hi> with this his longer Telescope,
one only of which was visible by the Species cast with
the lesser Glass.</p>

               <p>The Contents of which are,</p>
               <p>That designing to observe this passage of ☿ under ☉
he with his Tube watchfully looked for it in the Suns
place, from the 5th to the 7th. day, with a Telescope of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40537:49"/>
23 foot (as above) he observed a spot of an elliptical
figure which had already gotten a 16th. part of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter
of the Sun within the limb, and declined
a little to the South in respect of the parallel of the
Aequator drawn through the Suns center, at 10 hours
26 min. but the Clouds hindering he could not observe
its motion till it had ascended as high as the parallel:
when the Suns altitude was 27. 45. or 10 a Clock 54
minutes. From the quickness of its motion he soon
found it to be ☿ and not a spot, and therefore
he forsook not his Quadrant to which was fitted his
three foot Telescope and Table to receive the figure
of the ☉ but observed the times of the Immersions and
the Emersion of ☿ by the help thereof, being assisted
by several of his friends who were witnesses of what
passed, and particularly by the Illustrious Monsieur
<hi>De Beauchamp,</hi> who with the twenty three foot Glass
determined the Exit of <hi>Mercury,</hi> whilest he himself
took the Altitude of the Sun with his Quadrant, as in
the tenth Observation.</p>

               <p>From this Observation he had the Declination of
Mercury in respect of the Parallel through the Center
of the Sun, and thence its absolute Declination from the
Equator, supposing the place of the Sun according to
<hi>Hecker,</hi> and the obliquity of the Ecliptick, 23, 30′ the
right Ascension also of ☿ appeared by the difference
of time between the Transit of ☿ and the West limb
of the Sun by the same meridian. Then from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and right Ascension of ☿ given by Trigono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical
Calculation, he found out the Longitude and
Latitude of it in every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Observation, and the time of
its true Conjunction.</p>

               <head>Vpon this Observation I find in the twenty
third Journal de Scavans of the Year
1677. Mr. Cassini made these Reflections.</head>
               <p>THat having compared this Observation of
Monsieur <hi>Gallet,</hi> of 1677. with that of
Mr. <hi>Gassendus,</hi> of 1631. the same day of the year, to
wit the seventh of <hi>November,</hi> he found that the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of ☿ at its leaving the Disc of the Sun, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by these two Astronomers were equal, even
to the sixth part of a minute. And by consequence
that ☿ was both in the one and the other Observation
at the same distance from its North node, and that it
traced in the Disc of the Sun an equal line: And for
that ☿ was here at the like distance from its Apoge;
as the Sun was also pretty near, the swiftness of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
motion in the Sun was equal. By the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mr. <hi>Gallet</hi> it is found considerably more slow
than that which Mr. <hi>Gassendus</hi> hath supposed from the
Rudolphin Tables of which he made use for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of it, not having been able to make Observation
immediately by reason of the Clouds. He believes
then that ☿ spent more then five hours in running
through the Disc of the Sun, since by the Observation of
Mr. <hi>Gallet,</hi> it hath spent 5 hours and 35 minutes, which
may serve for an Advertisement for determining more
exactly the time of the true conjunction of ☿ with the
☉ in the year 1631.</p>
               <p>The same equality of Latitude at Mercury's leaving
the Sun shews that the Sun was equally distant from
the Node of Mercury at the time of these two Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
And as the Sun was more advanced in that
of this year from 63 to 64 minutes, than in that of
the year 1631, So it follows that the septentrional
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40537:51"/>
Node of ☿ is advanced from 63 to 64 minutes in the
space of 46 years, as precisely as by the Rudolphin
Tables, which agree also exactly in the Epochas of the
Nodes: a matter of no small Importance in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which hath not a little difficulty to determine with
preciseness the Nodes of the Planets and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But having compared the observation of Mr. <hi>Gallet,</hi>
with that of Mr. <hi>Hevelius,</hi> in 1661. which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the third of <hi>May,</hi> in a place of the Zodiac oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to that of this year, he hath found the septentrion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Node of ☿ less advanced than the Meridional was in
the preceding Observation; so that if the Nodes of ☿
in regard of the Sun are precisely opposite the one to
the other, it appears that they have gone backward
since the year 1661. as do those of the Moon, and by
consequence their motion is sometimes direct, sometimes
retrograde: But if their motion is supposed uniform,
it will follow that the Line of the Nodes of ☿ doth
not pass at all through the center of the Sun, but that
it is removed from it towards the septentrional limit
about a two hundredth part of the Semidiameter of
the Orb of <hi>Mercury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far this knowing and accurate Astronomer
Monsieur <hi>Cassini,</hi> who we hear hath since farther dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
concerning this matter, which we hope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
so soon as he shall make it publick; and to add
some other curious Observations made by other hands,
I have as yet been able to procure but one more; but
that is one so considerable, that it will excite the skilful
Astronomers anew to ply their Calculations, to see what
the comparing of this with the rest will produce;
which as they come to my hands, I design to publish, as
I shall also somewhat of my own Observations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon:
and therefore I omit to make any reflections at
present. This Letter is of Mr. <hi>Edmund Hally,</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding

the Learned world is very much obliged for his patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing

hath not been sparing of his own pains and purse in

towards the perfecting thereof.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HOnored Sir, You may with reason wonder that I
should so long be negligent to write to your Worship,
to give you an account of my proceedings since my departure
from you, seeing that in the business I am now engaged upon,
the Honorable Sir <hi>Joseph Williamson,</hi> his Majesties Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Secretary of State, and your self are my only Patrons:
but I have not been unmindful of my Duty in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
only I delayed, that what I sent you might not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
inconsiderable. I hoped still that we might have
some clear weather when the Sun came near our Zenith,
that so I might give you an account that I had near hand fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Catalogue of the Southern Stars, which is my
principal concern; but such hath been my ill fortune, that
the Horizon of this Island is almost always covered with a
Cloud, which sometimes for some weeks together hath hid
the Stars from us, and when it is clear, is of so small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
that we cannot take any number of Observations at
once; so that now, when I expected to be returning, I have
not finished above half my intended work; and almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
to accomplish what you ought to expect from me. I will
yet try two or three months more, and if it continue in the
same constitution, I shall then, I hope be excusable if in that
time I cannot make an end. However it will be a great
grief to be so far frustrated in my first undertaking: I have
notwithstanding had the opportunity of observing the ingress
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40537:52"/>
and egress of ☿ on the ☉, which compared with the like
Observations made in <hi>England,</hi> will give a demonstration
of the Suns Parallax, which hitherto was never proved,
but by probable arguments. Likewise I have seen those two
Eclipses, one of the Sun, the other of the Moon in <hi>May</hi> last,
both which I send you, but the <hi>mighty winds, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
swift motion of the Clouds</hi> hindred the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Observations. That of the Moon may help for the
difference of our Meridians, which is about 7 degrees to
the Westwards of <hi>London:</hi> but it may more curiously be
found by <hi>Mercury sub Sole.</hi> There are three Stars of the
first Magnitude that never appear in <hi>England,</hi> but none
near the South Pole of any brightness, except one of the
third Magnitude, which is about ten degrees distant from
it. The two Nubeculae called by the Saylors the <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanick</hi>
Clouds, are both of them exactly like the whiteness
of the milky way lying within the Antartick Circle; they
are small, and in the Moon shine, scarce perceptible; yet in
the dark the bigger is very notable. I need not relate unto
you the temperature of the Weather for heat and cold here in
the Torrid Zone, you your self having long since had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of a Latitude little different: only this I shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
you, that ever since I came to this Island, we have had no
weather that is hotter than the Summer of <hi>England</hi> is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily.
Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> is a person wonderfully assistant to
me, in whose company all the good fortune I have had this
Voyage consisteth, to me all other things having been cross:
nevertheless I despair not of his Honors and your Worships
favour, which alone is sufficient to encourage me to bear
with patience these disappointments, and expect some fitter
opportunity.</p>

               <p>THE Globe of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whose Revolution about
its <hi>Axis</hi> was determined by the Observations of
Monsieur <hi>Cassini,</hi> in the Year
1665. to be 9 hours,<note place="margin">This Revolution of the body of ♃ upon its <hi>Axis</hi> I first discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>May</hi> 1664. and published in the first Transaction, which was a considerable time before it was discovered by Monsieur <hi>Cassini;</hi> but we are obliged to him for the perfecting the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
as we are also for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rare Discoveries and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
improvements in Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</note> and 56
minutes, is as it were a watch
for visibly pointing the hours
and minutes to half the Earth
at once; so that it shews the
same time to all under the same
Meridian, and a different time
to different Meridians, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they differ in Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>It hath for an Index of its motion one principal spot,
which is very neatly distinguished from the rest of its
surface, and seems from its figure and situation to have
some resemblance to the Caspian Sea of the Terraque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Globe. By the help of good Glasses it may be seen
passing the under Hemisphere of it, from the East to
the West, with a velocity so sensible, that one may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
to one or two minutes, the time that it comes
to the middle of the Disc, which is the place the most
fit for establishing of the Epochas, and for finding the
difference of Longitude. There may be a great number of
such Revolutions observed, since in one year of 365
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40537:53"/>
days there are made 882 Revolutions. But it doth
not appear in every year, but as if it were some kind
of Marish which is dried at certain times, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears
during two or 3000 Revolutions; and after it
hath remained thus imperceptible for some years, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
again to its former state. After it had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the last six months of the year 1665. and some
months of 1666. it became invisible till the beginning
of the year 1672. then being returned to its former ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
Monsieur <hi>Cassini</hi> compared the intervals of
the six years, and limited the revolution to be made in
9 hours, 55 minutes, 51 seconds; and continuing his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
to the end of the year 1674. he found by
these two years that it was too slow by two seconds
and a half: so that it appeared to be in 9 hours, 55 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
53 ½ seconds.</p>
               <p>This spot hath been invisible in 1675. and 1676. du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which space there happened other very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
changes in the body of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> for the clear inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
which was between the two dark belts of <hi>Jupiter</hi>
was separated into many little parts, in the manner like
so many Islands; as if the two obscure belts had been
two great Rivers broken one into the other, and had
left these parts which appeared like Islands, which yet
were at last all effaced, and the two dark belts, and
the interjacent space at length all coalesced into one
large belt. But after the coming of <hi>Jupiter</hi> out of the
Rays of the Sun in the year 1677. the belts again took
their form, and situation which they had heretofore;
to wit, the same which is described in the 24 figure.
The principal spot appeared anew after the beginning
of <hi>July</hi> last. Monsieur <hi>Cassini</hi> found this spot in the
middle of <hi>Jupiter</hi> the night after the eighth of the said
month, at 13 minutes after one at night; and hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
ever since observed it at the hours proper to its
revolution. Having compared many Observations of
this year with as many others made the same days of
the year 1665. for avoiding the scruples which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40537:54"/>
from the inequality of times, he hath found by the
intervals of twelve years that those revolutions compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the one with the other, complete themselves in 9
hours, 55 minutes, 52 seconds, and 5 or 6 thirds. And
because that in the years 1672, 1673. they appeared
more slow by 2 seconds and a half, during the time that
<hi>Jupiter</hi> was in its greatest elevation from the Sun.
Monsieur <hi>Cassini</hi> inclines to suppose that these revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have some little inequality depending on the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the distance of ♃ from the ☉, and that they
are a little slower when ♃ is more removed, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
faster when nearer approached that body; the
same which several great Astronomers have supposed to
happen to the Diurnal Revolutions of the Earth in the
Copernican Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>In this account he hath separated the inequality
which doth result from the variation of the two equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> (as he hath explained in divers Letters
in 1665.) the which may amount to one half hour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the inequality of natural days, which according
to his Hypothesis may amount to 16 minutes.</p>
               <p>For the finding then of the return of the principal
spot to the middle of ♃ for many years to half an hour
or thereabout, there needs nothing but adding still the
time of the period to the Epoche of the 8. of <hi>July,
1677.</hi> and for the finding precisely, even to some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
the two inequalities of <hi>Jupiter</hi> must be observed
according to the following Rule.</p>

            <head>MICROSCOPIVM:
OR,
Some new Discoveries made with and
concerning Microscopes.</head>
            <head type="sub">A Letter of the Ingenious and Inquisitive Mr. Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoeck
of Delft, sent to the Secretary fo the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<date>October 5. 1677.</date>
            </head>
            <p>IN this Letter after the Relation of many curious
Observations made with his Microscope, he adds,</p>
            <q>
               <p>By some of my former Letters I have related what an
innumerable company of little Animalcules, I have
discovered in waters; of the truth of which affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that I might satisfie the Illustrious Philosophers
of your Society, I have here sent the Testimonials of
eight credible persons; some of which affirm they
have seen 10000, others 30000, others 45000 little
living Creatures, in a quantity of water as big as a
grain of Millet (92 of which go to the making up the
bigness of a green Pea, or the quanitty of a natural
drop of water) in the desiring of which Testimonials
I made it my request that they would only justifie
(that they might be within compass) half the number
that they believed each of them saw in the water, and
even so the number of those little creatures that would
thereby be proved to be in one drop of water would
be so great, that it would exceed belief. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by my Letter of the 9th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1676. I affirmed
that there were more than 1000000 living Creatures
contained in one drop of Pepper-water. I should not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40537:55"/>
have varied from the truth of it, if I had asserted that
there were 8000000; for if according to some of the
included testimonials there might be found in a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water as big as a millet seed, no less than 45000
animalcules. It would follow that in an ordinary drop
of this water there would be no less than 4140000
living creatures, which number if doubled will make
8280000 living Creatures seen in the quantity of one
drop of water, which quantity I can with truth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
I have discerned.</p>
               <p>This exceeds belief. But I do affirm, that if a larger
grain of sand were broken into 8000000 of equal
parts, one of these would not exceed the bigness of one
of those little creatures; which being understood, it
will not seem so incredible to believe that there may
be so great a number in the quantity of one drop of
water.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Upon the perusal of this Letter, being extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to examine this matter farther, and to be ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by ocular inspection as well as from testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.
I put in order such remainders as I had of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Microscopes (having by reason of a weakness in
my sight omitted the use of them for many years) and
steeped some black pepper in River water, but exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that water about two or three days after, I could
not by any means discover any of those little creatures
mentioned in the aforesaid Letter: though I had made
use of small glass canes drawn hollow for that purpose,
and of a Microscope that I was certain would discover
things much smaller than such as the aforesaid Mr. <hi>Leeuw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enhoeck</hi>
had affirmed these creatures to be; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that the light was not convenient (the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of which I shall shew by and by) having looked only
against the clear sky, or that they were not yet generated,
which I rather suppose, I could not discover any. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
therefore either that my Microscope was not so
good as that he made use of, or that the time of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40537:55"/>
year (which was in <hi>November)</hi> was not so fit for such
generations, or else that there might be somewhat as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to the difference of places; as that <hi>Holland</hi>
might be more proper for the production of such little
creatures than <hi>England.</hi> I omitted therefore farther
to look after them, for about five or six days, when
finding it a warm day, I examined again the said wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and then much to wonder I discovered vast mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of those exceeding small creatures, which Mr.
<hi>Leeuwenhoeck</hi> had described; and upon making use of
other lights and glasses, as I shall by and by shew, I not
only magnified those I had thus discovered to a very
great bigness, but I discovered many other sorts very
much smaller than those I first saw, and some of these so
exceeding small, that millions of millions might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in one drop of water. I was very much surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at this so wonderful a spectacle, having never seen
any living creature comparable to these for smallness:
nor could I indeed imagine that nature had afforded
instances of so exceedingly minute animal productions.
But nature is not to be limited by our narrow appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions;
future improvements of glasses may yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enlighten our understanding, and ocular inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may demonstrate that which as yet we may think
too extravagant either to feign or suppose.</p>
            <p>Of this, A later Discovery of Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoeck</hi> does
seem to give good probabilities; for by a Letter of his
since sent (the which is hereunto annexed) it appears
he hath discovered a certain sort of Eels in Pepper-water,
which are not in breadth above one thousandth
part of the breadth of a hair; and not above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part of the length of a vinegar Eel.</p>

                  <head>Mr. Leeuwenhoecks Second Letter.</head>
                  <p>SIR, Yours of the thirtieth of <hi>November</hi> I received
not till <hi>January,</hi> whereby understanding the kind
reception of my former by the <hi>R.S.</hi> I here return my
acknowledgment to that illustrious Company for their
great civility: but I wonder that in your Letter I find
no mention made of my Observations of the second of
<hi>December, St. No.</hi> which makes me doubt whether the
same came to your hands.</p>
                  <p>Since you assure me that what I send of this nature
will be acceptable to the renowned Society, I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
again to send you some of my farther Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to be communicated to that learned Philosophical
Company. Since I wrote of the Blood of Eels, and
of young Eels, I have not been idle to view Blood,
but especially my own, which for some time I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigably
examined, after that I had put it into all
conceivable motions. Among which Observations I
well saw that the <hi>globuli</hi> of my own blood took the
same figure which I formerly mentioned, that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
of the blood of Eels appeared of to the eye:
upon seeing which I doubted again at the cause of the
smart which the blood of the Eels causes in the eye.</p>
                  <p>These my many times repeated Observations of my
own blood I made to no other end, than if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to observe the parts out of which the Globules
of the blood consisted: With observing this, I found
the globulous blood much more pliable than I did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the same before. I have at several times bended
these Globules before my eyes, that they were three
times as long as broad, without breaking the Vesicule
of them: and besides I saw that the Globules of blood
in passing by and through one another, did by reason
of their pliableness receive many sorts of figures, and
coming thence into a larger place, they recovered their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40537:56"/>
former globulosity which was a very great pleasure
to observe: and withal, that the Globules of blood
coming many together, and growing cold thereby,
came to unite, and made a matter very smooth,
wherein there were no more parts distinct to be taken
notice of, much after the same manner as if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
a Dish filled with balls of wax set over a fire,
by which they would quickly be melted together, and
united into one mass; by which uniting of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,
I concluded this to be the reason of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
which is called the <hi>cold fire,</hi> and of that also
which causes the hands or fingers to be lost by cold:
but I leave this to others. And I did very clearly also
discover that there were six other smaller Globules of
blood contained within each of the former and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Globulous Vesicles: and withal, I took much
pains to observe the number of the same very small
globules, out of which the greater Globules do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist:
that at last I strongly imagined, that every of the
greater Globules consisted of six smaller Globules, no
less pliable than the aforesaid: for oftentimes I saw
very clearly how the small Globules joyned and ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
themselves according to the figure the Vesicle
or larger Globule stretched at length had taken, being
themselves stretched after the same manner: and thus
made one of the larger Globules stretcht out, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the lesser within it stretched also with it,
as if it consisted of long threads. Moreover, I
put the greater Globules into so violent a motion, that
their Vesicles burst in pieces, and then the lesser Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
appeared plainly to be scattered. This first
Globule I can see as plainly and great, as with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
eye one should look upon the eggs or spawn of a
Cod-fish.</p>
                  <p>About nine or ten years since Dr. <hi>Graff</hi> opened in
my presence the vein of a Dog, and let out so much
blood that the Dog grew faint; then he opened the
Artery of another Dog, and by a pipe transfused the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40537:57"/>
blood of this second into the first, whereby the first
was recovered, the second was faint. Then the said Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
injected back into the Artery of the second, a
quantity of Cows milk, supposing thereby to preserve
the second dog alive, saying, milk was blood: but
no sooner was the milk put into the artery, but the
dog died. And whereas 'tis commonly said that milk
is Blood, therefore I shall relate of what parts the
Milk consists, so far as I have hitherto discovered. I
have said heretofore that the Milk doth consist of
Globules swimming in a thin clear watery matter
which we call Whey: but as the great <hi>Globuli</hi> of
Blood are all of the same bigness, so in the Milk they
are quite differing, being of as many sizes and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
as we can imagine, between the smallest sand,
and a barely corn; all of them being as clear as Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal;
save only that through and between the same
drive some irregular particles for the most part roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
these had a fatty substance, which I imagined
to be the latter: their irregularity I imagined came
from the impression of the encompassing Globules
made on them, in which posture they grew cold.</p>
                  <p>Viewing the aforesaid differences of the Milk Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,
I supposed that the Milk vessels have no
other parts included but the matter out of which they
are all made; and that the same matter, so long as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the vessels, consisted of one uniform matter,
so that one could not distinguish parts; and that the
same vessels discharging this uniform matter into other
vessels, containing a substance of a quite differing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which I suppose to be the Whey, comes to be
separated into these Globules of so differing magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
This may be represented by having two ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
filled, the one with Fat, representing Whey; the
other with Quicksilver, resembling the uniform mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Milk: these blended together, the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver
will be separated into small Globules of differing
magnitudes, and kept distinct by the fat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:40537:57"/>
Or further, it may be explained by a dissolution of
some gums in Spirit of Wine, a drop of which being
put into rain water (which I compare to Whey) the
Gum becomes separated immediately into an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of small clear Globules, which makes it
appear also as white as Milk it self: and thence I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the whiteness of Milk hath the same cause.</p>
                  <p>I have been often minded by some, that flesh was
nothing else but clodded blood; yet for all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
I was never able to find the first particles of
blood in the fibers of the flesh, but only such as are
contained in the first Globules.</p>
                  <p>The last Summer being sickly for some weeks, I
voided much Flegm, which was green, tough, and
acid in the throat, which yet continues; but nothing
near so much as before: and some of it which I void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the morning was of so heavy a matter, that it
sunk in the water: the ponderosity of it I found to
proceed from its not being filled with airy bubbles,
which most Flegms are mixed with. By this means I
observed my Flegm very often, and found it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of tough slimy moisture, mixt with many Globules;
and the tougher the Flegm was, the greater was the
quantity of Globules; and from them also proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the green colour of it. All these Globules were of
one and the same bigness with the first Globules of
the blood; and indeed the blood is of the same
make, but only of a different colour: for as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the greater blood Globules to consist of six
lesser, so here I could see them more plain; only they
seemed more slender and tender than in the blood:
the reason whereof I suppose to be that the vesicules of
the Flegm Globules had already received some kind
of corruption: besides, there was mixt with the tough
part of the Flegm great quantity of very thin cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
and in the same manner as I have heretofore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
how our cuticle is supplied underneath, as the
upper part is rubbed off in scurf, so I suppose the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40537:58"/>
cuticles of the gullet <hi>aspera arteria,</hi> and other ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
are taken off by the Flegm. There drove also,
through the Flegm some other particles, which from
their smallness I could not assign them a figure, but I
conceived them rather cubical than round. I did last
Summer shut up some Caterpillers to spin Webs, and
within these few days I broke some of these Webs,
when from each of them came out a flie, which from
the cold were very weak, and were unable to stand;
by which I conceive that those which came not out in
the latter part of the year, remain the whole Winter
in their Webs, till the warmth makes them come out.
I was pleased to understand that your self and the
<hi>Society</hi> had seen in so small a quantiy of water as a
sand, so great a number of Creatures; as also, that I
shall be partaker of what you shall observe, which I
shall with longing desire expect. I cannot but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that that small sort of Creature which I hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could give no description of, I now see their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
And for the pleasure I take in the various plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
shapes, with their motions, which do now and
then appear in the water, I have the fourth of this
month, when it froze hard, taken a third part of beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
pepper, and 2/3 of high rain water in a clean glass,
which I set the first night in my Bed-chamber; the next
day, the weather being milder, I set it in my Counting-house,
and in three times 24 hours discovered so
great a number, and so unexpressible small Creatures,
that 'tis hard to be conceived; and according to my
judgment, the most of them were much less than a
thousandth part of the thickness of the hair of ones
head, and three or four times as long as thick; the
which made, with the hinder part of their body, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so swift a progress, as when we observe a Pike
shooting through the water, and every shoot was in
length most times about half a hairs breadth; the
other sorts or kind of which were yet smaller, whose
shape for brevity I omit; only I shall say, that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40537:58"/>
times in pepper-water which hath stood somewhat
long, among the very small Creatures, I have seen a
sort of small Eels which had their shapes and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as perfect as great ones: these were to my
appearance a thousand times thinner than the hair of
ones head, and that if 100 of these small Eels were
laid in length one behind another, the whole length
would not extend to the length of the Eel in vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
Whether you have also observed these small
Creatures with your Microscope, I shall be glad to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.
I would willingly also be informed whether
my Letter of the second of <hi>December</hi> mention'd above
be come to your hands, and how those Observations
do please the Gentlemen of your Society; and also
to understand the receipt of this.</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>The manner how the said Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoeck</hi> doth make
these discoveries, he doth as yet not think fit to impart,
for reasons best known to himself; and therefore I am
not able to acquaint you with what it is: but as to the
ways I have made use of, I here freely discover that all
such persons as have a desire to make any enquiries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Nature this way, may be the better inabled so to do.</p>
            <p>First, for the manner of holding the liquor, so as to
examine it by the Microscope, I find that the way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoeck</hi> is to include the same in a
very fine pipe of glass, and then to view it by
the help of the Microscope; for by placing that at a
due distance, whatever is contained in the said liquor
will most easily be discovered: The liquor will most
easily insinuate it self into the cavity of the said pipe,
if the end thereof only be just put within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
This as it is exceedingly convenient for many
trials, so is it not very difficult to prepare; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every one is not instructed how to proceed in
this matter, and it may cause him more trouble than
needs to procure them, I will here describe the way;
and so much the rather, because the same <hi>apparatus</hi> will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40537:59"/>
serve for the preparing of Microscopes: as I shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
shew.</p>
            <p>Provide then a box made of tin, with a flat bottom,
and upright on all sides; let this have fixed within it to
the bottom a small piece of tin, hollowed like a ridg
tile, so that the wiek of the Lamp may lie and rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and let the Tin-man fix on it a cover of tin, so
that there may be only left one part of the aforesaid
box open, to wit, where the bent tin piece and the
wiek do lie and come above the sides: this cover may
be turned back on its hinges when there is occasion to
raise the wiek, or put in more oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for the most
part ought to lie flat and covered; for whilst it is using,
it is necessary to keep the flame from spreading too
much, and taking fire all over. This box must stand
within another box of tin, made large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it; the use of which is to keep the former Lamp
Box from fowling the board or table on which it
stands: This stands upon a board about one foot square,
into which is fastned a standard or stick upright, cleft
so as to pinch and hold the sodering pipe between its
clefts, which may be fastned with a screw, or a slipping
ring; through which pipe, blowing with your breath,
the flame will be darted forward with great swiftness
and brightness: if then into this flame you hold a small
piece of a glass pipe, made of white glass, (for green
glass, or coarser glass will not be melted easily in this
flame) and keep it turning round between your fingers
and thumbs, you shall find that the flame will in a very
short time melt the middle part of the said pipe; so
that if you remove it out of the flame, and draw your
hands one from another, you may easily draw the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
pipe into a very small size, which will yet remain
hollow, though drawn never so small. The best Oyl
for this purpose is good clean Sallat Oyl, or Oyl Olive;
but high rectified Spirit of Wine is yet better, and
cleanlier, but much more chargeable; and for most uses
the Oyl Olive will serve. This I have set down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40537:59"/>
many who are far off in the Country cannot have
the convenience of going to a Lamp-blower as oft as
they have occasion for such pipes; which if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
themselves with small white glass pipes from the
Potters, they may accommodate themselves withal,
though they have nothing but a large candle, and a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipe,
instead of the aforesaid <hi>apparatus,</hi> though
not altogether so conveniently. But I would rather
advise them to have a Lamp made, which most Tin-men
know how to fit and prepare; and so it will not need
much more description.</p>
            <p>But this way of Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoecks,</hi> of holding the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
in small glass pipes, though it be exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
and very convenient for many examinations,
yet for divers others 'tis not so well accommodated as
this which I contrived my self for my own trials, at
least for those Microscopes I make use of; what it may
be for those which Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoeck</hi> uses I know not.</p>
            <p>I take then instead of a glass pipe a very thin plate
of <hi>Muscovy</hi> glass, this serves instead of the moveable
plate which is usually put upon the pedestal of Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes;
but because the common pedestal hitherto
made use of in Microscopes is generally not so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for trials of this nature, I lay those by, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
thereof I fix into the bottom of the Tube of the
Microscope, a cylindrical rod of Brass or Iron. Upon
this a little socket is made to slide to and fro; and by
means of a pretty stiff spring, will stand fast in any
place. This hath fastned to it a joynted arm of three or
four joynts, and at the end a plate about the bigness of
a half crown, with a hole in the middle of it about
three quarters of an inch wide; upon this plate I lay
the <hi>Muscovy</hi> glass, and upon that I spread a very little
of the liquor to be examined; then looking against
the flame of a Candle, or a Lamp, or a small reflection
of the Sun from a globular body; all such parts of
the liquor as have differing refraction will manifestly
appear. By this means I examined the water in which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40537:60"/>
I had steeped the pepper I formerly mentioned;
and as if I had been looking upon a Sea, I saw infinite
of small living Creatures swimming and playing up and
down in it, a thing indeed very wonderful to behold.</p>
            <p>If the flame of the candle were directly before the
Microscope, then all those little Creatures appeared
perfectly defin'd by a black line, and the bodies of
them somewhat darker than the water; but if the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
were removed a little out of the axis of vision, all
those little Creatures appeared like so many small pearls,
or little bubbles of air, and the liquor in which they
swimmed appeared dark; but when the water began
to dry off, the bending of the superficies of the liquor
over their backs, and over the tops of other small motes
which were in the water made a confused appearance,
which some not used to these kind of examinations,
took to be quite differing things from what they were
really; and the appearances here are so very strange,
that to one not well accustomed to the phaenomena of
fluids of differing figures and refractions, the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of substances this way will be very apt to mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
rather than instruct him; especially of such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as are not perfectly fluid, and will not readily
and naturally smooth their own superficies, such as
Tallow, concreted Oyls, Marrow, Brains, Fat, inspissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
juyces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for if those substances be so examined
by spreading them upon this plate, and be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against the candle, or other small defined light, all
the inequalities left on the surface by the spreading do
by the refractions of the rays of light render such odd
appearances, that they will easily deceive the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and make him to conceive that to be in the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the part which is really no where but in the
make of the superficies of it. This therefore as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great inconvenience to be met with in Microscopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Observations, I prevent by these ensuing methods:
First, all such bodies as Fat, Oyl, Brains, Rhobs, <hi>Pus,</hi>
tough concreted Flegm, and the like, whose surfaces
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40537:60"/>
are irregular, and ought to be reduced to smoothness
before they can be well examined, I order in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
First, I provide a very clear and thin piece of
looking-glass plate very smooth and plain on both sides,
and clean from foulness: upon the surface of this I lay
some of those substances I last mentioned, then with
such another piece of Looking-glass plate laid upon
the said substance I press it so thin as not only to make
the surfaces of it very smooth, but also to make the
substance of it very thin; because otherwise, if the
substance be pretty thick, as suppose as thick as a piece
of <hi>Venice</hi> paper, if it be a whitish substance, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of parts lying one upon another in such a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
do so confound the sight, that none of them all
can be distinctly seen: but if by squeezing the said plates
hard, and close together, it be reduced to a twentieth
part perhaps of that thickness, the substance may be
well looked through, and the constituent parts may
be very plainly discovered. Thus also 'tis very visible
in the Globules of milk and blood, discovered by the
ingenious Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoeck,</hi> for when either of those
substances are thick, the multitude of those little Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
confound and thicken the liquor so as one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive any thing until it be run very thin; for
then all the remaining Globules with their motions may
very distinctly be apprehended. This therefore is an
expedient by which thousands of substances may be
examined; and therefore the more fit to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
that there may be the greater number of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
well accommodated for such trials. These plates
therefore may be contrived so as to be pinched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the help of screws, and a frame, that thereby
they may be forced the closer and the evener together,
as there shall be occasion; and may be kept firm and
steady in that posture, and then, that it may some
ways or other be conveniently fastned to the former
plate, so as to be moved this way or that way steadily,
as there shall be occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40537:61"/>
But there are other substances which none of these
ways I have yet mentioned will examine, and those
are such parts of animal or vegetable bodies as have a
peculiar form, figure, or shape, out of which if it be
put, the principal thing looked after is destroyed:
such are the Nerves, Muscles, Tendons, Ligaments,
Membranes, Glandules, Parenchymas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Animals, and the Pulps, Piths, Woods, Barks,
Leaves, Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Vegetables. Some of these
which are not made by dissection or separation from
other parts may be viewed alone; but there are others
which cannot be well examined unless they be made to
swim in a liquor proper and convenient for them: as
for instance, the parts of flesh, muscles and tendons:
for if you view the fibres of a muscle encompassed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the air, you cannot discover the small parts out
of which it is made: but if the same be put into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
as water, or very clear oyl, you may clearly see
such a fabrick as is truly very admirable, and such as
none hitherto hath discovered that ever I could meet
with; of which more hereafter, when I shew the true
mechanical fabrick thereof, and what causes its motion.
Thus if you view a thred of a Ligament, you shall
plainly see it to be made up of an infinite company of
exceeding small threads smooth and round, lying close
together; each of which threads is not above a four
hundredth part of the bigness of a hair: for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
those of Beef with a hair of my head, which was
very fine and small, <hi>viz.</hi> about a 640. part of an inch, I
found the Diameter thereof to be more than twenty
times the Diameter of these threads; so that no less
than 163 millions, besides 840 thousands of these must
be in a ligament one inch square. I shall not here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
upon the admirable contrivance of Nature in this
particular, nor say any thing farther of the reason of
the greater strength of the same substance drawn into
smaller than into greater threads; but only this in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that the mechanical operations of these minute
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40537:61"/>
bodies are quite differing from those of bodies of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
bulk, and the want of considering this one thing
hath been the cause of very great absurdities in the
Hypotheses of some of our more eminent modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers:
For he that imagines the actions of these
lesser bodies the same with those of the larger
and tractable bodies, will indeed make but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
wooden hand at best. This put me in mind
likewise of advertising the Experimenter that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himself with instruments, by which, to stretch
and pull in pieces any substance whilst the same
is yet in view of the Microscope, of which there
may be many which any one will easily contrive, when
he hath this hint given him of the usefulness thereof in
the examination of the texture of several substances;
as of Tendons, Nerves, Muscles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> those I have made
use of were made to open like a pair of Tobacco
Tongues, by two angular plates of thin brass rivetted
together, which by pinching the opposite end, would
either open or shut at the other, as I had occasion.
These having a part extended between the two tops,
were fixt at a due distance from the object-glass that
the body extended between them might be distinctly
seen; then with my finger squeezing together the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
ends, the other ends opened, by which means
how the parts stretched and shrunk might be plainly
discovered. Now as this is of use for some kind of
substances, so the two glass plates are for others, and
particularly for squeezing of several substances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, so as to break them in pieces, as those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Creatures in pepper-water, or the Globules in blood,
milk, flegm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the parts within them may
yet farther be enquired into, as Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoeck</hi> I find
hath done by his latest Observations. Whether he makes
use of this way, or some other, I know not.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a description of the appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it remains that I come to the description of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40537:62"/>
it self, which is the principal instrument, and
without which all the rest are insignificant.</p>
            <p>The Microscopes then I design here to describe, are
only of two kinds, either single or double.</p>
            <p>The single Microscope I call that which consisteth
only of one glass, though it have a double refracting
superficies; and the double one I call that which is
compounded of two glasses, though it hath for the most
part a quadruple refraction of the Rays.</p>
            <p>The single Microscope then consisteth of one small
<hi>lens</hi> so fastened into a cell, that the eye may come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
to look through the middle part or <hi>Axis</hi> of
it; of these there are various sorts, as double Convexes,
or plain Convexes, or perfectly spherical.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to describe the common <hi>lenses</hi> which
are every where made use of for this purpose, being
plano-convexes of Spheres about half an inch Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
save only this, that 'tis best to turn the plain side
towards the object, and the convex to the eye: nor
shall I say much concerning those double Convex Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
there being no great difficulty in the making or
using of them; but that the smaller the sphere is in
which they are made, the nearer do they bring the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the eye; and consequently the more is the object
magnified, and the better and truer they are polisht in
the Tool, the more clear and distinct doth the object
appear, but to make any of a Sphere less than 1/10 of
an inch in Diameter is exceeding difficult, by reason
that the glass becomes too small to be tractable; and
'tis very difficult to find a cement that will hold it fast
whilst it be completed; and when 'tis polisht, 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
difficult to handle and put into its cell: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
I have found the use of them offensive to my eye,
and to have much strained and weakened the sight,
which was the reason why I omitted to make use of
them, though in truth they do make the object appear
much more clear and distinct, and magnifie as much as
the double Microscopes: nay, to those whose eyes can
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40537:62"/>
well endure it, 'tis possible with a single Microscope to
make discoveries much better than with a double one,
because the colours which do much disturb the clear
vision in double Microscopes is clearly avoided and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
in the single. The single Microscope therefore
which I shall here describe, as it is exceeding easie to
make, so is it much more tractable than the double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
glasses made the common way by working them in
a hollow Hemisphere with water and sand; for those,
supposing them made with all the accurateness imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
will be far short from being so well polisht as
these; and wanting the stem or handle which these
have, they are infinitely troublesome to remove, or
place, or to cleanse when there shall be occasion.</p>
            <p>Take then a small rod of the clearest and cleanest
glass you can procure, free if possible from blebbs, sands,
or veins; then by melting it in the flame of a Lamp
made with Spirit of Wine, or the cleanest and purest
Sallet Oyl, draw it out into exceeding fine and small
threads; then take a small piece of these threads, and
in the same flame of the aforesaid Lamp melt the end of
it, till you perceive it to run into a little ball or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule
of the bigness desired; then suffer it to cool, and
handling it by the aforesaid thread of glass, which is as
it were a handle to it, fix it with a little wax upon the
side of a thin plate of Brass, Silver, or the like, that the
middle of it may lie directly over the middle of a small
hole pricked through the said thin plate with a needle:
then holding this plate close to the eye, look through
the said little hole, and thereby you may also see very
clearly through the aforesaid Globule, fixed with wax
on the side that is from the eye: if then either by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
joynted arm, or by a little soft wax, and a needle,
or a thin plate of Muscovy glass, you fix the object you
would examine; so that it may be at a due distance from
the said little Globule, you will perceive the minute
parts thereof very distinct. The <hi>focus</hi> of a sphere looked
on by the naked eye, is about half the <hi>radius</hi> of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40537:63"/>
sphere, without the superficies of it; but this is varied
much by the age of the eye that looks through it, by
the imagination also of the person, and by the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
specifique refraction of the glass made use of.</p>
            <p>By this means I have prodigiously magnified some
small bodies, insomuch that I have been able to see and
distinguish the particles of bodies, not only a million
of times smaller than a visible point, but even to make
those visible, whereof a million of millions of them
would hardly make the bulk of the smallest visible sand;
so prodigiously do these exceeding the little Globules of
glass inlarge the prospect of humane sight into the more
private recesses of nature.</p>
            <p>If the things to be viewed be liquors, they may be
included either in those little pipes of Mr <hi>Leeuwenhoeck</hi>
I newly mentioned, or else they may be put upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
thin plates of <hi>Muscovy</hi> glass or <hi>Selenites,</hi> and
the other side of the plate may be made to touch the
Globule, or at least be fixed at such distance, as may
make the parts of the liquor distinct: If you make use
of a Looking-glass plate to spread the liquor upon you
would examine, you may turn the liquor towards the
Globule, and you may therein easily see all the parts
very distinctly, without at all hurting the prospect by
the interposition of the <hi>Muscovy</hi> glass; which though
it be exceeding clear, especially if the plates be very
thin, yet hath it some flaws, and some opacousnesses in
it, which do somewhat cloud the prospect.</p>
            <p>If further, you would have a Microscope with one
single refraction, and consequently capable of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
clearness and brightness that any one kind of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscopes
can possibly be imagined susceptible of, when
you have fixt one of these little Globules as I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and spread a little of the liquor upon a piece
of Looking-glass plate, then apply the said plate with
the liquor, next to the Globule, and gently move it
close to the Globule, till the liquor touch; which done,
you will find the liquor presently to adhere to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40537:63"/>
Globule, and still to adhere to it though you move it
back again a little; by which means, this liquor being
of a specifique refraction, not much differing from glass,
the second refraction is quite taken off, and little or
none left but that of the convex side of the Globule
next the eye; by which means as much of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of refraction as is possible is removed, and
that by the easiest and most practicable expedient that
can be desired. I could add various other ways of
making these Globular bodies both of glass and other
substances which will yet farther advance our prospect
into nature, and are pleasant to admiration; but those I
shall yet reserve till I see what effects the publishing of
these may produce, and to the end to excite other
persons to be inquisitive into this matter: for let me as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
them, very much more may yet be done by a way
I know, than by this I have here published. And I
confess I have very often wondered that no farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
had been made of this Principle, since I
publisht it in the year 1664. in the 20. page of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to <hi>Micrographia:</hi> for though some other reasons
discouraged me from prosecuting those enquiries,
yet I hoped that others might long before this have
carried it much farther.</p>
            <p>The only inconvenience in these kinds of Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes,
is, that the object is necessarily brought so near
the glass, that none but such as are transparent, and to
be viewed by a through light are capable of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by them: such therefore are to be examined by the
double Microscope; which, as it is abundantly more
tractable, so doth it much less strain the eye; and from
the easiness of its use, when well fitted, is much more
pleasant: and if ordered as it ought, will magnifie as
much more than the common ones hitherto made, as
those did more than the naked eye.</p>
            <p>Both these Microscopes I have directed Mr. <hi>Christopher
Cock,</hi> in <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> how to prepare, that such as will not
trouble themselves in the making of them, may know
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40537:64"/>
where to be accommodated with such as are good.</p>
            <p>And of the improvement of this kind of Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
I see no limits, especially as to the augmenting
the visible appearance of such objects as are capable of
enduring the increase of light; for since 'tis demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that light may be augmented upon any one object
susceptible to any given degree, and that by the double
Microscope the image can be augmented to any assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
magnitude, what but the difficulty of making all
things correspondent should limit the power of such an
instrument. Now the making of this double Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
though it be somewhat more difficult than of the
single one, yet the tractableness thereof when well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and its easiness to be cleansed, and applied to use,
makes amends for the extraordinary charge, especially
the situation of the object; which being capable of
any reasonable distance from the object glass, so as to
be fit for examination, makes it very desirable. Now
as in all other mechanical contrivances, that is best
which is plainest, and most simple: so is it in this,
wherein nothing more is required, but two plano Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
glasses, the one for the object-glass, and the other
for the eye-glass: the less the spheres of the glasses be,
the more do they magnifie the object; and the thinner
and clearer the substance of them be, and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
shaped, and the brighter they are polisht, the
clearer do they represent it; and the longer the glasses
are distant from each other, the more is the image mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
<hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> though indeed the same thing is
performed by glasses of very differing magnitudes, due
proportions of all things about it being kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
For if as the distance of one object from the
object-glass is to the distance of another object from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
object-glass, so the distance of the first image be
to the distance of the second image, the image in both
must be equal: if therefore this image be viewed with
equal glasses the image must be equally magnified at
the bottom of the eye; so that in this way the object is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40537:64"/>
capable of a double way of augmenting, <hi>viz.</hi> first, the
augmenting the figure in the Tube, by the smallness of
the object-Glass, and length of the Tube: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the augmenting that image in the bottom of the
eye, and that is by the Eye-glass; give therefore light
enough to the object, and you may increase the image
at the bottom of the eye to what proportion you shall
desire. And by a way I shall shortly shew, the objects
may be perceived distinct, defined, and colourless, as if
seen by the naked eye. In all these ways the manner
of applying the light is very significant, and provided
it be very strong, the smaller the point be it proceedeth
from, the more distinctly doth it exhibit the difference
of refraction in the transparent bodies viewed by it, and
the plainer will their parts be discovered: The light
therefore of the Sun either reflected from a Spherical
Convex body, or Spherical Concave body, the object
being placed beyond the <hi>focus,</hi> or Refracted through
a Concave or through a Convex, if the object be placed
beyond the <hi>focus,</hi> do exceedingly well. But these with
the help of a dark Room do yet better, the object
being placed in a Table against the Light, and all other
Light screen'd from the Eye by the Dark Room. Much
the same thing is done by the Light of a Lamp or
Candle in the Night, which is indeed the most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Light, where Colour is not so much looked after.</p>
            <p>Whilest this Discourse was Printing I casually met
with a Treatise of <hi>P. Cherubine,</hi> Printed at <hi>Paris,
1677.</hi> Entituled, <hi>LAVISION PERFAITE,
ou les concours des deux axes de la Vision en un sceul point
de l' object;</hi> Wherein the Author pretends amongst other
things to have promoted Microscopes extreamly by
so joyning two together, as through them to see the
same object distinct with both the Eyes at once, and
to see a large object all at one view, by which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
to have discovered some mistakes and untruths
in some of those figures I have formerly published in
my Micrography. But if he had pleased to have read
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40537:65"/>
the Description as well as looked on the Figure, he
might have been better informed than by his Preface
he would seem to be. I deny not but that there are many
failures in some of those draughts, some of my own and
some of the gravers committing. <hi>Humanum est.</hi> But
those which he charges for such are not, as he might
have seen if he had made use of better glasses than those
which he describes, for they are so far short of equalling
those I use, that I can demonstrate from his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of them, that those I made use of did magnifie
10000 times more than that with which he pretends to
have made these great Discoveries. Nor is it any thing
more than common to see as large an <hi>Area</hi> as he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with a glass that magnifies no more than his
doth. But I could have shewed him how he might
see the whole Creature at once, and yet much more
magnifie than that which I have described, nay though
the Creature were twice as big, and that with one Eye
only, which is much to be preferred before that with
two. However I should be very glad to hear what
Discoveries he doth make with his binocular Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope
more than was seen before. As also that he would
please to demonstrate the truth of Parallelogram pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
for certain uses, pag. of Dioptrique Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laire,
and in the Fourth Chapter of the Fourth Part of
this Book. But to digress no farther from what I was
describing. I must add that with both these kinds of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscopes
have I examined several substances; as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the steepings of several grains and seeds in
rain-water. And though I have not yet found any one
tincture more prolific than this of Pepper; yet 'tis not
the only tincture in which they do both breed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
I have seen several sorts in the steeping of Wheat,
Barly, Oats, Coffee, Anniseeds, Pease, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> some not
above a third part of a hair in thickness; others not
above the twentieth part of the breadth of a hair, and
some not more than a thirtieth part of that breadth; so
that no less than 900 of these least must go to make an
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40537:65"/>
               <hi>area</hi> as big as that of an hair cut transversly, and 27000
to make a Cylinder as big as the hair of ones head, and
of equal height with the Diameter of that hair, which
one may just call a visible point, and no more; few
eyes seeing things distinctly much smaller: Now the
Diameter of a hair of my head being by examination
found but the 640 part of an inch, it follows that no
less than 19200 or to use a round summ about 20000 of
them may lie in the length of an inch, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that a circle an inch Diameter will be to the <hi>area</hi>
of one of these cut transversly as 400000000 to 1. four
hundred millions to 1 and a Cylinder one inch Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
and one inch high, will be to one of these mites, as
8000000000000 to one, eight millions of millions to
one. If therefore we compare the magnitude of one of
these animals to the magnitude of other creatures living
in the water, we shall find that these will be found much
smaller in comparison to the body of an ordinary
Whale, than the body of the same Whale will be to
the body of the whole Earth; which may prove an
argument for an <hi>anima mundi</hi> perhaps to some. But let
every one make his own inferences, and believe his
own eyes, for they will make the best impression on
his reason and belief. Now if the Creature be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
small, what must we think of the Muscles,
Joynts, Bones, Shells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> certain it is, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism
by which Nature performs the muscular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is exceedingly small and curious, and to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of every muscular motion in greater Animals at
least, there are not fewer distinct parts concerned than
many millions of millions, and these visible, as I shall
hereafter shew through a Microscope; and those that
conceive in the body of a muscle, little more curiosity
of mechanism than in a rope of the same bigness, have
a very rude and false notion of it; and no wonder if
they have recourse to Spirits to make out the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena:
but of this hereafter more.</p>
            <p>Further, I have examined the constitution of Blood,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40537:66"/>
Milk, Flegm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and found them much the same with
what Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhock</hi> has declared. A little fat laid
upon the glass plate whilst warm, melts, and becomes
transparent, but observed in a convenient posture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the light of a candle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till it congeals, and
shrinks, make a pleasant fluid, and shews how consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
a fluid and solid body do vary, and may give
us a good hint to conjecture at the reason of the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and greater lightness of Ice than of Water. The
first beginnings also of the shooting or crystallising of
Sugar into rectangular parallelipipeds, Alum, Salt, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are strangely surprizing and instructive, I

and invisible parts of animal substances) to ease
both his eyes and imagination I shall proceed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

us. And those are contained in the ensuing Discourse,

                  <head>A Relation communicated to me in a Letter by that ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and experienced Chirurgion Mr. James Young of
Plimouth, in the beginning of January last, of the fatal
Symptoms caused by a Bullet swallowed into the Lungs.</head>
                  <p>SIR, In the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> 1674. one Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
Williamson</hi> of <hi>Liscard</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> aged about
65 years, of a brisk, firm habit, became (after a too li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
drinking of Cyder) afflicted with the Colick, of
which in four days he cured himself, by swallowing two
Musket Bullets, and receiving some Carminative Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
On the 12. of the same month, his pain returning
somewhat smarter than before, he attempted to swallow
three Pistol Shot, and supposing it the easiest way, he
lay on his back, and threw them all at once into his
throat; where they choaking, had almost strangled
him; constraining him to vomit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they were
past down, he became seized immediately with a violent
Cough, Wheasing, pain in the left side of his Breast, a
great noise in respiration, more especially after a fit of
Coughing for then his Breast would hiss, like the suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Pump, when the Air descends through the
boxes.</p>
                  <p>These accidents so suddenly occurring, without any
manifest cause, did much surprize him, and the more,
because he was naturally of a sound breast; the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
was cured by Clysters, Potions of Manna, <hi>ol. amyg. d.
&amp;c.</hi> and two of the Shot were soon ejected, <hi>ex ano,</hi>
and maugre the other accidents, he became indifferently
well, and able to walk about house.</p>
                  <p>Five or six weeks after this, those symptoms became
more fierce, depaupering his spirits, prostrating his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
disquieting his sleep with dreams, a <hi>Dyspnoea,</hi> and
rutling violent Cough; a straitness and load in his Breast
kept him in bed, extenuated his body (which without
help of Milk Clysters, was costive) he frequently fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with sweats, and a tickling sleepiness in both legs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:40537:67"/>
Under the tyranny of this legion of symptoms, our
Western <hi>Apollo,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bidgood</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> was consulted,
who affirmed them all to be caused by the remaining
Bullet, which passing through the <hi>Larynx,</hi> was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one of the branches of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> where it would
abide, in despight of any endeavours to eject it: yet
to alleviate the violence of the accidents, he directed
to the use of emollient <hi>Eclegma's,</hi> temperate Cordials,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> by help of which, and some other propitious
circumstances, he not only recovered his legs, becoming
able to walk, and ride a small Journey, but also consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
Marriage with a young woman of 25—who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
brought him two Children, whereof one is now
alive, and very lusty; and was seven months gone with
a third, when he died: the more wonderful if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
were just to him (of which there appeareth no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to doubt) because a very little motion would so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his difficulty of breathing, as to make him faint.</p>
                  <p>After Matrimony he had divers lucid Intervals, at
times would be very brisk, and at others very languid,
and faint, like a dying man: he continually expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
sometimes grumous coagulated Blood, otherwhiles
very recent; now purulent foetid matter, then laudable
<hi>pus.</hi> His natural aversion to Medicine caused him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
what was advised by Dr. <hi>Bidgood,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Sprage, &amp;c.</hi> saving a few of the more slight mixtures:
And although Sack had been formerly very familiar to
him, he was now forced to shun it, and all strong Drinks,
because they would infallibly produce a <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> a
pulsant throbbing of the Heart, and labouring in his
Breast: the first of these perhaps proceeded from his
Constitution, which inclined to Choler; but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
undoubtedly, from the effervescency, and warm mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to which it enforced the Blood, which the obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and pressure the Bullet occasioned in the <hi>Pneuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
organs, could not peaceably admit of: wherefore
he resolutely fixed to small Drink, and shunned, as
much as possible, all evitable Exercise, saving that of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40537:67"/>
his hands, which he frequently employed in making
Net-work.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1676. he applied himself to our ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and learned Country-man, Dr <hi>Mayow</hi> of <hi>Bath,</hi> who
agreed with Dr. <hi>Bidgood,</hi> that the remaining Bullet
lodging in the Lungs, was the occasion of all those ill
symptomes under which he laboured; but seemed to
dissent from his presage, by hoping he might expectorate
it: to atchieve which, he directed to have the body
suspended head downwards, and fumes of Storax, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to induce expulsive Coughing, together with
concussions of the body, and all preceded with an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
course, to relax, and dilate the vessels of the Breast;
all which were used to no purpose, save to verifie Dr.
<hi>Bidgoods</hi> Prognostick, that no efflation, how violent
soever, would be able to extrude it, and inhaunce the
Patients despair of being ever cured; from which time
he never attempted it: so that those symptomes before
mentioned, continuing until the Winter, and then gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considerably on him, especially the <hi>Haemoptysis, &amp;c.</hi>
he languished till the ninth of <hi>December</hi> last, and then
died.</p>
                  <p>The tenth <hi>Ditto</hi> (assisted by his Son-in-law) I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Thorax,</hi> in presence of two other Chirurgions
of the place, together with divers persons of Quality,
whose curiosity led them to see the examination; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Bullets being there, was so much doubted by
many, and disputed as impossible by others. In the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
the following particulars were observable,</p>
                  <p>The Body was extenuate and tabid,</p>
                  <p>The right lobes of the Lungs were replete, sound,
and well coloured.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Serum</hi> in the <hi>Pericardium</hi> was almost all absu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</p>
                  <p>The Heart strangely shrivelled and very small.</p>
                  <p>Under the <hi>Pericardium</hi> (the Body being <hi>supine)</hi> we
found a lump of coagulated Blood, as big as a Pigeons
Egg; near which lay also a substance, shaped like an
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40537:68"/>
obtuse headed muscle, having a Tendon-like tail, which
insinuated to the Pendant Lobe: Its body was above
an half inch thick. Its other dimensions and shape ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
like that of the figure X, of which A sheweth
the head or upper end, B the tail, which in drawing
out of the rotten Lungs (being also corrupted) broke
asunder. Its Texture seemed fibrous, like that of the
Kidneys, being white one half way through, the rest of
a dark red: it was very soft and plum, having a firm
smooth tegument, and felt very much like a Sheeps kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>The left Lobe of the Lungs was cadaverous, and
hollow, by an abscess which had discharged near a pint
of very foetid and purulent matter, into that side of the
trunk where it lay immured up, by the adhesion of the
Lungs on that side, to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> which with the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragima,</hi>
as far as the matter extended, was livid, and
eroded.</p>
                  <p>We examined this rotten part of the Lungs, with
what exactness and curiosity we were capable of, amidst
such a crowd as were present; and the more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
stench of the <hi>Cadaver;</hi> and found though the
whole <hi>Parenchyma</hi> were rotten, and no firmer than co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated
Blood (with which it had very near resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance)
yet the branches of the <hi>Trachea</hi> continued into
it were uncorrupt, and sound; nor in any of them could
we find what we very confidently presumed to be
there, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bullet.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I resolved to seek it the way by which it
must have entred; and accordingly dividing the
<hi>Trachea</hi> at its insertion to the Lungs, I thrust in a ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Probe to the left branch, and there felt him, lying
loose about two inches within it, which with my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
I easily expressed at the divided end of the pipe:
to do which, I laid it bare so far as where the Bullet
had lodged; and I protest, to my wonder, I found it
not any way injured, or altered, by hardness, erosion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the Bullet had divers impressions from the
later.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:40537:68"/>
The sanguiferous vessels, though lacerated, and cut
in the dissection, did yield little or no Blood, either
fluid or coagulate.</p>
                  <p>Thus far is true History, and matter of fact; I must
now beg your pardon, if I presume to give my sense,
and apprehension of some of those Phaenomena here
related.</p>
                  <p>The extenuation of the body, the absumption of
the <hi>serum</hi> in the Heart-bag, and the contraction of the
Heart, were the effects of the <hi>Tabes;</hi> and that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by the Bullets injuring the Lungs, and pectoral
vessels.</p>
                  <p>The lump of coagulate blood found under the Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag
was extravasate from the rotted veins, and arteries
of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>That strange substance lodged between the <hi>Pericar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
and the Bullet, was either a <hi>Polypus,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescence
of some part, or it was generated by nature,
and substituted for a cushion to defend the Heart from
injury, by so uneasie a neighbour. That Polypuses have
been found in the Heart, is affirmed by <hi>Nicolas Tulpius,
Marcellus Malpighius, G. Garnarus,</hi> &amp;c. but their shape
and texture differing vastly from that of ours, giveth
reason to believe this to be none; especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they all excrescing from the Heart, or some
carneous part, are inseparably united and radicated to
their original, and are spungy; whereas this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less, having no root, nor so much as an adhesion
any where, saving at the tail; the small end of which,
being rotted by the Lungs, into which it continued,
did easily divide upon my endeavour to draw it out:
the body of it also lay loose in the aforesaid interstice,
and as easily slipped out, as a Wen, or a <hi>Struma,</hi> when
the containing parts are opened. Its substance was not
fungous, but of a soft firmness, like a Kidney; and in
what ever circumstances it may resemble a Polypus, as
it doth the figure of that of the Nose, <hi>vide N. Tulpii
ob. med. lib. 1. obs.</hi> 26. yet it also differs from all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescences,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40537:69"/>
besides, in what hath been mentioned, in
that it was not rooted in any fleshy, bony, or muculous
part; and such the Lungs are well known not to be: it
must therefore be the stupendious effect of Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and laid as a cushion to defend the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Its composition being so delicately soft, and yet firm
enough for such a purpose: Its magnitude, situation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
concurring also to confirm this opinion concerning it;
besides which, I do almost remember, and believe
(though I cannot be positive) that the pulsant pain he
had so violently in his Breast, toward the left side, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
<hi>gradatim,</hi> from the time of the deglutition: if
that be true, whatever the substance were, or its cause,
its effects were very propitious, manifesting nature to
be, not only a diligent supplier of her own defects,
but as industrious to produce strange and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
relief, in such emergencies as this before us: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
story we have from <hi>A Pareus, lib. 8. cap.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The abscess was without doubt from a Phlegmon of
the Lungs; and because for the most part it was below,
or beyond the Bullet, it proceeded rather from its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing,
and so stagnating the Blood, and recrements in
that Lobe, than from extravasation. What occurred of
the latter, was expectorated, or remained in such Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulums
as that found under the Heart.</p>
                  <p>The cause of the Bullets falling, rather into the left
than the right <hi>Ramus</hi> of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> is obvious from
the more supine and direct figure thereof, correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the trunk, as the figure doth manifest: which
consideration, together with the Bullets being loose in
the pipe, renders the unsuccessfulness of Dr. <hi>Mayow</hi>'s
attempt very wonderful: I am inclined to believe it
was so, either for want of a more early trial, or a more
skilful tryer, than him who was employed about it.
The way was ingeniously contrived, and (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
himself told me) had been successfully experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the like occasion. Certainly, had not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Doctors abode, and very important avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40537:69"/>
denied his personal assistance: or had any other
person skilled in Anatomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> been substituted, the
Bullet from his own favourable shape, and more propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
gravity, and particularly from the strong efflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they provoked, together with the assistant posture
of the body, would have been extruded. Had they
instead of hanging him perpendicular, made him incline
a little to the right side, to have made the left <hi>Ramus</hi>
more prone; and at the same time made him distend
the pipes by sucking in as much breath as they could
contain, their other means might have been effectual;
which I am induced to presume from the prosperous
effects of the like attempt, and yet wanting many of
their advantages; I mean the reversion of a Stone, when
sticking, and not able, to pass through the Urinary Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.
Let any Physicians seriously perpend the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this, with the advantages for the former, and
they will justifie my opinion.</p>
                  <p>The erosion of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and <hi>Diaphragme,</hi> was from
the acidity of the matter, gnawing and corrupting
them; for though the <hi>Trachea</hi> wonderfully escaped
such impressions, the Bullet discovered on its superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
divers marks of erosion, which all acids produce
with much facility, upon the saccharous or saline parts
of Lead; as is to be seen by immersing it in vinegar.</p>
                  <p>And now Sir, to relieve your patience (no less than
my own) perhaps already wearied with the prolixity
of this Narrative, give me leave to conclude, with sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting,
that I am of a belief (having perused most of
the publick accounts of this kind) that scarcely a rarer
accident, and accompanied with such stupendious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
hath occurred to the present age than this:
that an extraneous body, so large, so heavy, so hard,
should slip down that difficult, and unusual way of
the Weason, and abide so long in the organs of respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in so aged a person, admitting after it such exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
as he performed, Riding, Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
should so unaccountably provide such a pertinent
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40537:70"/>
sence against injuries accidentally accruing, and that
even the smallest Ramifications of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> though
immersed in such a <hi>Cadaver,</hi> should be preserved from
injury thereby. I am sure in the voluminous Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of <hi>Schenckius, Horstius, Riverius, Bartholine,
Burnet,</hi> &amp;c. nor among all the stories in Mr. <hi>Oldenburg</hi>'s
Transactions, or the <hi>Miscellanea Curiosa</hi> of the <hi>Leipswick</hi>
