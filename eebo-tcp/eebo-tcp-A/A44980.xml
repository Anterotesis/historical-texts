            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Humble Offer at the Deciſion of the QUESTION, <hi>How the Vacant Throne ſhall be ſupplyed without Wrong to any Pretender</hi>?</head>
            <p>THE Aſſurance of ſome worthy Members of the Convention, is ſuch, That they ſpeak even more than enough upon moſt Subjects; while a diſtruſt of their own Abilities with-holds others from ſpeaking their own Senſe, and the Senſe of thoſe who ſent them. And It being now, if ever, a time to ſpeak, and to ſpeak out, ſo, as all <hi>Europe</hi> may hear: For the Service of God, and the Satisfaction of thoſe whom they represent, and of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, thoſe that cannot Speak, muſt Write.</p>
            <p>Three ſorts of Perſons are ſuppoſed to be in the Houſe: Some, who are at bottom for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which however flourishing and happy abroad, cannot be ſo in <hi>England</hi>; We are not ready for it, we are not Publick-ſpirited enough; witneſs the Election for Members of Parliament, where the Electors are too much ſway'd by Drink. Beſides, how can we, without manifeſt Injuſtice, alter a Monarchy to a Democracy? And indeed, 'tis a Jeſt to tell the People they are Free: For in a Commonwealth they have many Maſters, whereas in a Monarchy they have but one. Secondly, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Houſe are thought ſecretly to deſire to bring back the Self-Depoſed King, the Miſchiefs of which need not, I conceive, be Inculcated to this Houſe. Thirdly, Others out of a true and honeſt deſign to redreſs Grievances, may (it is fear'd) by much differing in Opinions, and Spinning out of Time, leave the greateſt Grievance of all (want of Settlement) unredreſs'd. Theſe Three together make a great Party in the Houſe, but adding thoſe to them who although they think that King <hi>James</hi> the Second has moſt certainly forfeited his Right to the Crown, yet it is not really in the diſpoſal of the People, but the Power ought to be Depoſited in the Hands of a Regent, or the next Heir.</p>
            <p>Theſe I obſerve, added to the other, make up the Major part of the Houſe, and therefore 'tis juſtly feared that the Debates will hardly be ended in one Afternoon.</p>
            <p>But now, if a Way could be found, to Do the Work without Altering the Succeſſion, or Doing Wrong to any, ſure it were Adviſeable.</p>
            <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the moſt Noble Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is the fitteſt Perſon to fill the Vacant Throne, all the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſt part of the World muſt yield. A Prince of ſo great Valour, ſo great Experience, and ſo great Moderation: A Prince ſo long verſed in the higheſt Affairs of State, and Conduct of Armies and Fleets<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> A Good-natured Daughter may poſſibly come to be Reconciled to a Diſſembling Father; but an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Prince, who ſuck'd in his Averſion to Popery with his Nurſes Milk, and has always been as averſe, as he has been ungrateful, to the Papiſts, is liable to no ſuch Objection: So that in point of Prudence, to have the Prince ſeated ſingle in the Vacant Throne, and ſo prevent all Diſputes that may a riſe, is undoubtedly moſt deſirable. But</p>
            <p>Some ſay, This will be a Wrong to the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> (not to ſpeak of Her Royal Highneſs the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> who will be Queen in Right of Her Husband:) To Anſwer which might be inſtanced the Engliſh Proverb, <hi>That Change is no Robbery.</hi> Here a Prince of about Forty Years Old, is ſubſtituted before Her Royal Highneſs, in ſtead of an Immortal Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and as many Dukes as her moſt Fruitful Majeſty, the Popiſh Queen, may bring forth.</p>
            <p>Therefore none can doubt the Reaſonableneſs, as well as Expediency of placing our Illuſtrious Prince upon the Throne, but the fear of Injuſtice may be a Stumbling-Block, and really a juſt Cauſe of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to many. To obviate which,</p>
            <p>I deſire it may be well weighed and conſidered, That by all Law, which is the Wiſdom of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion collected, as I may ſay, the Extract, the Eſſence of our Wiſdom, No Man can Claim by the Will of Another, ſo long as the Teſtator lives: Likewiſe <hi>Non eſt Hares Viventis</hi>; There is not, there cannot be a Wrong to the Succeſſor, ſo long as the Popiſh King ſurvives; Therefore as it is moſt Reaſonable, and moſt Expedient, ſo it is no way diſſonant to the Higheſt Juſtice in this Grand Conjuncture, to place the Noble Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> upon the Throne. Therefore</p>
            <p>Without longer Diſpute, though I deſire no Precipitation in ſo weighty an Affair, but humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that one Day may end all our Debates upon account of paſt Grievances, which will all probably be remedied by the happy change of temper in our Governors, That a Vote may be paſſed, to which the Lords Concurrence may be deſired, That in reſpect the Throne is Vacant, and the Neceſſity of the Three Nations require it to be filled, (and not kept in Suſpenſion as our Biſhopricks have been,) That His Royal Highneſs may be forthwith Proclaimed and Crowned, or Crowned and Proclaimed our King, at leaſt ſo long as King <hi>James</hi> the Second lives; which may be done without Wrong to any Pretender. But</p>
            <p>That it may not give Suſpicion of Indecency to the Prince Himſelf, if His Survivorſhip ſhould reduce him from King of Three Kingdoms, only to be Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> again. I humbly move, That the Two Princeſſes may be humbly deſired to Reſign their Right to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and that War be proſecuted until our Noble Prince <hi>William Henry,</hi> with the Sweetneſs of His Temper, and Irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of His Sword, ſhall be plac'd upon that Throne, and then Great <hi>Britain</hi> having ſo Benign a Neighbour, may venture the Scepter to be Sway'd by Female H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
