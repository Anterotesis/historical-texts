         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you by way of Retortion, this Brat may be laid at your doores,
you promoted, encouraged, and abetted the forcing of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
by the Army at one time, yet condemned the violence
offered by the King at another; but the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi>
did not thus, they miſlik't it in the one as well as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>London</hi> thy Prophets make thee to erre,<note place="margin">Pag. 3. l. 5.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Poor <hi>London</hi> indeed, and it is like to be poorer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have done with it; I could tell who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
rich, and the City poor.</p>
            <p>2. You would have ſaid more truly, if you had ſaid thus,
<hi>London</hi> of late hath made her Prophets poor, rather then the
Prophets made <hi>London</hi> erre.</p>
            <p>3. You ſay her Prophets make her err, had you named the men,
and particularized the errors, it would have been more credible
and demonſtrable; but generall accuſations are no proofes; I
am ſure one Prophet of your own hath vented more groſſe and
pernicious errors in one year, then can be faſtned upon all the
ſubſcribers throughout the Courſe of their Miniſtery. None
of the ſubſcribers ever held that the Engliſh Scriptures, or that
book called the Bible, is not the Word of God; that no writings
whatſoever, whether tranſlations or originalls, are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſtian Religion; that a natural man had free wil and
power to do good ſupernatural; that thoſe without the Goſpel
written or preacht have ſufficient means for beleeving; that the
ſun, moon, and ſtars are the Apoſtles of Chriſt to preach the
Goſpel unto them: But theſe, with many others, have been
invented by Mr. <hi>J. Goodwin,</hi> as may appear in his Hagiomaſtix,
and by Divine Authority of the Scriptures, quoted in the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, againſt errors, &amp;c. I would fain
know whether any or all the ſubſcribers have taught any error
that carries the leaſt proportion to any of theſe; let the world
then judge what Prophets they are that make <hi>London</hi> to
erre.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is to notorious a falſity, the very mention is a
ſufficient Confutation; did ever any of the Letter-writers (as
you ſcoffingly call them) ever inſtigate the people to maintain
the Prelaticall faction, or the Clergy thereof? 'tis well known
the Prelates were nevee friends to them, nor they to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates;
wherefore the Lord rebuke thee thou lying tongue, who
goeſt about to belye their perſons, when thou canſt not confute

            <p>2. For the latter part of your charge, that they did move the

mention this as an ornament to the Miniſtery, not a reproach to

            <p>2. This is ſo notorious a calumny, that many of your own

ſoules good, it was by the Miniſtery of thoſe men whom you
falſly accuſe.</p>
            <p>3. It were well that you and others (who ſay the labours of
the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters are inſucceſſefull) would conſider, whether
the ſpirit of the Lord be not departed from your Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſince you have fallen into ſeparation, whether more hath
not been perverted then converted by your Miniſters. For my
part I cannot diſcern any ſignalls or ſeals to the Miniſtery of
many of your ſeparated congregations, of bringing ſheep to
Chriſts fold, but of ſtealing ſheep out of the flock, brought in
by the bleſſing of God upon other mens labours.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas you ſay, that all the benefit <hi>London</hi> hath received
by the Miniſters, is but to turn the ancient love and union of the
inhabitants thereof, into hatred and diviſion; all that I ſhall
ſay to the ſlander, is this, the Lord bee Judge between them
and you; <hi>London</hi> was once a City at union within it ſelf, and
did ſerve the Lord with one conſent, and carry on the work of
the Lord with one ſhoulder, untill men of your turbulent facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and humour fell to ſchiſme and ſeparation, gathering Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
out of Churches, and that not when declining, but when
reforming (a practice never heard of before late years) theſe and
ſuch like practices of yours, have turned <hi>Londons</hi> ancient love, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and goodneſſe, into hatred, diviſion, and bitterneſſe one
againſt another.</p>
            <p>5. By theſe laſt words, viz. <hi>which is all the benefit thou haſt
received by the exchange of thy late Dioceſſe for the Province of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
by this I perceive <hi>Iohn Price</hi> had rather have <hi>London</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſe

if not, then what <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaid of thoſe Biſhops, cannot as
truely be ſaid of our preſent Clergy men, as you ſlanderouſly
affirm: Beſides, what names of vanity do the Miniſters ſeek to
themſelves? are they any other then Miniſters of the Goſpel,
Preachers of the Word, Embaſſadors of Chriſt? if theſe be the
names of vanity, do not you count Chriſt vain in giving theſe
names unto his Miniſters? Which if you doe I ſhall eſteem you
a man of vanity and blaſphemy too. To conclude my anſwer,
to this Quotation out of <hi>Gregory,</hi> I ſhall only give you this
counſell, that it would better become ſuch a raw novice to

            <p>2. You would by this endeavour to make the world beleeve, as

&amp; that when invited; but if the whole tranſaction of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

turn to their honour and your reproach; I ſhall therefore give
you a brief narrative of the whole buſineſſe (to rectifie your
miſtake) as I have received it from thoſe who have very good
reaſon to know all the particulars of it; which was thus;
Col. <hi>Titchbourne</hi> came to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Aſh</hi> as from the Councell of the
Army, deſiring that hee and other Miniſters would come to a
debate concerning the Coercive power of the Magiſtrate in
matters of Religion; ſoon after a letter was written by M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
directed to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Calamy,</hi> wherein he, with other Miniſters
were deſired in the name of the Councell of the Army, to meet
at <hi>White-hall,</hi> about ſomewhat to be held forth by them, about
liberty in worſhip: To the firſt invitation by Col. <hi>Titchbourne,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> did in the name of the Miniſters, declare to him, that if
the Councell of the Army would come to a debate, whether they
had ſinned or no, in entring upon thoſe wayes wherein they
were unduly ingaged, in ſeizing on the Members of Parliament,
&amp;c. he profeſſed the Miniſters would be willing to meet, where
and with whomſoever, to labour to ſatisfie them therein; but
this offer was declined, they that do evill hate the light, leſt their
deeds ſhould be made manifeſt; I need ſay no more, becauſe the
letter it ſelf ſaith ſo much for the Miniſters vindication, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
ſuch a conference as was deſired, read pag. 2. of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Repreſentation, that may ſtop your mouth. <hi>Had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
been deſired with us, only to have given you reſolution, whether
the wayes wherein at the preſent you are walking, are agreeable to the
word of God, wee ſhould moſt willingly have delivered our judgments,
&amp;c. And if only for the clearing of this caſe a conference had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
it was from the firſt profeſt, that we ſhould be ready and willing
to meet where, and with whomſoever, to aſſert and maintain our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein, but as if the juſtneſſe of your way were already granted
by us, we were only invited to contribute our aſſiſtance in proſecution of
what you had undertaken, which we conceive to be out of your ſphear; and
for us to have joyned in any conſultations of this nature, would have
made us acceſſory unto them, guilty of the evill that is in them, &amp;c.</hi>
Thus was the letter. And becauſe you are but of a vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
I ſhall relate a compariſon M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>

Suppoſe (ſaid he to the Colonell) your ſervants ſhould
offer you violence, and lay you under reſtraint, and ſhould then
come to a Miniſter, and pray him to adviſe them, how they ſhall
diſtribute their Maſters goods, and what or how much each of
them ſhould take to themſelves; now ſhould that Miniſter
conſult with thoſe ſervants, hee ſhould bee an abettor in their
horrid inſolencies againſt their Maſter; the Miniſter ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tell thoſe undutifull ſervants, that it were more proper for
them to ask whether they had not ſinned in thus abuſing their
Maſter, and to charge them, to reſtore their Maſter to his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the enjoyment of his authority, by them unduly uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
to obey him for time to come, &amp;c. The drift Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at is eaſy to conjecture, the Army who are as ſervants to the
Parliament, did lay violent hands on, and reſtrain their Lord
and Maſter the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (whoſe Army they
were, raiſed by their authority, for preſervation of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
&amp;c.) and when the Army had done that, they ſent
to Miniſters to adviſe what was yet further to be done; and how
they muſt manage their Maſters work, (I mean, diſpoſe of
the affairs of the Kingdome) but never deſire to be reſolved
whether they had done well or ill in offering violence to their
Maſters the Parliament, but as if it were to be taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that the Army had done well in forcing the Parliament, the
Miniſters are only deſired to join in conſultations with them, to
adviſe about thoſe things which are not legally within their
cognizance to ſettle, what ever ſatisfaction they ſhould receive
from the Miniſters.</p>

2. Notwithſtanding your ſlanders, 'tis well known what
ſubmiſſive and chriſtian reſpects to Authority, eſpecially the
Parliament, the Miniſters of the Presbyterian judgment have
expreſſed; yea if the Lords and Commons ſhould ſit full and
free in Parliament, though in ſome things God might leave
them to act ſinfully, yet would the Miniſters live quietly and
ſubmiſſively, if not in doing what they command, yet in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſuffering what they inflict; and not expreſſe ſuch a ſpirit of
Turbulency, as many have done in the impriſoning of the chief
Magiſtrates, altering of our Laws, and putting the whole Land
into a conflagration.</p>
            <p>3. If the Miniſters will not with you cry up a faction, muſt
they therefore needs be charged by you to cry down a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
ſuppoſe they ſhould not acknowleg. 60 members of the
Houſe of Commons (now under the power of the Sword) to
be a free Parliament (when above two hundred Members are
forc't away) or the Supream Authority of the Nation, are they
therefore diſingenuous, and unſubmiſſive to all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
            <p>Doth not your ingenuity and candor further appear,<note place="margin">Pag. 8. l. 20.</note> by your abetting,
countenancing, and encouraging violence and force upon the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
by company of looſe, prophane and wicked fellows at one time, is
ſome of you did, falling in with the diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Army, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It would make more for your honor and their ſhame,
had you named thoſe Miniſters that did abet, and encourage
the violence and force upon the two Houſes. Yea it would more
have advantaged you, if in ſtead of a perempory and naked
aſſertion, you had given in ſome plain and evident demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that any of the Miniſters had done ſo.</p>
            <p>2. I can truly ſay, that thoſe Miniſters, with whom I have
had moſt occaſion to converſe, have expreſt their utter abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
of that force and violence. Yea to my knowledge, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them did declare againſt it in their Pulpits.</p>
            <p>3. For the other part of your accuſation, that they fell in
with the diſaffected, delingquent and malignant party, that's
moſt notoriouſly falſe, as well as the reſt. 'Tis well known the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116115:9"/>
Miniſters have never been friends to Malignants, nor they to
the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas you ſay, they did at another time declare againſt
the Army for S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>izing on the Members of the Commons Houſe:
I grant they did ſo, and had they not cauſe to do it? conſidering
that the Parliament had long before declared,<note place="margin">Declar. Ian. 17. 1641.</note> that if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhould offer to arreſt or detain any member of Parliament,
that it was againſt the libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ties of the Subject, and a breach of
the Priviledges of Parliament, and ſuch a perſon is declared a
publick enemy of the Common-wealth. And conſidering alſo
the Vow and Covenant, when the Lords and Commons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
a horrid deſign to ſurpriſe the City, and by armes to force
the Parliament, they did then vow and covenant, <hi>to reſiſt the
ſame, and all other of the like nature;</hi> ſo the Miniſters have dealt
moſt impartially in blaming the violence offered the Houſes, as
well in the one, as in the other. Indeed it may be ſaid of you,
that you are the moſt partiall judge in this matter that can bee
in the world; to countenance and encourage the Armies forcing
the Parliament at one time, yet condemn it in the Apprentices
at another, for my own part I muſt profeſſe I condemn it in
both.</p>

blood may be avenged, in cry out in your pulpits, of ſtaining the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion with the blood of the King, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You did once count it a vertue in the Miniſters to
excite the people againſt the King and His party, and doe you
now eſteem it a vice? are you turned malignant after ſo many
turnings?</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis true the Miniſters did excite the people to cleave to
the two Houſes of Parliament, who were neceſſitated to take up
defenſive arms, againſt the forces of the King, but never againſt
the perſon of the King.</p>
            <p>3. But did they ever ſtirre up any to bring the King to a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Tryal, and to take away his life? The Miniſters underſtood
themſelves better then for they know 'twas lawfull in <hi>David</hi> to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116115:10"/>
take up defenſive arms, to fortifie <hi>Ziglag,</hi> and other places of

to kill <hi>Saul,</hi> when he had him in his hands, yea though hee
were a moſt bloody and tyrannicall King.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters doe well conſider that it is one thing to take
away the life of a King, and another thing to withſtand the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
execution of the unjuſt commands of a King: And this
diſtinction your Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> did well know,<note place="margin">I. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

another to ſecure a mans own life, or the life of another whom we know to

               <hi>Goodwin</hi> juſtified the withſtanding the violence of
the King, yet condemned all attempts of taking away the life
of the King: The Miniſters are ſtill of this mind, though he be
revolted from theſe his firſt Principles.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas you ſay, the Miniſters cry out againſt ſtaining
the Proteſtant Religion with the blood of the King; had they
not cauſe to do ſo? conſidering that people of the Proteſtant
Religion did never take away the life of their King till now:
Bleſſed be God, and bleſſed be they, that it was in their hearts to
vindicate themſelves to the world to bee clear in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>If you deny this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> P. p. 9. l. 16.</note> I ſhall ſhew you ſeverall of your owne Bookes

can ſhew none.</p>
            <p>2. I obſerve you promiſe in your book more then you make

him in the front ſpice of your book, as if what you had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
from him would have made much for your cauſe, for
bringing the King to Capitall puniſhment; his words you
quote are theſe: <hi>Men of blood are not meet perſons to be at peace with,

mention at all of the King, either in that paſſage, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of his Sermon, that Hee ſhould be cut off. 2. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Love</hi>
doth clearly expreſſe himſelfe whom he means by thoſe men of

diſtemper: Many malignant humors are to be purged out of many of
the Nobles and Gentry of this Kingdome before we can be healed.</hi> 3. Tis
true, Mr. <hi>Love</hi> then was, and ſtill is of that mind, that thoſe who
were the chief inſtruments to engage the King in the late bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

time of peace, or (if not reach them that way) by the law of the

of the Parliaments taking up of defenſive arms, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Covenant are bound in their places and Callings to

wherein we are bound that malignants <hi>may be brought to

               <hi>Love</hi> doth

demand of you, is there any clauſe in that Sermon, or any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
that way to charge the King with the death of King
<hi>Iames</hi> or Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> or with the blood of <hi>Rochell</hi> or <hi>Ireland?</hi>

not) yet there is not the leaſt intimation in all his Sermon, that
you ſhould bring the King to Capitall puniſhment. Now that

more pernicious paſſages in it then the former Agreement of the

of Parliaments, and to the fundamentall Government of the

did not the Generall write a Letter to the Parliament againſt
Col. <hi>Rainsborow,</hi> who was the man that preſented this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

enough that the Generall and his Officers then did diſlike the
Agreement of the People, and did put the man to death for
promoting it? Yea I might quote a fourth teſtimony alſo, if it
were of any credit, viz. <hi>Lilburne</hi> and his Agitators, who with
one mouth have exclaimed againſt the Army, for voting that
man (viz. <hi>White)</hi> to death. But ſuppoſe it were true, as you

beats an Enſign with his own Colours, or they that offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

'twas not only for his mutinying againſt his Enſign, but againſt
the Generall and his Officers Commands, who ordered him to
goe to <hi>New-caſtle;</hi> If it were ſo. I would ask you but this one

            <p>You ſtill inſiſt upon the Armies proceedings againſt the Members,<note place="margin">P. 15. l. 31.</note>
which themſelves do acknowledg ſimply conſidered, irregular, and not
juſtifiable but by honeſt intentions, and an extraordinary neceſſity for the
ſame end leading them thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the Army (who are but partiall Judges in their
own caſe) are forc't to confeſſe their proceedings to be irregular
and unjuſtifiable, may not indifferent Spectators ſay they are
ſinfull and abominable?</p>
            <p>2. Surely the Army are put to their ſhifts, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to make honeſt intentions their main plea to juſtifie
irregular actions; this was no good Divinity in <hi>Pauls</hi> time for
any to ſay, Let us do evill that good may come, <hi>Rom. 3. 8.</hi> nor
in the time of the Old Teſtament; <hi>Saul</hi> had, a good intention
in offering a ſacrifice to the Lord (which was the Prieſts office,
not his) yet his good intention could neither acquit him from ſin
or puniſhment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. v. 9. to 15. nor could it excuſe <hi>Saul</hi>
that he had a good intention for the publick, <hi>viz.</hi> his zeal to the
children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> in ſtaying the <hi>Gibeonitel,</hi> whoſe
lives by Covenant he ought not to take away, but the Lord pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
that iniquity upon his poſterity, though <hi>Sauls</hi> intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were honeſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 2. I could inſtance in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah.
1 Chr. 13. 9, 10.</hi> and the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh, 1 Sam. 6. 13, 14. 19,
20.</hi> with many others, to ſatisfie you, herein, that honeſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teons
cannot juſtifie ſinfull actions. Beſides this plea were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
the more tolerable, if the intentions of the Army had
been for publick good; but if we may gueſſe at their intentions
by their own expreſſions in print, they will then appeare to bee
more ſinfull, treaſonable, and irreligious. Were not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
expreſt in their Remonſtrance, <hi>Novemb. 16. 1648.</hi> and
other papers of theirs, as againſt an accomodation with the
King <hi>upon any tearms at all;</hi> p. 57. though never ſo ſafe or juſt,
for the taking away the Kings life, p. 62. that the Prince and
Duke of <hi>York</hi> be made incapable of government; that if they
come not in &amp; render themſelves, that they ſtand exiled for ever,

dye without mercy, if ever found or taken in this Kingdome,
pag. 62. that a Period be put to this Parliament, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
power be put into the hands of the people. pag. 65, 66.
that in ſtead of this &amp; all future Parliaments there may be a new
kind of Repreſentative; that all profeſſing faith in God, ſhall
have a Toleration whatever his opinion be; that the Magiſtrate
meddle not with matters of Religion; theſe and ſuch like are
the declared intentions of the Army, which muſt juſtifie all their
irregular and unjuſtifiable procedings; by this it appears, that
the ends they aim at are no more juſtifiable, then the means they
uſe. Now whether ſuch intentions can juſtifie their irregular
actions, let the world judg, ſo that I may ſay of them, as one
did of men of the Popiſh Religion, if theſe bee Saints, who bee
Scythians? if theſe be Catholicks, who be Caniballs?</p>
            <p>3. For the extraordinary neceſſity the Army pleaded for, I
have but three things to ſay in way of anſwer. 1. Tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
by what was mentioned before, that the end the Army
aimed at, were no more juſtifiable then the means they uſed, now
what can be more unreaſonable, then to make neceſſity a plea
to juſtifie not only irregular actions, but corrupt ends alſo?
2. The godly in former ages had a more conſcientious tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
then to make neceſſity a plea and patron of impiety; they
thought it better to ſuffer the greateſt evill then to commit the
leaſt ſin;<note place="margin">Aug. in Pſ. 73.</note>

that the neceſſity pleaded for, is but pretended or contracted,

Puritans are enemies to Monarchy, and intend nothing but to bring all

truely the Land is not able to beare their words. <hi>If M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>

third deſigne he laid downe in theſe words,</hi> viz. To cut off the
King if he ſides not to the Independent party; 'tis true of late they ſeem
to appeare for him to gaine Malignants on their ſide, but 'tis notoriouſly
knowne how their principles are directly againſt Monarchy; what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
ſpeeches have ſome Independent Members uttered againſt the
King, yea it will never be forgotten how inraged the Independent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Houſe and Sectaries of <hi>London</hi> were againſt the City Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,
chiefly becauſe there was this paſſage in it, for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to the world in print, that [the King for his miſgovernment muſt

Syrian Captains did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 31. to fight neither with ſmal nor

ſtirring up the People againſt the Parliament and for the King, as you
did of late in your prayers and preaching expreſſing greater malignity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliament, and their party, and greater zeale for the King
and his intereſt, then thoſe very Miniſters whoſe places you poſſeſſe, they
being ſequeſtred and caſt out for the Tenths of that Anti-parliamentary
malignancy which you have vented.</p>
            <p>

2. As for the other part of your charge, that <hi>another while
the Miniſters did ſtirre up the People againſt the Parliament, and for

a ſufficient confutation of it.</p>

poſſeſſe;</hi> this is ſo palpable a calumny that I ſhould have more
adoe to hide and cover your folly, then to vindicate their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
in this matter; Will not all that know the <hi>London</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
acquit them and blame you? could you not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to charge them with falſities, with the want of Miniſteriall
abilities, and of that candor and ingenuity that becomes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
but muſt you now tax them with Malignancy alſo? yea
were you not aſhamed to tell the world, that <hi>Malignant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were ſequeſtred for the Tenths of the Anti-parliamentary Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
which the London Miniſters vented?</hi> when you know that
one century of ſequeſtred Miniſters is printed, and the reſt recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which will remaine a laſting monument of their ſhame and
your falſhood. If you think as you write, in time you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Malignant Miniſters Advocate to have them brought

out.</p>
            <p>And now being come to pag. 19. of your booke, I cannot but

you ſet your ſelfe to anſwer what makes moſt for your eaſe

plainely demonſtrate, for when the Miniſters did ſtrongly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that if the Kings comming to the Houſe of Commons to
demand but five Members was deemed ſuch a horrid violation
of the Parliaments Priviledges, that they thereupon Ordered
that any perſon that did ſeize upon any Member of Parliament,

for that effect ſhall judge convenient; yea are they againſt the
trying, condemning, and ekecuting the King; which is that which
you call juſtice: this kinde of juſtice the Miniſters are againſt;
and had they not reaſon? becauſe the Parliament declared to
the whole world, that one end of the warre was to bring Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
to condigne puniſhment, yet to preſerve the perſon of
the King. And thus I have given you an anſwer touching the

I come in the next place to examine whether the Vow and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
ſpeaks for the Miniſters, or againſt them.</p>
            <p>Where as you mention the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vow and Covenant you might have indeed

to have taken notice of that which was the maine end of that Vow and
Covenant contained in thoſe words, that I will according to my power
and vocation aſſiſt the forces raiſed and continued by both houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
againſt the force raiſed by the King without their conſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t; have
you performed this vow?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> The Miniſters have not been wanting in that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116115:22"/>
which becomes Miniſters of the Goſpell even in the main
end of the Vow and Covenant, for they have <hi>according to their
power and vocation, aſſiſted the forces raiſed and continued by both
Houſes of Parliament, againſt the Forces raiſed by the King, without
their conſent.</hi> Now becauſe the Subſcribers will not aſſiſt the
ſaid Forces againſt the Parliament, as they did once aſſiſt them
againſt the Forces raiſed by the King, muſt they be accounted
tranſgreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urs or breakers of their vow?</p>
            <p>2 You might have ſhewed that ingenulty that becomes a
Chriſtian to have taken notice of the grounds or motives why
the Vow and Covenant was made, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there was a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
and treacherous deſigne to ſurprize the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Weſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inſter,</hi> with the Suburbs, <hi>and by arms to force the Parliament,</hi>
therefore the Lords and Commons thought fit that all who
are true hearted and lovers of their Country ſhould bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
each to other in a ſacred Vow and Covenant, wherein
we declared our abhorrency and deteſtation of the ſaid wicked
and treacherous deſigne, and that according to our power and
vocation would oppoſe and <hi>reſiſt the ſame and all other of the like
nature.</hi> So that by the Vow and Covenant it appeares the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
were bound according to their power and vocation to
oppoſe and reſiſt the Armies forcing the Parliament as well as
the former attempt of Malignants by arms to force the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they being both of the like nature.</p>
            <p>3 Yea you would have ſhewed your ingenuity to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice that the Vow bindes to aſſiſt onely ſuch Forces as
are raiſed and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntinued by both Houſes of Parliament, not ſuch
Forces as are raiſed by both Houſes but continue longer then
both Houſes would have them; Now the Forces (I mean the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my)
raiſed by the Parliament are continued longer then both
Houſes of Parliament thought fit to continue them. For they
would have disbanded them (unleſs 9000) in <hi>May 1647.</hi> &amp; they
are continued untill <hi>March 1649.</hi> and God knowes how much
longer yet they may continue to be an oppreſſion to the people.
To conclude this, I would aske you whether in caſe the Earle of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army, the Lord of <hi>Mancheſter's,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller's,</hi>
and Major Generall <hi>Maſſie's</hi> Souldiers, who were all raiſed by
the Parliament, had refuſed to disband when the Parliament
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116115:23"/>
did command them, and had continued in arms together lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then the Parliament thought fit to continue them, I pray
reſolve me in your next whether the Vow and Covenant did
oblige thoſe that had taken it to aſſiſt and defend thoſe Forces;
if not, then how can you accuſe Miniſters that they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their Vow in not aſſiſting the Army, who though they
were raiſed by both Houſes, yet have continued longer in arms
then both Houſes were willing to continue them.</p>
            <p>4 Wee were all bound by the Vow and Covenant <hi>to aſſiſt the
Forces raiſed and continued by both Houſes of Parliament againſt the
Forces raiſed by the King,</hi> but not againſt the perſon of the King,
the priviledges of the Parliament, &amp;c. Now to aſſiſt any Forces
whatſoever in oppoſition unto thoſe juſt ends for which they
were firſt raiſed, would have involved us in the guilt of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
perjury imaginable. And that the Army raiſed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
went directly contrary to thoſe juſt ends for which they were
firſt raiſed, is eaſily demonſtrable. For <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. the Army was raiſed for
the defence of the Kings perſon, and they have deſtroyed his
perſon. 2. For the preſervation and defence of Religion, and
they have endangered Religion, by pleading for a licentious
toleration. 3. For the priviledges of Parliament, and they
have offered ſuch an unparalleld violation of their Priviledges
as the like hath not been heard. And now tell me whether the
Proteſtation and Vow be not as Aegyptian reeds to runne into
your ſides when you leane on them. I come in the third place
to examine whether the Solemne League and Covenant will

            <p>3. 'Tis you and your party (not the Miniſters) who make
the Covenant a contradictious thing: the Covenant tyes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

Parliament, yet you plead Covenant to deſtroy their priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
the Covenant engageth to extirpate Hereſie and Schiſme,

you plead Covenant to allow men to be what Religion they

Now let the world judge who makes the Covenant a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious

2. The word of God which is the rule and ſtandard of true

here you beg the queſtion, taking that for granted, which was

the Adulterer by the law of God was to bee put to death
as well as the murderer, and there is no Court by the

whether is every man in the land even to the laſt bound to lay
hands upon the Adulterer? if you ſay yea, I am ſure ſome of
your greateſt Grandees would not be long lived; if you ſay no,
tell me a reaſon why you hold your ſelf bound to do ſo to the
one and not unto the other. 3. If it be true that it is not the
condemnation but the execution of blood-guilty perſons that
makes ſatisfaction for the blood they ſpilt, and keeps the land
from being defiled, then I demand whether every man in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Before I come to clear thoſe Authours alledged by

            <p>3. I have good reaſon to beleeve that you borrowed moſt

me to beleeve that you had theſe quotations not from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
themſelves, but from that Popiſh writer, is this. 1. In
reading thoſe Authors I find ſome of them to be of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
mind to that which you alledg them for. 2. Thoſe very
men, and that matter almoſt <hi>in terminis</hi> is quoted by that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
writer; and may not this give ſome ground to beleeve what
I aſſert?</p>
            <p>4 You muſt needs be put to a penury of proofs, when you pretend
to alledg Proteſtant Divines, yet among them mention M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi>
a Lawyer but no Divine, and <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> a Jeſuite but no
Proteſtant; ſurely either your memory muſt be ſhort, or your
reading but ſmall.</p>
            <p>5. In ſome of your quotations you only name the men, but do
not mention the page where ſuch a paſſage is to be found. Thus
you deal with <hi>Zuinglius, Pareus, Dudly, Fenner,</hi> and <hi>Rutherford;</hi>
which makes me think you never read their books, or elſe that
you intended to pervert their words, and put your Reader to
more pains before hee ſhall find out your abuſe of the Authors.</p>
            <p>6. Though ſome of the Authors alledged ſpeak high of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Tyrannicall and idolatrous Kings, yet none of them
(unleſſe the Jeſuite, under the name of <hi>Junius Brutus)</hi> ever gave
the leaſt intimation of ſpilling the blood of a Proteſtant King.</p>
            <p>7. One ſolid Argument had ſtood you in more ſtead then a
hundred quotations; not mens ſayings, but their reaſons are to
be regarded.</p>
            <p>8. There is no opinion ſo groſſe, but there may be ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men who will labour to maintain it; tis true, ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men may plead for the putting of Kings to death, but is
this the received opinion or declared judgment of any of the
Reformed Churches? could you ſhew that (which I know you
cannot) it would be of more weight with me.</p>
            <p>9. Although ſome of the Authors ſpeak high in this point, yet
none of them come up to the preſent caſe. There were ſo many
conſiderable and concurrent circumſtances in the caſe of the
king that varyed it much from the caſe of Kings in former times;
the buſineſſe is ſo circumſtantiated that were all the Authors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by you alive, none of them (I verily beleeve) nor any
Caſuiſts in the world would give their conſent to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116115:28"/>
the life of our King as the caſe ſtood with us. For, 1. Hee
was a Proteſtant King. 2. The end of the Parliaments War
againſt the Forces raiſed by him, was to preſerve His perſon, as
appears by their many Declarations in that behalf. 3. Many
Oaths and Covenants made to the moſt high God for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of His Royall perſon. 4. The King of <hi>England</hi> could
not be put to death, but they muſt kill the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> alſo, who had as true a right in Him as this Kingdome
had. 5. That he granted more for the good of the Kingdome
then ever any King that ſate upon the Engliſh Throne. 6. That
Hee never perſonally ſhed blood. 7. That the Army muſt
firſt force the Parliament before they could kill the King; which
wil be to after ages a laſting monument of the Parliaments Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
and the Armies Reproach. 8. That the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(if they ſate free and ful, which now they do not) have no
power by law to erect a new Court to take away the life of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man, much leſſe the life of the King. 9. That the General &amp; his
Officers declared in their Remonſtrance, <hi>June 23. 1647.</hi> that <hi>they
did clearly profeſſe they did not ſee how there could be any peace to this
Kingdom firm and laſting, without a due conſideration of and proviſion
for the Rights, Quiet &amp; Immunities of His Majeſties Royal family, &amp;c.</hi>
theſe and ſuch like circumſtances conſidered, can it be imagined
that any could have their hands in the Kings blood, unleſs they
were led more by paſſion then reaſon, by deſign then conſcience?
Thus having given you theſe advertiſements (touching the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
by you alledged in the general) I come now a to particular
ſurvey of the ſeverall authors brought by you to maintain your
King-killing Doctrine.</p>

to the Crowne by ſucceſſion, and a juſt Hereditation. Thirdly,
I do not read in his Book called the <hi>Appellation, &amp;c.</hi> that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
for bringing Kings to a judiciall Tryall and taking away

the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> and <hi>Ehud</hi> ſlaying <hi>Eglon,</hi> is to be imitated by every

Doctrine? If you do, I feare you will often times follow the
Devils inſtigation to murder the innocent, when you thinke 'tis
the impreſſion of Gods ſpirit on your heart to do juſtice on the
guilty. Oh take heed that you be not given over to beleeve lies,
and then to worke wickedneſſe with greedineſſe. Before I leave
this unſafe aſſertion in Dr. <hi>Ponnets</hi> Booke (of which you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove)
<hi>viz. that private men may kill a Tyrant:</hi> I deſire that this
might lye ſadly on your heart, ſuppoſe you ſhould think ſuch a
Magiſtrate to be a Tyrant and a murderer, and becauſe none wil
put to death that Tyrant, therefore you hold your ſelfe bound
to do it: ſuppoſe againe, another thinkes him to be a juſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
whom you ſlew, and kils you that killed him, and a

intituled the <hi>Image of both Churches, Jeruſalem and Babylon</hi> (by

deale candidly with ſo Orthodox a Divine as <hi>Beza</hi> was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ſlanderous reports of Papiſts againſt ſo zealous a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant?
The ſame Author who ſaid that <hi>Beza</hi> made that

               <note place="margin">See image of Ier. and Bab. by <hi>P D. M.</hi> p. 82.</note> affirmed alſo that <hi>Beza</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpt

mans wife, &amp;c. the one is as true as the other. 2. It may bee
made demonſtrable that <hi>Beza</hi> was not the Authour of that
book, which goes under the name of <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> for can it
be imagined that ſo ſober and learned a man as <hi>Beza</hi> was,
ſhould be ſo inconſiſtent to his owne principles, to write one

ſubject unto a tyrant, beſides amendment of life, prayers and teares.</hi> Yea
<hi>Beza</hi> was of this judgment, that though private men might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
the ſinful commands of a Prince, yet he was utterly againſt
taking up of Arms:<note place="margin">Beza in confeſſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fidei Chriſtianae c. 5. Sect. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Tis ane thing</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>not to obey Magiſtrates,
and another to reſiſt or take up Arms, which God doth not permit thee.</hi>
If <hi>Beza</hi> was againſt private mens taking up of defenſive arms, can
it be imagined that he would plead for offenſive Arms againſt
the life and perſon of a King? Indeed <hi>Beza</hi> hath a learned Tract

            <p>3. This <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> whom (you ſay) good Authours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

that is, <hi>A Tyrant without a title, is ſuch a one who by force and fraud

Again, when he comes to ſpeak of a Tyrant (not in title, but) in

ſuch a tyrant may be puniſht, but yet only by them <hi>(qui ea pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te

maintain, that in all that book there is not one paſſage that
I can find for bringing the King to capitall puniſhment; I am
ſure in many places he is againſt it, in anſwering that objection
which Royaliſts made, that becauſe <hi>David</hi> would not ſtretch
forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed, therefore the King
being the Lords anointed cannot be reſiſted. To which he gives
this anſwer:<note place="margin">Lex, Rex. queſt. 31. p. 330.</note> David <hi>ſpeaketh of ſtretching out his hand againſt the

an eminent ſervant of the State in the puniſhing of others; if therefore he
be unpuniſhable, it is not ſo much becauſe His Royall power is above all
Law-coaction, as becauſe one and the ſame man, cannot be both the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher

of true Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here you come in with your Ifs and Ands, begging
the queſtion, taking that for granted which was ſtill denyed;
ſay not if the ſaving of the Kings perſon being a murderer, bee
the deſtruction of the Command of true Religion, but prove
that he was a murderer, and that the ſaving of His perſon would
be a deſtruction to true Religion; a convincing Argument
would ſtand you in more ſtead then a confident aſſertion of the
one, or a naked ſuppoſition of the other.</p>
            <p>2. I would demand of you, whether the ſaving of <hi>Davids</hi>
perſon, who killed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the Hittite; and of <hi>Sauls,</hi> who ſlew
85 of the Prieſts of the Lord; and of <hi>Manaſſehs,</hi> who made the
ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> run down with blood, were a deſtruction of
the Commands of true Religion? if you ſay it was, are not you
a very charitable man to ſtigmatize the children of Iſrael, that
they deſtroyed the Command of Religion, that the land was
defiled with blood, and that to many generations, for not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
all their Kings who had ſpilt blood; if you ſay no, give
me one cogent reaſon why many of the wicked and bloody
Kings of Iſrael (as wel as the good) ſhould live, and yet our late
King dye.</p>
            <p>3. You are the firſt (and I hope will be the laſt) that ever I
could hear of, that pleaded <hi>an obligation by the Covenant to cut off
the Kings head for the preſervation of true Religion:</hi> unleſſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his perſon, can be interpreted to cut off his head, I am ſure
the Covenant laies upon you no ſuch obligation; was the Kings
perſon, and Religions preſervation ſo inconſiſtent, that you
muſt needs deſtroy the one to preſerve the other? were there no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116115:37"/>
veins to be opened to let out malignant blood from any part of
the body, but muſt you cut off the head? could no perſon bee
found but the King alone to expiate the guilt of blood? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
indeed you ſay in p. 23. that the <hi>cutting off the Kings head
was the moſt acceptable and fatteſt ſacrifice unto juſtice, that ever was
offered in this Kingdome.</hi> I do verily beleeve it was ſo fat a ſacrifice
that it wil overturn your ſtomacks, it may be ſomething elſe too.</p>
            <p>4. I grant 'tis the Command of God that a murderer ſhould
be put to death; yet is there a great difference to be put between
one that kills another maliciouſly, and between a multitude
who ſhed blood only in a Military way in a time of Civill war;
as for inſtance,<note place="margin">Judg. 20.</note> in the bloody war betwixt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi>
though the men of <hi>Judah</hi> (who had the beſt cauſe) loſt 40000
men in two battails, yet upon a third attempt when God gave
them the day over the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> though they do ſlay
them in the purſuit and heat of the battle (which was lawful) &amp;
ſmote 25000 of the children of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> yet when the war was
ended, and a full and finall victory gotten by the men of <hi>Judah;</hi>
they did not bring the reſidue of the children of <hi>Benjamin</hi> to a
judiciall Tryall, nor executed them, though they ſlew of the
men of <hi>Iudah 40000;</hi> but the ſword having determined the
controverſy in the field on their ſide, by a very full and finall
conqueſt, the remaining part of the children of <hi>Benjamin</hi> were
invited by their conquerors to an amicable reconcilement and
Treaty; as appears <hi>Iudg. 21. 13. The whole Congregation ſent
ſome to ſpeak to the children of</hi> Benjamin, <hi>that were in the rock</hi> Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>and to call peaceably unto them,</hi> or as it is in the margin, to
proclaim peace to them; yea 'tis ſaid that the people (even thoſe
that ſlew them) repented them for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> becauſe the Lord
had made a breach in the Tribes of Iſrael. <hi>c. 21. v. 15.</hi> now had
that Law taken place in all Military expeditions, they had been
bound not to have ſuffered one of the children of <hi>Benjamin</hi> to

if it may be, to reclaim you from your King-killing doctrine.</p>
            <p>1. That there is no Preſident in all the ſcripture, that the
<hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of the Jews, or Rulers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ever judicially ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and put to death any of the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> or <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
though many of them were moſt groſs Idolaters, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Princes, who ſhed much innocent blood, and oppreſſed
the people ſundry wayes. Tis true indeed, ſome of the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſlain by private conſpiracies, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
tumults in an illegall way, but none were ever arraigned,
condemned or executed by their <hi>Sanhedrins,</hi> or generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
So that in putting the K to death, you have done that for
which you have no Scripture preſident.<note place="margin">2.</note> 2. The ſervants of God
in ſcripture did hold it lawful to take up defenſive arms to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the rage and tyranny of their Kings, yet did not count it
lawfull to deſtroy the perſons of their Kings; thus <hi>David</hi> did by
force of Arms defend himſelf againſt the raging and tyrannicall
invaſion of <hi>Saul,</hi> by poſſeſſing many ſtrong holds and fortified
places,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 6, 7. 13.</note> yet thought it not lawfull to kill him; <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaid
David) <hi>that I ſhould do this thing to my maſter the Lords anointed,
to ſtretch forth my hand againſt him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—and ſaid he to <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai,
Deſtroy him not, for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt him, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116115:38"/>
be guiltleſſe.</hi> If many circumſtances had been conſidered, <hi>David</hi>
had much to plead why he ſhould take away the life of <hi>Saul,</hi>
(more I am ſure then you had to take away the life of our late
King) for 1. <hi>Saul</hi> was in actuall purſuance of <hi>David</hi> for his life,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 26. 2. God had before this declared that he repented
that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 11. 3. God had rejected
<hi>Saul</hi> from being King over <hi>Iſrael, 1 Sam. 15. 26. 4. Saul</hi> had
loſt his governing abilities, the ſpirit of government was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from Him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. 5. He was guilty of much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood; He ſlew 85 Prieſts of the Lord; and put to the
ſword, both men, women, children and ſucklings in the City
of <hi>Nob, 1 Sam. 22. 18, 19.</hi> 6. Hee was earneſtly urged to kil
<hi>Saul</hi> by the men that were about him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 4. &amp; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.
9, 10. 7. <hi>Saul</hi> was the only man that ſtood between him and
his actuall poſſeſſion of a Kingdome, yet all theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did not take with <hi>David;</hi> he was ſtill of this mind that none
could ſtretch forth their hands againſt him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 10, 11.</note> and be guiltleſſe; <hi>His
day</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) ſhall come to dye, or he ſhall deſcend into hattail,
and periſh, the Lord forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth my hand againſt
him, &amp;c.</hi> Another ſcripturall inſtance that I may give you (to
name no more) you may find in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 45. When <hi>Saul</hi>
would have put <hi>Ionathan</hi> to death, the people roſe up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued
<hi>Ionathan</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he dyed not, yet
none of them attempted to lay violent hands on <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe. I
ſhall conclude this advertiſement with a good obſervation
M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> hath,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> third part of the Soveraigne Power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments and Kingdoms, p. 95.</note>

            </p>
            <p>3. To ſpill the blood of any (eſpecially Royal blood) meerly
out of a Political deſigne, is in the account of God murder (not
juſtice) although the men may deſerve to be put to death. The
ſcripture affords a pregnant proof of this, the Lord commanded
<hi>Iehu</hi> to ſmite the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 9. 7.</note> to avenge the blood of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the Prophets;<note place="margin">2 Kings 10. 6.</note> according to the command of the Lord, <hi>Iehu</hi>
cauſed 70 of the ſons of <hi>Ahab</hi> to be ſlain by the Rulers of <hi>Iezre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi>
God commends him for doing this, <hi>the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Jehu,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116115:38"/>
               <hi>becauſe thou haſt done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes,
and haſt done unto the Houſe of</hi> Ahab, <hi>according to all that was in my
heart, thy children of the fourth generation ſhall ſit on the throne of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.
Yet for all this, becauſe <hi>Iehu</hi> had a Politicall deſign in ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Houſe of <hi>Ahab, viz.</hi> the emolument and eſtabliſhment
of his Kingdome, not a conſcientious reſpect to the command
of God,<note place="margin">Hoſea 1. 4.</note> therefore the Lord by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi>
ſaith, that <hi>He will avenge the blood of</hi> Jezreel <hi>upon the Houſe of</hi>
Jehu. That is, the blood of <hi>Ahabs</hi> 70 ſons which was ſhed by
the Rulers of <hi>Iezreel</hi> at <hi>Iehu</hi>'s command: I wiſh thoſe who
had a chief hand in putting the King to death, would conſider
whether a Politicall deſign, rather then a conſcientious reſpect
to juſtice, was not a chiefe motive ingaging them to that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
attempt.</p>
            <p>4. Moſt of thoſe men in ſcripture who ſpilt the blood of their
Kings (although wicked) did not dye a naturall death, but
came to an untimely end. Tis ſaid in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 23. that <hi>the
ſervants of</hi> Ammon <hi>conſpired againſt Him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 21. 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>and ſlew the King in His
own Houſe;</hi> then 'tis ſaid in the very next verſe, <hi>the people of the
Land ſlew all them that had conſpired againſt King</hi> Ammon. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<hi>Elah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſlaine by <hi>Zimri</hi> a Captaine of his
chariots,<note place="margin">1 Kings 16. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>as he was in</hi> Tirzah <hi>drinking himſelf drunk,</hi> 'tis ſaid <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
went in and ſmote him, and killed him;</hi> But what became of <hi>Zimri?
Jezabel</hi> could ask, <hi>had</hi> Zimri <hi>peace that ſlew his maſter? 2 King. 9.
31.</hi> No, he had not, for when 'twas told in the camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
that <hi>Zimri had conſpired and alſo ſlain the King;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 16. 16.</note> upon this the
Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell into a mutiny, made <hi>Omri</hi> King, and came
againſt <hi>Zimri,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 16. 18.</note> who for fear was driven to run into the palace
of the Kings houſe, put the houſe on fire about his ears, and was
there burnt to aſhes, that was the end that <hi>Zimri</hi> came to: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King that was killed by his own Subjects was <hi>Iehoaſh</hi> King
of <hi>Iudah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 12. 19, 20, 21.</note> 'tis ſaid, <hi>his ſervants aroſe and made a conſpiracy, and ſlew</hi>
Jehoaſh <hi>in the Houſe of</hi> Millo. But what became of theſe men
that ſlew <hi>Iehoaſh?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 14. 5.</note> 'tis ſaid expreſly 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 5. that <hi>as ſoon as the
kingdom was confirmed in the hand of</hi> Amaziah <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jehoaſh, <hi>that
he ſlew his ſervants which had ſlain the King his father.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 15. 10. 14.</note> So likewiſe
<hi>Shallum</hi> killed <hi>Zecharaiah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he himſelf was ſoon
afterward killed by <hi>Menahim</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gadi,</hi> as 'tis ſtoried,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116115:39"/>
2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 10, 14. Again <hi>Pekah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Remaliab</hi> killed <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaiah</hi>
King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſoon after he himſelfe was killed by
<hi>Hoſhea,</hi> as 'tis recorded 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 25. 30. Many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
might bee alledged, if I ſhould exactly looke over the
Hiſtories of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but theſe may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>5. Tis to be obſerved, that <hi>Omri</hi> who did ſucceed <hi>Zimri</hi> (who
came to ſo untimely an end) was made King by the Souldiers
or Army of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and was he better then the reſt? no, he was
rather worſe,<note place="margin">1 King. 16. 25.</note> 'tis ſaid expreſly, that <hi>Omri wrought evill in the ſight
of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and did worſe then all that were before him.</hi> It is my wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h
that thoſe Rulers or Repreſentatives, or cal them what you wil,
who have the rule of the Kingdome now in their hands, and
have gotten it by the power of an Army, doe not worſe then all
the Kings that ever went before, that we feel not their little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
heavyer upon us then the Kings loins.</p>
            <p>6. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> their firſt King, to <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
the laſt (which was about 480 yeares) were never under
ſuch intolerable oppreſſion and miſery,<note place="margin">2 King. 16. 21.</note> as in the times of thoſe
Kings before mentioned,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Arth.

removalls of their Kings made ſuch ſtrange alterations,
and popular commotions in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the
people had not peace or ſettlement, but lay under the miſeries
either of oppreſſion or Civil wars; thus it was after <hi>Zimri</hi> King of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> was burnt in the place of the Kings houſe; then <hi>Tibni</hi>
and <hi>Omri</hi> had a conteſt about a ſucceſſion, or claime to the
Kingdome; upon this 'tis ſaid, <hi>the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were divided
into two parts, half to make</hi> Tibni <hi>King, another halfe followed</hi> Omri
<hi>to have him King,</hi> upon which a bloody war followed, for three
years and upward. Tis my prayer that a war might not follow
in <hi>England</hi> as did in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This inſtance may ſuffice in ſtead of
many,<note place="margin">I. P. p. 38. l. 34.</note> I ſhall mention no more.</p>
            <p>It ſeems theſe Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>London,</hi> I mean theſe
ſubſcribers could aquieſce in ſuch conceſſions from the King, &amp;c. <hi>then
a little after,</hi> the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>London,</hi> plead Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for the Parliaments acquieſcing in the conceſſions of the King at
<hi>Newport,</hi> which (by the teſtimony of the whole Miniſtry of <hi>Scotland)</hi>
acquieſced in, would deſtroy both Religion and Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:116115:39"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Tis no wonder that you who make ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to maintain errors, ſhould make no more of ſpeaking
falſhood; and that not only againſt the Miniſters, but againſt
the Parliament alſo; you ſay the Parliament did acquieſce in the
Kings conceſſions, which they did not; yea they did wholly
wave that queſtion, Whether the Kings Anſwers to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of both Houſes were ſatisfactory? and like men of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
honor and conſcience they voted only this; <hi>That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
of the King to the Propoſitions of both Houſes, are a ground for
the Houſe to proceed upon for the ſettlement of the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Miniſters did not plead Covenant for the Parliaments
acquieſcing in the Kings conceſſions, (I am ſure their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Vindication hath no ſuch intimation in them) the
Miniſters did hope and beleeve the Parliament would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
more, and the King yeelded to more for the good of
the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>3. The Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did not ſay, that
the Parliament did, or would acquieſce in the Kings conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as ſatisfactory, but only they gave a timely caution, that if
they ſhould be acquieſced in, it would bee dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to Religion and Covenant.</p>
            <p>Look back into your former courſe of life,<note place="margin">I. P. pa. 40. l. 16.</note> and call to mind how many
oaths and ſubſcriptions you have made from time to time, over and over,
&amp;c. And how have you directly for ſworn your ſelves againſt the light
and ſenſe of your own judgment and conſcience? have wee not cauſe to
judg better of many of the Prelaticall party? who being men of learning
and conſcience, and never ſo violent againſt their oppoſers in Church
and State as your ſelves, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Is it not more then enough for you to accuſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
and godly Miniſters of falſity, vain-glory, malignity,
but muſt you now lay Perjury to their charge alſo?</p>
            <p>2. Suppoſe any of them (I am ſure all did not) did ſwear or
ſubſcribe to the Church-government by Biſhops, and to the
book of Common-prayer, (for 'tis of that you ſpeak) and
ſhould now renounce them, yet 1. I thought that you would
account it a badg of their glory, and not aſperſe them with the
ſtain of Perjury for thus doing. 2. Was it agreeable to the Law
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116115:40"/>
of love, or rules of Chriſtianity, to ſay that ſo many godly and
conſcientious Miniſters did forſweare themſelves againſt the
light and ſenſe of their own judgments and conſciences in ſo
doing? 3. Although the Miniſters did ſubſcribe to Biſhops and
the book of Common prayer, yet cannot they juſtly be accuſed
of Perjury, though they did afterwards ſwear to extirpate them,
becauſe Biſhops (and Common-prayer) were ſetled not by a
Divine but meerly a Politicall inſtitution in this Kingdome; the
ſame power that eſtabliſht them, might either for a while ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
or totally aboliſh them without the leaſt ſhew of Perjury:
I ſuppoſe when you were made free you tooke an oath to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Priviledges and Charter of the City; if that Power that
made that Charter think fit to aboliſh or alter it, you will not
think your ſelfe under the guilt of Perjury, for ſubſcribing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Charter ſomewhat different from the former. 4. If the
ſubſcribers have forſworn themſelves, then I am ſure <hi>Iohn Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
and the reſt of your Independent Teachers (if Miniſters)
are as deeply guilty of Perjury as they are; the one ſubſcribed
to no more then what the others did.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas you declare, that <hi>you have cauſe to judg better of the
Prelaticall party, who are men of learning and conſcience, and never ſo
violent againſt their oppoſers in Church and State as the Miniſters.</hi> To
this I have 2 things to ſay, 1. This malicious and malignant
language of yours, ſhews you to be a follower of <hi>Pragmaticus</hi> or
<hi>Aulicus,</hi> rather then a diſciple of <hi>Anticavalieriſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> 2. It ſeems, the
Prelatical party are in your eſteem men of learning and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn Price</hi> his Snapſack. p. 8.</note>
but the Presbyterian party are men of neither; you ſay in
p. 2.<note place="margin">All the godly, learned &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are for defenſive arms, &amp; few there are of the contrary judgment, but Papiſts, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Prelates, Delinquents, and prophane wretches.</note> 
               <hi>they want Miniſteriall abilities,</hi> and here in pag. 40. that they
<hi>forſwore themſelves againſt conſcience, &amp;c.</hi> and if ſo, you account
them to be men neither of learning or conſcience. I am ſure you
were once of another mind, when you reckoned the Prelaticall
party among <hi>Papiſts, Atheiſts, Delinquents and profane wretches,</hi>
and the Miniſters to be learned, godly, and conſcientious, &amp;c.
<hi>O quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi> Surely you are not the man that you
were. Would one think that you ſhould be the man to cry up
the Prelaticall Clergy, and cry down the godly Miniſtry; to
publiſh thoſe unto the world to be men of peace, but theſe to be
violent diſturbers both of Church and State? doe not you juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116115:40"/>
the wicked, and condemn the innocent, both which are an
abomination to God: Alas! what wrong have the Miniſters
done? what violence to any have they ever offered? it may bee
you who wil not be ruled by the golden red of Presbytery, may
have your neck under the iron y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will feel who will be moſt violent againſt their oppoſers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prelaticall party, or the godly Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The truth is,<note place="margin">I. P. p. 41. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The truth is, the ſtink of the camp, both for their
practices and opinions, is come up into the noſtrills of the
Lord of hoſts as an abhorring to him as for their practices, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying

impriſoning many of their perſons; uſing the ſword for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the perſon of the King, &amp; priviledges of Parliament,
which was put into their hands for the preſervation of both;
ſuch practices as theſe, with many others, have no ſweet ſavour
of religion in them. And for their opinions, are there not among
them multitudes who deny the myſtery of the Trinity, the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

of the ſoul, the reſurrection of the body, &amp; ſuch like; and is this
to ſpread the ſweet ſavour of Religion throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
If the Jews were baniſht out of <hi>England</hi> for poyſoning our

Many are of opinion, they have done more hurt by their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,

ſay, they have ſpread the ſavour of Religion abroad, more then
thouſands of the Miniſters of the Goſpell. To conclude, I ſhall

them, that ſo many might follow their pernicious wayes and
tis no wonder if ſuch as have declined and are aſhamed of the
Truth, are aſhamed alſo of the Miniſters that preach it.</p>
            <p>Why may not they <hi>(i.e. the Army)</hi> conclude from ſucceſſes as well
as you,<note place="margin">I. P. p. 44. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>2. p. 45, 46.</note> &amp;c.—2. Though ſucceſſes are not alwaies infallible
teſtimonies of the goodneſſe of the cauſe on which ſide they fall, yet ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
with their circumſtances, do ſometimes moſt evidently vindicate
the mind of God. As 1. when both parties appeal ſolemnly to God, &amp;c.
2. When th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe ſucc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſes are carried on in an uniform manner, the Lord
giving ſeverall years ſucceſſe upon their appeals unto him. 3. When the
glorious Majeſty, power and preſence of God doth appeal after ſuch
appeals, when he ſhall with a ſmall Army of 16000 men deſtroy near
an 100000 men in Arms, as if the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, the <hi>Welch</hi> Army, the
<hi>Kentiſh</hi> Army, the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Army, were conſidered, it would appear. <hi>This is
the ſum of what you ſay about the point of ſucceſſe in three pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>The Miniſters did never conclude ſucceſſes to bee
the infallible teſtimonies of the goodneſſe of the Cauſe, on
which ſide they fall; they know that oftentimes</hi> they that worke
wickedneſſe are ſet up,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 15.</note> and they that tempt God are delivered; yea that
a juſt man may periſh in his righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 15.</note> and that a wicked man may
prolong his life in his wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>2. In this the Papiſts and you are not much unlike, they make
Proſperity a note of the true Church, and you make Succeſſe
an evidence of a good cauſe; if it were ſo, the Heathen Emperors
might plead their Cauſe to be good, and the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to be bad; yea the Turke and the Pope might borrow an
Argument from you that their waies are good, becauſe they
have proſpered, and the Church of God have been perſecuted
and kept under by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:116115:41"/>
3. You think that you have a ſhift that will help you out, by
ſaying, that <hi>ſucceſſes with their circumſtances, as praying, and ſolemn
appealing unto God vindicates the mind of God.</hi> To this evaſion of
yours, I ſhal ſay but this, Succeſſe may not alwaies fal to that ſide
(though juſt) which doth pray and appeal to God, but on that
ſide which is unjuſt, and doth neither. As is clear in the caſe of
the men of <hi>Judah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 20. 18. 23.</note> they ſought unto God, and askt Counſell of
God before they would fight with the children of <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
yet for all that they loſt in two battails 40000 men; yet their
cauſe was good, their prayers and appeals to heaven were ſolemn
and ſerious.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider God may give the Army ſucceſſes not out of any
love or approbation of their wayes; but out of love to his own
name and people, whoſe work for ſome time they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was ſucceſſefull againſt the <hi>Chaldaeans;</hi>
theſe ſucceſſes were given him not for his own ſake, but for the
ſakes of the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> God may uſe the Army as a
battail axe, to break the enemies of his Church in pieces, and
yet neither love their perſons, nor own many of their actions,
but break them in the end. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> did ill to ſay, becauſe he
had a proſperous voyage at ſea, that therefore the Gods did fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
Sacriledge; God neither favours nor loves Rebellion,
though they may proſper that are guilty of it. If you do build
ſo much on ſucceſſes, yet make not preſent but finall ſucceſſe the
ground of your confidence; if the Army perſiſt to juſtifie their
ſinfull actings, mark what will become of them in the latter
end. He conclude this with the wiſh of the Poets.</p>

and wee may expect reſt and peace as the iſſue thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Had the Army as good grounds to put to death
King <hi>Charles,</hi> as <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> had to kill Queen <hi>Athaliah,</hi> I ſhould
not open my mouth. Conſider 1. <hi>Athalia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> was an uſurper of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:116115:42"/>
the Crown of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Read 2 Kings 11. 2. 12, &amp;c.</note> but ſo was not King <hi>Charles</hi> of the Crown
of <hi>England.</hi> 2. What <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did do was by Authority derived
from the young King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who was proclamed and crowned
King by the conſent of the whole realm. 3. <hi>Iehoiada</hi> was not only
a Prince of his Tribe, and the young Kings uncle, but alſo hee
was as it were Lord Protector of the young King, during his
minority; and therefore might without queſtion legally put
that uſurper to death. Prove the King to be ſuch an uſurper as
<hi>Athaliah</hi> was; or the High-Court and Army to have ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as <hi>Iehoiada</hi> had, and Ile be ſilent.</p>
            <p>1. If ſhe had had a true and legall Title to the Crown, as the
King had. 2. If he had ſolemnly ſwore to God to preſerve
her perſon, as you did to preſerve the Kings. 3. If ſhee had
been no Idolater, as the King was not. 4. If he had not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from the young King for doing what he did, would he have
done it? no doubtleſſe.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall paſs that by, that you put the Army before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and only ſpeak to that impulſe of ſpirit, that ſtirred
up the Army and Court of Juſtice to put the King to death; I
ſhall yeeld that they did by an impulſe of ſpirit, but yet I have
reaſon to beleeve 'twas by the impulſe of that ſpirit that now
works mightily in the children of diſobedience, becauſe 'twas
done without and againſt the rule of the Word (as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
by which as the ſpirit, ſo all the impulſes of the ſpirit are
to be tryed, and if they agree not thereto they are Satanicall
ſuggeſtions, not the Spirits inſpirations.</p>
            <p>3. And whereas you expect that <hi>the iſſue of putting the King to
death will be reſt and peace;</hi> I muſt tell you the blood of Kings
hath been oftentimes the ſeeds of diſſentions, commotions, and
deſolations, not of reſt, peace and eſtabliſhment unto Kingdoms;
as I told you before, ſo I ſay again, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
from <hi>Saul</hi> their firſt King, to <hi>Zedekiah</hi> their laſt, were never under
ſuch intolerable oppreſſions and miſeries as in thoſe times
wherein their Kings (though wicked and bloody) were put to
death by their Subjects.</p>
            <p>That the murderer ſhall ſurely be put to death,<note place="margin">I. P. p. 50. l. 1.</note> is a known Precept of
God, if this muſt be diſpenſed withall, ſhew us the abſolute, preſent, and
clear neceſſity of it; if you cannot, will you ſpeak wickedly for God, &amp;c.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:116115:42"/>
As for the Armies prrceedings, if there was a neceſſity that the Land
ſhould be cleanſed from blood-guiltyneſſe, that the great ends of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and all our wars ſhould be ſecured, &amp;c. then was there a neceſſity
on the Army to take that courſe they did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I may anſwer you by way of Retortion, that the
murderer ſhould be put to death, is a known Precept; that <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
and <hi>Owen</hi> had murdered many, was a known practice; for
their pardon there is a known Vote; now if they were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
why were they condemned? if guilty of blood, why were
they ſpared? can you deſpence with blood and none elſe?</p>
            <p>2. Though murdering of one perſonally and maliciouſly
cannot be diſpenſed withall; yet God never required that all
who in a military way ſhed blood ſhould be put to death; as is
clear in the caſe of <hi>Abſolons</hi> Rebellion, and the <hi>Benjamites</hi> unjuſt
war (with many others) neither <hi>David,</hi> nor the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
(when the ſword had determined the controverſy in the field
on their ſides, and had cut off many of the evil doers) held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bound to cut off the remainders that was left of the Armies
either in the one or the other. If you think that this Precept
<hi>(viz.</hi> that the murderer be put to death) reaches to all blood
ſpilt in a military way, then are you bound that every man that
was in the Kings Armies ſhould bee put to death, elſe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to you) the land would be defiled with blood.</p>
            <p>3. To what you ſay in the laſt place, that <hi>there was a neceſſity
on the Army to take that courſe they did, if there was a neceſſity that the
Land ſhould he cleanſed from blood, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall return this briefe
anſwer. 1. The Army pleaded a neceſſity in the year, 1647. for
things of a quite contrary nature, to what they pleaded a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
for in <hi>Nov. 1648.</hi> 2. Who are the moſt competent judges, the
Parliament or the Army, to judge of this neceſſity? if you ſay the
Parliament, they ſaw no ſuch neceſſity, why did not the army then
acquieſce in their judgments as they once promiſed to do? If you
ſay the Army may be judges (which is moſt inequitable for them
to be judges in their own Cauſe) then why may not any other
20000 men in the Kingdome plead neceſſity to oppoſe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as they did to oppoſe the Parliament? ſhould any party,
(whoſe principles are not conſiſtent with, but contrariant to
the Armies proceedings) plead a neceſſity for their appearing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116115:43"/>
for the intereſt of Religion, laws of the land, Priviledges of the
Parliament, and Liberties of the People, &amp;c. how can you juſtifie
the Army, yet blame them? 3. If the neceſſity pleaded for, was ſo
clear, preſent, and abſolute as you pretend; how it comes to paſs
that it can be diſcerned by none but by the Army themſelves &amp;
their own party? This makes me of the ſame mind with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers,
<hi>that the neceſſity pleaded for is but pretended, or elſe contracted
by their own miſcarriages;</hi> the Army that prevailed againſt the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
weapons of their enemies, were overcome by this own poor
dart of pretended neceſſity; true is that Proverb, <hi>durum telum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas;</hi>
could the Army have overcome their groundleſſe fears
and jealouſies, they would never have done what they did; yea
could they have truſted God, they wonld have been of <hi>Auſtins</hi>
mind, <hi>(Ferenda eſt magis omnis iniquitas quam perpeiranda eſt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
iniquitas)</hi> viz. to endure the greateſt evil, rather then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the leaſt ſin.</p>
            <p>If your Temple work goes on ſlowly,<note place="margin">I. P. p. 55 l. 8.</note> then the City is ſet on work,
the Country is excited, the Apprentices encouraged to offer violence upon
the two Houſes, forcing them to Vote and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nvote at pleaſure, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by ſome of your Tribe and ſubſcribers, as ſhall be made good if
occaſion bee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It will turn to your reproach that you are builders
of <hi>Babel,</hi> but to their renown, that they are imployed about
Temple work, which though it go on ſlowly, yet ſafely, you
have no cauſe to deſpiſe the day of ſmall things; hee that hath
laid the foundation ſtone, will rear up the top of the building,
that all the people may cry Grace grace unto it.</p>
            <p>2. And whereas you ſay, that they had <hi>excited men to offer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
to the two Houſes, forcing them to Vote and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nvote, &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
you meaſure other mens corn by your own Buſhell, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens hearts by your own practices, you and your faction
have offered violence to the two Houſes, forcing them to Vote
and Unvote at your pleaſure, and yet you do the evill and other
men muſt beare the blame.</p>
            <p>3. As to that you ſay, that it <hi>ſhall be made good if occaſion bee,
that ſome of the ſubſcribers did encourage the Apprentices to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Houſes,</hi> I ſhall give you but this anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> to give you
a challenge and offer you an occaſion to make it good if you
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116115:43"/>
can; that you have not done it all this while, I impute not to
your lenity but their innocency.</p>
            <p>And thus I have returned you an anſwer to the moſt materiall
paſſages in your book; I ſhall not meddle with thoſe fond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
you propoſe in the latter end thereof; I know one fool can
ask more queſtions in a day, then twenty wiſe men can anſwer
in a year.</p>
            <p>You conclude your book with a prophane deſcant on a ſerious
and ſavoury Sermon of Mr. <hi>Calamies;</hi> you who were once, when
you wrote your Snapſack, ſo humble as to ſay you were neither
a Prophet nor the ſon of a Prophet, are now ſo proud as to
become a Lord &amp; judg of the Prophets? yet thoſe that know you
will count your tongue to be no ſlander; M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Calamies</hi> perſon is
ſo well eſteemed, and his Miniſtry ſo approved, that all your
revilings will turn to his glory, and your ſhame: M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Calamy</hi> only
affirmed that Anarchy, Perjury, Toleration, &amp;c. are ſuch deeps
able to ſink a Kingdome, if you ſay the contrary, you will ſhew
your ſelfe a ſimple and ſhallow fellow. To conclude all,
the counſell I ſhall give you is this, that you would be more in
the ſhop, leſſe in the pulpit, more in your dwelling houſe, leſſe
in the Printing-houſe, then will the Church be leſs diſturbed
and your family better provided for.</p>
