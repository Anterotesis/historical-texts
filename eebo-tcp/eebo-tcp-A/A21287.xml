            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Publike weale is in ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wiſe defined by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, but knowing by experience, that the often repetition of any thyng of graue or ſadde importaunce, wyll be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyous to the reders of this warke, who perchaunce for the more parte haue not ben trayned in lerning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynynge ſemblable matter: I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled one definition out of many, in as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious fourme, as my poore wytte can deuyſe: truſtynge that in thoſe fewe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the true ſignification of a publike wele ſhall euidently appere, to them whom rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can ſatiſfie.</p>
               <p>¶A publike weale is a body lyuyng, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact <note place="margin">publike weale.</note> or made of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry aſtates and degrees of men, whiche is dyſpoſed by the order of equytye, and gouerned by the rule and moderation of reaſon. In the latin tongue it is called <hi>Reſpublica,</hi> of the whiche the <note place="margin">Reſpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</note> worde <hi>Res,</hi> hath dyuers ſignifications, and dothe not onely betoken that, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a thynge, whiche is diſtinct from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:513:10"/>
but alſo ſignyfieth aſtate, condityon, ſubſtaunce, and profyt.</p>
               <p>¶In our olde vulgare, profytte is called <note place="margin">profytte.</note> weale. And it is called a welthy countray, wherin is al thynge that is profitable: And he is a welthy man, that is ryche in money and ſubſtaunce. Publyke (as Uarro ſayth) <note place="margin">publyke.</note> is diriuied of people: which in latyn is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Populus.</hi> wherfore it ſemeth, that men haue ben longe abuſed, in calling <hi>Rempub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam,</hi> a commune weale. And they which do ſuppoſe it ſo to be called, for that, that euery thynge ſhoulde be to all men in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune, without diſcrepaunce of any aſtate or condition, be therto moued more by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualite, than by any good reaſon or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to humanitie. And that ſhall ſo one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere vnto them, that wyll be ſatyſfied ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with auctoritie, or with naturall order and example.</p>
               <p>¶Fyrſte the propre and trewe ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wordes, Publike and Comune, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be borowed of the latin tongue, for the inſufficiencie of our owne langage, ſhal ſufficiently declare the blyndenes of them, which haue hitherto holden and meyntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſayde opinions. As I haue ſayde, publyke toke his begynnynge of people, whiche in latin is <hi>Populus:</hi> in which worde <note place="margin">populus.</note> is conteyned, all the inhabytantes of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme

or citie, of what aſtate or condition ſo euer they be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶Plebs</hi> in engliſſhe, is called the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie, <note place="margin">plebs.</note> whiche ſignifieth onely the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, wherin be conteyned the baſe &amp; vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare inhabitantes, not auaunced to any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or dignitie: whiche is alſo vſed in our dayly comunication. for in the citie of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and other cities, they that be none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, or ſheriffes, be called communers. And in the countrey, at a ſeſſions, or other aſſembly, if no gentyll men be there at, the ſayinge is, that there was none but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltye, whiche proueth, in myne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Plebs</hi> in latine, is in engliſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie: and <hi>Plebeij</hi> be communers. <note place="margin">plebeii.</note>
               </p>
               <p>¶And conſequentely there maye appere, lyke diuerſitie to be in engliſhe, betwene a publyke weale, and a commune weale, as <note place="margin">publyke &amp; commune.</note> ſhuld be in latyn, betwene <hi>Res publica,</hi> and <hi>Res plebeia.</hi> And after that ſignification, if there ſhulde be a commune weale, eyther the communers onely muſt be welthy, and the gentyl and noble men, nedy and myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: orelles excludyng gentylitie, al men muſte be of one degre and ſort, and a newe name prouided. For as moche as <hi>Plebs,</hi> in latine, and comminers in englyſhe, be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des onely made for the diſcrepance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, wherof procedeth Ordre: whiche <note place="margin">Ordre.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:513:11"/>
in thynges, as well naturall as ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, hath euer hadde ſuche a preeminence, that therby the incomprehenſible maieſtye of god, as it were by a bryght leme of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che or candell, is declared to the blynd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes of this worlde.</p>
               <p>¶ More ouer, take awaye Order from all thynges, what ſhulde than remayne? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes nothynge finally, excepte ſomme man wolde imagine eftſones, <hi>Chaos,</hi> whiche of ſome is expounded, a confuſe mixture. <note place="margin">Chaos.</note>
               </p>
               <p>¶ Alſo where there is any lacke of order, nedes muſte be perpetuall conflycte. And in thynges, ſubiecte to nature, no thyng of hym ſelfe onely maye be nouryſſhed: but whan he hath diſtroyed that, wherwith he doth participate, by the order of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hym ſelfe of neceſſitie muſte than peryſſhe, wherof enſueth vniuerſall dyſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>¶ But nowe to proue by example of thoſe thynges, that be within the coumpaſſe of mannes knowlege, of what eſtimation Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre is, not onely among men, but alſo with god, all be it his wyſedome, bountye, and magnificence, can be with no tonge or pen ſufficiently expreſſed. Hath not he ſette de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees &amp; aſtates in all his glorious warkes?</p>
               <p>¶ Fyrſte in his heuenly miniſters, whom, as the Churche affyrmethe, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:513:11"/>
to be in dyuers degrees, called hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarches. Alſo Chriſte ſayth, by his euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, that in the houſe of his father (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is god) be many manſions.</p>
               <p>¶ But to treate of that, whiche by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Elemenꝭ.</note> vnderſtandynge, maye be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Beholde the foure elementes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the body of man is compacte, how they be ſet in theyr places, called ſpheres, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or lower, accordynge to the ſouerayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of theyr natures: that is to ſaye, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the moſte pure elemente, hauinge in it nothyng, that is corruptible, in his place, is hygheſte, and aboue other elementes.</p>
               <p>The ayer, whiche next to the fyre, is moſt pure in ſubſtance, is in the ſeconde ſphere or place: The water, whiche is ſomewhat conſolidate, and approcheth to corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is nexte vnto the erthe: The erthe, which is of ſubſtance gros and ponderous, is ſet, of all elementes, moſte loweſt.</p>
               <p>¶ Beholde alſo the order, that god hath put generally in all his creatures, begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge at the mooſte inferiour or baſe, and aſſendynge vpwarde: he made not onely herbes to garniſhe the erthe, but alſo trees of a more eminent ſtature, than herbes: and yet in the one and the other, be degrees of qualities, ſome pleaſante to beholde, ſome delycate or good in taſte, other holſome
<pb facs="tcp:513:12"/>
and medycinable, ſome commodyous and neceſſarie. Semblably in byrdes, beaſtis, and fyſſhes, ſome be good for the ſuſtina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of man: ſome beare thynges profytable to ſondry vſes: other be apte to occupation and laboure: in dyuerſe is ſtrengthe and fierſenes onely: in many is both ſtrengthe and commoditie: ſome other ſerue for ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: none of them hath all theſe qualities: fewe haue the more parte or many, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautie, ſtrengthe, and profytte. But where any is founde, that hath many of the ſayde propreties, he is more ſette by, than al the other, and by that eſtimation, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre of his place and degree euidentely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth. So that euery kynde of trees, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, birdes, beaſtis, and fiſſhes, beſide their diuerſitie of fourmes, haue (as who ſayth) a peculyer dyſpoſityon, appropered vnto them, by god theyr creatour: ſo that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thynge is ordre, and withoute ordre maye be nothyng ſtable or permanent. And it maye not be called Ordre, excepte it do conteyne in it, degrees, high and baſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the meryte or eſtimation of the thynge that is ordered.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe to returne to the aſtate of manne kynde, for whoſe vſe, all the ſayde creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res were ordeyned of god, and alſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them all, by prerogatiue of knowlege
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:513:12"/>
&amp; wyſedome. It ſemeth, that in hym ſhulde be no leſſe prouidence of god declared, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the inferiour creatures: but rather with a more perfect ordre and dyſpoſition. And therfore it appereth, that god gyueth not to euery man like gyftes of grace, or of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, as it lyketh his diuine maieſtie. Ne they be not in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune (as fantaſtical foles wolde haue all thynges) nor one man hath not all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and good qualities. <note place="margin">vuderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge.</note>
               </p>
               <p>¶ Not with ſtandynge, for as moch as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge, is the moſte excellent gyfte, that man can receyue in his creation, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by he doth approche moſte nyghe vnto the ſimilitude of god, whiche vnderſtandynge is the pryncipall parte of the ſoule: It is therfore congruent, and accordynge, that as one excelleth an other, in that influence, as therby beinge nexte to the ſimilitude of his maker: ſo ſhulde the aſtate of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be auaunced in degree, or place, where vnderſtandynge maye profyt, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dyſtrybuted into ſondry vſes, faculties, and offices, neceſſary for the lyuynge and gouernaunce of mankynd. And lyke as the angels, whiche be moſt feruent in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, be hygheſt exalted in glorye (after the opinion of holy doctours) and alſo the fire, which is the moſt pure of elementes,
<pb facs="tcp:513:13"/>
and alſo dothe clarifie the other inferioure eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, is deputed to the higheſt ſphere or place. So in this worlde, they, whiche excelle other in this influence of vnderſtan dynge, and do imploye it to the deteynyng of other within the boundes of reaſon, and ſhewe them, howe to prouide for theyr ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie lyuynge: ſuche ought to be ſette in a more highe place, than the reſidue, where they maye ſe, and alſo be ſene, that by the beames of theyr excellente wytte, ſhewed throughe the glaſſe of auctoritie, other of inferiour vnderſtanding, maye be directed to the way of vertu and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious liuing.</p>
               <p>¶ And vnto men of ſuche vertue, by verye equitie apperteineth Honour, as theyr iuſt <note place="margin">Honour.</note> rewarde and duetie: which by other mens labours, muſte alſo be meynteyned, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to theyr merytes. For as moche as the ſayde perſons, excellinge in knowlege, wherby other be gouerned: be mynyſters for the only profite and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of them, whiche haue not equall vnderſtandynge: where they, whiche do exerciſe artificiall ſcience, or corporall labour, do not trauaile for theyr ſuperiours only, but alſo for their owne neceſſitie. So the houſeband man fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dethe hym ſelfe and the clothe maker: the clothe maker apparayleth him ſelf and the houſebande: they bothe ſocour other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:513:13"/>
other artificers them: they and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artificers, them that be gouernours.</p>
               <p>¶ But they that be gouernours (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayde) nothyng do acquire by the ſayd influence of knowlege for theyr owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, but do imploye all the powers of theyr wyttes, and theyr dylygence, to the only preſeruation of other their inferiours. Amonge whiche inferiours alſo behoueth to be a diſpoſition and order, accordyng to reaſon: that is to ſay, that the ſlouthfull or idell perſon, do not participate with hym, that is induſtrious, and taketh peyne, wher by the fruites of his labours, ſhulde be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſſhed, wherin ſhulde be none equalite, but therof ſhulde procede dyſcourage, and finally dyſolution, for lacke of prouyſion. Wherfore it can none other wiſe ſtand with reaſon, but that the aſtate of the perſon in preeminence of lyuynge, ſhuld be eſtemed, with his vnderſtandynge, labour, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie: where vnto muſte be added an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of honour and ſubſtaunce, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che nat only impreſſeth a reuerence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of procedeth due obedience amonge ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, but alſo inflameth men, naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to idelnes, or ſenſual appetite, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyte lyke fortune, and for that cauſe, to diſ poſe them to ſtudy or occupation.</p>
               <p>¶ Howe to conclude my fyrſte aſſertion or
<pb facs="tcp:513:14"/>
argument. where al thing is comune, there lacketh ordre: and where ordre lackethe, there all thynge is odyouſe, and vncomly. And that haue we in dayly experience. for the pannes and pottes, garnyſſhe well the ketchyn, and yet ſhuld they be to the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre none ornamente. Alſo the beddes, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtars and pyllowes, beſeme not the hall, no more than the carpettes and kuſſhines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſtable. Semblably the potter and tynker, onely perfecte in theyr crafte, ſhal littell do, in the miniſtration of Iuſtice. A ploughman or carter, ſhall make but a foble anſwere to an ambaſſadour. Alſo a wayuer or fuller, ſhuld be an vnmete capitaine of an army, or in any other office of a gouernour. wherfore to conclude, it is only a publyke weale, where, lyke as god hath dyſpoſed the ſayde influence of vnderſtandynge, is alſo appoynted degrees and places, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the excellencie therof, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to alſo wolde be ſubſtance conuenient, and neceſſarie, for the ornamente of the ſame: which alſo impreſſeth a reuerence and due obedience to the vulgare people or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie, and without that, it can be no more ſayde, that there is a publike weale, than it may be affyrmed, that a houſe without his propre and neceſſary ornamentes, is well and ſufficiently furnyſhed.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:513:19"/>
the time that they were vnder kinges, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che was by the ſpace of. 144. yeres, were well gouerned, nor neuer was among them diſcorde or ſedition: But after that by the perſuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Brutus and Colatinus, whoſe wyfe (Lucretia) was rauyſhed by the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne <note place="margin">Lucrecia.</note> of Tarquine, kynge of Romaynes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſayde Tarquine and all his poſtery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, were exiled out of Rome for euer, but alſo it was finally determyned amonge the people, that neuer after they wolde haue a kynge reygne ouer them. Conſequently the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munaltie more and more encroched a lycence, and at the laſt compelled the Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nate to ſuffre them to choſe yerely amonge them, gouernours of theyr owne aſtate &amp; condition, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they called Trybunes: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Tribunes.</note> whom they reſceyued ſuche audacytie and power, that they finally opteyned the higheſt auctoritie in the publyke weale: in ſo moche, that oftentymes they dyd repele the actes of the Senate, and to thoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes mought a man appele from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or any other offyce or dygnitie. But what came therof in concluſion? Surelye whan there was any difficulte warre immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, they were conſtrayned to electe one ſoueraygne and chyefe of all other, whom they named Dictator, as it were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">Dictator.</note> from whom it was not laufull for any

But bycauſe there appered to be in hym the pryſtinate auctorytie and maieſtie of a kynge, they wolde no longer ſuffre hym to continue in that dignitie, than by the ſpace of .vi. monethes, excepte he than reſigned it, and by the conſente of the people eftſones dyd reſume it. Finally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyl Octauius Auguſtus had diſtroied An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, and alſo Brutus: and finiſhed al the Ciuile warres (that were ſo called bycauſe <note place="margin">Ciuile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> warres</note> they were betwene the ſame ſelfe Romayn citezins) the citie of Rome was neuer long quiete from factions or ſedicions amonge the people. And if the nobles of Rome had not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men of excellent lerning, wiſedome, and proweſſe, &amp; that the Senate, the moſte noble counſaylle in all the worlde, whiche was fyrſte ordeyned by Romulus, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by Tullus hoſtilius, the thyrd king of Romaynes, had not continued, and with great difficultie reteyned theyr auctoritie, I ſuppoſe verylye, that the Citie of Rome had ben vtterly deſolate ſone after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellynge of Tarquine.

of the commoditie of ordre.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo reaſon and commune experyence playnely declare, that where the dominion is large and populouſe, there it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that a prynce haue many inferiour go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours: whiche be named of Ariſtotel, <note place="margin">Politic. li. iiii.</note> his eies, eares, handes, and legges: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che if they be of the beſte ſorte (as he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſaith) it ſemeth impoſsible, a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tre not to be wel gouerned by good lawes. And excepte excellent vertue and lernyng do inhable a manne of the baſe aſtate of the communaltie, to be thought of al men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſo moche auaunced, els ſuche go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours wold be choſen out of that aſtate of men, whiche be called worſhypfull, if amonge them may be founden a ſufficiente nombre, ornate with vertue and wyſedome, mete for ſuche purpoſe: and that for ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry cauſes.</p>
               <p>¶ Fyrſte it is of good congruence, that the ſuperiours in condition or hauiour, ſhulde haue alſo preeminence in adminiſtration, if they be not inferiour to other in vertue.</p>
               <p>Alſo they, hauynge of theyr owne reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues certayne, wherby they haue compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente ſubſtaunce to lyue withoute takynge rewardes: it is lykely, that they wyll not be ſo deſirous of lucre (wherof may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred corruption) as they, whiche haue

very lytteli or nothynge ſo certayne.</p>
               <p>¶ More ouer, where vertue is in a gentyl man, it is commonly myxte with more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, <note place="margin">Gentilme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> more affabilitie, and myldenes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the more parte it is in a perſon rurall or of a very baſe lynage, and whan it hapneth other wyſe, it is to be accompted lothſome and monſtruous.</p>
               <p>¶ Furthermore, where the perſon is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppefull, his gouernaunce, though it be ſharpe, is to the people more tollerable, and they therwith the leſſe grutche or be dyſobedient.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo ſuche menne hauynge ſubſtaunce in goodes by certeyne and ſtable poſſeſſions, which they may aporcionate to theyr owne lyuynge and bryngynge vp of theyr chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in lernynge and vertues, maye (if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repugne not) cauſe them to be ſoo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and furnyſhed towarde the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of a publyke weale, that a poore mannes ſonne, onely by his naturall wytte, without other helpe, neuer or ſeldome may atteyne to the lyke.

               <head>What order ſhulde be in lernynge, and whiche autours ſhulde be fyrſte redde. Capitulo. x.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Owe let vs retourne to the order of lernynge apte for a gentyll man. Wherin I am of Quintilians opinion, that I wolde haue hym lerne greke and latine authours bothe at one tyme, orels to begyn with greke, for as moche as that is hardeſte to come by: by reaſon of the diuerſytie of tonges, whiche be fyue in nombre, and all moſt be knowen, or elles vneth any poete can be wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande. And if a chylde do begyn therin at <note place="margin">The fyrſte lerninge in childhode.</note> ſeuen yeres of aege, he maye contynually lerne greke autours thre yeres, and in the meane tyme vſe the latin tonge as a family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar langage: which in a noble mannes ſonne maye well come to paſſe, hauynge none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons to ſerue hym or kepynge him company, but ſuche as can ſpeake latine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly. And what doubt is there? but ſo maye he as ſoone ſpeake good latine, as he maye do pure frenche, whiche nowe is broughte into as many rules and fygures, and as longe a gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, as is latin or greke. I wyll not contende, who amonge them, that do write grammers of greke (whiche
<pb facs="tcp:513:37"/>
nowe all moſt be innumerable) is the beſt: but that I referre to the diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a wyſe mayſter. Alway I wolde aduyſe hym, not to deteyne the chylde to long in that tedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labours, eyther in the greke or latyne grammer. For a gentyl wytte is there with ſone fatigate.</p>
               <p>¶Grammer, beinge but an introduction to the vnderſtandynge of autors, if it be made to long or exquiſite to the lerner, it in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner mortifyeth his courage: And by that tyme he cometh to the moſt ſwete and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante redynge of olde auctors, the ſparkes of ſeruente deſyre of lernynge is extyncte, with the burdone of grammer, lyke as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel fire is ſone quenched with a gretheape of ſmal ſtickes: ſo that it can neuer come to the principall logges, where it ſhuld longe bourne in a great pleaſaunt fyre.</p>
               <p>¶Nowe to folowe my pourpoſe. After a fewe and quicke rules of grammer, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or interlaſynge it therwith, wolde be redde to the chylde, Eſopes fables in greke: in whiche argument children moch <note place="margin">Eſopes fables.</note> delyte. And ſurely it is a moche pleaſante leſſon, and alſo profitable, as well for that it is elegante and brefe (and not with ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng it hath moch varietie in wordes, and therwith moche helpeth to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of Greke) as alſo in thoſe fables is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:513:37"/>
included moche morall and polytyke wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherfore in the teachynge of them, the maiſter dilygently muſte gather to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe fables, whiche maye be moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to the aduauncement of ſome vertue, wherto he perceyueth the chylde inclyned: or to the rebuke of ſomme vyce, wherto he fyndeth his nature dyſpoſed. And therin the maiſter oughte to exercyſe his wytte, as well to make the child plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vnderſtand the fable, as alſo declaring the ſignification therof compendiouſly, and to the purpoſe. Fore ſene allwaye, that as well this leſſon as all other auctors, which the chylde ſhall lerne, eyther greke or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, verſe or proſe, be perfectly had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the boke: wherby he ſhal not onely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne plentie of the tonges called Copie, but alſo encreaſe and nouriſhe remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wonderfully.</p>
               <p>¶The nexte leſſon wolde be ſome quycke <note place="margin">The .ii. leſſon to children. Lucianus.</note> and mery dialoges, elect out of Luciane, whiche be without ribawdry, or to moche ſkornynge: for eyther of them is exactely to be eſchewed, ſpecially for a noble man, the one anoyenge the ſoule, the other his eſtimation, concernynge his grauitie.</p>
               <p>¶The comedyes of Ariſtophanes maye <note place="margin">Ariſto.</note> be in the place of Luciane, and by reaſon they be in metre, they be the ſoner lerned
<pb facs="tcp:513:38"/>
by harte. I dare make none other compari ſon betwene them, for offendinge the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of them bothe: but thus moche dare I ſaye, that it were better, that a chyld ſhuld neuer rede any parte of Luciane, than all Luciane.</p>
               <p>¶I coud reherſe diuers other poetis, whi che for mater and eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, be very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but I feare me to be to longe from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Homere: from whom as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, <note place="margin">Homerus.</note> proceded al eloquence and lerning. For in his bokes be conteyned, and moſte perfectly expreſſed, not only the docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis marciall and diſcipline of armes, but alſo in comparable wyſedomes, and inſtructions for polytike gouernaunce of people: with the worthy commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and laude of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble princis, wherwith the reders ſhall be ſo all inflamed, that they moſte feruentely ſhall deſire and coueite, by the imitation or their vertues, to acquire ſemblable glory. For the whiche occaſion Ariſtotle, mooſte ſharpeſt witted, and excellent lerned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, as ſone as he had receiued Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander from kinge Philip his father, before any other thynge taught him the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warkes of Homere. Wherin Alexander founde ſuche ſwetenes and frute, that euer after he had Homere, not onely with hym in all his iourneyes, but alſo laide hym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:513:38"/>
his pillowe, whan he went to reſte: and often tymes wolde purpoſely wake ſome houres of the nyght, to take as it were his paſſe tyme with that moſt noble poete. For by the redynge of his warke, called Illia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, where the aſſembly of the moſt noble grekes againe Troy is recyted, with their affaires, he gathered courage and ſtrength againe his ennemies, wyſedome and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for conſultations and perſwations to his people and army. And by the other warke, called Odiſſea, whiche recounteth the ſondry aduentures of the wyſe Uliſſes: he by the example of Uliſſes, apprehended many noble vertues, and alſo lerned to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kape the fraude and deceytfull imagynati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſondry &amp; ſubtile crafty wittes. Alſo there ſhal he lerne to enſerche and pceyue the maners and conditions of them that be his familiars, ſifting out (as I mought ſay) the beſt from the worſte, wherby he maye ſurely commytte his affaires and truſte to euery perſon after his vertues. Therfore I nowe conclude, that there is no leſſon for a yonge gentyll man to be compared with Homere, if he be playnly and ſubſtancially expouned and declared by the mayſter.</p>
               <p>¶Notwithſtandyng, for as moche as the ſayd warkes be very longe, and do require therfore a great tyme to be all lerned and
<pb facs="tcp:513:39"/>
kanned: ſome latin auctour wolde be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with myxt, and ſpecially Uirgile: whiche in his warke called <hi>Eneidos,</hi> is moſte lyke to <note place="margin">Uirgilius.</note> Homere, and almoſte the ſame Homere in latin. Alſo by the ioining together of thoſe auctors, the one ſhall be the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande by the other. And veryly (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd) no one auctour ſerueth to ſo dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wittes, as doth Uirgile. For there is not that affect or deſire, wherto any childes fantaſy is dyſpoſed, but in ſome of Uirgils warkes may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den matter therto apt &amp; propiſe. For what thing can be more famy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar than his bucolikes? nor no warke ſoo nyghe approcheth to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune dalyance &amp; maners of chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the praty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the ſimple ſhepeherdes therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, wonderfully reioyceth the chylde that hereth it wel declared, as I knowe by mine owne experience. In his Georgikes, lorde what pleaſaunt varietie there is, the dyuers graynes, herbes, and flowres, that be there deſcribed, that redynge therin, it ſemeth to a man to be in a delectable gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne or paradyſe. What ploughe manne knoweth ſo moch of houſebandry, as there is expreſſed? who delytynge in good hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſys, ſhall not be therto more enflamed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge there, of the bredyng, cheſyng, and kepyng of them? In the declaration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:513:39"/>
Uirgille leaueth farre behynde hym all breders, hakney menne, and ſkorſers, Is there any aſtronomer, that more exactely ſetteth out the ordre and courſe of the cele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtiall bodyes: or that more truely doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine in his pronoſtications of the tymes of the yere, in their qualities, with the future aſtate of all thynges prouided by huſeban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Uirgile doth recite in that warke?</p>
               <p>If the chylde haue a delyte in huntynge, what pleaſure ſhall he take of the fable of Ariſteus? ſemblably in the hunting of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do and Eneas, whiche is diſcryued mooſte elegantly in his boke of Eneidos.</p>
               <p>If he haue pleaſure in wraſtling, renning, or other lyke exerciſe, where ſhall he ſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more pleſaunte eſbatementes, than that whiche was doone by Eurealus and other troyans, whiche accompanyed Eneas?</p>
               <p>If he take ſolace in herynge mynſtrelles, what mynſtrel may be compared to Iopas, whiche ſange before Dido and Eneas? or to blinde Demodocus, that played &amp; ſange moſte ſwetely at the dyner, that the kynge Alcinous made to Uliſſes? whoſe dityes &amp; melody excelled as farre the ſonges of our minſtrelles, as Homere and Uirgile excell all other poetes,</p>
               <p>¶ If he be more deſyrous (as the mooſte parte of children be) to here thinges mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous
<pb facs="tcp:513:40"/>
and exquiſite, which hath in it a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa ge of ſome thinges incredyble: wherat ſhal he more wonder, than whan he ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde Eneas folowe Sibille into hel? what ſhal he more drede, than the terrible vyſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Cerberus, Gorgon, Megera, and other furies and monſters? howe ſhall he abhorre tyranny, fraude, &amp; auarice, whan he doth ſe the peines of duke Theſeus, Siſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, and ſuche other, tormented for their diſſolute and vicious lyuynge? Howe glad ſone after ſhall he be, whan he ſhal beholde in the pleaſaunt fieldes of Eliſius, the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of noble princis and capitaynes, which for their vertue and labours, in aduaunſing the publyke weales of theyr countryaes, do lyue eternally in pleaſure inexplycable? And in the laſte bokes of Eneidos, ſhal he finde matter to miniſter to hym audacytie, valiaunt courage and polycie, to take and ſuſteyne noble enterpriſes, if any ſhall be nedefull for the aſſailynge of his enemyes. Finally (as I haue ſayde) this noble Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile, like to a good noriſe, giueth to a child, if he wyll take it, euery thynge apte for his witte and capacitie. Wherfore he is in the ordre of lerninge to be preferred before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other autor latine.</p>
               <p>¶ I wolde ſet nexte vnto hym two bokes of Ouid, the one called Metamorphoſios,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:513:40"/>
whiche is as moche to ſaye, as changynge of men in to other fygure or fourme: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is intytled <hi>De faſtis:</hi> where the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the gentyles, and ſpecyally the Romaynes, be expreſſed: bothe ryght ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye for the vnderſtandynge of other poetes. But by cauſe there is lyttell other lernynge in them, concernynge eyther ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous maners or polycie, I ſuppoſe it were better that as fables and ceremonyes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come in a leſſon, to be declared abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly by the maiſter, than that in the ſaide two bokes, a longe tyme ſhulde be ſpente and almoſte loſte: whiche mought be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed on ſuche autors, that do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſter both eloquence, ciuile polycie, and exhortation to vertue.</p>
               <p>¶ Wherfore in his place, lette vs brynge in Horace, in whom is conteyned moch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of lerning, and quickeneſſe of ſentence. This poet may be enterlaced with the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Odiſſea</hi> of Homere, wherin is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wonderfull prudence and fortitude of Uliſſes, in his paſſage from Troye. And if the chylde were induced to make verſis by the imytation of Uirgile and Homere, it ſhulde myniſter to hym moche dylectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and courage to ſtudy: ne the makynge of verſis is not diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſens the noble Auguſtus, and almoſte all
<pb facs="tcp:513:41"/>
the olde emperours made bokes in verſis.</p>
               <p>¶ The two noble poetis, Silius and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, be very expediente to be lerned: for <note place="margin">Silius. Lucanus.</note> the one ſetteth out the emulation in qualy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and prowes of two noble and valiante capitaynes, one ennemye to the other, that is to ſay, Silus writeth of Scipio the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and Haniball, duke of carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſys: Lucane declareth a ſemblable matter, but moche more lamentable: for as moche as the warres were ciuile, and as it were in the bowells of the Romaynes, that is to ſay, vnder the ſtanderdes of Julius Ceſar and Pompei.</p>
               <p>¶ Heſiodus in greke, is more briefe than Uirgile, where he writeth of houſebandry, and doth not ryſe ſo hyghe in philoſophy, but is fuller of fables: And therfore is more illeccbrous.</p>
               <p>¶ And here I conclude, to ſpeke any more of poetis neceſſary for the chyldehode of a gentyll manne: for as moche as theſe (I doubt not) wyll ſuffyce, vntyll he paſſe the age of .xiii. yeres, In whiche tyme child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode declyneth, and reaſon waxeth rype, and apprehendeth thinges with a more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante iugement.</p>
               <p>¶ Here I wolde haue remembred, that I require not al theſe warkes to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly red of a chylde in this time, which were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:513:41"/>
almoſte impoſſible: But I only doſyre, that they haue in euery of the ſayde bokes ſoo moch inſtruction, that they may take ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome profytte. Than the chyldes cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <note place="margin">Poetis de fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and pryſed.</note> infiamed by the frequente redynge of noble poetes, dayely more and more deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to haue experyence in thoſe thynges, that they ſo vehemently do commende in them, that they write of.</p>
               <p>¶ Leonidas, the noble kynge of Sparta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes beynge ones demaunded, of what eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in poetry Tirtaeus (as he ſuppoſed) was: it is written, that he anſwering ſayd, That for ſteryng the mindes of yong men, he was excellent, for as moche as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge meued with his verſys do renne into the batayle, regardynge no peryll, as men all inflamed in martiall courage.</p>
               <p>¶ And whan a man is comen to rype ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and that reaſon in hym is confyrmed with ſerious lernyng and long experience: than ſhall he, in redyng tragedies execrate and abhorre the intollerable life of tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes: And ſhall contemne the foly and dotage, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſed by poetes laſciuious.</p>
               <p>¶ Here wyll I leaue to ſpeake of the firſte parte of a noble mannes ſtudy: And wyll write of the ſeconde parte, whiche is more ſerious, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth in it ſondry maners of lernynge.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter .xiiii. yeres be paſſed of a chyldes age: his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, if he can, or ſome other, ſtudy ouſly exercyſed in the arte of an oratour, ſhal fyrſt rede to hym ſome what of that parte of logike, that is called <hi>Topica,</hi> either of Cicero, or els of that noble clerke <note place="margin">Logike.

               <p>¶ Immediately after that, the art of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torike <note place="margin">Rhetorik.</note> wolde be ſemblably taughte, eyther in greke out of Hermogines, or of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian in latin, beginnyng at the thyrd boke, and inſtructynge dylygently the chylde in that parte of rheteryke principally, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che concerneth perſuation: for as moch as it is moſt apte for conſultation.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:513:42"/>
than the treatiſe that Tulli wrote vnto his ſonne, whiche boke is named the partyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of rhetorike.</p>
               <p>¶ And in good fayth, to ſpeake boldly that I thinke, for hym that nedeth not, or doth not deſyre to be an exquiſite oratour, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell boke, made by the famous Eraſmus <note place="margin">Eraſmus.</note> (whom al gentil wittꝭ ar bounden to tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke, and ſupporte) whiche he calleth <hi>Copiam uerborum &amp; Rerum,</hi> that is to ſay, plentie <hi>of</hi> wordes and maters, ſhall be ſufficiente.</p>
               <p>¶ Iſocrates, concerning the leſſon of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, is euery where wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful profitable, hauinge almoſt as many wyſe ſentences as he hath wordes, and with that is ſo ſwete &amp; delectable to rede, that after hym almoſt all other ſeme vnſauery and tedyous: and in perſuadynge as well a prynce as a pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſon to vertue, the two very lyttell and compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dious warkes, wherof he made the one to kyng Nicocles, the other to his frende Demonicus, wolde be perfectly ka<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and had in continuall memorye.</p>
               <p>¶ Demoſthenes and Tulli, by the conſent of all lerned men, haue preemynence and ſouerayntie ouer al oratours: the one reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge in wonderfull eloquence in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke weale of the Romaynes, who had the empire and dominion of all the worlde: the other of no leſſe eſtimation in the Citie of
<pb facs="tcp:513:43"/>
Athenes, whiche of longe tyme was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the mother of Sapience, and the palaice of muſis and all lyberall ſcyences. Of whiche two oratours may be attayned, not onely eloquence excellent and perfect, but alſo preceptes of wyſedome and gentill maners: with moſte commodious exaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of al noble vertues and policie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mayſter in redynge them, muſt wel obſerue and expreſſe the partes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of rhetoryke in them conteyned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the preceptes of that arte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lerned. The vtilytie that a noble man ſhal haue by redyng theſe oratours is, that whan he ſhall happe to reaſon in counſayle, or ſhall ſpeke in a greatte audyence, or to ſtrange ambaſſadours of great princis: he ſhall not be conſtrayned to ſpeake wordes ſodayne and dyſordred, but ſhall beſtowe them aptely and in theyr places. Wherfore the mooſte noble Emperour Octauius is hyghelye commended, for that he neuer <note place="margin">Octauius.</note> ſpake in the Senate, or to the people of Rome, but in an oration prepared and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo to prepare the chylde to vndeſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of hiſtories, whiche beinge repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the names of countres &amp; townes vnknowen to the reder, do make the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye tedious, orels the leſſe pleaſaunt, ſo if

For what pleaſure is it, in one houre to beholde thoſe realmes, cities, ſees, ryuers, &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, that vneth in an olde mannes lyfe can not be iournayde? what incredible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte is taken in beholdynge the dyuerſities of people, beaſtis, foules, fiſhes, tres, frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and herbes?

               <p>¶ Semblable vtilitie ſhal be founden in the hiſtorie of Titus Liuius, in his thyrde De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, where he writeth of the battayles, that the Romaynes had with Anniball and the Charthaginenſis.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo there be diuers orations, as wel in all the bokes of the ſayde auctors, as in the hiſtorie of Cornelyus Tacitus, whiche be <note place="margin">Cornelius Tacitus.</note> very delectable, and for conſayles very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be had in memory.</p>
               <p>¶ And in good faith I haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought, that the conſultations and orations, writen by Tacitus, do import a maieſte, with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious eloquence therin conteyned.</p>
               <p>¶ In the lerninge of theſe autors, a yonge gentyllmanne ſhall be taughte to note and marke, not onely the ordre and elegancie, in declaration of the hyſtorie, but alſo the occaſion of the warres, the counſailes and preparations on eyther parte, the eſtyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the capitaines, the maner and forme of theyr gouernaunce, the continuance of the battaylle, the fortune and ſucceſſe of the holle affayres. Semblably out of the warres in other dayely affayres, the aſtate of the publike weale, if it be proſperous or

               <p>¶ Surely if a noble man do thus ſeryouſly and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly rede hiſtories, I dare affirme, there is no ſtudy or ſcience for him of equal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie and pleaſure, hauynge regarde to euery tyme and age.</p>

               <p>¶ The prouerbes of Salomom, with the bokes of Eccleſiaſtes and Eccleſiaſticus, be very good leſſons.</p>
               <p>¶ All the hiſtoriall partes of the bible, be ryght neceſſary for to be redde of a noble man, after that he is mature in yeres. And the reſidue (with the newe teſtament) is to be reuerently touched, as a celeſtiall iewel or relyke, hauynge the chiefe interpretour of thoſe bokes, trewe and conſtante faith, and dredefully to ſet handes theron, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶ It wolde not be forgoten, that the lytell boke of the moſte excellent doctour Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Roter.

<pb facs="tcp:513:49"/>
The pride, auarice, and negligence of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, and the lacke or fewenes of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mayſters or teachers.</p>
               <p>¶ As I ſayde, Pride is the fyrſte cauſe of this inconuenience. For of thoſe perſones be ſome, which without ſhame dare affirme, that to a great gentylman, it is a notable reproche, to be well lerned, and to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a great clerke: whiche name they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte to be of ſo baſe eſtimation, that they neuer haue it in theyr mouthes, but whan they ſpeake any thyng in deriſion. Whiche perchaunce they wolde not do, if they had ones layſer to rede our owne cronycle of England, where they ſhal fynde, that kyng <note place="margin">Henry beau clerk kynge of Englande.</note> Henry the fyrſt, ſonne of Wylliam conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and one of the moſt noble princis that euer reygned in this realme, was openly called Henry beau clerke, whiche is in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſhe, fayre clerke, and is yet at this daye ſo named. And wheder that name be to his honour, or to his reproche, let them iuge that do rede and compare his lyfe with his two bretherne, Wylliam, called Rouſe, and Robert le courtoyſe, they both not hauyng ſemblable lernynge with the ſayde Henry, the one for his diſſolute lyuynge and tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, beynge hated of al his nobles and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, fynally was ſodeynely ſlayne by the ſhotte of an arrowe, as he was huntinge in

Which he wolde neuer haue done, if he had ſo moche delyted in good lernynge, as dyd his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The other brother, Robert le Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyſe, beynge duke of Normandy, and the eldeſt ſonne of Wylliam Conquer our, all be it that he was a manne of moche proweſſe, and right expert in martial affayres, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was electe before Godfray of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne, to haue ben kynge of Hieruſalem: yet not with ſtandynge, whan he inuaded this realme with ſondry puiſſaunt armies, alſo dyuers noble menne aydynge hym, his noble brother Henry beau clerke, more by wyſedome than power, alſo by lernyng, addynge policie to vertue and courage, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tymes vaynquyſſhed hym, and dyd put hym to flyght. And after ſondry victories, finally toke hym and kepte hym in pryſon, hauyng none other meanes to kepe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme in tranquillitie.</p>
               <p>¶ It was for no rebuke, but for an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent honour, that the emperour Antonine was ſurnamed philoſopher, for by his moſt noble example of lyuinge and induſtrye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable,
<pb facs="tcp:513:50"/>
he durynge al the tyme of his reygne, kept the publike weale of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes in ſuche a perfecte aſtate, that by his actis he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fyrmed the ſaying of Plato, That bleſſed is that publike weale, wherin either philoſophers do reygne, or els kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be in phyloſophy ſtudiouſe.</p>
               <p>¶ Theſe perſons, that ſo moche contemne lernynge, that they wolde that gentilmens chyldren ſhulde haue no parte or very lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell therof, but rather ſhulde ſpende theyr youth alway (I ſaye not onely in huntynge and haukynge, whiche moderately vſed as ſolaces ought to be, I intende not to dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe) but in thoſe ydle paſtymes, which for the vice that is therin, the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the prynce, and the vniuerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente of the people, expreſſed in ſtatutes &amp; lawes, do prohibite, I meane playenge at dyce &amp; other games named vnleful.

               <p>¶ Who euer reproued the emperour Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driane, for that he was ſo exquiſitly lerned, not onely in greke and latine, but alſo in all ſciences liberal, that openly at Athenes, in the vniuerſal aſſembly of the gretteſt cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the worlde, he by a longe tyme dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with phyloſophers and Rheroricy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, whiche were eſtemed moſt excellent: and by the iugemente of them that were preſente, had the palme or rewarde of vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie?

               <p>¶ A gentyllman, er he take a cooke in his ſeruice, wyll fyrſte examine him diligently, howe many ſortes of meates, potages, and ſauces he can perfectely make, and howe well he can ſeaſon them: that they maye be both pleaſant and nouriſhynge.

               <p>¶ The thyrde cauſe of this hyndrance, is negligence of parentes: which I note ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this poynte. There haue ben dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as well meane gentyll men as of the nobilitie, whiche delytynge to haue theyr ſonnes excellent in lernynge, haue prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them connynge maiſters, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancially haue taught them grammer, and very wel inſtructed them, to ſpeake latin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly: wherof the parentes haue taken moch delectation, but whan they haue had of grammer ſufficient, and be comen to the aege of .xiiii. yeres, and do approche or drawe towarde the aſtate of man, whiche aege is called mature or rype (wherin not onely the ſaide lernynge continued by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che experyence ſhall be perfectely dyge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and confyrmed in perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but alſo more ſeriouſe lernyng con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in other lyberall ſciences, and alſo
<pb facs="tcp:513:53"/>
philoſophy wolde than be lerned) the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, this thynge nothynge regardinge, but beinge ſuffiſed, that theyr chyldren can onely ſpeke latine proprely, or make verſes without matter or ſentence: they from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s forthe do ſuffre theym to lyue in idelnes, or elles puttynge them to ſeruyce, do as it were baniſhe them from al vertuous ſtudy, and from excerciſe of that, whiche they be fore lerned. So that we maye beholde dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yonge gentyll menne, whiche in theyr infancie and chyldehod, were wondred at for theyr aptnes to lernynge, and prompte ſpeakynge of elegant latine, nowe beynge men,: haue not onely forgotten theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruite (as the commune worde is) and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth can ſpeake one hole ſentence in trewe latine, but that wars is, haue all lernynge in deriſion, and in ſkorne therof, wil of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe ſpeake the moſte barberouſly that they can imagine.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil require me to ſhewe myne opinion, if it be neceſſary, that gentil men ſhulde, after the aege of .xiiii. yeres, continue in ſtudy. To be plaine and trewe, therin I dare affirme, that if the elegante <note place="margin">Eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended</note> ſpeakynge of latine be not added to other doctrine, lytel fruite may come of the tong, ſins latine is but a naturall ſpeche, and the fruite of ſpeche is wyſe ſentence, which is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:513:53"/>
gathered and made of ſondry lernynges. And he that hath nothyng but langage on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, maye be no more prayſed than a popin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iay, a pye, or a ſtare, whan they ſpeake feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There be many nowe a days in famouſe ſcholes and vniuerſities, whiche be ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che gyuen to the ſtudy of tonges only, that whan they write epiſtels, they ſeme to the reder, that lyke to a trumpet they make a ſoune without any purpoſe, where vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herken more for the noyſe than for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation that therby is meued. Wherfore they be moche abuſed, that ſuppoſe elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be onely in wordes or colours of Rhetorike. For as Tully ſayth, what is ſo furiouſe or mad a thynge, as a vayne ſoune of wordes of the beſt ſort and moſt ornate, conteyninge neither conning nor ſentence.</p>
               <p>¶ Undoubtedly, very eloquence is in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">what elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is.</note> tonge where any matter or acte done or to be done is expreſſed in wordes clene, pro piſe, ornate, and comely, wherof ſentencis be ſo aptly compact, that they by a vertue inexplicable, do drawe vnto them the myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and conſent of the herers, being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with eyther perſuaded, meued, or to dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation induced.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo euery man is not an oratour, that can write an epiſtle or a flatterynge oration in latin, wherof the laſte (as god helpe me)
<pb facs="tcp:513:54"/>
is to moche vſed. For a ryght oratour may not be without a moche better furniture. Tulli ſayth, that to hym belongeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply catynge or vnfoldinge of ſentence, with a great eſtimation, in gyuynge counſaylle concernyng matters of great importaunce: alſo to hym apperteyneth the ſterynge and quickenynge of people, languyſſhynge or dyſpeyryng, and to moderate them that be raſhe and vnbrydled. Wherfore noble au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours do affyrme, that in the fyrſte infancy of the worlde, men wandrynge lyke beaſtis in woddes and on mountaynes, regarding neyther the religion due vnto god, nor the office perteynynge vnto man, ordered all thynge by bodyly ſtrength: vntyl Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius (as Plato ſuppoſeth) or ſomme other man holpen by ſapience, and eloquence, by ſome apt or propre oration, aſſembled them to gether, and perſwaded to theym, what commoditie was in mutual couerſation and honeſt maners.</p>
               <p>¶ But yet Cornelius Tacitus deſcrybeth <note place="margin">Corn. Ta. de orat.</note> an oratour, to be of more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t qualites, ſayinge, An oratour is he, that can or may ſpeke or reaſon in euery queſtion ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, elegantly, and to perſwade proprely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the dygnitie of the thing that is ſpoken of, the oportunitie of tyme, and pleaſure of them that be herers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:513:54"/>
¶ Tully before hym affyrmed, that a man may not be an oratour, heaped with preiſe, but if he haue gotten the knowlege of all thinges, and artes of greateſt importance. And howe ſhall an oratour ſpeake of that thynge, that he hath not lerned? And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there maye be nothynge, but it maye happen to come in preyſe or dyſprayſe, in conſultation or iugemente, in accuſation or defence: therfore an oratour, by others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction perfectly furnyſhed, maye in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter and lernynge, commende or dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe, exhorte or diſſuade, accuſe or defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d eloquently, as occaſion hapneth. Wherfore in as moche as in an oratour is required to be a heape of all maner of lernynge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of ſome is called the worlde of ſcience, of other the circle of doctrine, whiche is in one worde of Greeke <hi>ENCYCLOPEDIA,</hi> therfore at this daye, maye be founden but a very fewe oratours. For they that come in meſſage from pryncis, be for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour named nowe oratours, if they be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degre of worſhyppe: onely poore men, hauynge equall or more of lernynge, beyng called meſſagers.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo they, which only teache rhetorike (whiche is the ſcyence, wherby is taughte an artiſiciall fourme of ſpekyng, wherin is the power to perſwade, moue, and delyte,
<pb facs="tcp:513:55"/>
or by that ſcience onely do ſpeake or write without any admyniſtratyon of other ſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) ought to be named rhetoriciens, de clamatours, artificiall ſpeakers (named in Greke <hi>Logodedali)</hi> or any other name than oratours.</p>
               <p>¶ Semblably they that make verſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſynge <note place="margin">Poetes.</note> therby none other lernynge, but the crafte of verſifienge, be not of auncient writers named poetes, but only called ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifyers. For the name of a Poete (wherat nowe, ſpecially in this realme, men haue ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che indignation, that they vſe only poetes and poetry in the contempte of eloquence) was in auncient tyme in highe eſtymation: in ſo moche that all wyſedome was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be therin included. And poetry was the firſt philoſophy that euer was knowen, wherby men from theyr chyldhode were brought to the reaſon, how to liue wel, ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge therby not onely maners and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affections, but alſo the wonderful war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of nature, myxtyng ſerious mater with thynges that were pleaſaunt: as it ſhall be manyfeſte to them that ſhall be ſo fortunate to rede the noble warkes of Plato and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle: wherin he ſhall fynde the auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of poetes frequentely alleged: ye and that more is, In poetis was ſuppoſed to be ſcience miſticall and inſpired: and therfore
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:513:55"/>
in latyne they were called <hi>VATES,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che worde ſignifieth as moche as prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And therfore Tulli in his Tuſculane <note place="margin">Ci. Tuſc. queſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> queſtions ſuppoſeth, that a poete can not abundantly expreſſe verſes ſufficiente and complete, or that his eloquence may flowe without labour, wordes well ſounyng and plentuouſe, without celeſtial inſtincio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is alſo by Plato ratified.</p>
               <p>¶ But ſens we be now occupied in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Poetes, it ſhall not be incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to our matter, to ſhewe what profytte maye be taken by the dyligente redynge of auncient poetes: contrary to the falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that nowe rayneth, of them that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in the warkes of poetes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned nothynge but baudry (ſuch is their foule word of reproche) and vnprofytable leaſynges. But fyrſt I wyl interprete ſome verſes of Horace, wherin he expreſſeth the offyce of poetes, and after wyl I reſorte to a more playne demonſtration of ſome wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and counſaylles conteyned in ſome verſes of poetes.

               <p>¶ I could recite a great nombre of ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good ſentences, out of theſe and other wanton poetes, whiche in latine do expres them incomparably, with more grace and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:513:57"/>
delectation to the reder, than our engliſhe tonge may yet comprehend. Wherfore ſens good and wyſe mater maye be pycked out of theſe poetes, it were no reaſon for ſome lyttel mater, that is in theyr verſes, to aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done therfore all theyr warkes, noo more than it were to forbeare or prohibite a man to come into a fayre gardeyne, leſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſauours of ſwete herbes and floures, ſhall meue hym to wanton courage, or leſte in gadringe good and holſome herbes, he may happen to be ſtunge with a nettle. No wyſe man entreth into a gardeyne, but he ſone eſpieth good herbes from nettils, and treadeth the nettils vnder his feete, whiles he gadreth good herbes: wherby he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no damage. Or if he be ſtungen, he ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth lyght of it, and ſhortly forgetteth it.</p>
               <p>Semblably if he do rede wanton mattier, mixte with wiſedome, he putteth the worſt vnder fote, and ſorteth out the beſte: or if his courage be ſtered or prouoked, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth the lyttel pleaſure and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimente that ſhulde enſue of it: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawynge his mynde to ſome other ſtudy or exerciſe, ſhortely forgetteth it.</p>
               <p>¶ And therfore among the iewes though it were prohibyte to chyldren, vntyll they came to rype yeres, to rede the bookes of Geneſis, of the iuges, <hi>Cantica Canticorum,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:513:58"/>
and ſome parte of the booke of Ezechiel the prophete, For that in theym was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned ſome matter, whiche moughte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to incenſe the yonge mynde, wherin were ſparkes of carnall concupiſcence, yet after certayne yeres of mennes aeges, it was lefull for euery man to rede and dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſtudye thoſe warkes. So al though I approue not the leſſon of wanton poetes, to be taughte vnto al chyldren: yet thinke I conueniente and neceſſary, that whanne the mynde is become conſtaunte, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is aſſwaged, or that chyldren of theyr naturall dyſpoſition be ſhamefaſte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinente, none aunciente poete wolde be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded frome the leſſon of ſuche one, as deſyreth to come to the perfecty on of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>¶ But in defendyng of oratours and poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, I had almoſt forgotten where I was. Ueryly there maye no man be an excellent poete, nor oratour, vnleſſe he haue parte of all other doctrine, ſpecially of noble philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. And to ſaye the trouthe, no man can apprehende the very delectation, that is in the leſſon of noble poetes, vnleſſe he haue redde very moche, and in dyuers autours of dyuers lernynges. Wherfore, as I late ſayde, to the augmentation of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, called in latine <hi>Intellectus et mens,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:513:58"/>
is required to be moche redynge and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante ſtudye in euery ſcyence, ſpecially of that part of philoſophy named moral, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che inſtructeth menne in vertue and poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike gouernance. Alſo no noble autour, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially of them that wrate in greke or latine before .xii. C. yeres paſſed, is not for any cauſe to be omytted. For therin I am of Quintilians opinion, that there is fewe or none auncyente warke, that yeldeth not ſome fruite or commoditie to the diligente reders. And it is a very groſſe or obſtinate wytte, that by redyng moche, is not ſome what amended.</p>
               <p>¶ Concernynge the election of other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, to be redde, I haue (as I truſt) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſufficiently my conceipte and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the x. and .xi. chapiters.</p>
               <p>¶ Fynally, like as a delycate tree, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a kernell, whiche as ſone as it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneth out leues, if it be plucked vppe, or it be ſufficiently rooted, and layde in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becometh drye or rotten, and no fruite cometh of it: if it be remoued and ſette in an other ayre or erthe, whiche is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities where it was before, it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blably dieth, or beareth no fruite, or els the fruite that commeth of it, leſeth his verdure and taſt, and fynally his eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So the pure and excellent lerning, wherof
<pb facs="tcp:513:59"/>
I haue ſpoken, thoughe it be ſowen in a chylde neuer ſo tymely, and ſpryngeth and burgeneth neuer ſo pleaſauntly, if before it take a depe rote in the minde of the childe, it be laide a ſide, eyther by to moch ſolace, or continuall attendaunce in ſeruice, or els is tranſlated to an other ſtudy, which is of a more groſſe or vnpleſaunt qualitie, before it be confirmed or ſtablyſhed by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge or dilygent exerciſe, in concluſion it vaniſheth and cometh to nothynge. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let men replie as they lyſt, in myne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, men be wonderfully diſceiued nowe a days (I dare not ſay with the perſuaſion of auarice) that doo put theyr chyldren at the age of xiiii. or .xv. yeres, to the ſtudy of the lawes of the realme of Englande.

               <p>¶ There be ſome alſo, which by theyr fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶ I thinke verily, if childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were brought vp, as I haue written, and continually were reteined in the right ſtudy of very philoſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phy, vntil they paſſed the age of .xxi. yeres, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet to the lawes of this realme (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones brought to a more certain &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious ſtudy, and eyther in engliſhe, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or good french, written in a more clene and elegant ſtile) vndoubtedly they ſhulde become menne of ſo excellente wyſedome, that throughoute all the worlde ſhulde be

               <p>¶ I ſuppoſe, there be dyuers men wil ſay, that the ſwetneſſe that is conteyned in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, &amp; the multitude of doctrines, ſhuld vtterly withdrawe the myndes of yonge men from the more neceſſary ſtudye of the lawes of this realme.

In the great multitude of yonge men, whiche alway wil repayre, and the lawe beinge ones brought in to a more certayne and perfect langage, wyll alſo increaſe in the reuerent ſtudye of the lawe: vndoughtedly there ſhall neuer lacke, but ſome by nature inclyned, dyuers by deſire of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry doctrines, many for hope of lucre or ſome other aduauncement, wyll effectually ſtudy the lawes, ne wyll be ther from withdrawen by any other leſſon, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

is more eloquent. Example we haue, at this preſent tyme, of dyuers excellent ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men bothe in the lawes ciuile and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in phiſike, whiche beynge exactly ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all partes of eloquence, bothe in the Greke tonge and latine, haue not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge red and pervſed the great fardelles and truſſes of the moſt barbarouſe autours ſtuffed with innumerable gloſes: wherby the moſt neceſſary doctrines of lawe &amp; phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyke be mynced into fragmentes, and in all wyſe mens opinions, do perceyue no leſſe in the ſayd lerninges, than they, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew eloquence, or neuer taſted other but the fecis or dragges of the ſayde noble doctrines.

               <p>¶ It is to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, that in the lernyng <note place="margin">The art of retorike in mootinge.</note> of the lawes of this realme, there is at this

Than gather they al in to perfecte remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, in ſuche order as it oughte to be pleaded, whiche is the parte of Rhetorike named <hi>memorie.</hi> But for as moche as the tonge, wherin it is ſpoken, is barberouſe, and the ſtering of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the minde in this realme was neuer vſed: therfore there
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:513:62"/>
lacketh Eloquution, and Pronunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, two the pryncipall partes of Rhetorike. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng ſome lawyers, if they be wel reteyned, wyll in a meane cauſe pronounce right veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly.

Alſo in arguynge theyr ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in myne opinion, they lacke very lytell of the hole art: for therin they do diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerue the rules of Confirmation and Confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin reſteth proufe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proufe: hauing almoſt al the places, wherof they ſhall fetche theyr reaſons, called of oratours <hi>loci co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munes,</hi> whiche I omyt to name, fearynge to be to longe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>¶ Nowe to beholde, what excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie is in the feate of ſwymmynge, ſens no kynge, be he neuer ſo puiſſaunte or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte in the experience of warres, maye aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hym ſelfe from the neceſſities, whiche fortune ſoweth among men that be mortal,
<pb facs="tcp:513:72"/>
And ſens on the helth and ſaulfegarde of a noble capitaine, often tymes dependeth the weale of a realme, nothing ſhulde be kepte from his knowlege, wherby his perſonne maye be in euery ieoperdie preſerued.</p>
               <p>¶ Amonge theſe exerciſes, it ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenyente, <note place="margin">Defence with wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</note> to lerne to handle ſondry way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſpecyally the ſword &amp; the bataile axe: which be for a noble man moſt conuenient.</p>
               <p>¶ But the moſt honorable exerciſe in mine opynion, and that beſemeth the aſtate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <note place="margin">Rydynge and vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of horſis.</note> noble perſonne, is to ryde ſurely and cleane, on a great horſe and a roughe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vndoubtedly not only importeth a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and drede to inferiour perſones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdyng hym aboue the common courſe of other men, dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting a fierce and cruel beaſt, but alſo is no lyttell ſocour, as well in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuete of ennemyes and confoundyng them, as in eſcapynge imminente daunger, whan wyſedome therto exhorteth. Alſo a ſtrong and hardy horſe doth ſome tyme more do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vnder his mayſter, than he with all his weapon: and alſo ſetteth forwarde the ſtroke, and cauſeth it to lyghte with more vyolence.</p>
               <p>¶ Bucephall, the horſe of greatte kynge Alexander, who ſuffred none on his backe <note place="margin">Bucephal.</note> ſaulfe onely his mayſter, at the battayle of Thebes beinge ſore wounded, wolde not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:513:72"/>
ſuffre the kynge to departe from hym to a nother horſe, but perſyſtynge in his fury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe courage, wonderfully continued out the batayle, with his fete and tethe beating downe and deſtroyenge many ennemyes: and many ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blable maruailes of his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth he ſhewed. Wherfore Alexander, after the horſe was ſlayne, made in remembrance of hym a citie in the countreye of India, and called it Bucephal, in perpetuall memorie of ſo worthy a horſe, which in his lyfe had ſo well ſerued hym.</p>
               <p>¶ What wonderful enterpriſes dyd Iulius Ceſar achieue by the helpe of his horſe? whiche not onely dyd excell al other horſis in fierceneſſe and ſwyſte rennyng, but alſo was in ſome partes diſcrepante in fygure from other horſes, hauyng his fore houes like to the fete of a man. And in that figure Plinius writeth, that he ſawe hym kerued before the temple of Uenus.</p>
               <p>¶ Other remembrance there is of dyuers horſes, by whoſe monſtruous power, men did exploite incredible affaires: but by cauſe the reporte of them conteynethe thynges impoſſyble, and is not writen by any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued auctour, I wyll not in this place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herce them. Sauynge that it is yet ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the caſtell of Arundell in Suſſex, was made by one Beauuize, erle of South <note place="margin">Arundell.</note>

               <p>¶ Nowe conſyderynge the vtilitie in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge great horſes, it ſhal be neceſſary (as I haue ſayde) that a gentylman do lerne to ryde a great and fierce horſe whyles he is tender, and the braunes and ſinewes of his thighes not fully conſolidate.</p>
               <p>¶ There is alſo a ryghte good exercyſe, whiche is alſo expedient to lerne, which is named the vauntynge of a horſe: that is to leape on hym at euery ſide without ſtyrope or other helpe, ſpecially whyles the horſe is goinge. And beinge therin expert, than armed at all poyntes to aſſaye the ſame, the commoditie wherof is ſo manifeſte, that I nede no further to declare it.</p>

eloquent philoſopher, maketh a delectable mention, in his boke, called the doctrine of Cirus: and alſo maketh a nother ſpecyall booke, conteynynge the hole diſciplyne of the auncient huntynge of the Grekes, and in that fourme beynge vſed, it is a laudable exercyſe, of the whiche I wyll nowe ſome what write.</p>
               <p>¶ Cirus, and other auncyente kynges of <note place="margin">The hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of Perſians. Xenophon pedia Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri. ii. i.</note> Perſia (as Xenophon wryteth) vſed this maner in all theyr huntynge. Fyrſte, where as it ſemeth, there was in the realme of Perſia but one Citie, whiche as I ſuppoſe, was called Perſepolis, there were the chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren of the Perſians, from theyr infancye, vnto the aege of ſeuentene yeres, broughte vp in the lerning of iuſtice and temperance, and alſo to obſerue contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in meate and drynke: in ſo moche, that whyther ſo euer they wente, they toke with them for theyr ſuſtenaunce, but onely breade and herbes, called Creſsis, in latine <hi>Naſturtium:</hi> and for theyr drynke, a dyſhe to take water out of the ryuers as they paſſed. Alſo they ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſhote, and to caſte the darte or iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn. Whan they came to the aege of .xvii. yeres, they were lodged in the palayſes, that were there ordeyned for the kyng and his nobles, whiche was as wel for the ſaue garde of the citie, as for the example of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraunce,
<pb facs="tcp:513:74"/>
that they dayly had at theyr eies gyuen to them by the nobles: whiche alſo mought be called Peeres, by the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greeke word, wherin they were called <hi>Omotimi.</hi> More ouer, they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ryſe alwaye in the fyrſt ſpring of the daye, and pacyentely to ſuſteyne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye bothe cold and heate: And the kyng dydde ſe them exerciſed in goinge and alſo in rennynge. And whan he intended, in his owne perſonne, to hunte, which he dydde commenly euery moneth, he toke with him the one halfe of the company of yonge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that were in the palayſes. Than toke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man with hym his bowe and quiuer with arowes, his ſworde or hache of ſteele, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel tergate, and two dartes. The bowe and arowes ſerued to purſue beaſtes that were ſwyft: and the dartes, to aſſayle them and all other beaſtes. And whan theyr courage was chaufed, or that by fierſeneſſe of the beaſt they were in daunger, than force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned them to ſtrike with the ſworde, or hache, and to haue good eye at the violent aſſaulte of the beaſte, and to defende them if nede were, with theyr tergates, wherin they accounted to be the treweſt and moſte certayn meditation of warres. And to this huntynge the kynge didde conducte them, and he hym ſelfe fyrſt hunted ſuche beaſtes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:513:74"/>
as he hapned to encounter. And whan he had taken his pleaſure, he than with moſte dilygence didde ſet other forwarde, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge who hunted valyauntly, and refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge them, whom he ſawe negligente or ſlouthfull. But er they wente forth to this huntynge, they dyned competentely: and duryng theyr huntyng they dined no more. For if by any occaſyon theyr hyntinge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued aboue one daye, they toke the ſaide dyner for theyr ſupper: and the next daye, if they kylled no game, they hunted vntyll ſupper tyme: accountynge thoſe two daies but for one. And if they toke any thynge, they eate it at theyr ſupper with ioye and pleaſure. If nothynge were kylled, they eate only bread and creſſis, as I before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed, and dranke therto water. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man wyll diſpreyſe this diete, lette hym thinke what pleaſure there is in breade, to hym that is hungry: and what dylectation is in drinkynge water to hym that is thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. Surely this maner of huntyng may be called a neceſſary ſolace and paſtyme, for therin is the very imitation of battaile. For not onelye it doth ſhewe the courage and ſtrengthe, as well of the horſe as of hym that rydeth, trauerſynge ouer mountaines and valeys, encountrynge and ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng great and myghty beaſtes: but alſo it
<pb facs="tcp:513:75"/>
increaſeth in them both agilitie and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, alſo ſleyght and policie to fynde ſuch paſſages and ſtraites, where they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent or intrap theyr enemies. Alſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce therin, they ſhall eaſyly ſuſteyne trauayle in warres, hunger &amp; thurſt, colde and heate. Hytherto be the wordes of Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon, although I haue not ſette them in lyke order as he wrate them.</p>
               <p>¶ The chiefe huntynge of the valyaunte <note place="margin">The hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of the grekes</note> Grekes was at the lyon, the libarde, the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, the wylde ſwyne, and the beare, and ſometime the wolfe, and the harte. Theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, which was companion to Hercules, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned the greateſt parte of his renoume, for fightynge with the greate bore, whiche the Grekes called <hi>Phera,</hi> that waſted and conſumed the fieldes of a great countrey.</p>
               <p>¶ Meleager likewiſe for ſleinge the great bore in Calidonia, whiche in greatnes and fiercenes, excelled al other bores: and had ſlayne many noble and valyaunt perſones.</p>
               <p>¶ The great Alexander, in tymes vacante from bataile, delited in that maner hunting. On a tyme he faughte alone with a lyon, wonderfull great and fierce, being preſent amonge other ſtraungers, the ambaſſadour of Lacedemonia. And after longe trauaile, with incredible myght, he ouerthrewe the lyon, and ſlewe hym, wherat the ſayde am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:513:75"/>
wondrynge maruaylouſly, ſayd to the kynge, I wold to god (noble prince) ye ſhulde fighte with a lyon for ſome great empire. By whiche wordes it ſemed, that he nothynge approued the valiauntnes of a prince by fighting with a wild beaſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moch more was aduentured, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mought be by the victorie goten.</p>
               <p>¶ All be it Pompei, Sertorius, and diuers <note place="margin">The hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> other noble Romaynes, whan they were in Numidia, Libia, and ſuch other countreys, whiche nowe be called Barbary and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſco, in the vacaty on ſeaſon from warres, they hunted lions, liberdes, and ſuch other beaſtes, fierce and ſauage, to thente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to exerciſe them ſelfes and theyr ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. But al mgihty god be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked, in this realme be no ſuche cruel beaſtis to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. Not withſtandyng, in the huntyng of redde dere and falowe, mought be a great parte of ſemblable exerciſe, vſed by noble men, ſpecially in foreſtis, whiche be ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe: if they wolde vſe but a fewe nombre of houndes, onely to harborowe or rouſe the game, by theyr yornyng to giue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, whiche waye it fleeth, the remenaunt of the diſporte to be in purſuing with iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and other waipons, in maner of warre. And to them, whiche in this huntynge doo ſhewe moſte proweſſe and actiuitie, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
<pb facs="tcp:513:76"/>
or ſome other lyke token, to be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in ſygne of victory, and with a ioyfull maner to be brought in the preſence of him that is chiefe in the companye, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue condygne prayſe for theyr good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour.</p>
               <p>¶ I dyſpraiſe not the huntynge of the foxe with rennynge houndes, but it is not to be compared to the other huntyng in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of exerciſe. Therfore it wolde be vſed in the depe wynter, whan the other game is vnſeaſonable.</p>
               <p>¶ Hunting of the hare with grehoundes, is a ryght good ſolace for men that be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyouſe, or them to whom nature hath not gyuen perſonage, or courage apte for the warres. And alſo for gentylwomen, which feare neyther ſonne nor wynde for appay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe theyr beautie. And perauenture they ſhall be there at, laſſe idell, than they ſhulde be at home in theyr chambres.</p>
               <p>¶ Kylling of dere with bowes or greyhou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, ſerueth well for the pot (as is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune ſaying) and therfore it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie be ſome tyme vſed. But it conteynethe therin no commendable ſolace or exerciſe, in compariſon to the other fourme of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, if it be diligently perceyued.</p>
               <p>¶ As for haukynge, I can finde no notable <note place="margin">Haukinge.</note> remembrance, that it was vſed of auncient
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:513:76"/>
tyme amonge noble pryncis. I call auncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente tyme, before a thouſand yeres paſſed, ſens whiche tyme, vertue and nobleneſſe hath rather decayed than increaſed. Nor I coulde neuer knowe, who founde fyrſt that dyſporte.</p>
               <p>¶ Plinius maketh mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his .viii. boke of the hyſtorye of nature, that in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Grece, called Thracia, menne and haukes, as it were by a confederacie, toke byrdes to gether in this wyſe. The menne ſprange the byrdes out of the buſihes, and the haukes ſorynge ouer them, beate them downe, ſoo that the men moughte eaſyly take them. And than dyd the men departe equally the praye with the faukons, which beynge well ſerued, eftſoones and of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome repayred to ſuche places, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge a lofte, they perceyued men to that purpoſe aſſembled.</p>
               <p>¶ By whiche reherſal of Plinius, we may coniecte, that from Thratia came this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of haukynge. And I doubt not, but many other as well as I, haue ſene a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable experience of wilde hobies, whiche in ſome countreys., that be champaine, will ſore and lie a lofte, houeringe ouer larkes and quayles, and kepe them downe on the ground, whiles they, which awayte on the
<pb facs="tcp:513:77"/>
praye, do take them. But in what wyſe, or where ſo euer the beginninge of haukynge was, ſurely it is a ryghte delectable ſolace, thoughe therof commeth not ſo moch vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie (concernynge exerciſe) as there doth of huntynge. But I wolde oure faukons moughte be ſatisfied with the dyuyſion of their pray, as the faukons of Tracia were, that they nedeed not to deuour the hennes of this realme, in ſuche nombre, that vnles it be ſhortely conſidered, and that faukons be broughte to a more homely dyete, it is ryght lykely, that within a ſhorte ſpace of yeres, our familiar pultrie ſhalbe as ſcarce, as be nowe partriche and feſaunt. I ſpeake not this in diſprayſe of the faukons, but of them whiche kepeth them lyke cokneyes. The meane gentyl men and honeſte houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, whiche care for the gentyl enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinement of their frendes, do find in their dyſhe, that I ſaye trouthe, and noble men ſhal ryght ſhortly eſpie it, whan they come ſodeinly to theyr frendes houſe, vnpuruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for lacke of longe warnynge.</p>
               <p>¶ But now to returne to my purpoſe. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly haukynge, meaſurably vſed and for a paſſetyme, gyueth to a man good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to his ſupper. And at the leaſt waye withdraweth hym from other daliaunce or diſportes diſhoneſt, and to body and ſoule
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:513:77"/>
perchaunce pernicious.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe I purpoſe to declare ſome thing, concernynge daunſynge, wherin is merite of prayſe and dyſprayſe, as I ſhall expreſſe it in ſuche fourme, as I truſt the reder ſhal fynde therin a rare and ſynguler pleaſure, with alſo good lernynge in thinges not yet communely knowen in our vulgare. Which if it be red of hym, that hath good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie and quyete ſylence, I doubte not, but he ſhall take therby ſuche commoditie, as he loked not to haue founden in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, whiche of the more parte of ſad men is ſo lyttell eſtemed.</p>

Whiche moughte be ſpoken of that kynde of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge, which was vſed in the tyme of ſainct Auguſtine, whan euery thing with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire

of Rome, declined from their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the olde maner of danſynge was forgoten, &amp; none remayned, but that which was laſciuious, and corrupted the myndes of them that daunſed, and prouoked ſynne, as ſemblably ſome do at this daye. Alſo at that tyme idolatry was nat clerely extinct, but diuers fragmentes therof remayned in euery region. And perchance ſolemne dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, whiche were celebrate vnto the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims falſe goddis, were yet continued, for aſmoch as the pure religion of Chriſt was nat in al places conſolidate, and the paſtors and curates dyd winke at ſuche recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, fearynge, if they ſhulde haſtily haue reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, &amp; induced ſodaynly the ſeueritie of goddis lawes, they ſhulde ſtyre the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therby to a generall ſedition, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent daunger and ſubuertion of Chriſtis hole religion, late ſowen among them, and nat yet ſufficiently rooted. But the wyſe &amp; diſcrete doctour ſaynte Auguſtine, vſynge the art of an oratour, wherin he was right excellent, omytting all rigorous menace or terrour, diſſuaded theym by the moſte ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt way, from that maner ceremony, belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And yet in theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of this noble doctour, is not ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſprayſe to all daunſynge as ſome men do ſuppoſe. And that for two cauſes. Fyrſt in his compariſon, he preferreth nat before daunſynge, or ioyneth therto any vycious exercyſe, but annecteth it with tyllyng and diggynge of the erthe, whiche be labours incident to mans lyuyng, and in them is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preemynence therof aboue daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge, qualifyeng the offence, they beinge done out of due tyme, that is to ſaye, in an holy daye, concludeth nat daunſynge to be at all tymes and in euery maner vnlaufull or vicious, conſyderynge, that in certayn ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of exſtreme neceſſytie, menne mought bothe ploughe and delue without doing to god any offence. Alſo it ſhall ſeme to them, that ſeriouſly do examyne the ſaid wordes, that therein, Sayncte Auguſtine dothe nat prohybyte daunſynge ſo generally, as it is taken, but onely ſuche daunſes, whiche (as I late ſayde) were ſuperſtytious, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in theym a ſpyce of ydolatrie, or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les dydde with vncleane motions or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynances irritate the myndes of the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to venereall luſtes.

THere be ſendry opinions of the ory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall beginninge of daunſynge.

And yet all other princis eyther feared hym, or had him in a fatherly reuerence. Whyche prayſe with the honour thervnto dewe, as inheritaunce diſcendeth by ryght vnto his moſte noble ſonne, our moſt dere ſouerayn lorde that nowe preſently reigneth. For as Tulli ſayth, The beſt inheritance, that the fathers leaue to their children, excelling al other patrimonie, is the glorie or prayſe of vertue and noble actis: and of ſuche fayre inheritance his highnes may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare with any prynce that euer reygned, whyche he dayly augmenteth, adding therto other ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>ADouble in daunſynge is compacte of the nombre of thre, wherby maye be noted theſe thre branches of pru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence, election, experience, and modeſtie: by theym the ſayde vertue of prudence is made complete, and is in her perfection. Election is of an excellente power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie, and hath ſuche a maieſtie, that ſhe wyll not be approched vnto of euery man. For ſome there be, to whom ſhe denyeth her preſence, as chyldren, naturall fooles, men beinge frantike, or ſubdued with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, alſo they that be ſubiectes to flaterers and proude men. In theſe perſones reaſon lacketh libertie, which ſhuld prepare their entrie vnto election. This Election, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">Election.</note> is a parte, and as it were a membre of prudence, is beſte deſcribed by Oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">Oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> whiche is the principall parte of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylle, and is compacte of theſe thynges folowynge.</p>
               <p>¶ The importaunce of the thynge conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, The facultie and power of him that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſulteth, The time whan, The fourme how, The ſubſtance wherwith to do it, The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and vſages of the countreys, For whom and agayne whom it oughte to be

Immediately co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the auctoritie of election, who taketh on her to appoynt, what is to be effectually folowed or purſued, reiectinge the refidue.

                  </note> For without her, Election is fruſtrate, and all inuention of manne is but a fantaſye. And therfore who aduiſedlye beholdethe the aſtate of mans lyfe, ſhall well perceiue, that al that euer was ſpoken or writen, was to be executed, and to that inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was ſpeche ſpecially gyuen to man, wherin he is moſte dyſcrepante, from brute beaſtes, in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe by them what is good, what vicious, what is profitable, what improfitable, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by clereneſſe of wytte do excel in know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege, to theſe that be of a more inferior ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie. And what vtilitie ſhulde be acquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſuche declaration, if it ſhulde not be experienced with diligence?</p>
               <p>¶ The philoſopher Socrates had not ben <note place="margin">Socrates.</note> named of Appollo the wiſeſt man of al Gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cia, if he had not dayly practyſed the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, whiche he in his leſſons commended.</p>
               <p>¶ Iulius Cacſar, the fyrſte emperour, al <note place="margin">Iul. Ceſar.</note> thoughe, there were in hym moche hydde
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:513:94"/>
lernyng, in ſo moche as he fyrſt founde the order of our kalandre, with the Cikle and byſexte, called the leape yere: Yet is he not ſo moche honoured for his lernynge, as he is for his diligence, wherwith he exploited or brought to concluſion thoſe counſayles, whiche as wel by his excellent lerning and wiſedome, as by the aduiſe of other expert counſaylours were before trayted, and (as I mought ſay) ventilate.</p>
               <p>¶ Who wyl not repute it a thing vayne and ſcornefulle, and more lyke to a maye game, than a mater ſeriouſe or commendable, to beholde a perſonage, whiche in ſpeche or writynge expreſſeth nothyng but vertuous maners, ſage and dyſcrete counſayles and holy aduertiſementes: to be reſolued in to all vices, folowynge in his actis no thynge that he hym ſelfe in his wordes approueth and teacheth to other?</p>
               <p>¶ Who ſhal any thynge eſteme theyr wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which with great ſtudies fynde out remedies and prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s neceſſary for thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gss dyſordred or abuſed, and where they them ſelfes may execute it, they leaue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, wherby theyr deuyſes, with the ſoune that pronounced them, be vanyſſhed and come to nothynge?</p>
               <p>¶ Semblably it is to be thoughte in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine. Wherfore as it ſemed, it was
<pb facs="tcp:513:95"/>
not without conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirmed by Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, that the knowlege and contemplation of Natures operatyons, were lame and in a maner imperfcte, if there folowed none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall experience. Of this ſhalbe more ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the later ende of this warke.</p>
               <p>¶ Herwith wolde be conioyned or rather <note place="margin">Modeſtie.</note> myxte with it, the vertue called Modeſtie: whiche by Tulli is defined to be the know <note place="margin">Offi. i.</note> lege of oportunitie of thynges to be doone or ſpoken, in apoyntinge and ſettinge them in tyme or place to them conuenient &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre. Wherfore it ſemeth, to be moche lyke to that, whiche men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munely call Dyſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">Diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Al be it diſcretio in latin ſignifieth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration: wherin it is more lyke to Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as it is communely vſed, it is not onely lyke to Modeſtie, but it is the ſelfe Modeſtie. For he that forbereth to ſpeke, all thoughe he can doo it bothe wyſely and eloquentely, bycauſe neyther in the tyme nor in the herers, he findeth oportunitie, ſo that no fruite maye ſuccede of his ſpeche, he therfore is vulgarely called a dyſcrete perſonne.</p>
               <p>¶ Semblably they name him diſcrete, that <note place="margin">Diſcrete.</note> puniſheth an offendour leſſe than his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes doo requyre, hauynge regarde to the weakenes of his perſone, or to the aptenes of his amendement.</p>

¶ So do they in the vertue called Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, <note place="margin">Liberalite</note> where in gyuynge, is had conſydera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well of the condition, and neceſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the perſone that receyueth, as of the benefite that cometh of the gifte receyued. In euery of theſe thynges and theyr ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable, is Modeſtie: which worde not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge knowen in the englyſhe tongue, ne of all them whiche vnderſtode latine, excepte they had red good auctours, they impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely named this vertue dyſcrecion. And nowe ſome men do as moch abuſe the word <note place="margin">Modeſtie abuſed.</note> modeſtie, as the other dyd dyſcretion. For if a man haue a ſad countenaunce at all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and yet not being meued with wrath, but pacient, and of moſte gentyllneſſe, they whiche wolde be ſene to be lerned, wyl ſay that the man is of a great modeſtie. Where they ſhulde rather ſaye, that he were of a great Manſuetude: whiche terme beynge <note place="margin">Manſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> ſemblably before this tyme vnknowen in our tongue, maye be by the ſufferaunce of wiſe men, now receiued by cuſtome, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the terme ſhall be made famyliare. That like as the Romaynes tranſlated the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Grecia into theyr citie, we maye, if we lyſte, bringe the lernynges and wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of theym bothe into this realme of Englande, by the tranſlation of theyr war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, ſens lyke enterpriſe hath ben taken by
<pb facs="tcp:513:96"/>
frenche men, Italyons, and Germaynes, to our no lyttel reproche for our neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and ſlouth.</p>
               <p>¶ And thus I conclude the laſte parte of daunſynge, whiche dilygentely beholden, ſhall appere to be as well a neceſſary ſtudy, as a noble and vertuouſe paſtime, vſed and contynued in ſuche fourme as I hytherto haue declared.</p>

was ſome tyme embraced of wyſe men and vertuous.</p>
               <p>¶ It is writen to the praiſe of Xerxes king <note place="margin">Kyng Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes.</note> of Perſia, that in tyme vacaunt from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of his realme, he with his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des had planted innumerable trees, which longe or he died brought forthe abundance of fruite, and for the craftie and dylectable ordre in the ſettynge of them, it was to all men, beholdynge the princis induſtrye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedynge maruaylous.</p>
               <p>¶ But who abhorreth not the hyſtorye of <note place="margin">Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus.</note> Serdanapalus, kynge of the ſame realme? whiche hauynge in deteſtation all princely affaires, and leuyng al company of men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed him ſelfe in a chamber with a greate multitude of concubynes: and for that he wold ſeme to be ſome time occupied, or els that wanton pleaſures and quyetneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to hym tedyouſe, he was founde by one of his lordes in a womans attyre ſpyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge in a diſtafe amonge perſones defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whiche knowen abrode, was to the people ſo odiouſe, that fynally by them he was burned, with all the place wherto he fledde for his refuge.</p>
               <p>¶ And I ſuppoſe there is not a more plain <note place="margin">Playing at diſe.</note> fygure of idelneſſe, than play inge at dyſe. For beſides, that therin is no maner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyſe of the body or mynde, they whiche

               <p>TUlli ſaith in his firſt boke of Officis, We be not to that intente broughte vp by nature, that we ſhulde ſeme to be made to playe and dyſport, but rather to grauitie and ſtudyes of more eſtymation. Wherfore it is writen of Alexander, empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure of Rome for his grauitie called <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus,</hi> that in his chyldehode, and before he was taughte the letters of greeke or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, he neuer exercyſed any other playe or game, but onely one, wherin was a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylitude
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:513:99"/>
of Iuſtice: and therfore it was called in latine <hi>Ad Iudices,</hi> whiche is in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyſhe to the iuges. But the fourme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not expreſſed by the ſaide auctour, nor none other that I haue yet red. Wherfore I wyll repaire againe to the reſidue of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt exerciſe.</p>
               <p>¶ And for as moche as Galene in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde <note place="margin">Exerciſe for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge of helthe.</note> booke of the preſeruation of helthe, declareth to be in them theſe qualities or dyuerſyties, that is to ſaye, that ſomme be done with extendynge of myghte, and as it were vyolentely, and that is called valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunte exercyſe: Some with ſwyfte or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty motion, other with ſtrengthe and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie, and that maye be called vehemente: The partycular kyndes of euery of them, he deſcribeth, whiche were to longe here to be reherſed</p>
               <p>¶ But in as moche as he alſo ſaythe, that he that is of good aſtate in his body, ought to know the power and effect of euery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyſe: but he nedethe not to practiſe any other, but that whiche is moderate and meane betwene euery extremytie: I wyll now brefely declare, in what exerciſe nowe in cuſtume amonge vs, maye be moſt found of that medyocritie, and maye be augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or mynyſſhed, at the pleaſure of hym that doth exercyſe, without therby appay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payrynge
<pb facs="tcp:513:100"/>
any parte of dilectation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie therof procedynge.</p>
               <p>¶ And in mine oppinion none may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of ſhoting in a longe bowe.</note> with ſhootynge in the longe bowe, and that for ſondrye vtylytyes that come therof, wherin it incomparably excelletly all other exercyſe. For in drawynge of a bowe, eaſy and congruent to his ſtrength, he that ſhooteth, doth moderately exerciſe his armes, and the other parte of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and if his bowe be bygger, he muſte adde to more ſtrengthe, wherin is no leſſe valiaunt exerciſe than in any other, wherof Galene writeth.</p>
               <p>¶ In ſhootynge at buttes, or brode arowe markes, is a mediocritie of exercyſe of the lower partes of the bodye and legges, by goinge a lyttel dyſtaunce a meſurable paſe. At rouers or pryckes, it is at his pleaſure that ſhoteth, howe faſte or ſoftly he lyſteth to go: and yet is the prayſe of the ſhooter, neyther more ne leſſe, for as farre or nyghe the marke is his arowe, whanne he goeth ſoftly, as whan he renneth.</p>
               <p>¶ Tenyſe, ſelledome vſed, and for a lyttell <note place="margin">Tenyſe.</note> ſpace, is a good exerciſe for yong men, but it is more violent than ſhotynge, by reaſon that two men do play. Wherfore neyther of them is at his owne libertie to meaſure the exercyſe. For if the one ſtryke the balle
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:513:100"/>
harde, the other that intendeth to receyue hym, is than conſtrayned to vſe ſemblable vyolence, if he wyll retourne the bal from whens it came to hym. If it trille faſte on the grounde, and he intendeth to ſtoppe, or if it rebounde a greatte dyſtaunce from hym, and he wolde efteſones returne it, he can not than kepe any meaſure in ſwyftnes of mocion.</p>
               <p>¶ Some men wolde ſay, that in mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whiche I haue ſoo moche prayſed in ſhootynge, why ſhuld not bouling, claiſhe, pynnes, and koytynge, be as moche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended? Ueryly as for two the laſte, be to be vtterly abiected of all noble men, in lyke wyſe foote balle, wherin is nothynge but beaſtely fury, and extreme violence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of procedeth hurte, and conſequently ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and malice do remayn with them that be wounded. Wherfore it is to be put in per petuall ſylence.</p>
               <p>¶ In clayſſe is employed to littel ſtrength, in boulynge often tymes to moche, wherby the ſinewes be to moche ſtrayned, and the veynes to moche chafed: wherof often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes is ſene to enſue ache, or the decreas of ſtrength or agilitie in the armes, where, in ſhoting, if the ſhoter vſe the ſtrength of his bowe within his owne tiller, he ſhall neuer be therwith grieued or made more feble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:513:101"/>
¶ Alſo in ſhotyng is a double vtilitie, wher in it excellethe all other exercyſes and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes incomparably. The one is that it is, and alway hath ben, the moſt excellent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery for warres, wherby this realme of Englande hath ben nat only beſt defended from outwarde hoſtilitie, but alſo in other regions a fewe englyſhe archers haue ben ſene to preuayle agaynſte people innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Alſo wonne inpreignable cities and ſtronge holdes, and kept them in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the ſtrength of their enemies. This is the feate, wherby englyſhe men haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt dradde and had in eſtimation with out warde princis, as well ennemyes as alies. And the commoditie therof hath bene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued as far as Hieruſalem, as it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere in the lyues of Rycharde the fyrſt, &amp; Edwarde the fyrſte, kynges of Englande, who made ſeueral iourneis to recouer that holy citie of Hieruſalem into the poſſeſſion of chriſten men, and achieued them hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, the rather by the power of this feate of ſhootynge.</p>
               <p>¶ The premiſſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, O what cauſe <note place="margin">Decaye of Archers.</note> of reproche ſhall the decay of archers be to vs nowe lyuyng? Ye what irrecuperable damage either to vs or them, in whoſe time nede of ſemblable defence ſhall happen? whyche decaye, though we alredy ꝑceiue,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:513:101"/>
feare, and lament, &amp; for the reſtoryng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ceſſe not to make ordynaunces, good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and ſtatutes: yet who effectually put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his hande to contynuall execution of the ſame lawes and prouyſyons? or behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge them dayly broken, wynketh nat at the offendours? But I ſhall hereof more ſpeake in an nother place, and retourne nowe to the ſeconde vtilitie, founde in ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge in the longe bowe, whiche is kylling ofdere, wyld foule, and other game, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is bothe profyte and pleaſure aboue any other artyllery.</p>
               <p>¶ And verily I ſuppoſe, that before croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes and handgunnes were brought into this realme, by the ſleight of our enemies, to thentent to diſtroy the noble defence of archery, contynuall vſe of ſhotynge in the longe bowe made the feate ſo perfect and exacte amonge engliſhe men, that they tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſurely and ſoone kylled ſuch game, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they lyſted to haue, as they nowe can do with the croſſebowe or gunne. But this ſuffyſeth, for the declaration of ſhootyng, wherby it is ſufficientely proued, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably excellethe all other exercyſe, paſtyme, or ſolace.</p>
               <p>¶ And hereat I conclude to write of exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyſe, whiche apperteyneth as wel to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis and noble men, as to all other by theyr

               <p>¶ To Scipio, beinge in his manour place, called Linternu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, came dyuers great theues and pyrates, only to the intent to ſe his per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſone, of whoſe wonderfulle proweſſe and ſondry vyctories they harde the renoume.

<pb facs="tcp:513:108"/>
called to Scipio with a loude voyce, ſayinge that they came nat as enemyes, but wondrynge at his vertue and proweſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only to ſee him, whiche if he vouched ſaufe, they wolde accounte for an heuenly benefyte. That being ſhewed to Scipio by his ſeruauntes, he cauſed the gaates to be ſette wide open, and the theues to be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to entre: who kyſſynge the gates and poſtes with moche reuerence, as they had bene of a Temple or other place dedicate, humbly approched to Scipio, whyche vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged theym in ſuche fourme, that they as ſubdued with a reuerente drede, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge his maieſtie, at the laſt ioyfully kyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his hande oftentymes, which he beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnely offred to theym, made humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ſo departed, laying in the porch ſemblable offrynges, as they gaue to theyr goddes: And forth with retourned to their owne habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, reioyſing incredibly, that they had ſene and touched a prince ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and valyant.</p>
               <p>¶ It is no lyttell thyng to meruayle at, the maieſtie ſhewed in extreme fortune and my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſery. The noble Romayne Marius, whan he had ben .vii. tymes Conſul, being vayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyſhed by Scilla, after that he had longe hyd him ſelfe in mariſes and deſert places, was fynally conſtrayned by famyne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:513:108"/>
to a towne called Minturne, where he truſted to haue ben ſuccoured. But the inhabitantes, dreding the cruelte of Scilla, toke Marius, and put hym into a dongeon, And after ſente to ſlee hym their commune hangeman: whiche was borne in Cimbria, a countrey ſomtime diſtroyed by Marius. The hangman, beholdyng the honourable porte and maieſtie, that remayned in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, nat withſtandynge that he was out of honorable apparayle, and was in garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes torne and fylthy, he thought that in his vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage appered the terrible battayle, wherin Marius vanquyſhed his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tray men: he therfore all tremblynge, as conſtrayned by feare, dydde lette falle out of his hande the ſwerde, wherwith he ſhoulde haue ſlayne Marius, and leuing him vntouched, fledde oute of the place. The cauſe of his feare reported to the people, they meued with reuerence, afterwarde ſtudied and deuyſed howe they mought delyuer Marius from the malyce of Scilla.</p>
               <p>¶ In Auguſtus, emperour of Rome, was a natiue maieſtie. For as Suetomꝰ writeth, from his eien proceded rayes or beames, whyche perced the eien of the beholders.

               <p>¶ But nowe to confirme by true hiſtories, that accordynge as I late affirmed, nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic <note place="margin">Nobilitie wherin it is.</note> is not only in dignitie, auncient lignage, nor great reuenues landes or poſſeſſyons, let yong gentylmen haue often tymes tolde to theym, and (as it is vulgarely ſpoken) layde in theyr lappes, how Numa Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius was taken from huſbandry, whiche he <note place="margin">Numa klg of Romais</note> exerciſed, and was made king of Romayns by electyon of the people. What cauſed it ſuppoſe you, but his wiſedome and vertue, whiche in him was very nobilitie: and that nobylitie broughte hym to dygnitie? And if that were not nobylytie, the Romaynes were meruaylouſely abuſed, that after the dethe of Romulus theyr kynge, hauinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge

them a hundred ſenatours, whome Romulus dyd ſet in auctoritie, and alſo the blod royal, and olde gentylmen of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynes, who by the procurement of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the Romains, bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their doughters, inhabited the citie of Rome, they wold nat of ſomme of them electe a kynge, rather than aduaunce a ploughman and ſtraunger to that autoritie.</p>
               <p>¶ Quintius, hauing but .xxx. acres of land, <note place="margin">Quintius Dictator.</note> and beinge ploughman therof, the Senate and people of Rome ſente a meſſager to ſhewe hym that they had choſen hym to be <hi>DICTATOR,</hi> whiche was at that tyme the higheſt dignitie among the Romains, &amp; for thre monethes had auctoritie royal. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius herynge the meſſage, lette his plough ſtande, &amp; went into the citie, &amp; prepared his hooſt, agein the Samnites, and vanquiſhed them valiantly. And that done, he ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his office, and being diſcharged of the dignitie, repaired ageyne to his ploughe, and applied it diligently.</p>
               <p>¶ I wold demaund nowe, if nobilitie were only in the dignitie, or in his proweſſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he ſhewed agaynſt his ennemies. If it were only in his dignite, it therwith ceſſed, and he was (as I mought ſay) eſtſones vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, and than was his proweſſe vnrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whiche was the chiefe and origynall
<pb facs="tcp:513:113"/>
cauſe of that dignite: whiche were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent and without reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If it were in his proweſſe, proweſſe conſiſtynge of valiaunte courage and martial polycie, if they ſtyl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in the perſonne, he maye neuer be with out nobilitie, whiche is the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and as it were the ſurname of <abbr>vtue.</abbr>

               <p>¶ Ought not theſe two Romaynes, which by theyr death gaue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of victorye, be called noble? I ſuppoſe no man that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth what reaſon is, wyll denie it.</p>

               <p>¶ Thus I conclude, that nobylytie is not after the vulgare opynion of menne, but is onely the prayſe and ſurname of vertue. Whiche the lenger it continueth in a name or linage, the more is nobilitie extolled and meruayled at.</p>

               <p>¶ Affabilitie is of a wonderfull efficacie or power in procuryng loue. And it is in ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wyſe, but moſte proprely, where a man is facyle or eaſye to be ſpoken vnto. It is alſo where a man ſpeketh courteyſely with

a ſwete ſpeche or countenaunce, wherwith the herers (as it were with a delycate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour) be refreſhed, and alured to loue him, in whom is this moſte delectable qualytie.

Lorde god howe they be ſore blinded, which do wene, that haulte countenaunce is comelyneſſe of nobylitie, where vndoubtedly, nothynge is therto, a more greatter blemyſhe: As they haue wel proued, which by fortunes mutabilite haue chaunged their aſtate, whan they perceiue that the remembrance of theyr pride, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth all pitie, all men reioyſynge at the chaunge of theyr fortune.</p>
               <p>¶ Dioniſe, the proude kynge of Sicile, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that for his intollerable pride, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his people out of his realme, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menbraunce of his haulte and ſtately coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, was to all men ſo odiouſe, that he

               <p>¶ The pride of Carquine, the laſt kyng of Romaynes, was more occaſion of his exile, than the rauyſſhynge of Lucrecia, by his ſonne Arunciꝰ, for the malice that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his pryde had longe gathered, fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge valiaunt capitaynes, Brutus, Cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Lucretius, and other nobles of the citie, at the laſt braſte out, and takynge oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the rauiſſhement, all thoughe the king were therto not partie, they vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulſed

as moch as Ceſar in his youth loued Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilia, the mother of Brutus, and as menne ſuppoſed, vſed her more familiarly than ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſtie required. Thus Ceſar by omittinge his olde affabilitie, did incenſe his next fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶ Beneuolence, if it doo extende to a hole countreye or citie, is proprely called cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, <note place="margin">Charitie.</note> and ſome tyme zele: and if it concerne one perſon, than is it called Beneuolence. And if it be very ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and to one ſinguler perſon, than maye it be named loue or ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Loue. Amitie.</note> Of that vertuous diſpoſition procedeth an acte, wherby ſome thynge is complyed, whiche is profitable and good to hym that receyueth it. And that vertue, if it be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, or (as I mought ſaye) endeuour, is called than Beneficence: and the dede (vulgarly named a good tourne) maye be called a benefytte. If it be in money, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynge that hath ſubſtaunce, it is than <note place="margin">Liberalite</note> called Liberalitie, whiche is not alwaye a vertue as Beneficence is: for in wel doinge (whiche is the ryght interpretation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence) can be no vice included. But Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, <note place="margin">Seneca de benef.</note> thoughe it procede of a free and gentyll harte, wyllynge to do ſome thynge thankeful, yet may it tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſe the bondes of vertue, eyther in exceſſyue rewardes, or expences, orels employenge treaſour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, or other ſubſtaunce on ꝑerſons vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,

or on thynges inconuenient, and of ſmall importaunce. Al be it ſome thynke ſuche maner of erogation not to be worthy the name of Liberalitie.</p>
               <p>¶ Ariſtotle defineth a liberal man, whiche <note place="margin">A liberal man. Ethic. 2.</note> doth erogate, accordinge to the rate of his ſubſtance, and as oportunitie hapneth. He ſayth alſo in the ſame place, that Liberaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is not in the multitude or qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tite of that which is gyuen, but in the habite or facion, of the gyuer. For he gyueth accordynge to his habilitie. Neither Tulli approueth it to be Liberalitie, wherin is any myxture of auarice or rapine: for it is not properly Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, to exacte iniuſtely, or by violence or crafte to take goodes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> particuler per ſons, and diſtribute them in a multitude: or to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many iniuſtly, and enriche ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with on perſonne or fewe. For as the ſame autour ſayth, the laſt precept concernynge benefytes or rewardes is, to take good hede, that he contende not agaynſt equitie, ne that he vpholde none iniurie.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe wyll I procede ſeriouſly and in a due forme to ſpeke more pticulerly of theſe thre vertues.

               <p>¶ Fyrſte I beholde the dygnitie of that vertue, conſyderynge that god is therby chiefly knowen and honoured, both of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel and man. As contrary wyſe, the deuyll is hated and reproued both of god and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his malyce, whiche vice is contrarious and repugnant to Beneuolence.

               <p>¶ Nowe let vs ſee, where any other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may be equall in dignitie with this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Beneuolence: or if any vertue remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, where this is excluded?

but diſceite, rauine, auarice, and tyrranny. What of Fortitude? but beaſtely crueltie, oppreſſion, and effuſion of bloode. What iuſtice may there be without beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? ſens the fyrſt or chiefe porcion of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (as Tulli ſaith) is to indomage no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, onles thou be wronfully vexed. And what is the cauſe hereof, but equal &amp; entier loue, whiche being remoued or ceſſinge, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth not hym ſelfe to take from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther al thynge that he coueteth, or for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thynge that diſcontenteth him, wold not forthwith be auenged: wherby he confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Nowe wyl I endeuoure me to recreate the ſpirites of the dylygente reder, with ſome delectable hyſtories, wherin is any noble remembrance of this vertue Beneuolence, that the worthynes therof maye appiere in a more plaine declaration: For in euery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, exaumple is the beſte inſtructour.

               <p>¶ And here it is to be noted, that if a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour <note place="margin">That Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyce neuer lacke bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uolence.</note> of a publyke weale, iuge, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miniſtre of iuſtice, do gyue ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte on e that hath tranſgreſſed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, or puniſſheth hym accordynge to the qualitie of his treſpas: Beneuolence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not any thynge peryſhed: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnation or puniſhement, is either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hym that erreth into the traine of ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue, or to preſerue a multitude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> domage, by puttynge men in fcare, that be prone to offende, dreding the ſharpe correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they beholde a nother to ſuffre.

               <p>¶ But peraduenture ſome, which ſeke for ſtertynge holes to maynteyne theyr vices, wyll obiecte, ſayinge, that Moyſes was a holy prophete, and a perſon electe by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, to delyuer the chyldren of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael out of captiuitie, whiche he coulde not haue done, if he had not ben of ſuche pacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and charitie.

For as Tulli ſaith, Nothinge is more to be loued, or to be ioyned togyther, than ſimy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytude <note place="margin">Ci. off. i.</note> of good maners or vertues: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be the ſame or ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blable ſtudies, the ſame wylles or deſires: in them it hapneth, that one in an other as moch delyteth as in him

               </p>
               <p>¶ Ariſtotle ſaith, Frendeſhyp is a vertue, or ioyneth with vertue. whiche is affirmed <note place="margin">Tulli de amicitia.</note> by Tulli, ſaying, Frendeſhyppe can nat be without vertue, ne but in good men onely. Who be good men, he after declareth, to be thoſe perſones, whiche ſo do beare theym ſelues, and in ſuche wyſe do lyue, that their faythe, ſuretie, equalitie, and lyberalitie, be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued. Ne that there is in them any couetyſe, wylfulneſſe, or folehardynes, and that in theym is great ſtabilitie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: them ſuppoſe I (as they be taken) to be called good men, whiche doo folowe (as moche as men maye) nature the chiefe capytayne or guyde of mannes lyfe More ouer, the ſame Tulli defyneth frendſhyppe in this maner, ſayinge, It is noone other thynge, but a perfect conſent of al thynges appertaining aſwell to god as to man, with Beneuolence and Charitie. And that he knoweth nothing gyuen of god, except ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience, to man more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious. whiche de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>finition is excellent &amp; very true. For in god and all thynge that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of god, nothing is of more greatter eſtimation, than loue, called in latine <hi>AMOR,</hi> wherof <hi>AMICITIA</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, named in englyſhe frendſhyppe or amitie: the whiche taken awaye frome the
<pb facs="tcp:513:140"/>
lyfe of man, no howſe ſhall abide ſtanding, no fyelde ſhall be in Culture. And that is lyghtly perceyued, if a man do remembre, what commeth of diſſention and dyſcorde, fynally he ſeemeth to take the ſonne frome the worlde, that taketh frendſhyppe from mannes lyfe.</p>
               <p>¶ Sens frendſhyp can nat be but in good men, ne may not be without vertue, we may be aſſured, that therof none euyl may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, or therwith any yuel thyng may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate. Wherfore in as moche as it maye be but in a fewe perſones (good men being in a ſmalle nombre) And alſo it is rare and ſeldome, as all vertues be communely, I wyll declare after the opynion of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and partely by commune experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, who amonge good men be of nature moſte apte to frendſhippe.</p>
               <p>¶ Betwene all men that be good, can nat alway be amitie, but it alſo requireth, that they be of ſemblable or moche like maners or ſtudy, and ſpecially of maners. For Gra uitie and Affabilitie, be euery of them lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable qualities. So be Seueritie and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabilitie. Alſo Magnificence &amp; Liberalite, be noble vertues: and yet Frugalitie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is a ſobreneſſe or moderation in liuing, is, and that for good cauſe of all wyſe men extolled. Yet where theſe vertues and qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:513:140"/>
be ſeperately in ſondry perſons aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, may welle be perfecte concorde, but frendeſhyp is there ſeldome or neuer. For that, which the one for a vertue imbraceth, the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temneth, or at the leſte negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, wherfore it ſemeth, that it, wherein the one deliteth, is repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the others nature: And where is any repugnaunce, may be none amitie, ſens frendeſhyp is an entier conſent of wylles and deſires. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is ſeldome ſene, that frendeſhyp is betwene theſe perſons, A man ſturdy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion inflexible, and of ſoure countenance and ſpeche, with hym that is tractable, and with reaſon perſwaded, and of ſwete cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and entertaynment. Alſo betwene hym, whiche is eleuate in auctoritie, and a nother of a very baſe aſtate or degree, ye &amp; if they be both in an equall dignitie, if they be deſyrous to clyme: as they do aſcende, ſo frendſhyp for the more parte decayeth. For as Tulli ſaythe, in his fyrſte booke of offices, what thing ſo euer it be, in the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che many can nat excelle, or haue therin ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorytie, therein often tymes is ſuche a contention, that it is a thynge of all other moſte difficile, to kepe amonge them good or vertuous company: that is as moche to ſay, as to retayne amonge them frendſhyp and amitie. And it is oftentymes ſene, that
<pb facs="tcp:513:141"/>
diuers, which before they came in autorite, were of good &amp; vertuous condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, being in their proſperitie were vtterly changed, and diſpiſyng their old frendes, ſet all their ſtudy and pleaſure on their newe acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. Wherin men ſhall perceyue to be a wonderfull blyndnes, or (as I mought ſay) a madneſſe, if they note diligentely all that I ſhall hereafter write of frendeſhyp. But nowe to reſorte to ſpeke of them, in whom frenſhyp is moſt frequente, and they alſo therto be moſt aptely diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>¶ Undoutedly it be ſpecially they, whiche be wyſe, and of nature inclyned to Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, Liberalitie, and Conſtance. For by wyſedome is marked and ſubſtancially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the wordes, actes, and demeanure of all men, betwene whome hapneth to be any entercours or familiaritie, whereby is ingendred a fauour or diſpoſition of loue. Beneficence, that is to ſaye, mutually put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge to their ſtudie and helpe in neceſſary affaires, induceth loue. They that be lybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, do withholde or hyde nothynge from them, whom they loue, wherby loue incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. And in them that be conſtant is neuer myſtruſte or ſuſpition, nor any ſurmyſe or yuelle reporte can with drawe theym from their affection. And hereby frendeſhyppe is made perpetuall and ſtable. But yf ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:513:141"/>
of ſtudy or lernynge be ioyned vnto the ſayde vertues, frendſhip moche rather hapneth, and the mutuall enteruewe and conuerſation is moche more pleaſaunt, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the ſtudies haue in them any dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable affection or motion. For where they be to ſerious, or full of contention, frende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is oftentymes aſſaulted, whereby it is often in peryll. Where the ſtudy is elegant, and the matter illecebrous, that is to ſaye ſwete to the reder, the courſe wherof is ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther gentyll perſwaſion and quicke reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges, than ouer ſubtyll argumente, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious controuerſyes: there alſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the ſtudentes do delyte one in a nother, and be without enuye or malycy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contention.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe let vs try out, what is that frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe, that we ſuppoſe to be in good men. Ueryly it is a bleſſed and ſtable connexyon of ſondry wylles, makynge of two perſons one, in hauynge and ſuffrynge. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a frende is proprely named of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, the other .I. For that in theym is but one minde and one poſſeſſion: and that, which more is, a man more reioyſeth at his frendes good fortune, than at his owne.</p>

Whereat the kyng laughynge, demaunded of him ſkornfully, what pledge he wolde leaue hym, to come agayne. At the whiche wordes, his company on ſtepte forthe and ſayde, that he wolde remayne

The yonge man that ſhuld haue died, was ſuffred to departe home to his hous, where he did ſet all thynge in order, and dyſpoſed his goodes wyſely. The day appointed for his retourne was commen, the tyme moche paſſed. Wherfore the kynge called for hym that was pledge. Who came forth meryly, without ſemblaunte of drede, offringe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde the ſentence of the tyraunte, and with out grudginge, to dye for the ſauing the life of his frende. But as the offycer of iuſtyce had cloſed his eien with a kerchiefe, &amp; had drawen his ſwerde, to haue ſtryken of his hede, his felowe came renning and crieng, that the daye of his appoyntmente was not yet paſte: wherfore he deſired the miniſter of iuſtice to loſe his felowe, and to prepare to do execution on hym, that had giuen the occaſion, whereat the tyraunte beynge all abaſhed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded both to be broughte in his preſence, and whan he had inough wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶ There was in the cytie of Rome a noble ſenatour, named Fuluius, who ſente his ſonne, called Titus, beinge a chylde, to the citie of Athenes in Grece (whiche was the fountayne of al maner of doctrine) there to lerne good letters: and cauſed hym to be hoſted with a worſhypfull man of that citie,

called Chremes. This Chremes hapened to haue alſo a ſonne, named Giſippus, who not onely was equal to the ſayde yong Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in yeres, but alſo in ſtature, proporcion of body, fauour, and colour of viſage, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce and ſpeche. The two chyldren were ſo lyke, that without moche difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it coulde not be decerned of theyr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre parentes, which was Titus from Giſip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pus, or Giſippus from Titus. Theſe two yonge gentyllmen, as they ſemed to be one in fourme and perſonage, ſo ſhortely after acquaintaunce, the ſame nature wrought in theyr hartes ſuche a mutuall affection, that theyr wylles and appetites dayly more and more ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federated them ſelues, that it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med none other, whan theyr names were declared, but that they had only chaunged theyr places, iſſuing (as I mought ſay) out of the one body, &amp; entringe into the other.

Gyſippus, by the goodes of his father was knowen to be a manne of great ſubſtaunce: wherfore there were offred to hym greate and ryche mariages.

But the yonge man, hauyng his harte all redy wedded to his frende Titus, &amp; his minde fixed to the ſtudy of philoſophie, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge that maryage ſhulde be the occaſion to ſeuer him both from thone and thother, refuſed of longe tyme to be perſwaded, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll at the laſte, partly by the importunate callynge on of his kynneſmenne, partely by the conſente and aduyſe of his dere frende Titus, therto by other deſired, he aſſented, to mary ſuche one as ſhulde lyke him. What ſhall nede any wordes? his frendes found a yonge gentyl woman, whiche in equalitie of yeres, vertuous condicions, nobilitie of blode, beaute, and ſufficiente richeſſe, they thought was for ſuche a yonge man apt and conueniente.

And therwith he ſente out from the botome of his harte depe and colde ſyghes, in ſuche plentie, that it lacked but litel that his hart ne was ryuen in peces. In dolour and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe toſſed he him ſelfe by a certain ſpace but to no man wolde he dyſcouer it. But at the laſte, the peyne became ſo intollerable, that wold he or no, he was inforced to kepe his bed, beinge for lacke of ſlepe and other naturall ſuſtenaunce, broughte in ſuche fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, that his legges mougt not ſuſteine his body.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:513:145"/>
that he laye ſycke in his bed, had forthwith his harte perced with heuyneſſe, and with all ſpede came to hym, where he laye. And beholdynge the roſiall colour, whiche was wonte to be in his viſage, tourned into ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, the reſydue pale, his ruddy lyppes wan, &amp; his eyen ledy and holowe, moughte vneth kepe hym ſelfe from wepyng, but to the entente he wolde not dyſcomforte his frende Titus, diſſimuled his heuyneſſe, and with a comfortable countenaunce demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Titus, what was the cauſe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, blamynge hym of vnkyndeneſſe, that he ſo longe had ſuſteyned it, without gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge hym knowlege, that he moughte for hym haue prouyded ſome remedye, if any mought haue begoten, though it were with the dyſpendynge of all his ſubſtaunce.

Suerly that defaulte can be by no reaſon excuſed. Wherfore it is onely I, that haue offended. For who may by ryght proue, that ye haue treſpaſed, that by the ineuitable ſtroke of Cupides dart are thus bytterly wounded?

Nay nay Titus, it is (as I haue ſaid) the onely prouydence of god: ſhe was by hym from the begynnynge prepared to be your lady and wyfe. For ſuch feruent loue entreth not in to the harte of a wyſe manne and vertuous, but by a dyuyne dyſpoſyton:
<pb facs="tcp:513:148"/>
whereat yf I ſhoulde be dyſcontented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or grudge, I ſhulde not only be iniuſte to you, with holdynge that from you, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly yours, but alſo obſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant agaynſt the determination of god, whiche ſhal neuer be founden in Giſyppus. Therfore gentyll frende Titus, dyſmaye you not at the chaunce of loue, but receyue it ioyously with me, that am with you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge diſcontented, but meruaylous glad, ſens it is my happe to finde for you ſuche a lady, with whome ye ſhall lyue in felicitie, &amp; receyue fruite to the honour and comfort of all your lynage.

               <p>¶ <hi>VVITH</hi> theſe wordes Titus beganne to

meue, as it were out of a dreme, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, whether he harde Giſyppus ſpeke, or elles ſawe but a viſyon, lay ſtyll as a man abaſhed. But whan he behelde the teares, tryckelynge downe by the face of Gyſyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, he than recomforted hym, and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng hym for his incomparable kyndneſſe, refuſed the benefyte that he offered, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, that it were better, that a hundred ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vnkynde wretches, as he was, ſhulde peryſſhe, than ſoo noble a manne, as was Gyſippus, ſhulde ſuſteyne reproche or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. But Gyſyppus eſteſones comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Titus, and therwith ſware and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that with fre and gladde wyl he wold that this thynge ſhulde be in fourme afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde accomplyſſhed, and therwith inbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and ſwetely kyſſed Titus. Who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge the matter ſure, and not feyned, as a man not ſycke, but only awaked out of his flepe, ſet hym ſelfe vp in his bed, the quicke bloud ſome what reſorted vnto his vyſage, and after a lyttell good meates and drinkes taken, he was ſhortely and in a fewe dayes reſtored in to his old facion and figure. To make the tale ſhorte. The daye of mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was commen. Gyſyppus accompanied with his alies &amp; frendes, came to the houſe of the damoſell, where they were honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly &amp; ioyouſly feſted. And betwene him and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:513:149"/>
the mayden was a ſwete entertaynemente, whiche to beholde, all that were preſente, toke moche pleaſure and comfort, prayſing the beautie, goodlyneſſe, vertue, and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which in this couple were excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other, that they hadde euer ſene. What ſhal I ſay more? the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were radde and ſealed, the dowar apointed, and all other bargaynes concluded, &amp; the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of either parte toke their leaue &amp; dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the bride, with a fewe women (as was the cuſtome) brought into her chambre: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it was before agreed, Titus conueyed hym ſelfe, after Gyſippus retourned to his houſe, or perchance to the chambre appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted for Titus, nothyng ſorowfull, although that he hartily loued the mayden, but with a gladde harte and countenaunce, that he hadde ſo recouered his frende from deth, and ſo well broughte hym to the effecte of his deſyre. Nowe is Titus in bedde with the mayden, not knowen of her, nor of any other, but for Gyſippus. And fyrſte he ſweetely demaunded her, if that ſhe loued him, &amp; dayned to take hym for her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, forſakyng all other. whiche ſhe al bluſhing with an eye halfe laughynge, halfe mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge (as in poynte to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denheed, but ſuppoſinge it to be Gyſippus that aſked her) affirmed.

aſketh her, if ſhe in ratifieng that ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, wold receyue his ryng, which he had there alredy: wherto ſhe conſentyng, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the rynge on her fynger, and vnloſeth her gyrdell. what thynge els he dyd, they two only knewe of it. Of one thynge I am ſure, that nyghte was to Titus more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, than euer was the lengeſt daye of the yere, ye and I ſuppoſe a hoole yere of dayes. The morowe is comen.

I chooſynge rather to lyue with hym, as his company on and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, ye and as his ſeruaunt, rather than to be conſull of Rome. Thus my kyndenes hath be wel acquyted (or as I mought ſay) redoubled, delyueryng me from the deth, ye from the moſte cruel and peynefull deth of all other. I perceyue ye wonder here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at noble Athenienſis, and noo meruayle. For what perſon ſhulde be ſo hardy, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte any ſuche thyng ageynſt me, being a Romayne, and of the noble blode of the Romaynes?

Nay nay my fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, I haue none of you all therin ſuſpected. I perceyue ye deſyre and harken to knowe, what he was, that preſumed to do ſo cruell and great an enterpriſe. It was loue, noble Athenienſis, the ſame loue, which (as your poetes doo remembre) dydde wounde the more parte of all the goddis, that ye doo

I ſee, you wolde fayne knowe, who ſhe is, that I loued. I wyll no lenger delaye you noble Athenienſis: It is Sophronia, the lady, whom Gyſippus had choſen to haue to his wyfe, and whome he moſte entierly loued. But whan his mooſte gentyll harte perceyued, that my loue was in a moche hygher degree than his toward that lady, and that it proceded neither of wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, neyther of longe conuerſation, nor of any other corrupte deſyre or fantaſie, but in an inſtant, by the onely looke, and with ſuche feruence, that i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediatly I was ſo cruciate, that I deſired, &amp; in all that I mought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked

               <p>¶ At theſe wordes all they that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, began to murmure, and to caſte a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainous and greuous loke vpon Giſippus. Than ſpake ageyne Titus.</p>

But ſuche a frende, as I was (hauyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our ſimilitude, the longe approued concorde, alſo myne aſtate and condytion) he was ſure to fynde neuer none. Alſo the damoſell ſuffereth no diſper gemente in hyr bloode, or hynderance in her mariage, but is moche rather aduaunced (no dyſpreyſe to my dere frende Gyſippus). Alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider noble Athenienſis, that I toke her nat my father lyuynge, whan ye mought haue ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that as well her ryches as her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autie, ſhoulde haue therto allured me: but ſoone after my fathers deceaſe, whan I far exceded her in poſſeſſions and ſubſtance, whan the moſte notable men of Rome and of Italy, deſired myn alia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Ye haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all cauſe to reioyſe and thanke Gyſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, and nat to be angry, and alſo to extoll his wonderfulle kyndeneſſe towarde me, wherby he hath wonne me and al my blode ſuche frendes to you and your cytie, that ye may be aſſured, to be by vs defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt all the worlde: whiche beinge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, Giſippus hath well deſerued a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or ymage of golde, to be ſet on a piller, in the myddes of your citie, for an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable monumente, in the remembraunce of our incomparable fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhyp, &amp; of the good that therby may come to your citie.

ye wyll imagyne any thyng to the damage of my dere frende Gyſippus, after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partynge, I make myne auowe vnto god, creatour of all thynge, that as I ſhall haue knowlege therof, I ſhall furth with reſorte hyther, with the inuyncible power of the Romaynes, and reuenge him in ſuche wyſe againſt his enmies, that al Grece ſhal ſpeke of it to their perpetuall diſhonour, ſhame, and reproche.</p>
               <p>¶ And therwith Titus &amp; Gyſippus rooſe, but the other for feare of Titus diſſembled their malyce, makynge ſemblaunt, as they had ben with all thynge contented.</p>
               <p>¶ Sone after Titus, beinge ſent for by the auctorite of the ſenate and peple of Rome, prepared to departe out of Athenes, And wolde faine haue hadde Gyſippus to haue goone with hym, offrynge to deuyde with hym all his ſubſtance and fortune. But Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus, conſiderynge howe neceſſarye his counſayle ſhuld be to the citie of Athenes, wolde nat depart out of his countray, nat withſtandynge that aboue all erthly thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he moſt deſired the company of Titꝰ: whiche abode alſo, for the ſayd conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Titus approued.</p>
               <p>¶ Titus with his lady, is departed towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the citie of Rome. Where at their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge, they were of the mother of Titus,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:513:153"/>
his kynſemen, and of al the ſenate and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ioyouſly receyued. And there liued Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus with his lady in ioye inexplycable, and had by her many faire children: and for his wyſedome and lernynge was ſo hyghely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemed, that there was no dignitie or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable offyce within the Citie, that he hadde not with moche fauour and prayſe a chye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and occupied.</p>
               <p>¶ But now let vs reſorte to Giſippus, who immediately vpon the departing of Titus, was ſoo malygned at, as well by his owne kynſemen, as by the frendes of the ladye, that he, to theyr ſemynge ſhamefully aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, lcauynge her to Titus, that they ſpared not dayly to vexe hym with all kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of reproche, that they coulde deuyſe or imagine: and fyrſte they excluded hym out of theyr counſayle, and prohibited from hym al honeſt company. And yet not being therewith ſatisfyed, fynally they adiuged hym vnworthy to enioye any poſſeſſions or goodes, left to hym by his parentes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he (as they ſuppoſed) by his vndeſcrete frendſhyppe had ſo dyſtayned. Wherfore they dyſpoyled hym of all thynges, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte naked, expelled him out of the citie. Thus is Gyſippus, late welthy, and one of the mooſte noble men of Athenes, for his kynde harte, banyſſhed his owne countrey
<pb facs="tcp:513:154"/>
for euer, and as a man dyſmayed, wandring hyther and thyther, fyndynge no man that wolde ſocour hym. At the laſt, remembring in what pleſure his frend Titus liued with his lady, for whom he ſuffred theſe dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, concluded to go to Rome, and declare his infortune to his ſaid frend Titus. What ſhall nede a longe tale? in concluſyon, with moche peyne, colde, hunger, and thurſte, he is commen to the citie of Rome, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently enquiringe for the houſe of Titus, at the laſte he came to it: but beholdinge it ſo beauteous, large, and pryncely, he was aſhamed to approche nygh to it, beynge in ſo ſymple aſtate and vnklad, but ſtandeth by, that in caſe Titus came forth out of his howſe, he moughte preſente hym ſelfe to hym. He beynge in this thoughte, Titus holdynge his lady by the hande, iſſued out from his doore, and takynge theyr horſes to ſolace them ſelfe, beheld Giſyppus: and beholdynge his vyle apparayle, regarded hym not, but paſſed furthe on theyr waye, wherewith Gyſippus was ſoo wounded to the harte, thynkynge Titus had contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his fortune, that oppreſſed with mortal heuynes, fell in a ſowne, but beynge reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by ſome that ſtode by, thynkyng him to be ſyeke, furth with departed, entending not to abide any lenger, but as a wilde beaſt

But for werineſſe he was conſtrayned to entre into an olde barne, without the citie, where he caſtinge him ſelfe on the bare gronde, with wepynge and dolorous cryenge bewayled his fortune: But moſte of all accuſynge the ingratitude of Titus, for whom he ſuffred all that myſery: the remembraunce wherof was ſo intollerable, that he determined no lenger to lyue in that anguyſhe and dolour. And therwith drewe his knyfe, purpoſyng to haue ſlayne hym ſelfe. But euer wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (whiche he by the ſtudy of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy had attayned) withdrewe hym frome that deſperate acte. And in this contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, betwene wyſedome and wyll, fatigate with long iournaies and watche, or as god wold haue it, he fell into a dede ſlepe. His knyfe (wherwith he wolde haue ſlayne him ſelfe) fallyng downe by hym. In the meane time a commune and notable rufyan or thefe, whiche hadde robbed and ſlayne a manne, was entred into the barne, where Gyſyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus laye, to the intente to ſoiorne there all that nyghte. And ſeyng Giſippus bewept, and his viſage replenyſſhed with ſorowe, and alſo the naked knyfe by hym, percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well, that he was a man deſperate, and ſuppriſed with heuyneſſe of harte, was we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of his lyfe: whiche the ſayde rufyan

takynge for a good occaſion to eſcape, toke the knyfe of Gyſyppus, and puttynge it in the wounde of hym that was ſlayne, put it all blody in the hande of Gyſyppus, beinge faſte a ſlepe, and ſo departed. Soone after the dedde man beinge founde, the officers made dyligente ſerche for the murderar: at the laſte they entringe into the barne, and fyndinge Giſippus on ſlepe, with the blody knife in his hande, awaked hym, wherwith he entred agayne in to his olde ſorowes, complaynynge his yuel fortune. But whan the officers layde vnto him the death of the man, and the hauynge of the blody knyfe, he thereat reioyſed, thankynge god, that ſuche occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was hapned, wherby he ſhuld ſuffre deathe by the lawes, and eſcape the vyolence of his owne handes. Wherfore he denyed nothynge that was layde to his charge, deſyryng the officers to make haſt that he mought be ſhortely out of his lyfe. Whereat they meruayled. Anone reporte came to the ſenate, that a man was ſlayne, and that a ſtraunger, and a Greeke borne, was founde in ſuche fourme, as is before mencioned. They forthwith commaunded hym to be brought vnto theyr preſence, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge there at that tyme Titus, being than Conſull, or in other lyke dignitie. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Giſippus was brought to the barr<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:513:155"/>
with billes and ſtaues like a felon, of whom it was demaunded, if he ſlewe the man, that was foundended. he nothynge denyed, but in moſt ſorowfull maner curſed his fortune, namynge hym ſelfe of all other moſte miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. At the laſte one demaundynge hym, of what cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey he was, he confeſſed to be an Athenienſe, and therwith he caſt his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull eyen vppon Titus, with moche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and braſte oute into ſyghes and teares abundauntly: that beholdynge Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and eſpienge by a lyttel ſygne in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which he knewe, that it was his dere frende Giſyppus, and anone conſideringe, that he was brought into dyſpayre by ſome my ſaduenture, roſe out of his place, where he ſate, and falling on his knees before the iuges, ſayd, that he had ſlayne the man, for olde malyce that he bare towarde him, and that Gyſippus, being a ſtraunger, was gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and all men mought perceyue, that the other was a deſperate perſon. wherfore to abbreuiate his ſorowes, he confeſſed the acte, wherof he was innocent, to the intent that he wold finiſhe his ſorowes with deth. Wherfore Titus deſyred the iuges, to giue ſentence on hym, accordynge to his mery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. But Gyſippus, perceyuynge his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Titus (contrary to his expectation) to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre hym ſelfe to the deathe, for his ſaulfe
<pb facs="tcp:513:156"/>
garde, more importunately cried to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to procede in theyr iugement on hym, that was the very offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dar. Titus denied it, and affirmed with reaſons and argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that he was the murderer, and not Giſyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus. Thus they of longe tyme, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of teares conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, which of them ſhuld die for the other, wherat all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and people were wonderly abaſſhed, not knowyng what it ment. The murderer in dede, hapned to be in the preaſe at that time, who perceiuing the meruaylous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of theſe two perſones, which were bothe innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; that it proceded of an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> parable frendſhip, was vehemently prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to dyſcouer the trouthe. Wherfore he brake through the preaſe, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſenate, ſpake in this wiſe,</p>
               <p>¶ Noble fathers, I am ſuch a perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom ye knowe haue ben a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune baratour and thefe by a long ſpace of yeres: ye know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that Titus is of a noble bloude, and is a proued to be alway a man of excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and wyſedome, and neuer was malyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This other ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger ſemeth to be a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> full of ſimplicitie, and that more is, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for ſome greuous ſorowe that he hath taken, as it is to you euidente. I ſay to you fathers, they both be innocente, I am that perſon, that ſlewe hym, that is founde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:513:156"/>
by the barne, and robbed him of his money, and whan I founde in the barne this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lyenge on ſlepe, hauinge by hym a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked knyfe: I, the better to hyde myne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, dyd put the knife into the wounde of the ded man, and ſo al blody laide it agayne by this ſtranger. This was my miſcheuous deuiſe to eſcape your iugement. Where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nowe I remit me holy, rather than this noble man Titus, or this innocent ſtranger ſhulde vnworthely die.</p>
               <p>¶ Here at all the Senate and people toke comforte, and the noiſe of reioyſing hartes filled all the courte. And whan it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examined, Giſippus was dyſcouered, the frendſhip betwene hym and Titus was through out the citie publyſſhed, extolled, &amp; magnified. Wherfore the Senate conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this mater, and fynally at the inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Titus and the peple, dyſcharged the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Titus recognyſed his neglygence, in forgettynge Giſippus. And Titus beinge aduertiſed of the exile of Giſippus, and the dipiteful crueltie of his kynrede, was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wonderfull wrath, and hauinge Giſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus home to his hous (where he was with incredible ioye receiued of the lady, whom ſomtyme he ſhulde haue wedded) honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly apparyled him: and there Titus offred to hym, to vſe al his goodes and poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb facs="tcp:513:157"/>
at his owne pleaſure and appetite. But Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus, deſyrynge to be agayne in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre countrey, Titus by the conſente of the Senate and people, aſſembled a gret army, and wente with Gyſyppus vnto Athenes: where he hauing deliuered to him al thoſe, whiche were cauſers of banyſſhynge and dyſpoylynge of his frende Gyſyppus, dyd on them ſharpe execution: and reſtorynge to Gyſyppus his landes and ſubſtance, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſhed hym in perpetuall quietnes, and ſo retourned to Rome.</p>
               <p>¶ This exaumple in the affectes of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp, expreſſeth (if I be not deceyued) the deſcription of frendeſhyppe, engendred by the ſymilitude of age and perſonage, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the conformitie of maners and ſtudies, and confirmed by the longe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of company.</p>
               <p>¶ It wolde be remembred, that frendſhip <note place="margin">None euil maye be in frendſhip.</note> is betwene good men onely, and is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of an opinion of vertue. Than may we reaſon in this fourme, A good man is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, bycauſe all that he wylleth or doth, is only good: in good can be none euyl, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothynge that a good man wylleth or dothe, can be euyl. Lykewyſe vertue is the affection of a good man, which neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nor dothe any thynge that is euyl. And vice is contrary vnto vertue, for in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:513:157"/>
of vertue, is neyther euyll nor vyce. And very amytie is vertue. wherfore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge euyll or vycyous maye happen in frendſhyp. Therfore in the fyrſte election of frendes, reſteth al the importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it wold not be without a longe belibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and profe, and as Ariſtotle ſayth, in <note place="margin">Ethie.</note> as longe tyme as by them bothe, beinge to gether conuerſaunt, a hole buſſhell of ſalte mought be eten. For oftentymes with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (as I late ſayd) is chaunged, or at the leaſt miniſhed the feruentneſſe of that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according as the ſwete Poete Duide affirmeth, ſayinge in this ſentence,</p>

               </q>
               <p>¶ But if any hapneth in euerye fortune to be conſtant in frendſhippe, he is to be made of aboue all thynges that maye come vnto man, and aboue any other that be of bloude or kynrede, as Tulli ſayth. For from kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rede maye be taken Beneuolence, frome frendſhippe it can neuer be ſeuered. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:513:158"/>
Beneuolence taken from kynrede, yet the name of kynſeman remayneth: take it from frendſhyp, and the name of frendſhip is vtterly peryſhed.</p>
               <p>¶ But ſens this liberte of ſpeche is nowe <note place="margin">Howe to diſcernea fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d from a flatterer.</note> vſurped by flaterers, where they perceiue, that aſſentation and praiſes be abhorred: I am therfore not well aſſured, howe a man nowe a dayes ſhal knowe or dyſcerne ſuche admonicion from flatery, but by one onely meanes, that is to ſaye, to remembre, that fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip maye not be but betwene good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Than conſider, if he that doth admonyſſhe the, be hym ſelfe voluptuous, ambicious, co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uetous, arrogant, or diſſolute, refuſe not his admonicion, but by the example of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Antonine, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kefully take it: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende ſuche defaulte, as thou perceyueſte, doth gyue occaſion of obloqui in ſuche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the reporter alſo by thyne exaumple maye be corrected. But for that admonici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, accompt hym not immediatly, to be thy frend, vntyl thou haue of hym a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and ſure experience. For vndoubtedly it is wonderful difficile, to fynde a man very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious or couetous, to be aſſured in frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp.

And if they perceiue any parte of theyr tale miſtruſted, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſette forthe ſodeynely an heuy and ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenaunce, as if they were abiected and brought into extreme deſperation.

Lyke to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of Dionyſe, kynge of Sicile, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che al thoughe they were inclined to al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happynes and myſchiefe, yet after the com

But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Dionyſe, by theyr incitation hadde expelled Plato out of Sicile, they abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theyr habite and ſeueritie, and eſtſones retourned to theyr miſcheuous and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lyuinge.</p>
               <p>¶ The greate Alexaunder bare his hedde ſome parte on the one ſyde, more than the other, whiche diuers of his ſeruantes dyd counterfayte.</p>
               <p>¶ Semblably dyd the ſcholers of Plato, the moſt noble Philoſopher, whiche for as moche as theyr mayſter had a brode breſte, and hygh ſhulders, and for that cauſe was named Plato, whiche ſygnifyeth brode or large, they ſtuffed theyr garmentes, and made on theyr ſhulders greate bolſters, to ſeme to be of like fourme as he was. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhulde conceyue ſome fauour towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des them, for the demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration of loue that they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the oſtentation of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Which kinde of flatery I ſuppoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to coulde right well laugh at.</p>
               <p>¶ But theſe maner of flaterars may be well
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:513:162"/>
founde out and perceyued by a good witte, whiche ſometyme by hym ſelfe dyligentely conſidereth his owne qualities and natural appetite. For the company or communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a perſon familiar, whiche is alwaye pleaſaunte and without ſharpnes, inclinyng to inordinate fauour and affection, is alway to be ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo there is in that frende ſmall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, whiche foloweth a man lyke his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, meuynge only whan he meueth, and abiding where he liſt to tary. Theſe be the mortall enemyes of noble wyttes, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally in youthe, whanne communely they be more inclined to glory than grauite. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Liberalitie, which is on ſuche fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers imployed, is not onely periſhed, but alſo ſpilled &amp; deuoured. Wherfore in myne opinion, it were a right neceſſary lawe, that ſhulde be made to put ſuche perſons open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tortures, to the fearefull exaumple of other, ſens in all pryncys lawes (as Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche ſayth) not onely he that hath ſlayne the kinges ſonne and heyre, but alſo he that counterfayteth his ſeale, or adulteratethe his coyne, with more baſe mettall, ſhall be iudged to dye as a traytour. In reaſon how <note place="margin">Flateri ꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicions to gentyl na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> moche more peine (if there were any gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peyne thanne deathe) were he worthy to ſuffre, that with falſe adulation, dothe
<pb facs="tcp:513:163"/>
corrupte and adulterate the gentil and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous nature of a noble man, whiche is not only his image, but the very man hym ſelfe? For without vertue man is but in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of beaſtes. And alſo by peruerſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and flatery, ſuche one ſleeth both the ſoule and good renome of his maiſter. By whoſe example and negligence peryſſheth alſo an infinite numbre of perſones, whiche domage to a realme neyther with treaſure ne with power can be redoubed.</p>
               <p>¶ But harde it is, alway to exchewe theſe flaterers, whiche lyke to crowes, do pyke out mennes eyes er they be ded. And it is to noble men moſte difficile, whom all men couayte to pleaſe, and to dyſpleaſe them it is accounted no wyſedome, perchance leſt there ſhulde enſue therby more peryl than profytte.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo Carneades, the Philoſopher, was <note place="margin">Plutarchꝰ de libe. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducandi. A notable exaumple.</note> wonte to ſaye, that the ſonnes of noble men men lerned nothynge well but only to ride. For whiles they lerned letters, theyr may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters flattered them, prayſyng euery word that they ſpake. In wraſtlynge theyr tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and companions alſo flattered them, ſubmyttyng them ſelfes, and falling downe to theyr fete: But the horſe or courſer, not vnderſtandynge who rydeth hym, ne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a gentyll man or yoman, a ryche

man or a poore, if he ſyt not ſurely, and can ſkyl of ridynge, the horſe caſteth him quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely. This is the ſayinge of Carneades.</p>
               <p>¶ There be other of this ſort, which more <note place="margin">Subtyll flatterers. Ex Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarcho de cogn. ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co ab adu latore.</note> couertly laye theyr ſnares to take the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of princis and noble menne. And as he, whiche entendeth to take the fierſe &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty lyon, pytcheth his haye or nette in the woode amonge greatte trees and thornes, where as is the mooſte haunte of the lyon, that beinge blynded with the thyckenes of the couerte, maye er he be ware, ſodeyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tumble into the nette: where the hunter ſeelynge bothe his eyen, and byndinge his legges ſtrongly to gether, fynally daunteth his fierceneſſe, and maketh hym obediente to his enſygnes and tokens. Semblablye there be ſome, that by dyſſimulation can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtente or ſhewe a hyghe grauitie, mixt with a ſturdy enterteinment and facion, exilinge them ſelfes from all pleaſure and recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, frownyng and gruching at euery thing, wherin is any myrth or ſolace, all though it be honeſt, tauntynge and rebukyug immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately them, with whome they be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>IT is not to be doubted, but that the firſt and principal part of Iuſtice diſtributiue is, &amp; euer was, to do to god that honour,
<pb facs="tcp:513:166"/>
whiche is due to his diuine maieſtie. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour (as I before ſaide in the firſt boke, where I wrate of the motion called honor in daunſynge) conſiſteth in loue, feare, and reuerence. For ſens all men graunte, that iuſtyce is to gyue to euerye man his owne, moche more to rendre one good dede for a nother, moſte of all to loue god, of whom we haue all thynge, and withoute hym we were nothynge, and beinge peryſſhed, we were eftſones recouered.

And as it is ſayde of Ariſtotell, rulers more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly do ſynne, by example than by theyr acte.

Conſider alſo, that auctoritie being wel and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vſed, is but a token of ſuperioritie, but in ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry dede it is a burden and loſſe of libertie.</p>
               <p>¶ And what gouernour in this wyſe kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth him ſelfe, he ſhal alſo by the ſame rule knowe all other men, and ſhall nedes loue them, for whom he taketh labours, and for ſaketh libertie.</p>
               <p>¶ In ſemblable maner, the inferior perſon <note place="margin">Knowlege of ſubiectꝭ</note> or ſubiecte aught to conſider, that all be it (as I haue ſpoken) he in the ſubſtaunce of ſowle and body, is equall with his ſupery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. yet for as moche as the powers &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the ſoule and body, with the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of reaſon, be not in euery man equall, therfore god ordeyned a diuerſitie or prec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in degrees to be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, for the neceſſary derection and preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in conformitie of lyuynge.

Wherfore Tulli, being of the opynyon of Antipater the Phyloſopher, ſaythe, To concele any thynge, whiche thou knoweſt, to the entente that for thine owne profitte thou woldeſt a nother, who ſhall take any damage or benefyte thereby, ſhulde not knowe it, is not the act of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon playne or ſymple, or of a man honeſte, iuſte, or good: but rather of a perſon craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

Only I wyl ſhewe, howe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, lackynge true religion, had ſolempne othes in great honour, and howe terrible a thynge it was amonge them, to breke theyr othes or vowes.

               <p>¶ Among the Egiptians, they which were <note place="margin">Periurye puniſhed.</note> periured, had their heddes ſtryken of, as well for that they violated the honour due vnto god, as alſo that therby faith and truſt amonge people mought be decayed.</p>

And ſo in myne opinion ought all other to be, which beleue, that god kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth all thynge that is done here in erthe: and as he hym ſelfe is al goodnes, ſo loueth he all thynge that is good, whiche is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and hateth the contrary, which is vice.

For as Tulli ſaythe, Fayth is a conſtaunce and truthe of thynges ſpoken or couenaunted. And in a nother place he ſaythe, Nothyng kepeth ſoo to gether a publyke weale, as doth fayth.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that the prayſe is proprely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto the vertue, that is to ſaye, to enterpriſe thynges dredfull, eyther for the publike weale, or for winnyng of perpetual honour, orels for eſchewynge reproche or diſhonour. Whervnto be annexed theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, what importaunce the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe is, and wherfore it is done, with the tyme and oportunitie whan it oughte to be done. For (as Tulli ſayth) to entre in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, and to fyght vnauyſedly, is a thynge wylde, &amp; a maner of beaſtes: but thou ſhalt fyght valyantly, whan tyme requireth and alſo neceſſitie. And alway deathe is to be preferred before Seruitude, or any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie. And therfore the actes of Annibal, ageynſt the Saguntynes, which neuer did him diſpleaſure, is nat accounted for anye proweſſe. Neither Cataline, which for his ſingular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modite, &amp; a fewe other, making deteſtable warres agaynſte his owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:513:191"/>
good men, is nat numbred amonge valyant men, all though he faught manly and with great courage, vntyll he was ſlayne.</p>
               <p>¶ What auayled the boldneſſe of Uarro &amp; Flamimus, noble capitayns of Romayns, whiche deſpiſynge the proweſſe and crafte of Anniball, &amp; contemning the ſobre cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Fabius, hauyng only truſt in their owne hardyneſſe, loſte two noble armyes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the power of the Romayns was nyghe vtterly peryſhed. Wherfore eftſones I ſay, <note place="margin">who maye be called a valyaunt man.</note> that a valyaunt man is he, that dothe tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or ſuffre that, which is nedefull, and in ſuche wyſe as is nedefull, and for that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is nedefull, and alſo whan it is nedeful. And he that lacketh any of this, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led hardy, but nat valyant.</p>
               <p>¶ More ouer, all though they, whyche be hardy, or perſons deſperate, haue a ſimily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſeme to be valiant, yet be they nat valiant, no more than kinges in may games and enterludes be kinges. For they that be hardy, er they come to the perylle, ſeme to be fierce and egre, and in begynnyng their enterpriſe wonderful haſty, but whan they feele the thing more hard and greuous tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they eſtemed, theyr courage decaieth more and more, and as men abaſhed and vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, their hartes vtterly do fayle, and in concluſyon they appere more faynte, than
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:513:191"/>
they that be cowardes.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo in Deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can nat be fortitude: for that beinge a morall vertue, is euer vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary. Deſperation is a thyng as it were conſtrayned, ne hath any maner conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratyon, where fortitude expendeth euery thynge and acte diligently, and dothe alſo moderate it with reaſon.</p>
               <p>¶ Here now appereth (as I ſuppoſe) th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <note place="margin">Q. curſtus</note> ſaythe, It appertaineth to men, that be valyaunt, rather to diſpiſe deathe, thanne to hate lyfe.</p>
               <p>¶ A Man is called in latine <hi>VIR,</hi> whereof ſaythe Tulli, <hi>VERTVE</hi> is named. And the moſte propre vertue longynge to a man, is <hi>FORTITVDE,</hi> wherof be two excellente propreties, that is to ſay, the contempte of

But what very forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is, he more playnely declareth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, in a more larger circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcription, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thinges humain ought to be litell eſte med, deth nat regarded, labours &amp; griefes to be thought tollerable. Whan this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by iugement and a conſtant opinyon, than that is valyant and ſtable fortitude. But there vnto I wolde ſhulde be added, whyche opynyon and iugement procedeth of a reaſon, and nat repugnant to Iuſtice. And than it ſhall accorde with this ſayinge of Ariſtotle, A valyant man ſuſteineth, and <note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> dothe that, whiche belongeth to fortitude, for cauſe of honeſtie. And a lyttell before he ſaith, A man that is valyant, as well ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth, as dothe that, whiche agreeth with his worſhyp, and as reaſon commaundeth. So no violence or ſturdy mynde, lackynge reaſon and honeſtie, is any parte of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Unto this noble vertue be attendant, or as it were continuall adherentes, diuers vertues, whiche do enſewe, and be of right great eſtimation.</p>

for lacke of vitayle, or elles in fleinge, to be ſlayne by the Romaynes, yf the crafty and polytyke wytte of Anniball hadde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered them.

And Fabius dredynge the deceytefull wyt of Annibal, kept the army within the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, and ſo Anniball with his hoſt eſcaped with out domage. But Fabius, beinge payneful in purſuinge Anniball from place to place, awaytynge to haue hym at aduauntage, at the laſte dyd ſo fatigate hym and his hoſte,

that therby in concluſion his power myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and alſo the ſtrength of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes, of whom he was generall capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. In ſo moche as they were at the laſt conſtrayned to countermande hym by ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry meſſangers, wyllynge him to abandon the warres in Italy, and to retourne to the defence of his owne citie.

               <p>¶ Whiche was wel proued by Zeno Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, a noble philoſopher, who being a man of excellent wiſdome and eloquence, came to a citie, called Agrigentum, where reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phalaris, the mooſte cruell tyrant of al the worlde, who kept and vſed his owne people in moſte myſerable ſeruytude.

               <p>¶ Plato in his Epiſtoll to Dion kynge of Scicile ſayth, It is good ryght, that they, whiche be good men, and doo the ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, obteyne honour, whiche they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to haue.</p>

Alſo to them, whiche be good, and all redy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced, they gyue ſuche courage, that they endeuour them ſelfes with al theyr power, to encreaſe that opinion of goodnes, wher by they were broughte to that aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which nedes muſte be to the honour and benefyte of thoſe, by whom they were ſópromoted. Contrarye wyſe, where meu frome theyr infancye haue enſued vertue, worne the floryſſhynge tyme of youthe in paynefull ſtudy, abandonynge al luſtes and

               <p>¶ Cato, called Uticenſis, at whoſe wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome all the world wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, and whoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uitie, as wel the ſenate and peple of Rome, as other kynges and pryncis, reuerenſed, lokynge to be one of the Conſules, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly reiected, wherwith his frendes and kynſemen toke no lyttell diſcomforte.

He ſayth alſo afterwarde, Noble courage is an ornamente of vertues, for it maketh them the more ample, and without them ſhe her ſelfe may not be.</p>
               <p>¶ But I wyll for a lyttell tyme leaue this noble Philoſopher Aryſtotelle, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentely interprete a place in the offices of Tulli, where he mooſte eloquentely and playnely ſetteth out this vertue ſayinge, Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>waye a valyaunte and noble courage is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by two thynges ſpecyally, wherof one is in dyſpyſynge thynges outewarde, whan a man is perſwaded, neyther to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle at any thynge, neyther to wyſſhe or deſyre any thynge, but that whiche is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſte. More ouer, that a manne ſhulde not bowe for any fortune or trouble of mynde. A nother thynge is, whan thou art of that mynde or courage, as I before ſayde, that thou thanne practyſe thoſe thynges, not onely whiche be greate, and moſte profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but alſo that be very dyfficile and full of labour and perylle, as well concernynge mannes lyfe, as many other thynges ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perteynynge.</p>
               <p>¶ And afterwarde the ſame Tulli ſaythe, To eſteme lyttel thoſe thynges, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the more parte of men ſemeth excellent, and alſo with reaſon firme and ſtable to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶ By this it ſemeth, that <hi>MAGNANIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE,</hi> or good courage, is as it were the garmente of Uertue, wher with ſhe is ſette oute (as I moughte ſaye) to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooſte.

And on a tyme beinge deſired of Herculius and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, vnto whom he had reſigned the em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pire, to take efteſo ones on him the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, abhorringe it as a peſtilence, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this wyſe, I wolde ye dydde ſee the herbes, that I haue with myn owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des ſowen and ſet at Salona, ſurely ye wold nat than in this wyſe aduiſe me.</p>

And if at that tyme the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate had ben as wel furniſhed with noble &amp; wife ꝑſonages, as it was before the Ciuile
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:513:204"/>
warres, betwene Ceſar and Pompeie, it is to be thought, that he wolde ſurely haue reſtored the publike weale to his priſtinate glorie. But nowe lette vs ſee, what is the cauſe, that Ambytion is ſo pernicious to a publyke weale.</p>
               <p>¶ In myn opinion it is for two cauſes prin <note place="margin">Ambition why it is il</note> cipally. Fyrſte for as moche as they, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be of that courage and appetite, whan they be in auctoritie, ſuppoſe al thing to be lefull that lyketh them. And alſo by reaſon of their preeminence, wolde ſoo be ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from other, that no man ſhuld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolle them, or warne them of their enormyties, and finally wolde do what they lyſte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction. Wherof do enſewe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers iniuries and ſubuertion of iuſtyce.</p>
               <p>And this, whiche I haue nowe ſayd, Tulli affirmeth to be true, ſayinge, Uerily it is a great difficultie, where thou woldeſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all men, to obſerue equitie. Whiche is the thing moſt appropried to iuſtyce. And ſhortely after he ſayth, The more hygher of corage that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, &amp; deſirous of glory, the ſoner is he meued to do thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges ageinſt ryght. Seing it was ſo, in the time of Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, whan almoſte euery man, that was in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie, had de excellent lernyng (the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines bryngyng vp their children in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of morall philoſophye (what ſhall we
<pb facs="tcp:513:205"/>
ſuppoſe in our tyme, whan fewe men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie do care for lernyng? Why ſhuld we thynke to be more iuſtyce nowe vſed in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie, than was in the tyme of Tulli? Is there nat nowe priuate affection, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fauour, diſpleaſure and hatrede, as was at that tyme? I wolde the reders hereof, ſhuld be iuges, examinyng theſe my wordis with daily experience.</p>
               <p>¶ The ſecond cauſe, that conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicion, <note place="margin">Conetyſe.</note> is couetyſe of treaſure, therwith to mainteyn their oſtentation and vaynglory, whiche ambicious perſons, doo call theyr honour, wherby they be procured to fynde vniuſte meanes by their auctoritie, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyde for ſuche ſubſtaunce, wherwith they may be nat onely ſatisfied (they beinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaciable) but accordynge to their owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite fully ſuffyſed. Wherfore the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, called <hi>Stoici,</hi> vſed this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, gret indigence or lacke cometh nat of pouertie, but of great plentie, for he that hath moch, ſhall nede moche.</p>
               <p>¶ But certes ſuche ambycious perſones, may well conſider, that the magnificence &amp; pompe, whiche they couete, is nat ſo moch wondred at, as auarice &amp; collection of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is vniuerſally hated. Wherfore Darius, <note place="margin">Plutarchꝰ in apoth.</note> kyng of Perſia, and father to Xerxes, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded a ſubſidie to be leuyed of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:513:205"/>
his ſubiectes, demanded the chiefe men of the countreyes, whether they founde them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe greued. They anſwerynge, that they were in a merely good caſe, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the one halfe to be efteſones reſtored, leſte he of any auarice ſhulde be ſuſpected. By the whiche acte he ſtabyſſhed his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and made it more perfecte.</p>
               <p>¶ More ouer, Tulli ſaythe, To take any <note place="margin">Ci. off. iii.</note> thynge from an other man, and one man to encreaſe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie with an other mans detryment, is more repugnaunt to nature, than deathe, than pouertie, payne, or other thynge that mought happen, eyther to the body or other goodes worldly.</p>

The propretyes of theſe two vertues, be in this maner.</p>
               <p>¶ Abſtinence is, wherby a man refraineth from any thyng, which he may lefully take, for a better purpoſe. <hi>CONTINENCE,</hi> is a vertue whiche kepeth the pleaſaunte ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of man vnder the yoke of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>¶ Whiche wordes were ſpoken with ſuche a grauitie, that the ſayde ſeruaunte, beinge a ferde, deſyred Epamynondas, that he mought be ſaulfly conuayed out of the cite: whiche he graunted with good wyll, leaſte if the money were taken away, he mought of the receyuynge therof, haue ben ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.

               <p>¶ Semblable abſtinence was there in Pho <note place="margin">Phocion.</note> cion, a noble counſaylour of Athenes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome the ambaſſadoure of the greatte kynge Alexaunder, broughte from theyr mayſter a hundred Talentes of gold, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were of englyſhe money .xii. thouſand pounde.

If he wolde be vnlyke vnto hym, and of dyſſo lute maners, neyther Antipaters gyſtes, nor none others, were they neuer ſo great, ſhulde be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>¶ By theſe examples it doth appere, how good men dyd alwaye flee from rewardes, all though they mought haue ben lefully ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken, whiche in them was neyther folyſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nor yet ruſticitie, but of a prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideracion. For as moche as bothe by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and experyence they knewe, that he which taketh a rewarde before any thinge done, is no lenger at lybertye, but of a free man is made bonde, bycauſe he hath taken erneſte for his true endeuour. Alſo by the

takynge, he is become an yuel man, though before he were good, For if he receyue it for an yuel purpoſe, he is than a wretche &amp; deteſtable: If the matter were good, than is he not ryghtwyſe in ſelling a good dede, which he ought to do thankfully, and with out rewarde.</p>
               <p>¶ And I doubte not who ſoo euer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this preſente aſtate, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth felycitie to be in a meane, and al exceſſe to be peryllous, wyll alowe theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thynke them worthy to be had in remembraunce, ſpecyally of theym that be gouernours.

Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably, that man, whiche in chyldehode is brought vp in ſondry vertues, if eyther by nature, or els by cuſtom, he be nat induced, to be alwaye conſtant and ſtable, ſo that he

               <p>¶ And in one thyng me ſemeth that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <note place="margin">Conſtance equall to Iuſtyce.</note> hath equail prayſe with iuſtyce: that is to ſaye, that he that is hym ſelfe iniuſte, loueth that perſon, that dealeth iuſtly with hym, and contrary wiſe, hateth that perſon that dealeth iniuſtly, or doth hym wronge. In lykewyſe he, whiche is inconſtant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleth hym, whom he fyndeth conſtaunt, and deſyrethe to haue hym his frende: on the other parte, heis angrye with hym, whom he prouethe inconſtaunt and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge,
<pb facs="tcp:513:212"/>
and accounteth hym a beaſte, and vnworthy company of men: and awayteth diligently to truſte hym with nothyng.</p>
               <p>¶ We note in chylderne inconſtancie, and lykewyſe in women, the one for ſklender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of wyt, the other as a naturall ſicknes. Therfore men vſe in rebuking a man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtance, to calle hym a chyldyſhe or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly perſone. All be it ſome women now adayes be founden more conſtant than me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſpecially in loue toward their huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, or els mought there happen to be ſom wronge inheritours.</p>
               <p>¶ Conſtance is as propre vnto a man as is reaſon: And is of ſuch eſtymation, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng as it was ſpoken of a wiſe man, It were better to haue a conſtant ennemy, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an inconſtant frende.

darſte geyneſaye, Sceuola onely excepte, who beinge therof demanded wolde gyue no ſentence. But whan Sylla dyd caſt ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore on him a cruell countenance, he with a conſtant vyſage, and noble courage, ſaid to hym, Sylla, although thou faceſt and thret neſt me with thy multytude of ſouldiours, with whome thou haſte thus beſieged this courte, ye and although thou doeſt menace me with dethe neuer ſoo moche, yet ſhalte thou neuer bring to paſſe, that for ſhedinge a lytell olde blode, I ſhall iudge Marius a traytour, by whom this citie and all Italye haue ben preſerued.</p>
               <p>¶ The conſtance, that great kyng Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had, in truſtyng his frende againſt fals <note place="margin">Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders confidence</note> reporte, ſaued his lyfe: wher of all men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired. for after that noble battaile, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had vanquyſhed Darius, &amp; taken his treaſure, as he paſſed through Cilicia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge fore chaufed with feruente heate, and the length of his iourney, he came by the ryuer, called Cydnus, &amp; beholding it clere and pleaſaunt, and thynkynge to aſſwage therin the heates that he ſuffered, wente thereinto naked, and dranke therof: But immediatly, by the excedyng colde, which was in that water, his finewes ſhranke, and his ioyntes became vnweldy, and as they were deed, &amp; all his hoſte being diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted

he was conueyed to a cytie thereby, called Tarſum. Wherevpon the phiſitions aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyd to deuyſe the beſte remedy. All were determyned, to gyue hym one medycyne, and that it ſhuld be myniſtred by one Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyppe, chiefe phyſicyon with Alexander. In the meane tyme Parmemo, one of the greatteſt capytaynes about Alexander, ad uertyſed hym by his letters, that he ſhuld beware of the treaſon of the ſayde Philip ſayenge, he was corrupted with a greatte ſomme of moneye by Darius. Wherwith he beynge nothynge eſbaied, helde in his handes the letter, and receyuyng the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycyne, that Philippe gaue hym, at oone tyme delyuered the letter open to Philyp, and dranke alſo the medycine, declarynge therby the conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that was in his frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe. Whyche truſt, nat onely cauſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the better to wark with the medicine, but alſo bounde ſoo the harte of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towarde hym, that he euer after ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed more diligently for the helpe and pre ſeruation of the noble prince, that dydde ſo moche truſte hym.</p>
               <p>¶ The Conſtance of Cato Uticenſis was <note place="margin">Cato.</note> alway immoueable, in ſo moche that at ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry tymes, whan he in the Senate egrely defended the publike weale, with veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; longe orations, agaynſte the attemptates
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:513:213"/>
of ambicious perſons, he was by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, and commytted to pryſon, But he therfore not ceſſynge, but goynge towarde priſon, detected to the people as he went, the vnlefull purpoſes and enterpryſes of them, by whom he was punyſhed, with the peryll that was imminente to the publyke weale, whiche he dyd with ſuche courage and eloquence, that as well the Senate as the people drewe ſo aboute hym, that his aduerſaryes were fayne for feare to dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge hym.</p>
               <p>¶ Who can ſufficiently commende this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man Cato, whan he redeth in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Plutarche of his excellent courage and vertue? Howe moche worthyer had he ben, to haue had Homere the trumpe of his fame immortal, than Achilles? who for a lytell wenche contended with Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non onely: where Cato for the conſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the weale publyke contended, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reſyſted agaynſte Iulius Caeſar and the great Pompey, and not only agaynſt their menaces, but alſo agaynſte theyr deſyres, and offres of alyaunce.

               <p>¶ Undoughtedly conſtaunce is an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

vertue, as inconſtance is reprocheful and odious. Wherfore that man, whiche is mutable for euery occaſyon, muſt nedes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repent hym, and in moch repentaunce is not onely moche foly, but alſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymente: whiche euery wyſe man wyll eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue, if he can.

               <p>¶ He that practiſeth this vertue, is called <note place="margin">Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> a temperate man, and he that doth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therto, is named intemperate: betwene whom and a perſon incontinent, Ariſtotell maketh this diuerſytie, that he is intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, whiche by his owne election is ladde, ſuppoſynge the pleaſure that is preſente or (as I moughte ſaye) invre, ſhulde alwaye be folowed.

But the ſlaue, who as it ſemid was lerned, while he was in beatyng cried out on Plutarche, and in maner of reproche ſaide vnto hym, Howe agreeth this with thy doctrine, that preacheſt ſo moche of pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and in al thy leſſons reproueſt wrath: and nowe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thyne owne teachynge, thou arte all inflamed with wrathe, and clene fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, which thou ſo moch prayſeſt?

loke that thou ſtyl beate hym.</p>

               <p>¶ Pythagoras was neuer ſene to eate any fyſhe or fleſhe, but onely herbes &amp; fruites. Semblably dyd many other, who exactely
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:513:220"/>
folowed his doctrine. Wherfore it was ſup poſed, that they the rather excelled all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in fyndyng out the ſecretes and hidde knowleges of nature, which to other were impenctrable.</p>

               <p>¶ I am aſhamed to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, that he wold ſend to his frendes: two morſels of meate, a pece of podynge, or the carkaiſſe of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. This was but myſerye and wretched nygardſhyp in a man of ſuche honour.</p>

Alſo he wold haue diſhes of meate made of Camelles heeles, the combes of cockes, newely cutte, the tungues of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cockes and nyghtyngales, partriches eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other thynges harde for to come by: wherto be no englyſſhe names founden (as I ſuppoſe) apt to the true ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>¶ More ouer, all though I dyſprayſed ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardſhyp and vicious ſcarcitie, yet in theſe no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of dyſhes, whiche I haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I deſyre not, to haue therin meates for any occaſion to moche ſumptuous. For in one or two dyſhes may be emploied as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che money as in twenty, percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as good or better in eatynge. Wherof there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a noble exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Cleopatra, doughter to Ptholomee, late kyng of Aegipt, whom Ceſar in his lyfe helde for his Concubyne. The ſame lady Antony (with whome Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauian deuided the empire) loued alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramours, abandonynge his wyfe, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:513:222"/>
was ſuſter to Octauian. And the warres betwene hym and Octauian ceſſynge by a littell ſpace, he (durynge that tyme) lyued in moſte prodigall riotte, and thynkyng all thynge in the ſee, the lande, and the ayre to be made for ſatiſfienge his glotony, deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red al fleſhe and fiſhe that moughte be any where founden. Cleopatra, diſdayninge to be vainquiſhed in any exceſſe by a Romayne, layde a wager with Antony, that ſhe her ſelfe wold receiue in to her body at one ſup per, the value of fyfty thouſande poundes, whiche to Antony was thought in a maner to be impoſſible. The wager was put in to the handes of Numatius Plancus, a noble Romayne. The next day Cleopatra prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Antony a ryght ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous ſuper, but therat Antony nothing meruailed, knowig the value thereof by his accuſtomed fare, than the quene ſmylynge, called for a gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, where into ſhe dyd powre a quantitie of very tarte vineger, and taking a perle, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hinge at one of her eares, quickely did let it falle into the vinegre, wherin beynge ſhortely dyſſolued (as is the nature of the perle) ſhe immedyately dranke it.

And in myne opynion, one thynge is ſpecially to be noted.</p>
               <p>¶ Kynge Dauid, father to Salomon, was a man of a rare and meruaylous ſtrengthe, in ſo moche, as he hym ſelfe reporteth in the boke of kynges, beynge a chylde, and cari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>enge to his bretherne theyr dyner, where they kepte theyr cattell, ſlewe fyrſt a great beare, and after a lyon, whiche fyerce and hungry aſſaulted hym, all thoughe he were vnarmed: and whether he had any weapon or no, it is vncertayne, ſens he maketh ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of no mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alſo of what prowes he was in armes, and howe valiaunt and good a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayne in battayle, it maye ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere to them that wyll rede his noble actes and achieuaunces in the bokes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. wherin no good catholyke man wyll any thynge doubte, thoughe they be maruaylous. Yet not withſtandynge al his ſtrengthe and puyſſaunce was not of ſuche effecte, that in the longe tyme of his raign,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:513:224"/>
whiche was by the ſpace of .xl. yeres, he coulde haue any tyme vacant from warres. But all waye had eyther continuall batayle with the Philiſties, or elles was moleſted with his owne chyldren, and ſuch as ought to haue bene his frendes. Contrary wyſe, his ſonne Salomon, of whome there is no notable mention made, that he ſhewed any commendable feate, concernynge martiall proweſſe, ſauinge the furniture of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons with innumerable men of warre, hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, and chariotes, which proueth not him to be valiaunte and ſtronge, but onely pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente: after a lyttell bykerynge with the Philiſties, in the beginning of his raygne, continued in peace without any notable ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, or moleſtation of any perſone: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is named in ſcrypture, <hi>REX PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIFICVS,</hi> which is in englyſhe, The pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble kynge. And onely by ſapience ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned his realme, that though it were but a lyttell realme in quantitie, yet it excelled incomparably all other in honour and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In ſoo moche as ſyluer was at that tyme in the citie of Ieruſalem, as ſtones in the ſtrete.

with vertue, there vertue hath ſemed excel lent, and as I mought ſaye triumphant.</p>
               <p>¶ Scipio, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon of the moſte noble houſe of the Romaynes, in hyghe lernynge and knowlege of the nature of thinges wonder full ſtudyous, hauynge all waye with hym the mooſte excellente Philoſophers and poetes that were in his time, was an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and myrrour of martiall proweſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynence, deuotion, liberalitie, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues.</p>
               <p>¶ Cato, called vticenſis, named the chiefe pilar of the publike weale of the Romains, was ſo moche inflamed in the deſire of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, that (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth) he coude not te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pre him ſelfe in redinge greke bokes whiles the Senate was ſyttynge.</p>
               <p>¶ Howe moch it profited to the noble Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, whiche vntyll the deathe of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Iulius Ceſar, dylygentely applyed his ſtudy in Athenes, it wel appered after that the Ciuile warres were all finiſſhed: whan he refourmynge the hole aſtate of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke weale, ſtablyſhed the Senate, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng vnto hym ten honorable perſonages, dayely in his owne perſone conſulted with them of matters, to be reported twyſe in a monethe to the Senate, in ſuche wyſe ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge and helpynge forthe that moſte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble court with his incomparable ſtudy and

dylygence.</p>
               <p>¶ The emperour Titus, ſonne to Uaſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, for his lernynge and vertue was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the delycate of the worlde.</p>
               <p>¶ Marcus Antoninus, the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour, was in euery kynde of lerning ſo excellent, that he was therefore openly named the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, not in reproche (as men do nowe a days in deſpite cal them philoſophers and poetes, whom they perceyue ſtudyous in ſondry good diſciplines) but to the augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his honour. For being of his owne nature aptly inclined to embrace vertue, he addynge to abundance of lerning, became therby a wonderfull and perfecte prynce, beynge neither of ſtudy withdrawen from affayres of the publyke weale, nor by any buſynes vtterly plucked from philoſophy, and other noble doctrines. By the whiche mutuall coniunction and iuſte temperaunce of thoſe two ſtudyes, he attayned to ſuche a fourme in all his gouernaunce, that he was named and taken for father of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, of the people, and vnynerſally of all the hole empyre.</p>
               <p>¶ Moreouer, his dedes and wordes were of all men had in ſo hyghe eſtimation and reuerence, that bothe the Senate and peo ple toke of him lawes and rules of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge. And in his gouernance and propre

lyuinge, as well at home in his houſe, as in his ciuile buſines, he was to hym ſelfe the onely lawe and example.

The knowlege of this Experience is called Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, &amp; is expreſſed by hyſtory, whiche of Tulli is called the lyfe of memory. And ſoo <note place="margin">Hyſtoryes wherfore they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mendable.</note> it agreeth wel with the verſis of Affranius, by melate declared. And therfore to ſuche perſones, as do contempne auncient hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, reputynge them among leaſynges and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:513:233"/>
fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſies (theſe be their wordes of reproch) it maye be ſayde, that they fruſtrate Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: whiche (as the ſayde Tulli ſaythe) is the lyght of vertue, whiche they wolde be ſene ſo moche to fauour, all though they do ſeldome embrace it. And that ſhall they perceyue many feſtely, if they wyll a lyttell whyle laye a parte theyr accuſtomed obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, and ſuffre to be diſtilled into their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res two or thre dropes of the ſwete oyle of remembraunce.</p>
               <p>¶ Let them reuolue in theyr myndes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that there is no doctryne, be it ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuyne or humayne, that is not eyther all expreſſed in hiſtory, or at the leſte mixte with hyſtorie. But to thentente that there ſhall be lefte none ignoraunce, wherby they mought be detained in theyr errour, I wyl nowe declare vnto them what it is, that is called an hyſtorye, and what it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth.</p>
               <p>¶ Fyrſte it is to be noted, that it is a greke name, and commeth of a worde or verbe in <note place="margin">Myſt or ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what it ſi gnifieth.</note> Greeke <hi>Hiſtoreo,</hi> whiche dothe ſignifie, to knowe, to ſe, to enſerche, to enquere, to here, to lerne, to tell, or expounde vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and decayes, and occaſyon therof. More ouer preceptes, exhortations, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayles, and good perſwaſyons, comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in quicke ſentences and eloquente ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Fynally ſoo large is the compaſe of that, whiche is named hiſtorie, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all thynge that is neceſſarye to be put in memory. In ſoo moche, as Ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelle, where he declareth the partes of mannes body, with theyr deſcryption and offices, and alſo the ſondry formes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſytions of all beaſtes, foules, and fiſhes, with theyr generation, nameth his boke an hiſtorye. Semblably Theophraſt his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, a noble philoſopher, deſcryuynge all herbes and trees, whereof he mought haue the trewe knowledge, intytleth his boke, The hyſtorye of plantes. And finally Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni the elder, calleth his mooſt excellent and wonderfull warke, the hiſtorye of nature: in the whiche boke he nothynge omytteth, that in the boſome of Nature is conteyned,

and maye be by mannes wytte comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and is worthye to be hadde in remen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce. Whiche auctorities of theſe three noble and excellent lerned men, approueth the ſygnification of HISTORIE, to agree wel with the expoſition of the verbe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo, wherof it commeth.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe let vs ſe what booke of holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I meane the olde teſtament and the newe, maye be ſayde, to haue no part of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie. The fiue bokes of Moiſes, the boke of Iuges, the foure bokes of kinges, Iob, Heſter, Iudeth, Ruth, Thobias, And alſo the hiſtorie of Machaebes (whiche frome the other is ſeperate) I ſuppoſe no manne wyll denye, but that they be all hiſtoricall: or (as I mought ſay) intier hiſtories. Alſo Eſdras, Nemias, Ezechiell, and Daniel, all though they were prophetes: yet be their warkes compacte in fourme of narrations, whiche by oratours be called enunciatyue, and onely perteyneth to hyſtories, wherin is expreſſed a thynge done, and perſonnes named. All the other prophetes, thoughe they ſpeake of the tyme future or to come, whiche is out of the deſcription of an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie, yet eyther in rebukinge the ſynnes and enormities paſſed, or bewayling the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their countrey, or captiuitie of the people, and ſuch like calamitie or miſerable
<pb facs="tcp:513:235"/>
aſtate, alſo in meuynge or perſwadynge the people, they do recite ſome circumſtaunce of a narration.</p>
               <p>¶ But now be we commen to the newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and principally the bokes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes, vulgarely called the goſpelles, whiche be one contexte of an hiſtorie: doo not they conteyne the temporall lyfe of our ſauiour Chryſte, kyng of kynges, and lorde of the worlde, vntyll his glorious aſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And what thynge lacketh therin, that dothe perteine to a perfect hiſtorie? There lacketh not in thynges, ordre and dyſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the contexte or narration, verytye, in the ſentences grauytye, vtylytie in the counſaylles, in the perſwaſyons doctryne, in expoſytions or declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s facylitie. The bokes of actes of apoſtelles, what thynge is it elles but a playne hyſtorie? The epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of ſayncte Paule, ſaincte Peter, ſainct Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſayncte Iames, and Iudas, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, do conteyne counſayles and aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſementes in the fourme of orations, recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge diuers places, as wel out of the olde teſtament, as out of the goſpels, as it were an abbreuiate, called of the grekes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines Epitoma. This is well knowen to be true, of them that haue had any leaſure to rede holy ſcripture: who remembring them ſelfes by this my lytel induction, wyl leaue
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:513:235"/>
to neglecte hiſtorye, or contemne it with ſo generalle a dyſprayſe as they haue benne ac cuſtomed.</p>
               <p>¶ But yet ſome wyll impugne them with a more particuler obiection, ſayinge, The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the Grekes and Romayns be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge but lyes, and faynynge of poetes: ſome ſuche perſons there be, betwene who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and good auctours haue euer ben perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hoſtilitie. Fyrſte howe doo they knowe, that all the hyſtoryes of Greekes and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes be leaſynges, ſens they fynde not, that any ſcripture autentyke, made aboute that tyme that thoſe hiſtories were writen, do reproue or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne them? But the moſt catholike and renoumed doctours of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the corroboratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes and ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, do allege the ſame hiſtories, and vouche (as I mought ſay) to theyr aide the autoritie of the writars. And yet ſom of thoſe Rabines (in goddis name) whiche in compariſon of the ſayd noble do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, be as who ſaythe petites, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth lettred: wyl preſume, with theyr owne ſely wittes, to dyſproue that, whiche bothe by auncientie of time, and conſent of bleſſed and noble doctours, is allowed, &amp; by theyr warkes honoured.</p>
               <p>¶ If they wyl coniect hiſtories to be lyes, bycauſe they ſome tyme make reporte of
<pb facs="tcp:513:236"/>
thynges ſene, and actes doone, whiche do ſeme to the reders incredyble: by the ſame reaſon maye they not onely condempne all holy ſcripture, whiche conteyneth thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges more wonderful, thanne any hyſtorian writeth, but alſo exclude credulitie vtterly from the company of man? For howe many thynges be daily ſene, whiche being repor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted vnto hym that neuer lawe them, ſhulde ſeme impoſſible?</p>
               <p>¶ And if they wyl allege, that al thyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in holy ſcripture, is approbat by the hole conſent of all the clergie of Chryſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at diuers generall counſayles aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: Certes the ſame counſailes neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proued or reiected the hiſtories of grekes or Romaynes, but the moſte catholike and excellent lerned men of thoſe congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, embraced theyr examples, and ſowing them in their warkes, made of them to the churche of Chriſte, a neceſſarye ornament. Admytte, that ſome hiſtories be interlaced with leaſynges: why ſhulde we therfor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecte them? ſens the affaires there repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nothynge concerneth vs, we beynge therof no parteners, ne therby onely, may receyue any damage. But if by redyng the ſage counſayle of Neſtor, the ſubtylle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions of Uliſſes, the compendious gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of Menelaus, the imperyall maieſtie
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:513:236"/>
of Agamemnon, the proweſſe of Achilles, and valiant courage of Hector, we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende any thynge, wherby our wyttes maye be amended, and our perſonages be more apte to ſerue our publyke weale and our prynce: what forceth it vs, though Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere write leaſynges?</p>
               <p>¶ I ſuppoſe no man thynketh, that Eſope wrate goſpels: yet who doubteth, but that in his fables, the foxe, the hare, &amp; the wolf, though they neuer ſpake, do teache many good wyſedomes? whiche being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydered, men (if they haue not auowed to repugne agaynſt reaſon) ſhall confeſſe with Quintilian, that fewe, and vneth one maye be founde of auncient writars, whiche ſhall not bringe to the redars ſome thyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious: And ſpecially they that do write ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hiſtoricall, the leſſon wherof is as it were the myrrour of mans life, expreſſinge actually, and (as it were at the eyen) the beautie of vertue, and the deformytie and lothelynes of vice. Wherfore Lactantius <note place="margin">Lacta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius lib. 3.</note> ſaythe, Thou muſte nedes peryſhe, if thou knowe not, what is to thy lyfe profytable, that thou maiſt ſeke for it: and what is dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶ This euyll reporte, called Detraction, <note place="margin">The image of detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was wonderfully wel expreſſed in figures, by the mooſte noble peynter <hi>APELLES.</hi> After he was dyſcharged of the cryme, wherof he was falſely accuſed to Ptholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee, kyng of Aegypt, hauyng for his ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶ At the ryght hande was made ſyttyng a man, hauynge longe cares, puttynge forth his hande to <hi>DETRACTION,</hi> who farre of came towardes hym. Aboute this man ſtoode two womenne, that is to ſaye, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and Suſpicion. On the other ſide came Detraction, a woman aboue meaſure well trymmed, all chaufed and angrye, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge her aſpecte or loke lyke to the fyre, in ſhewynge a maner of rage or furye. In hyr lefte hande, ſhe helde a brennynge torche or bronde, and with her other hand
<pb facs="tcp:513:241"/>
ſhe drewe by the heare of his heed, a yong man, who helde vppe his handes towarde heuen, callynge god and the ſaynctes for wytneſſe: with her came a man pale, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll fauoured, beholdynge the yonge man intentifely, like vnto one that had ben with longe ſicknes conſumed, whom ye mought lyghtely coniecte, to be enuye. Alſo there folowed two other women, that trymmed and apparayled Detraction, the one was Treaſon, the other Fraude. After folowid a woman, in a mournyng weede, blacke and ragged, and ſhe was called Repentaunce, who tournynge her backe, weepynge and ſoore aſhamed, behelde Ueritie, who than approched.</p>
               <p>¶ In this wyſe Apelles deſcribed Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by whome he hym ſelfe was in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll.

For it is a thyng to laughe at, and verye vnſyttynge, to ordeyne for thy houſe a keper or porter: and to leaue thine eares and mynde to all menne wyde open. Wherfore, whan any perſone commeth to vs, to tel vs any reporte or complaint: Firſt it ſhall behoue vs throughly and euenly to conſidre the thynge, not hauinge reſpecte to the eares of hym that reporteth, or to his fourme of lyuynge, or wyſedome in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kynge. For the more vehement the repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in perſwadynge, the more dylygente and exacte triall and examynation ought to be vſed. Therfore truſte is not to be giuen to an other mannes iudgement, moche leſſe to the malice of an accuſer. But euery man ſhall reteyne to him ſelfe the power, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerche out the trouthe, and leauyng the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye or dyſpleaſure to the detractour, ſhall ponder or waye the matter indifferentely, that euery thynge, in ſuche wiſe beinge cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly inſerched and proued, he may at his pleaſure eyther loue or hate hym, whom he hath ſoo ſubſtauncially tried. For in good fayth, to giue place to detraction at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge,
<pb facs="tcp:513:242"/>
is a thynge chyldiſſhe and baſe, and to be eſtemed amonge the moſte great inconueniences and myſchiefes. Theſe be well nyghe the wordes of Luciane: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the counſayle be good, I remytte it to the wyſe reders.

Dyuers requyre to haue reſpecte and ſtudy, wherin is moche more ſuertie, many wyll ſpeke warely, for feare of diſpleſure, ſome more bolder in ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue, wyll not ſpare, to ſhewe theyr myndes playnely, diuers wyl aſſent to that reaſons, wherwith they ſuppoſe, that he, whiche is

And more ouer, where there is a greatte noumbre of counſaylours, they all beinge harde, nedes muſt the counſayle be the more perfecte.

               <p>THe ſecond conſyderation is, that the <note place="margin">Generall thinges be fore parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer.</note> general &amp; vniuerſall aſtate of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike weale, wold be preferred in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, before any particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie: and the profite or damage, which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen within our owne countrays, wolde be more conſidred, than that, which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from other regions: whiche to beleue. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune reaſon and experience leadeth vs. For who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth thoſe gardiners, that wyll put all their diligence in trymmyng or kepynge delicately one knotte or bedde of herbes, ſuffrynge al the remenaunt of their gardeine to be ſubuerted with a gret nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre

of molles, and to attende at noo tyme for the takynge and deſtroyenge of theym, vntyll the herbes, wherin they haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their labours be alſo tourned vp and peryſhed, and the molles increaſed in ſo infinite nombres, that no induſtry or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, may ſuffice to conſume them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the labour is fruſtrate, and all the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne made vnprofytable, and alſo vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. In this ſimilitude to the gardeyn may be reſembled the publike weale, to the gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diners, the gouernours and counſaylours, to the knottes or beddes, ſondry degrees of perſonages, to the molles, vyces, &amp; ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry enormities, Wherfore the conſultation is but of a ſmall effecte, wherin the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall aſtate of the publyke wele doth nat oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie the more parte of the tyme, &amp; in that generaltie euery particular aſtate, be nat di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligently ordered. For as Tulli ſaith, They that conſulte for parte of the people, and <note place="margin">Ci. Ooffia, li. i.</note> neglecte the reſidue, they brynge into the citie or countrey a thynge mooſte perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that is to ſay, ſedition and diſcorde. Wherof it hapneth, that ſome wyll ſeeme to fauoure the multitude, other be incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to leene to the beſte ſorte, fewe do ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye for all vniuerſally. Whiche hath benne the cauſe, that not onely Athenes (whiche Tulli dothe name) but alſo the Citie and
<pb facs="tcp:513:247"/>
empire of Rome, with dyuers other cities and realmes, haue decayed and ben fynally brought in extreme deſolation.</p>
               <p>¶ Alſo Plato, in his booke of Fortitude, <note place="margin">Plato in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>achete.</note> ſaythe in the perſone of Socrates, Whan ſo euer a man ſeketh a thynge, for cauſe of an other thynge, the conſultation ought to be alwaye of that thynge, for whoſe cauſe the other thynge is ſought for, and not of that, whiche is ſoughte for bycauſe of the other thynge. And ſurely, wyſe men do conſider, that damage often tymes hapneth, by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge the due fourme of conſultation: men lyke euyl Phiſitions, ſekyng for medicines, er they perfectly knowe the ſickneſſes: and as yuel marchauntes do vtter firſte the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and commodities of ſtrangers, whiles ſtrangers be robbing of their owne cofers.</p>
               <p>¶ Therfore theſe thinges, that I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed, concernyng conſultation, ought to be of all men in auctoritie ſubſtancially pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and moſt vigilantly obſerued, if they intende to be to theyr publyke weale profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: for the whiche purpoſe onely, they be called to be gouernours.</p>
               <p>¶ And thus I conclude, to write any more of conſultation, whiche is the laſte parte of morall Sapience, and the begynnynge of Sapience politike.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe all ye reders, that deſyre to haue
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:513:247"/>
your chyldren to be gouernours, or in any other autoritie in the publike weale of your countrey, if ye brynge them vp, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte them in ſuche fourme, as in this boke is declared, they ſhall than ſeme to all men, worthy to be in autoritie, honour, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe. And al that is vnder theyr gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce ſhal proſpere and come to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as a precious ſtone in a riche ouche, they ſhall be beholden and wondred at, and after the deathe of theyr body, theyr ſoules for theyr endeuour, ſhal be incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly rewarded of the gyuer of wiſedome, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely be gyuen eternall glorie.</p>
