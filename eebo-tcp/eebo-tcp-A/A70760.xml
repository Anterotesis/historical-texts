            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

created our firſt Parents, and purpoſing to multiply
their Seed into many Generations, for the repleniſhing
of the World with their Poſterity, did give to <hi>Adam</hi>
for his time, and to the reſt of the Patriarchs, and chief

Power and Dominion over their Children, and Off-ſpring,
to rule and govern them; Ordaining by the
very Law of Nature, That their ſaid Children and Off-ſpring
(begotten and brought up by them) ſhould
fear, reverence, honour, and obey them. Which
power and Authority before the Flood, reſting in the

very large extent, not only for the Education of their

good Kings and Civil Magiſtrates, to bring up their

                  <p>THE Hiſtory of <hi>Jehu</hi> before-mention'd, doth put
us in mind, what is written of <hi>Ahud,</hi> one of the
Judges of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> We have elſewhere ſhew'd, that
from <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Death to the time of <hi>Saul,</hi> God himſelf,
when his People were oppreſt by their bordering
Neighbours, did ſtill raiſe up unto them, Governours
and Leaders, called <hi>Judges,</hi> without reſpect either of
any Tribe,<note place="margin">Placet. xlviii.</note> more one than another, or of the dignity
of any Perſon, or of the Peoples pleaſure, choice and
conſent firſt required; but ſimply, according to his
own choice and wiſdom: In which number the ſaid
<hi>Ahud</hi> was one; the manner of whoſe entrance into that
charge, we could not (our courſe conſider'd) preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
with ſilence. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been eighteen
years in ſubjection to the <hi>Moabites;</hi> as they had been a
little before, eight years to the <hi>Aramites.</hi> They knew
that it was not lawful for them of themſelves, and by
their own Authority, to take Arms againſt the Kings,
whoſe Subjects they were, though indeed they were
Tyrants: and therefore they <hi>cried unto the Lord for
ſuccour.</hi> Who, in compaſſion of their ſervitude and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
<note place="margin">Judg. 3. 9, 15.</note> appointed <hi>Othoniel</hi> to deliver them from the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites;</hi>
and afterward <hi>Ahud</hi> from the <hi>Moabites.</hi> In the
choice of which two Judges it is to be obſerv'd, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42183:30"/>
the Scriptures do tell us, that <hi>God raiſed them up</hi> (and
therefore 'tis moſt certain he did ſo) and alſo, that in
ſuch raiſing of them to their places he made them <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
to his People</hi> (as the Scriptures ſpeak) giving them
thereby Authority to ſave and redeem the Iſraelites
from the Tyrants that oppreſſed them: without both
which Prerogatives it had been altogether unlawful for
them to have done as they did. Beſides, it appeareth
in the Scriptures, that when the Lord did thus chuſe
out, and authorize the ſaid Deliverers and Rulers, he
did not only give them, by his holy Spirit, full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their lawful Callings, but likewiſe did furniſh
them with ſuch wiſdom and courage, as was neceſſary
for them in thoſe kinds of Services. So as <hi>Ahud</hi> (at
whom we principally aim) being thus both called and
inſtructed from God,<note place="margin">Placet. xlix.</note> how he ſhould begin his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
deliverance from the <hi>Moabites,</hi> by killing of <hi>Eglon</hi>
their King, he framed his courſe accordingly; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for himſelf a meet Weapon, took a fit Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and thereupon (as God had directed him) he,
wholly reſting upon the Lord's aſſiſtance, executed that
Judgment upon the ſaid King; and afterward ſo van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and ſubdued them under the hand
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the whole Land was at reſt from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of their Enemies <hi>eighty years.</hi> Beſides, it is to
be obſerv'd, that as God's appointing by Name and
Election of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and after that the
Kingdom was held by Succeſſion; the very being of
the King's Son, and the true Heir Apparent after his
Father's Death, gave unto them all the actual Intereſt,
Right and Poſſeſſion (as Poſſeſſion in thoſe caſes is to
be expounded) of their ſeveral Governments, to do
any act or acts, as well before as after any ſubſequent
Formalities and Ceremonies: even ſo the ſaid form of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Judges by God himſelf immediately, made them
alſo Judges actually, and did give unto them a full and
abſolute Authority (independent upon any but upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42183:30"/>
him that gave it them) to undertake any thing, that
by God's direction appertain'd to their places.<note place="margin">Placet. l.</note> Again,
there is one other Example of <hi>Jehu</hi> amongſt the Kings
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which we have before touched, like unto this
of <hi>Ahud:</hi> wherein it appeareth, that he the ſaid <hi>Jehu</hi>
was of a Subject firſt made the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before it
was lawful for him to have killed <hi>Joram;</hi> As <hi>Ahud,</hi> a
Subject, was firſt made the Judge, Prince and Ruler of
the People, before he might have lawfully killed King
<hi>Eglon.</hi> Both which Examples (being but in number
two throughout the Hiſtories of all the Princes, Judges,
and Kings, either of <hi>Judah,</hi> or <hi>Iſrael)</hi> do make it known
unto us, That although the Lord both may, and is
able to overthrow any Kings or Emperours, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
any claim, right, title, or intereſt, which
they can challenge to their Countries, Kingdoms or
Empires; yet foreſeeing in his Heavenly Wiſdom, and

Height and Ripeneſs, as his Juſtice could not fitly be

for example, in the overthrowing of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> (God's

the High-Prieſthood amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was better
beſtow'd afterwards. Indeed now it came into the
hands of the <hi>Maccabees:</hi> but how they uſed it there
is little mention.<note place="margin">Placet. lxxiii.</note> It is probable, that being ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
as they were, and ſo continually in a manner
vexed with Wars, they had no time to execute that
office in ſuch ſort, as otherwiſe divers of them no
doubt would have done. But it cannot be denied, that
ſome of that rank were greatly puffed up with that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and did thereby much forget themſelves, and
the holy Duties appertaining to the High-Prieſthood.
Elſe would not <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> have ſo unnaturally famiſhed

of his Innocent Brother <hi>Antigonus;</hi> nor would <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>

the two Sons of the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> (viz. <hi>Hircanus</hi>

aſſiſted <hi>Pompey</hi> in his attempt againſt <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Placet. lxxiv.</note>
partly in hope thereby to get the High Prieſthood, and
partly in malice againſt his Brother; who, as long as
he could, defended that City; the Iſſue of all which
ſtrife was this, <hi>Pompey</hi> ſubdued the City; ſlew twelve
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42183:40"/>
thouſand Men; <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> is put from the High Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
the civil Government is ſeparated again from
the High-Prieſthood; the High Prieſthood is beſtowed
upon <hi>Hircanus</hi> for his Service, and the civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thenceforth tranſlated to ſtrangers; the Temple
was ſpoiled, and <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was made Tributary to
the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of all which Calamities falling
in this ſort upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> the diſſention betwixt <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi>
and <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> was held in thoſe days to have
been the cauſe; to the great blemiſh of their credits,
profeſſing themſelves to be God's High-Prieſts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
while <hi>Jaſon, Menelaus, Alcimus,</hi> and the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi>
were buſied in their ſaid Un-Prieſtly Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and <hi>Greekiſh</hi> profanations, divers Sects of Religion
aroſe, and encreaſed among the Jews; eſpecially, that
of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> a crafty and an arrogant kind of Men,
ſeditiouſly bent againſt their Kings, and impugners
without fear of their Authority.<note place="margin">Joſ. ant. l. 17. c. 13.</note> In which courſe they
were the rather animated, becauſe they found through

thoſe days, when the Prieſts had gotten the Reins into
their own hands, although we doubt not but that
there were ſome few, notwithſtanding, both of the
Prieſts, and of the People, who diſliking of all their
ſaid hypocritical, ambitious, profane, and wicked
Practices (cover'd ſometimes with a pretence of Zeal,
and ſometimes with the glorious name of the High

There was never (we think) ſo obſtinate and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

his Mind at another time more amply, if it had
been poſſible to have reclaimed them: which Duty,
ſo impoſed upon him, <hi>Joſephus</hi> performed very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.
He told them, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that tho' the <hi>Romans</hi> had dealt
ſometimes very hardly with them, yet their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

lawfully fight in defence of their Countrey, when it

by Rebellion, under pretence of Liberty, to caſt
off that Yoke; that their Fore-fathers being in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
under the Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

Deliverance; but ever expected the Lord's leiſure,
who always, in due time, had compaſſion upon
them; and that although they were then in the
greateſt diſtreſs, that ever People were, and could
expect nothing but utter Ruine and Deſolation; yet
if then they would ſubmit themſelves, they might
be received to Mercy. For (ſaith he) the <hi>Romans</hi>

City, nor touch your Sanctuary; but grant unto you
freely, your Families, your Poſſeſſions, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of your Sacred Laws."</q> But all theſe Offers they
refuſed. Howbeit the compaſſion of <hi>Titus</hi> towards

Deſtruction more apparently) required the ſaid <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42183:42"/>
to deliver his Mind, to the ſame effect, to their

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42183:46"/>

either to bleſs or to puniſh any Kingdom, People or

Rulers of the Earth. And it may not here be omitted
(which indeed ariſeth of the Premiſſes) that the Son
of God, in diſpoſing of the Government, under him, of
the Earth, did not appoint any one man to be the ſole
Monarch of the world; as from whom all other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Governments, Kings and Princes ſhould receive
their Directions, and unto whom they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
It is true, that <hi>Adam,</hi> whilſt he lived, was the
chief Governour under the Son of God,<note place="margin">Placet. xcij.</note> over all his
own Off-ſpring; and that <hi>Noah</hi> likewiſe, during his
Life, had the like Authority. But when, after the
Flood, the Iſſue of <hi>Sem, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> grew to a
great People, their Father, <hi>Noah,</hi> did not commit, to
any one of them, the Government of the reſt, and of all
of their Poſterity; but divided the whole World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them three: and from them, no one ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
or Monarchy, but many Kings. Principalities,
Kingdoms and Governments, by God's Providence, have
deſcended. It is more than probable, that if the Son
of God had been pleaſed to have committed to any
one Man, a Government of ſo large an extent, he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42183:46"/>
would have truſted his Servant, King <hi>David,</hi> with it,
being a Man according to his own Heart. But the
Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wherein <hi>David</hi> reigned, was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within the ſtrait Limits aſſigned to the Twelve
Tribes. And ſuch other Kings, as ſwerved, after that
time, from <hi>David</hi>'s mild and temperate Government,
and took upon them the Titles of Monarchies, having
enlarged their Kingdoms by Injury and Oppreſſion of
their Neighbours; where, in their Pride and Greedineſs,
but the Scourges and Rods of God's Indignation,<note place="margin">Placet. xciij.</note> and
had their fatal Ends accordingly. So as where the
Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi>

the Son of God was ever the ſole (though inviſible)
Monarch, as we have ſhewed in the former Chapter:
So it is generally agreed upon among all Chriſtians,
That from the Creation of Mankind, during the times
aforeſaid, there hath always been One Univerſal or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church:</hi> which began in <hi>Adam,</hi> and afterward
(as his Poſterity multiplied, both before and after the

and whereof the Son of God likewiſe was always the
head and ſole (though inviſible) Monarch. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of which Church was ever one and the ſame
Rock, to wit <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the promiſed <hi>Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

Perſons, Families, Societies, and Companies, as truly
believed in that bleſſed Seed, without exception of any

and parts of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Placet. xcvi.</note> For the death of our
Saviour Chriſt, which long after did actually enſue;
was virtually, through Faith, as effectual to all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
before his Paſſion, as it hath been ſince. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
whereof the Holy Ghoſt did not only affirm, That
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt was the ſame,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Wiſdom, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42183:48"/>
Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
in him) <hi>yeſterday,</hi> (that is, before and after the
Law) <hi>as to day</hi> (that is, now in the time of the New

from the beginning of the World:</hi> becauſe his Death and
Paſſion, being ever as preſent in the view and ſight of
God the Father (before whom <hi>a thouſand years are but
as one day;)</hi> the ſame was typically repreſented by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and effectual Sacraments; and the merits thereof
have from the beginning been communicated to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
So that although in imitation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we have ſpoken hitherto but of one particular
Church, and of the Succeſſion of it in the Lines of <hi>Seth</hi>
and <hi>Sem:</hi> yet there have been other particular Churches
in all Ages, which were built upon the ſaid Rock and
promiſed Seed. <hi>Cain</hi> offer'd his Sacrifice to God as well
as <hi>Abel;</hi> though it was not for his ſins accepted: and
it is not to be doubted, but that every chief Family of
his Poſterity had their Prieſts and publick worſhip of
God;<note place="margin">Placet. xcvii.</note> albeit mingled with ſome ſuch Superſtition and
Idolatry, as offended God, and made them leſs accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his ſight. For as of the Poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> many
periſhed; ſo we are to judge on the other ſide, that
many of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Line died in God's favour: except we
ſhould think, againſt the rules of Charity, that the
Curſe which fell upon <hi>Cain,</hi> killing his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> did
cauſe his Off-ſpring to become as brute Beaſts: whereas
having <hi>Adam</hi> their Grandfather, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
he did better inſtruct them, and prevail'd at leaſt
with ſome of them. Likewiſe after the Flood, all <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s
Off-ſpring, being one Church under him, and
grounded upon Chriſt the true Foundation of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
afterward, when they were ſetled in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Countries, allotted unto them, they ſwerved
greatly from that Purity in Religion which <hi>Noah</hi> had
taught them; yet they had ſtill their Prieſts, their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
and ſome outward worſhip of God amongſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42183:48"/>
them. Beſides, hitherto all the World being as one
People,<note place="margin">Placet. xcviij.</note> if there were then any viſible Churches at all
upon the Earth; it cannot be truly ſaid, that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> and the Erecting of the
true worſhip of God in his Family, did make them to
be in worſe caſe than they were before. If Churches
before, they ſo continued after, though Superſtitious
and Idolatrous Churches. Again, it is generally held,
that God did not therefore diſtinguiſh the <hi>Jews</hi> from
other Nations and People, and ſettle his publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
amongſt them; as purpoſing thereby, that his
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in their times, ſhould only conſiſt of
them and of their Nations; and ſuch other Proſelytes
as would be circumciſed, and join themſelves unto
them: but much more, becauſe by that means the
truth and certainty of all the Promiſes and Prophecies
concerning the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> might be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and diligently obſerv'd, and kept in one Nation,
and viſible known place and People. For it is plain in
the Scriptures, that after the ſaid diſtinction, many of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſerved God,<note place="margin">Placet. xcix.</note> and believed in Chriſt, and
were thereby made the true Members of the <hi>Catholick
Church;</hi> though they were not circumcis'd, nor had
any medling with, or dependency upon the <hi>Jews.</hi> Some
are particularly named; as <hi>Job, Jethro, Rahab,</hi> the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites,</hi>
the Widow of <hi>Sarepta, Naaman, Cornelius,</hi> and
ſome others: by whom we are not only to judge of
their Families and Governments, that they were ſo
many particular Churches: but likewiſe, that in every
Country, and People, many ſuch godly Men from
time to time might have been found; who with their
Families, and peradventure Subjects, were ſo to be
held and eſteemed of. We will not enter into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing
of theſe places, how far they may be extended.

obſerve, that it was lawful for any of the Gentiles to
come into the outward Court of the Temple, to bring
their Sacrifices unto the Lord, and there to offer up
their Prayers likewiſe unto him: that accordingly they
did often reſort to the Temple for Devotion ſake, there
to worſhip God: as by the Examples of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> of
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 8. 27.</note> and of certain <hi>Grecians,</hi> that are mentioned
in the Scriptures:<note place="margin">John 12. 20.</note> and that many of them were ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the true ſervice of God, as the Prophet <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai</hi>
calleth our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Deſiderium Gentium.</hi> So
that the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> conſiſting from the beginning
till <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, of ſuch only as were afterward
for diſtinction ſake called <hi>Gentiles;</hi> although God was
then pleaſed to beſtow his Mercies more plentifully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that one particular Church of the Jews, deduced
from <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Placet.</note> than upon any other, or indeed upon
all the reſt,<note place="margin">ci.</note> for the principal Cauſes before-ſpecified;
yet they were not utterly ſo rejected, or caſt out of
God's favour, but that many of them did continue as
dutiful Children in the Lap and Boſom of the ſaid <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church.</hi> Of which <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> it is true,
that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> for their times, were (under
Chriſt) the chief Governours. Howbeit afterward
the Poſterity of <hi>Noah</hi> being mightily encreaſed, when
thereupon he diſtributed the whole World among his

one of them to be the Ruler of the ſaid <hi>Catholick Church;</hi>
but left the Government of every particular Family or
Church unto their chief Heads, Princes and Prieſts;

of it; who only was able to undertake ſuch a charge

and mighty Stumbling-blocks, which, through long
Practice, and incredible Ambition, are caſt in our way

approve of their groſs Impiety, who read the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42183:51"/>
Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as if they were
falſified and corrupted, and by receiving and rejecting
as much of them as they liſt, do prefer before them
(as not containing in them all neceſſary Truth for
Man's Salvation) certain obſcure, and Apocryphal
Writings; Or, ſhould our ſelves impiouſly imagine,
that the New Teſtament (as now we have it) was
but a rough Draught, and a fit Project compiled, for the
time, by the Apoſtles, to be afterward better ordered,
poliſhed, and ſupplied with certain humane Traditions
and Doctrines, by ſome of their Succeſſours: We can
ſee no Authentical Ground, nor ſufficient Warrant, in
thoſe Writings, which ought to be the true Rule of
every Chriſtian Man's Conſcience (as not being there
to be found) for any Apoſtolical Prieſt or Biſhop ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to pretend, that all the particular Churches, in
the World, are under his Government; or to tell the
Subjects of any Chriſtian King, oppoſite in ſome points,

of Arms, or by ſome ſecret Practice, to ſubdue him;

Authority and Power over all Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
in the World, to beſtow them, in ſome caſes,
(under pretence of Religion) when he ſhall think the
ſame to be moſt available, for the ſtrengthning and
upholding of ſuch his pretended Univerſal Power and
Dominion. To the Proof whereof, before we addreſs
our ſelves; becauſe the ſame doth much depend upon
the admirable Humiliation of the Son of God, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our Nature upon him, and performing the Work
of our Salvation, in ſuch a manner, as he did: We
have thought it our Duties (leſt otherwiſe we might be
miſtaken, either through Weakneſs, Simplicity or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice)
firſt, briefly to obſerve (notwithſtanding our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's

Preheminency and Royalty of his Perſon.</p>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42183:51"/>
It is many ways apparent, that the mean Eſtate and
Condition of our Saviour Chriſt, here upon Earth,
was one eſpecial Motive, both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
why, in their carnal Judgments, he was, to the one
ſort a Scandal, and to the other a Scorn; as if he had
been a Man out of his Wits, and preached he knew
not what. In which reſpect, partly not only the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Prieſts of all ſorts, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> with the reſt of their Hypocritical Orders;
but likewiſe the civil Governours, as well <hi>Romans</hi> as
<hi>Jews,</hi> did utterly deſpiſe him, hate him, deride him,
beat him, and put him to death. Since which time
ſundry ſorts of Hereticks have ſtumbled at the ſame
ſtone, labouring, by all the means they could, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
and diſhonour the Perſon of Chriſt, in regard of
the mean ſhew of his humane Nature, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many Arguments which they might have
found in the Scriptures, (had not their Hearts been
hardned) of his Divinity. On the other ſide, we are
not ignorant, how the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents,
ſuppoſing it would too much impeach their
Credits, and worldly Reputations; if they ſhould be
too much preſſed to deduce the principal ſtrength of
their Eſtates and Callings, from the ſaid mean Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Saviour Chriſt, whilſt he lived in this
World; do thereupon attribute ſundry Virtues, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Branches of Authority unto his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which do not, in Truth, belong properly unto it,
but are rather appertaining to his Perſon, being both
God and Man; as hoping thereby to get ſome fair Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
and Colours for the upholding of their uſurped
Greatneſs, and pretended uncontroulable Sovereignty.
For the avoiding therefore of theſe Extremities, and
becauſe ſuch as deny the Pope's Supremacy, are moſt
falſly charged, by ſundry paſſionate, and inconſiderate
Perſons, to be Men, that believe no one Article of the
Chriſtian Faith: We have thought it meet, to make
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42183:52"/>
it known, to all the Chriſtian World, how deteſtable,
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> all ſuch falſe Doctrine is,
as doth any way, not only impeach the Sacred Perſon
of our Saviour Chriſt, but likewiſe the other two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Bleſſed Trinity, God the Father, and God
the Holy Ghoſt; in that the diſhonouring of One of
them, is the diſhonouring of them all Three.</p>
                  <p>We do therefore, for our ſelves, and in the Name
of all the reſt of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> acknowledge
and profeſs, from the bottom of our hearts, the Truth
of all that is written in the Sacred Scriptures;
and conſequently, and in more particular manner,
whatſoever is written in the ſame, that doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to the moſt Holy and Bleſſed Trinity. Out
of the Doctrine of which Sacred Writings, becauſe
the Apoſtles and Churches of God, (moved thereunto,
by ſundry ſorts of Hereticks) have, long ſince, moſt
faithfully and learnedly deduced, into certain Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
rightly termed <hi>Creeds,</hi> all thoſe Points of true
Doctrine, which do concern God the Father, God the
Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, and are neceſſarily to
be believed, under pain of condemnation: We do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
embrace, and ſtedfaſtly believe, all and every
one the Articles of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed;</hi> and all and
every one the Articles of the other <hi>Creeds,</hi> made, by
ſundry Councils, for the further Declaration of the
Chriſtian Faith, and Apoſtolick Creed, as of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Creed,</hi> made, by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> againſt <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
who denied the Divinity of the Son of God;

Creed</hi> againſt <hi>Eudoxius</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> and <hi>Macedonius,</hi>
who denied the Holy Ghoſt to be God; and of the
<hi>Creed,</hi> made in the firſt Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> againſt
<hi>Nestorius,</hi> who taught that the two Natures in Chriſt,
were not united together perſonally, but that the
Word, which did take our Nature upon him, for our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42183:52"/>
Redemption, did only aſſiſt Chriſt, our Saviour, as
one Friend may aſſiſt another; and of the <hi>Creed</hi> made
in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> againſt <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who did
confound the two Natures of Chriſt. Againſt any of
which Articles whoſoever doth oppoſe himſelf, and
doth willfully continue in ſuch his Oppoſition; we
hold and judge them to be worthily ſubject to all thoſe
Cenſures, and Anathematiſms, which the ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
and Canons of the ſaid Councils have juſtly
laid upon them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo with the ſame Reſolution and Faith before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
we receive and believe all and every one
the ſeveral Points and Articles of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed,
made a little after the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> againſt ſuch
blaſphemous Opinions, as in thoſe times were either
directly or indirectly, publiſhed in Corners, and ſpread
here and there to the ſeducing of many. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſome Articles of the which Creed, that
do more nearly concern our Courſe; We ſtedfaſtly
believe and confeſs, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That our Lord, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
the Son of God, is both God and Man: God of the
ſubſtance of the Father, begotten before all Worlds;
and Man, of the ſubſtance of his Mother, born in the
World: perfect God, and perfect Man, of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Soul, and humane fleſh ſubſiſting: Equal to the
Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferiour to
the Father, as touching his Manhood: who although
he be both God and Man; yet he is not two, but
One Chriſt: One, not by Converſion of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
into Fleſh; but by taking of the Manhood into
God: One altogether, not by Confuſion of ſubſtance,
but by Unity of Perſon."</q> In reſpect of which Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Union of the two Natures of our Saviour Chriſt,
without confuſion or mixture of either of them, thus
deſcribed in the ſaid Creed; whatſoever is affirmed in
the Scriptures, as well of the one Nature as of the other,
the ſame is alſo truly to be affirmed <hi>de toto Compoſito,</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42183:53"/>
that is, of his moſt ſacred Perſon being both God and
Man; the Eſſential Properties of them both remaining
notwithſtanding diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>For as the ſaid perſonal or hypoſtatical Union of the
ſaid two Natures, doth not make the one Nature to be
the other; the divine Nature to be the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or the humane Nature to be the Divine Nature:
ſo doth it not make the Eſſential Proprieties of the one
Nature to be the Eſſential Proprieties of the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but as well the Proprieties and actions as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themſelves do remain diſtinguiſhed, though uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one Perſon; both of them concurring together,
the Deity in working that which appertaineth to the
Deity, and the Humanity executing thoſe Eſſential
Proprieties and actions which do belong unto the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
For Example, the Divine Nature appear'd
in Chriſt by Miracles, when his humane Nature was
ſubject to many opprobries and injuries. In that our
Saviour Chriſt did ſatisfie 5000. Perſons with 5. loaves,
did give Water of Life to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> did
walk upon the Sea dry-foot, did by his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
calm the Winds; he ſhewed thereby ſome effects
and works of his Divine Nature: becauſe they were
(as one well ſaith) <hi>verbi propria, non carnis,</hi> the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Word, and not of the Fleſh. Again, in that
Chriſt brake Bread, this was an Office of his humane
Nature, but in that he multiplied it, the ſame did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to his Divine Nature. In that he cried out, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus
come forth,</hi> that was the office of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but in that he quickned him, and raiſed him
from Death, that did belong unto his Divine Nature.
In that he ſaid, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> that was an
office of his humane Nature; but in that ſuch ſins were
indeed remitted, the ſame did appertain to his Divine
Nature. In that our Saviour Chriſt died, the ſame
did proceed from the Fleſh; but in that by his Death
he did expiate our Sins, that did proceed from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42183:53"/>
In that he was Buried, did proceed from the Fleſh;
but in that he did raiſe himſelf from the dead, that was
he Office of his Divinity. In that he gave Bread to his
Apoſtles in his laſt Supper, he did it as Man; but in
that he made them partakers of his bleſſed Body, he did
the ſame as he was God. In that now being in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he doth poſſeſs that Kingdom in the name and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of his Elect, that doth appertain to his humane
Nature; but that he doth now remain with us, and
dwell in our hearts, that is an Office of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In that he maketh Interceſſion for us, that doth
belong to his humane Nature; but in that he doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
us, regenerate us, work in us both to will and to
perform, in that he ruleth us and leadeth us in the
way of his Commandments; all theſe Offices do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto his Divinity. Laſtly, In that he ſhall come
in the Clouds, and ſay unto one ſort of Perſons, <hi>Come
ye bleſſed,</hi> and unto the other ſort, <hi>Depart ye Curſed;</hi>
he ſhall do the ſame according to his humane Nature:
but in that he ſhall judge every Man according to his
knowledge of all Mens hearts, their cogitations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and works, that he ſhall do as God.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs any thing by us thus affirmed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
Chriſt himſelf is not divided, though the
Proprieties and actions of his two Natures, are in this
ſort to be diſtinguiſhed: as God himſelf is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
although the three Perſons in Trinity are
rightly held to be indeed diſtinguiſhed: and yet all the
ſaid actions and proprieties of the two Natures of
Chriſt, diſtinguiſhed, as we have expreſſed they are,
are notwithſtanding very truly to be affirm'd of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Perſon. The reaſon whereof, hath been before
touched, and it is this; becauſe ſeeing that both the
Natures are joined together in the Perſon of the Son,
by an <hi>Hypoſtatical,</hi> and conſequently a true and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Union; ſo as Chriſt is thereby both true God, in
regard of his Divine Nature, and true Man, in reſpect
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42183:54"/>
of his humane Nature: Whatſoever is the Propriety
of the Divine Nature, and of the humane Nature, the
ſame is wholly, and altogether in Chriſt, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
therefore to be affirmed of him, both eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and properly. In reſpect whereof, we ſay, that
Chriſt was dead, and that he could not die; that he
is both finite and infinite; eternal and temporal; in
every place, and yet circumſcribed in one place. For,
of neceſſity, whatſoever are the Properties of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, the ſame are truly and properly to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<hi>de vero homine:</hi> and whatſoever are the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
of the Divine Nature, the ſame are likewiſe to be
affirmed <hi>de vero Deo;</hi> Chriſt being (out of all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
amongſt the Children of God) <hi>&amp; verus homo, &amp; verus
Deus.</hi> And thus we have, after a ſort, both briefly
and truly ſet down the Force and Efficacy of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical
Union of the two Natures of Chriſt, being
diſtinguiſhed, but no ways confounded; as the ſame,
together with the true Doctrine of all other neceſſary
Articles, concerning the Bleſſed Trinity, doth, by the
Scriptures, moſt truly expounded in the Creeds above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
many ways very notably appear.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe much more might have here been
added by us; if (our Courſe conſidered) we had thought
it neceſſary. Only we have thought it fit, furthermore
to profeſs, and make it thereby known to all Men;
that there are ſome other <hi>Creeds,</hi> made by other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and particular Biſhops, like to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and
other worthy Perſons: as <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s <hi>Creed, Tertullian</hi>'s
<hi>Creed</hi> (as we may ſo term it) <hi>Damaſus</hi>'s <hi>Creed,</hi> the
<hi>Creed</hi> aſcribed to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and to St. <hi>Auguſtine, Te
Deum laudamus,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Creed</hi> of the firſt Council of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Creed</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Leo,</hi>
which was approved by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and
the <hi>Creed</hi> of the ſixth Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> againſt
the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> holding that in Chriſt, both God and
Man, there was but One Will: all of them tending to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42183:54"/>
the ſetting forth the Orthodoxal and true Doctrine of
<hi>One God in Trinity, and Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Perſons, nor dividing the Subſtance;</hi> and of <hi>One
Chriſt, true God and true Man, not confounding his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nor dividing his Perſon.</hi> Which <hi>Creeds</hi> we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
embrace, and reverence in ſuch ſorts, as they
have been received, embraced and reverenced hitherto,
by all the particular Churches of the Chriſtian World;
in as much, as they agree both with the Scriptures,
with the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> with the four <hi>Creeds</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the four firſt general Councils, and with the
<hi>Athanaſian Creed;</hi> which contain in them that Faith,
which was then, and ſo ſtill ought to be accounted
the true, Catholick Faith: nothing, in effect, being
contained in all the <hi>Creeds</hi> before, by us ſpecified,
which may not be deduced, by neceſſary conſequence,
out of the ſaid <hi>Athanaſian Creed;</hi> and the Concluſion
of which <hi>Creed</hi> is, in theſe words, expreſſed; <hi>This is
the Catholick Faith, which except a Man believe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
he cannot be ſaved.</hi> To which Concluſion, that,
in ſenſe, is very conſonant, wherewith <hi>Damaſus</hi> doth
end his <hi>Creed,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Read theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, retain them: to this Faith ſubmit thy Soul,
and thou ſhalt obtain Life and Reward from Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which <hi>Creeds,</hi> containing the Catholick Faith, in
thoſe days, or in any of the reſt, we have thought it
good, here to remember, that there is not any one
Article, to warrant or prove thoſe new Articles, which
were coined long after the making of any of the ſaid
<hi>Creeds,</hi> by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are added to the
<hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> by <hi>Pius IV.</hi> in the profeſſing of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Faith: eſpecially that New Article of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi>
which is ſtill ſo ſtifly maintained and urged
upon many, under pain of the loſs of their Souls, <hi>viz.</hi>
that it is altogether neceſſary for them, if they will
be ſaved, to be obedient to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which
New Article, being but an extravagant Concluſion;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42183:55"/>
made by a very ſtrange Man, and built upon as ſtrange
Collections out of the Scriptures; We leave it for a
novelty unto all the Articles of the ancient Catholick
Faith: and will now addreſs our ſelves to proſecute

For that Faith doth only apprehend Chriſt truly to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which worketh by Charity; that is, which
purgeth the Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the
living God; and bringeth forth by the Spirit, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Precepts and Laws of God.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ſhewed by us at large in the former
Book, that although the Son of God having made the
World, did by his mighty Power and divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
retain, as it were, in his own hands, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule and Government of it: yet for a more viſible
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42183:55"/>
benefit and comfort to Mankind, he did divide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
the ſame into divers Countries, Principalities,
and Kingdoms: and ordaining civil Magiſtracy, did
not only appoint Soveraign Princes and Kings as his
Deputies and Lieutenants upon Earth, to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
under him, ſuch Countries and Kingdoms as he
had allotted unto them; but did likewiſe tie Mankind
by one of the Moral Laws ingraven in their hearts,
that they ſhould honour them, ſerve them, and be
obedient unto them. Which particular Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was no more aboliſhed by the Incarnation of our
Saviour Chriſt, than were all the reſt. Nay it was in
truth of ſuch force and publick note, as that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
having moſt willingly ſubjected himſelf to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the whole Law, did very carefully, upon
every occaſion, ſhew himſelf moſt obſervant of this
one Law amongſt the reſt. For in the whole courſe of
his Life here upon Earth, we find not any alteration
that he made in the Civil State where he was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant:
which he muſt of neceſſity have done, if his
coming into the World had any way impeached the
Authority of the civil Magiſtrates. It is expreſly recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him,<note place="margin">Luc. 2. 51.</note> that he lived in ſubjection to his Parents;
herein fullfilling the ſaid <hi>Fifth Commandment,</hi> which
containeth as well the ſubjection due to Authority Civil
as Paternal.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 3.</note> He was <hi>made of the Seed of</hi> David <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh; and ſo had (no
doubt) according to his Manhood, great natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of thoſe Miſeries and Afflictions, which the
<hi>Jews</hi> at that very time endur'd under the <hi>Romans.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
as knowing the duties of their Allegiance, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moved, nor any way encouraged them to take
Arms againſt the Emperour; nor filled their heads with
ſhifts and diſtinctions, how Subjects in this Caſe and
that Caſe, were ſuperiour to their Soveraigns; nor did
any way approve of thoſe rebellious courſes in them,
whereunto they were of their own diſpoſitions very
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42183:56"/>
greatly addicted. He was ſo far from theſe exorbitant
and bad Humours; as ſtill he ſhewed, when there was
cauſe, his great deteſtation of them. He did himſelf
<hi>very willingly</hi> pay Tribute when it was demanded; and
upon fit Occaſion, gave all the <hi>Jews</hi> this following
Rule, that they, living under <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were <hi>bound to
pay unto him thoſe things that were his;</hi> meaning ſuch
Obedience, Cuſtom, Tributes, Tolls, Taxation and
Payments, as, by the Laws, both Divine and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
were due unto <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And certainly if ever it
had, and might have been lawful for private Men, in
reſpect of their own Zeal, to have uſed Force againſt
Authority; it ſeemeth to us, that it might have been
born with in the Apoſtles, upon ſome ſuch Accidents,
as then fell out. <hi>Judas</hi> had betrayed their Maſter,
and thereupon a Multitude was ſent, with a publick
Officer, to apprehend him. Which the Apoſtles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
conferred together, as it ſeemeth, how to make
Reſiſtance,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 49.</note> and ſaid, in their Zeal, <hi>Maſter, ſhall we ſmite
them with the ſword?</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> ſeeing (of likelyhood)
the Haſte, Violence, and Fury that was uſed, by the
ſaid Multitude, did, upon the ſudden, pluck out his
Sword, and without any expectation, what Chriſt
would anſwer to the ſaid Queſtion, ſmiting one of the
Company, did cut off his Ear. Now if we ſhall conſult,
with Fleſh and Blood, who would not approve this
Fact of St. <hi>Peter?</hi> But our Saviour Chriſt, being void
of any Heat or Paſſion, and only reſpecting the Will
of God, and the due Obſervation of the ſaid particular
Law; did utterly condemn, in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that violent
and unlawful Attempt: becauſe he, being but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man, had nothing to do with the Temporal
Sword, which belonged to the Civil Magiſtrate; and
much leſs ſhould have uſed it againſt Authority. And
therefore, as well to let St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſee his Offence, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to leave a Caution, for the bridling, from thence
forwards, of all future raſh Zeal, in ſuch a Caſe, he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42183:56"/>
juſtified the Law of God, and did leave the ſame, for
a Rule, to all Poſterity, ſaying, <hi>All that take the ſword,
ſhall periſh with the Sword:</hi> meaning all private Perſons,
that ſhall, at any time, abuſe, after that ſort, the civil
Sword, which doth in no wiſe appertain unto
them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is manifeſt, that our Saviour Chriſt, if,
as he was God, he had been diſpoſed, was able to
have defended himſelf againſt all the World. Nay,
as he was Man, he might, by Prayer to his Father,
have procured ſufficient Aſſiſtance againſt the Force
of all his Enemies; had he not well known that
Courſe to have been repugnant to the Obedience,
which he had undertaken, of the ſaid Commandment,
and no way agreeable to the Vocation and Work
which he had in hand: and therefore perſiſting in his
Reproof of St. <hi>Peter, Thinkeſt thou</hi> (ſaith he unto him)
<hi>that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he will give me
more than Twelve Legions of Angels?</hi> but it is ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
in all the Proceedings of our Saviour Chriſt,
whilſt he lived in this World, that he never liked, in
any, the Reſiſtance of Civil Authority by Force; or
approved of any inconſiderate and raſh Zeal, bent
againſt Magiſtrates, or any other Perſons; but was
always ready to blame and check the ſame, as he did,
when he found it in two other of his Apoſtles, who,
to revenge an Injury offered to their Maſter, ſought to
have had it puniſhed from Heaven. For when the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi>
refuſed (upon conference and direction, we
doubt not, of thoſe that were in Authority over them)
to give Chriſt entertainment,<note place="margin">Luc. 9. 54, 55.</note> and lodging in one of
their Cities; <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſo moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
as they would needs have licence of him, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that Fire ſhould come down from Heaven, as <hi>Elias</hi>
did; ſhewing thereby, that in their Heat (if they had
been able) they would have had them all deſtroyed.
But our Saviour Chriſt, diſliking ſuch fiery and raſh
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42183:57"/>
Zeal, rebuked them, and ſaid, <hi>You know not of what
ſpirit you are:</hi> that is, in effect, as if he ſhould have
ſaid, You may pretend <hi>Elias</hi>'s Fact, but you are far
from <hi>Elias</hi>'s Spirit. He only executed the Judgment
of God, as, by the Spirit, he was extraordinarily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected;
whereas Ye have received no ſuch direction,
but are only in your Paſſion and Heat ſtirred up to
Revenge.</p>
                  <p>The Concluſion hereof is, That Chriſt, our Lord, all
the time he remained here upon Earth, did not only,
in his own Perſon, ſhew himſelf obedient to civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
according to the ſaid fifth Commandment;
but did likewiſe utterly condemn, in others, (upon
every occaſion offered to him, throughout the Four
Evangeliſts) all inconſiderate Zeal, and Oppoſition,
againſt Temporal Magiſtracy. Inſomuch as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own ſaid Obedience, when he was apprehended
(notwithſtanding <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sword) he ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the publick Officer, that was then ſent for him:
and likewiſe being afterward carried to <hi>Pilate,</hi> (the
Civil Magiſtrate, at that time, under the Emperour)
and before him falſly charged, by his malicious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
with Treaſon; he behaved himſelf in ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
manner, as was fit and convenient for him, that
truly had profeſſed ſubjection, and did in no ſort ſeek
to decline his Power and Authority; either by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was not the Emperour's Subject, or that
<hi>Pilate</hi> was not his competent Judge, or by uſing any
other Tergiverſation or Evaſion: but acknowledged,
very freely, his ſaid Authority to be lawful, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf thereunto, did confeſs that it <hi>was given him
from above.</hi>

                  <p>'TIS many ways very plain and evident, that the
<hi>Jews</hi> did expound all thoſe places of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
which do notably ſet forth the ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Saviour Chriſt, to be meant of a temporal
Kingdom, which he ſhould erect upon the Earth. And
upon that falſe ground they did imagine, that when
their expected <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come into the World, he
was to advance them unto a glorious Eſtate here upon
Earth, and to reign in the midſt of them as a moſt
mighty and temporal Monarch. Which erroneous
conceit, when <hi>Herod</hi> heard of the Birth of Chriſt, made
him to fear leſt the new-born Babe ſhould deprive him,
of his Kingdom, and induced him thereupon to ſeek
his deſtruction. Thence alſo did proceed, that when
the People were ſo much moved with admiration of
one of Chriſts Miracles, as that they uſed theſe words,
<hi>This is of a truth the Prophet which ſhould come into the
World;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 6. 14, 15.</note> they preſently deviſed how they ſhould make
him their King. But Chriſt perceiving their drift, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
their purpoſe by departing from them; as well
obſerving and knowing, that their erroneous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him. Nay the better ſort of thoſe that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſt, were not free from this erroneous cogitation;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42183:59"/>
as it appeareth by the Petition,<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 21.</note> that the Mother of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedee</hi>'s
Children,<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 35, 41.</note> made unto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Grant that
theſe my two Sons may ſit, the one at thy right hand, and the
other at thy left hand, in thy Kingdom.</hi> It ſeemeth, by
St. <hi>Mark,</hi> that her ſaid two Sons, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> did
join with their Mother, and made likewiſe the ſame
Petition themſelves, unto Chriſt, in their own Names.
And it is plain, that the reſt of the Apoſtles, having
aſpiring Minds to have been great Men in the World,
(as dreaming of a Temporal Kingdom, that Chriſt
was in time, to eſtabliſh amongſt them) when they
heard this Suit, did begin, as the Evangeliſts teſtifie,
to diſdain at <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> for ſeeking, in that ſort,
to prefer themſelves before them; ſome of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
thinking themſelves more worthy of thoſe two
great Dignities, than either of them were. But our
Saviour Chriſt, finding theſe carnal Imaginations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, did throughly reprove them, for thoſe
their vain conceits; and did make it well known unto
them, how far they over-ſhot themſelves, when they
ſuppoſed that he ſhould become a Temporal King; or
that they themſelves ſhould be honoured by him with
Temporal Principalities. Which Courſe alſo our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt held,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 24.</note> when (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith) <hi>There aroſe a
ſtrife amongſt the Apoſtles, which of them ſhould be the
greateſt.</hi> For then, they perſiſting in their former Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
he did again renew his Reproof (if this were a
ſeveral contention from the former) ſaying unto
them, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles reign over them, and
they that bear rule over them, are called Benefactors,</hi> (as
uſing to reward their Servants with great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
worldly Preferments;)<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 25, 26.</note> or as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth
Chriſt's Words, (whether upon this, or the
former Occaſion mentioned, it is not greatly material,
becauſe they are all one in ſenſe) <hi>Ye know that the Lords

great, exerciſe authority over them: but</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42183:60"/>
ſhall not be ſo among you. But whoſoever will be
great among you, let him be your ſervant; even as the Son
of Man came not to be ſerved, but to ſerve:</hi> or as St.
<hi>Luke</hi> hath Chriſt's words, <hi>Ye ſhall not be ſo:</hi> that is, Ye
ſhall not live as Kings upon the Earth, nor have ſuch
worldly Eſtates, as that thereby ye might have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to vaunt in the World, what great Benefactors you
have been, in advancing your Followers, to this or

greater? he that ſitteth at the table, or he that ſerveth? Is
not he that ſitteth at the table? and I am among you as
he that ſerveth.</hi> By which words of our Saviour, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manifeſt, how far he was from challenging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
any worldly Kingdom; and how much his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were deceived, in apprehending what great Men
they ſhould become, by being his Followers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe much more might be here alledged
by us: as alſo, it would not be forgotten, what we
have before obſerved in the former Chapter, tending to
the ſame effect; in as much as Chriſt having made
himſelf ſubject to the Obedience of the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
which tied him as well to be a Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Emperour, under whom he was born, as to the
obedience of his Parents; did thereby ſhew himſelf to
be no temporal Monarch. Howbeit, all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
there are ſome ſo much addicted in theſe

they will needs have Chriſt to have been here upon the

poſſeſs them by any Right, Intereſt, or Title, until
they had again reſum'd them from him, as he was
Man, and forſaken their ancient Tenures, whereby
they had held them of him, as he was God."</q> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as ſome of them ſay in effect, that neither <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus
Caeſar,</hi> nor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> his Succeſſor, were lawful
Emperours, from the time of Chriſt's Birth for above
the ſpace of thirty years, until our Saviour had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>Jews</hi> to pay Tribute to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> as if in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Tiberius</hi> had again received thereby his former
right to the Empire; and that thereupon he was from
that time forward to hold it of Chriſt, as he was Man.
In which erroneous conceits theſe Men proceed further
than ever the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the Apoſtles in their weakneſs did.
For the <hi>Jews</hi> never imagin'd of their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that when
he came into the World he ſhould aboliſh all civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
amongſt the Gentiles, and be a temporal King
to Rule all Nations; or that as many Soveraign Kings
and Princes, as ſhould from that time forward deſire to
rule their Subjects by any lawful Power and Authority,
muſt receive and hold the ſame from (the ſaid <hi>Jews)</hi>
their temporal Kings: but did reſtrain their conceits
within more narrow bounds, thinking, that their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>
ſhould not have ſuch intermedling with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
but only reſtore the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which
had for a long time been miſerably ſhaken, and rent in
pieces, and live in that Country amongſt them in a
much more glorious form and ſtate, than any of their
Kings before him had done. And yet notwithſtanding,
theſe the ſaid Perſons, having inconſiderately ſo far
overrun the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Follies; are poſſeſſed never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
with ſome Imaginations (no doubt) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Pope doth either applaud, or wink at their
proceedings, they may in time make it probable to the
ſimpler ſort (who when force is to be uſed, do bear
the greateſt ſway) that as all Emperours and Kings,
forſooth, held their Kingdoms from Chriſt, as he then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42183:61"/>
was, and ſtill is Man; ſo ought they now in theſe days
to hold them of the Pope, in that (if Men might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe them) our Saviour Chriſt did (as they ſay)
after his Aſcenſion, beſtow all ſuch Worldly Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and conſequently upon his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that now all Worldly
Principalities are theirs, and muſt be held of them, as
they were before of Chriſt after his Incarnation, by as
many Kings and Princes as deſire to hold their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
by any right title.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are Men not to be feared; For to ſay the
truth of them, they are all of them in effect, either but
groſs and unlearned Canoniſts, or elſe but new upſtart
and ſottiſh <hi>Nerians,</hi> and of great affinity with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts;
who meaning (as it ſeemeth) to outſtrip the

Spiritual Soveraignty: whoſe endeavours are
altogether (as we ſuppoſe) to be contemned; in that
both the ſorts of them, as well Canoniſts as <hi>Nerians,</hi>
are more voluminous in their Writings than ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
filling them principally with very idle and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Canons and Decrees of the Pope's own making;
and having no true feeling, or ſenſe of Divinity, do
handle the Scriptures, when they have leiſure to come
unto them, with ſo foul and unwaſhed hands, as that
their Maſter either is, or ought to be aſhamed of them,
in that he permitteth their ſo abſurd Books to come
abroad into the World.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it will not a little hinder their credit (if it

ever had any ſuch temporal Authority,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de ſum. Pontif. l. 5.</note> or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as doth appertain unto Kings and Soveraign
Princes."</q> We will ſet down ſome words of one that
is of eſpecial Authority amongſt them; not becauſe
we intend to ground any thing upon them, but for that
they are true, and may perhaps be of more force than
ours are like to be with ſome kind of People; the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of whoſe hearts in the truth we tender as much
as we do our own. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Chriſt (ſaith he) did not take
Kingdoms from them whoſe they were; for Chriſt
came not to deſtroy thoſe things that were well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but to make them better. Therefore when a
King is become a Chriſtian, he doth not loſe his
Earthly Kingdom, but procureth a new Intereſt to
a Kingdom that is Eternal. Otherwiſe the benefit of
Chriſt ſhould be hurtful to Kings, and Grace ſhould
deſtroy Nature. And again; Chriſt, as he was Man,
whilſt he lived upon the Earth, neither did, nor
would receive any Temporal Dominion. And again,
I ſay, that Chriſt was always, as the Son of God, a
King and Lord of all Creatures, in ſuch ſort as his
Father is: but this Eternal and Divine Kingdom
doth not abolliſh the Dominions of Men. Again; I
affirm not (ſaith he) that Chriſt, as he was Man,
could not, though he would, and had thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for him, have received Regal Authority:
but yet I ſay, that he would not, and therefore that
he did not receive, nor had, not only the Execution of
any Lordſhip or Regality, but neither the Authority
or Power of any Temporal Kingdom. Again, Chriſt,
as he was Man, had no Temporal Kingdom, neither
by Inheritance nor by Election, nor by Conqueſt,
nor by any ſpecial Gift of God: and therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that Chriſt had no Temporal Kingdom at
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42183:62"/>
all; becauſe every ſuch Kingdom is gotten by one of
the ſaid four means. Again, ſaith he, Chriſt never uſed,
in this World, any Regal Power: He came to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and not to be miniſtred unto; to be judged,
and not to judge. And again; Regal Authority
was neither neceſſary nor profitable to Chriſt; but
plainly idle and unprofitable. For the End of his
coming into the World, was the Redemption of
Mankind: but to this end Temporal Power was not
neceſſary, but only Spiritual. Laſtly, All the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture almoſt, (ſaith he) where is a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Kingdom of Chriſt, ought neceſſarily to
be underſtood of his Spiritual and Eternal Kingdom:
and therefore it cannot be deduced out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
that Chriſt had any Temporal Kingdom."</q>
So as, in this Man's Judgment, neither St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for
his time, nor ſince, any of his Succeſſours, did ever
receive any Temporal Kingdoms from Chriſt, (he
himſelf being never poſſeſt of any, as he was Man)
either to retain, in their own hands, or to commit the
Execution of them, as in their Right, to other Kings
and Temporal Monarchs.</p>
                  <p>But to omit the further proſecution of this <hi>Loyoliſt</hi>'s
ſaid Poſitions, delivered truly in this point, more at
large, and proved by ſundry Arguments in his Book,
quoted by us: becauſe he is a Man (though he be a
<hi>Cardinal,</hi> and of great Eſtimation with his own Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety)
whoſe Credit ſeemeth to decay, eſpecially with
the ſaid Canoniſts, and others of that like Crew. For
if the reſt ſhall hereafter proceed with him, as One of
them hath already done (by perverting the whole
drift of his Diſputation, in that behalf, very childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and groſly) he will be driven, e'er it be long, to
range himſelf in the Troops of ſome, who are falſly
ſuppoſed Hereticks; in that the ſaid grave Canoniſt is
ſo couragious, as he dareth to adventure the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of a Curſe, of the greateſt nature, againſt him,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42183:62"/>
by name, even <hi>Anathema ſit,</hi> and therefore We will clear
our hands of him, and drawing to an end, in this
matter, leave the Concluſion of it unto Chriſt himſelf;
who knew his own Eſtate, when he lived here in the
World, as well as any Canoniſt, either by Birth of
<hi>Padua, Naples,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or of any other City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>It is true that our Saviour Chriſt, as ſoon as he was
born, was a Spiritual King, not only over the <hi>Jews,</hi>
but alſo over all Nations. And therefore, when at the
time of his Arraignment, before <hi>Pilate,</hi> though in ſcorn
the <hi>Jews</hi> termed him King, and that indeed he could
not truly have denied it; yet he did not equivocate
therein, but confeſſed unto them, what manner of
King he was. For <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaying unto him, <hi>Art thou
the King of the Jews?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 18. 36.</note> and telling him that <hi>the Jews and
High-Prieſts had delivered him into his hands; Jeſus</hi>
anſwered thus, <hi>My kingdom is not of this World: if my
kingdom were of this World, my Servants would ſurely
fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews: but now
is my kingdom not from hence.</hi> As if he ſhould have
ſaid, I am no Temporal King, nor have any Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kingdom, in this World: for if I had, my Subjects
(no doubt) would never have ſuffered me to come
to this diſtreſs: or if it had been my hap, ſo to have
been diſhonoured, as now I am; they would (out of
all doubt) have fought on my behalf, as all dutiful
Subjects are bound to do, when the Perſons of their
Sovereigns ſhall be in any danger. But my Kingdom
is of another Nature: it is no Temporal Kingdom;
either of this World, (that is, ſuch a Kingdom, as thoſe
who are Temporal Kings do poſſeſs) or from hence,
that is, my Kingdom requireth no worldly Aſſiſtance;
the World hath given me no Subjects, neither have I
any worldly Eſtate or Poſſeſſions; ſo as it might be
affirmed truly, either of me or of my Kingdom, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42183:63"/>
either for the Dignity of my Perſon, or the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my Government, I have any thing hence, that
is, from the World.</p>

                     <p>That our Saviour Chriſt in working our Salvation, whilſt he

great reſpect of them, in regard of their Authority; made
no new Laws when he expounded the old; erected no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

of God; omitting no one circumſtance, Ceremony, or
duty, undertaken voluntarily by him, which he did not very
throughly perform, even with the loſs of his Life.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS our Saviour Chriſt, whilſt he lived in the
World, did no way diſturb the civil ſtate, but
upon every fit occaſion did ſubmit himſelf unto it: So
may it be truly ſaid of him concerning the State Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical,
formerly by God himſelf eſtabliſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
ſtill among the <hi>Jews</hi> (though in a very corrupt
manner) that he did in every thing, thereunto by the
Law of God appertaining, conform himſelf unto it,
while it laſted: I ſay, while it laſted; becauſe upon
his Death there was a great alteration. According to
the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, then (whilſt he lived) in

<hi>ſubject to the fullfilling of the whole Law.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 12. 8.</note> Then (as the

to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be preſented to the Lord, and to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42183:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have an Oblation (ſuitable to their poor Eſtate) of a
pair of Turtle-Doves,<note place="margin">Exod. 13. 13.</note> or two Pigeons, offered to God
with the price of Redemption for him,<note place="margin">Num. 18. 16.</note> in that he was
a Manchild, and the firſt-born. There were no kind
of ſolemn Feaſts appointed by the Law, which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
not with his preſence according to the Law:
Nay he was pleaſed to be preſent at the Feaſt of the
<hi>Dedication of the Temple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 16.</note> which was inſtituted by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
Maccabaeus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 22, 23.</note> and his Brethren: as well to teach all
Poſterity, by his Example, what godly Magiſtrates
may ordain in ſuch kind of Cauſes; as alſo how things
ſo ordain'd, ought to be obſerved. And as he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
ſo did he celebrate and obſerve the chief
Feaſts of the <hi>Paſsover:</hi> omitting nothing, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the behalf of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or for our ſakes, he had
undertaken to perform. And although the Prieſts in
thoſe days were very far out of ſquare, and that our
Saviour Chriſt had very juſt cauſe in that reſpect to
have reprov'd them ſharply, as other Prophets had
often dealt with their Predeceſſors: yet he did ſo much
regard them, by reaſon of their Authority, unleſs he
ſhould otherwiſe have ſeem'd to have contemned both
them and it; as he did rather chooſe to let them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
their offences by Parables,<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 16.</note> than by any rough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion:
<note place="margin">—25. 28.</note> ſtill upholding them in their credits and
authority, as by the Law of God in that behalf it was
provided. When amongſt many other his wonderful

them go <hi>ſhow themſelves to their Prieſts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 4.</note> becauſe they
were appointed Judges by the Law to diſcern the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of that Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Mark 1. 44.</note> before the Parties (though indeed
healed of it) might intermingle themſelves with the
reſt of the People;<note place="margin">Luke. 5. 14.</note> and did further require them to
<hi>offer for their cleanſing thoſe things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">—17. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>which</hi> Moſes <hi>had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in testimonium illis;</hi> that is, that ſo the ſaid
Prieſts might plainly ſee, both that he was a Keeper of
the Law, and alſo, that he had healed them, and ſo be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42183:65"/>
driven to repent them of their incredulity, or at the
leaſt prevented thereby from ſlandering either him, as
a Breaker of the Law, or that which he had done for
them, as if he had not throughly healed them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it any way repugnant hereunto, that when our
Saviour Chriſt found chopping and changing,<note place="margin">John 2. 15.</note> by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſelling in the Temple, he made a Scourge of
ſmall Cords, and drave them thence with the Sheep,
Oxen, Doves, and Money-Bags; forbidding them to
<hi>make his Fathers Houſe an Houſe of Merchandiſe.</hi> For
he did not thereby, in any ſort, prejudice the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Prieſts (who ſhould chiefly have prevented
ſuch groſs abuſes, and traffick in the Temple) as if he
had done the ſame, either as a chief Prieſt, or a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
King (according to ſome Mens fond imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
by any Pontifical, or Regal Authority: but his
fact therein (howſoever it might ſhew the negligence
of the ſaid Prieſts) did only proceed from his Divine
Zeal, as he was a Prophet, and could not endure ſuch
an abominable profanation of God's Houſe: many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
before him having done matters very lawfully of
greater moment, through the like divine and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Zeal in them, without any impeachment of any
Power, either Regal or Pontifical. Howbeit, that our
Saviour Chriſt was oftentimes very vehement againſt
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> it is plain and manifeſt, when
joining them both together,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> he termed them <hi>ſerpents;</hi> the
<hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> and denounceth againſt them in one
Chapter eight Woes, concluding thus, <hi>How ſhould you
eſcape the damnation of Hell?</hi> The reaſon, that theſe
Curſes and hard cenſures were jointly laid upon them,
was becauſe they themſelves were joined together in
all kinds of Impiety and Malice againſt Chriſt; and
were neither of them, eſpecially the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> any
Plants of God's Plantation. For whilſt not only the
<hi>High-Prieſts</hi> were ſtill in Faction and Fury one againſt
another, as well for the getting, as the keeping that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42183:66"/>
high preferment; and that many of the inferiour
Prieſts were either ſiding amongſt themſelves for one
Party or other, or elſe more idle and negligent in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of their duties than they ought to have been;
theſe two Sects thruſt themſelves into the Church, and
through their Hypocriſy ſo prevail'd with the People
in ſhort time, as the Prieſts afterward either could not,
or would not be rid of them: becauſe on the one ſide
they thought it in vain to ſtrive with them, they were
ſo backed; and on the other ſide they found them ſo
diligent in diſcharging of thoſe duties, which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to themſelves, and withal ſo careful to uphold
the ſtate and authority of the Prieſthood. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"By means
whereof they grew very ſhortly into ſo great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">Joſ. Antiq. l. 18. c. 2.</note> that (as one writeth of the <hi>Phariſees)</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
did appertain to publick and ſolemn Prayers,
and to the worſhip of God, it was done according to
their interpretations, and as they preſcribed."</q> And
the <hi>Scribes</hi> being likewiſe Doctors, and Expounders of
the Law, and concurring ſtill with the interpretations,
and preſcriptions of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> came not by that
policy in their credits and reputation had of them, far
ſhort behind them. The diſtinction between them
may well be expreſt by comparing the <hi>Phariſees</hi> unto
the <hi>Divines</hi> amongſt our Adverſaries, who take upon
them to ſearch out more throughly the myſteries of the
Scriptures; and the Scribes to their <hi>Canonists,</hi> who in
reſpect of their ſaid Divines, are but Novices in God's
word, and Applauders to the Pope's Decrees, as the
<hi>Scribes</hi> were, being compar'd to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> in that
they held it for a principal part of their office, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and maintain, as much as they could, the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and did only take upon them to
deal with the bark and literal ſenſe of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the more profound knowledge and myſtical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of them unto the ſaid <hi>Phariſees.</hi> But the Iſſue
of the labours of both theſe Hypocritical Sects was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42183:66"/>
ſuch, as being blinded with their own devices, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
to be the ſpecialleſt Enemies that Chriſt found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth, and oppoſed themſelves moſt againſt him.
And yet notwithſtanding, becauſe he found them in ſo
great Authority, and perceived how the knowledge
of the Law, which ought to have been received from
the lips of the Prieſts, did then depend upon the lips
of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> he did neither blame them
for it, nor impugn the ſaid Authority. Inſomuch
as the multitude being many ways factious, and
(though very ignorant) were become great Queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
touching the Points of the Law; he referred
them, with a very good Caution, to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> to be inſtructed by them, ſaying, <hi>The Scribes
and Phariſees ſit in Moſes's ſeat: all therefore whatſoever
they bid you obſerve and do, that obſerve and do; but
after their works do not, for they ſay, and do not.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appeareth, how reſpectful our Saviour Chriſt
was for the free paſſage and obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
Law; in that he was content that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi>
(notwithſtanding he knew their Hypocriſie and
Corruption, and how they had come by that Authority,
which they then enjoyed) ſhould yet inſtruct the People
under them; ſo as the People did beware of their
wicked Converſation, and approved no reſolutions, that
they might receive from them, which were not firſt
proved unto them out of the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and were
fit to proceed from his Seat.</p>
                  <p>Touching which laſt point of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and how
nothing ought to have been taught out of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Seat,
but that, which <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the direction of the Holy
Ghoſt, had preſcribed; for as much as our Saviour
Chriſt did well ſee, and underſtand how the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> had, by their falſe Interpretations and Gloſſes,
perverted and corrupted the true ſenſe and meaning of
divers of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws, he was greatly moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and did take great pains to refute the ſaid falſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42183:67"/>
gloſſes and interpretations, and to reſtore to the Laws
mention'd their true ſenſe and original meaning.
Wherein, although by his ſtrict Expoſition of thoſe
Laws he might ſeem (to ſome not well advis'd) to
have ſo extended and enlarged the meaning of them,
as if he had thereby preſcribed ſome new points or laws
of greater perfection than were originally contain'd in
the true meaning of the old; yet we cannot find, how
either the ſaid points may otherwiſe be termed new,
than as Gold firſt purified and fined, after it hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in time grown ruſty, or been by falſe mixtures
cunningly corrupted, may be called new gold, when
it is again purged from the ſaid falſe mixtures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd;
Or how the obſervation of them can bring with
it to Men any greater perfection in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than God himſelf did expect of his Servants in
the Old Teſtament, by their obſerving of the ſaid Laws
(ſo expounded by Chriſt) in their ancient ſenſe and
meaning, which they firſt had, when by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Moſes</hi> did give them unto them. For if in proper
Speech he had made any new Laws, coming only to
fullfil the old, as himſelf in a true ſenſe affirmed, the
<hi>Jews</hi> might have had ſome good colour to have blamed
him; in that, during the continuance of their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Government, if any new Laws had been then
to have been made touching the worſhip of God, the
Authority in that behalf was limited by God himſelf
unto their own Church-Governours. Again, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the Son of God in taking our nature upon
him, did ſo make himſelf of no reputation, as being (of
his own goodneſs towards Mankind) a Servant to his
Father, he became (to do his will) <hi>obedient unto the
death, even the death of the Croſs;</hi> It cannot well be
imagined by any, that have any true underſtanding of
the Scriptures, that the Son of God, having ſo debaſed
himſelf (as is aforeſaid) did ever think in that his ſo
admirable humiliation, of any Rules, or new Laws of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42183:67"/>
greater perfection than he had before required and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
unto his true Servants and Children, as he was
God in Majeſty and Glory, without any ſuch Exinani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of. The obedience and
duty which Almighty God ever did, or ever will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of his Servants, was, and is always to proceed,
as well from their hearts, as from any other external
actions. Inſomuch, as if it fell out (as it may at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
that they cannot perform their ſaid duties, in
reſpect of ſome impediments that will hold them from
Chriſt: In that Caſe, be it riches, they are to leave
them; their Eyes, their Hands, or their Feet, they are
to cut them off; Nay be it their Blood, their Hearts,
and Lives, they are rather, than to forſake their God,
and his Chriſt, to yield them all in this World, with
what ignominy ſoever, to the end they may receive
them again with glory in the Kingdom of Heaven:
Than which great obedience and perfection, what can
be imagin'd greater? Or who is there in the World,
that truly profeſſeth Religion, who in that Caſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from it? Certainly, we think, none, of what
Eſtate and Condition ſoever they be; but do rather
hold, that as they, who ſhall yield up their Lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of any extraordinary perfection (ſaving
in the Caſe above-expreſſed) are far from that which
they make ſhew of, but are rather to be accounted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate;
ſo are they, in our Judgments, to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men of very extraordinary humours, and moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Perſons, if not ſuch counterfeit Hypocrites, as
were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in profeſſing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

It is not our purpoſe to proſecute all thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
mention'd in the Evangeliſts, wherein our Saviour
Chriſt ſhew'd his Obedience: there being in effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he did, which was not either figur'd in the
Law, or foretold by the Prophets, that he ſhould perform.
The time of his Incarnation, with the manner of it;
his Entertainment in the World; his diligence in
Preaching; his whipping, blows, and ſcorns offer'd
unto him; the Wounds of his hands, feet and ſide;
the beginning and progreſs of his Spiritual Kingdom;
the ſeveal duties appertaining to him, as he was a
Prophet, and likewiſe as he was our High-Prieſt, the
Inſtitution of Baptiſm, and of Chriſt's laſt Supper; his
Righteouſneſs and Mercy; his Death, with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it; his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of other points; they were all foreſeen, figur'd, and
deſcribed by the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures; and
were accordingly, with admirable Patience, Humility,
Obedience, Courage, Zeal and Alacrity executed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone,
and accompliſhed by him in ſuch manner and
ſort, with the obſervation of all neceſſary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and by ſuch degrees, as from the beginning were
limited and thought fit for ſo great a work. For all
things could not be done together by him, and at once.
Although after his Baptiſm he Preached moſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wrought ſtrange Wonders, and did chuſe, to aſſiſt
him, his Twelve Apoſtles, and Seventy Diſciples, who
did likewiſe preach, baptize, and wrought Miracles
in his Name: yet neither he, nor they did collect any
particular Church or Churches, apart from the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
of the <hi>Jews;</hi> but held Society and Communion
with them, in all things, that did belong to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Service and Worſhip of God: becauſe, until his
Paſſion, as well the Ceremonies of the Law, as the
<hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſthood, together with the Authority,
thereunto appertaining, were all of them in force; and
therefore it was not lawful, whilſt the Old Church did
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42183:68"/>
ſtand, to have erected a New. Moreover it is not to be
doubted, but that as before Chriſt's Incarnation there
were many faithful and godly Perſons, that believed in
Chriſt, to come, and by that their Faith were ſaved: ſo
there were many ſuch Believers, after his Incarnation,
who were likewiſe the Children of God, though they
were ignorant (for a time) that Chriſt, when he was
come, was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom they expected: none of
the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo believing, being in ſtate of Damnation, until
after they had ſeen Chriſt, heard him preach, been
preſent at his Miracles, or at the leaſt had received full
inſtruction of them all from his Apoſtles and Diſciples,
they did notwithſtanding reject him. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
the true Believers amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in thoſe
days, might not well have been diſtinguiſhed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and different Congregations or particular Churches,
without many great and apparent Inconveniencies, but
this Point is yet plainer, in that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
at that time, that Chriſt, whom they ſaw, and
heard, was the true <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> were, notwithſtanding,
ſubject to the Obedience of thoſe Ceremonial and Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Laws, which did concern them every one in his
Calling, which doth appear by the Examples of Chriſt
himſelf and his Apoſtles: who, although they were
baptized, did not ſever themſelves from the manner
of Worſhipping of God in thoſe times. Inſomuch as
firſt they did celebrate together the Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
before our Saviour Chriſt made them Partakers of
his laſt Supper. Neither is it to be queſtioned, but that
many, who did believe in Chriſt, (their and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our)
then amongſt them, had new born Children,
before his Paſſion, which were as well circumciſed as
baptized. For then, as Circumciſion was not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Baptiſm, no more was Baptiſm any Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Circumciſion, being both of them ſo united
together, and qualified, as they could not well be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
during the Continuance of the Levitical Law,
and Prieſthood.</p>

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:42183:69"/>
We grant, that upon our Saviour Chriſt's Birth, and
further proceedings in the execution of his Office, not
only the Jewiſh Ceremonies, but in like ſort their
Prieſthood began both of them to ſhake, and did, after
a ſort, draw near to their End: but until our Saviour
Chriſt ſaid upon the Croſs,<note place="margin">John 19. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and that the
<hi>vail was rent in twain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>from the top to the bottom,</hi> they
neither of them had utterly loſt their <hi>Levitical</hi> Natures,
Power and Authority, And therefore it muſt be held,
that although, by the preaching of our Saviour and of
his Apoſtles, many Mens hearts were drawn to believe
that Chriſt was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom they expected, and
that they were thereby made actually Partakers of
many of thoſe Mercies, which, by Figures, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
had been formerly ſet out unto them; as alſo,
that in regard thereof, they might be termed, in a right,
good ſenſe, the beginning of a New Church: yet did
they, neither in reſpect of their Faith and Baptiſm,
make any Separation, but were only the better part of
the old Church: nor might they, in regard of either of
them, have lawfully exempted themſelves from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of it. Which is further manifeſt by the words
of our Saviour Chriſt himſelf,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 15.</note> when he ſaith thus; <hi>If thy
Brother treſpaſs against thee, go, and tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thee and him alone. If he hear thee, thou haſt won thy
Brother. But if he hear thee not, take yet with thee one
or two, that, by the mouth of two or three Witneſſes, every
word may be confirmed. But if he will not vouchſafe to hear
them, tell it unto the Church.</hi> For by the Church, in
this place, the Eccleſiaſtical Courts eſtabliſh'd amongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> at that time, muſt (as we think) be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
there being then no other Courts, of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
amongſt them, which had any Authority to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
any ſuch obſtinate Perſons, as Chriſt there ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of. So as our Saviour Chriſt did here refer the
Parties, offended by ſome of their Brethren, to the ſaid
Eccleſiaſtical Courts; in the ſame reſpect and ſenſe,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42183:69"/>
and no otherwiſe, then he ſent the Lepers (whom he
had healed) to the Prieſts, according to the Law; or
when he referred the multitude to the <hi>Seribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi>
to be inſtructed by them, becauſe they <hi>ſate in
Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Chair.</hi> Beſides whatſoever is ſpoken by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,
of the <hi>Church that ſhould he built upon a Rock</hi>
ſo ſtrongly, as that the <hi>Gates of Hell ſhould not be able to
prevail againſt it;</hi> or of the Power and Authority <hi>to
bind and looſe,</hi> by Cenſures, or otherwiſe: that is no
way to be applied to the ſaid Church or <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi>
mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or to any particular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Chriſtians, either before the Paſſion of Chriſt,
or afterwards; but was only ſpoken and delivered, by
way of Prophecy, of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which, after
the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of our Saviour Chriſt,
ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the World, in a more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and univerſal ſort, than formerly it had been.
And yet we do not deny, but that Chriſt, in the ſaid
words, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> meaning the <hi>Jews</hi> Courts, or
<hi>Sanhedrims,</hi> might very well inſinuate, in that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not thoſe Courts by their own Names, but termed
them the <hi>Church,</hi> that, in ſuch caſes as there are by
him mentioned, the Chriſtians, in time to come, ſhould
accordingly repair unto their Eccleſiaſtical Courts, to
be eſtabliſhed among them throughout the Chriſtian
World, for Reformation of Offenders, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Points of Religion; as the <hi>Jews</hi> of all ſorts
(whether Believers or not) were bound, until the
Death of Chriſt, to repair to their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drims,</hi>
if either they meant to be truly inſtructed in
the Laws, or to have ſuch manner of Offences lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
puniſhed by thoſe kind of Cenſures, that Chriſt, in
the ſaid place, ſpeaketh of.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhould we inſiſt ſo much upon this point,
to prove that all the <hi>Jews,</hi> that either believed in Chriſt,
or did reject him, were bound (before the Paſſion of
our Saviour Chriſt) to be obedient to the Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42183:70"/>
Governours, eſtabliſhed, by God himſelf, in that viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church: conſidering how careful our Saviour Chriſt
was, upon every occaſion offered, for the preſervation
of their Authority, whilſt it was to endure, and with
what Humility he did ſubmit himſelf unto it? For
being ſent for by them, he was content, at that time,
to go unto them, and to be examined by them; when
he had found them many ways before to be his mortal
Enemies: and knew how at that preſent, they were
plotting to take away his Life, by corrupting of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
to betray him into their hands, and by ſuborning
of falſe Witneſſes to accuſe him: as alſo, how, after
they had examined him, they would uſe him moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully
and ſcornfully, ſpit in his Face, and buffet
him, beat him with Rods, carry him bound as a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,
and deliver him to <hi>Pilate</hi> the Civil Magiſtrate;
Likewiſe how they themſelves would be his Accuſers;
how they would practiſe with the People to prefer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas</hi>'s
liberty (being a Murtherer) before his, and to
cry out with them, to <hi>Pilate, Let him be crucified, Let
him be crucified; Crucify him, Crucify him;</hi> their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Fury being ſo bent againſt him, as that they
themſelves would have put him to death, if by the
Laws of the <hi>Romans</hi> (whereunto they were then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
they might have been permitted ſo to have done.</p>

                     <p>That our Saviour Chriſt, after his Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
did not alter the form of temporal Government,
eſtabliſht by himſelf long before his Incarnation: and
that therefore Emperours, Kings, and Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
though they were then Infidels, were nevertheleſs to
be obey'd by the Subjects, as formerly from the beginning
they had been.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT hath been before obſerv'd by us, that our Saviour
Chriſt, whilſt he lived in the World, was no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
King, nor had any temporal Dominion, Court,
Poſſeſſions, Regal State, Dukes, Earls, Lords, or any
other Subjects, as other temporal Kings had, to obey
and ſerve him. But perhaps after his Reſurrection, it
was for otherwiſe with him. Indeed ſo it was; For
whereas the Son of God, God himſelf, equal to the
Father, by being made Man, did ceaſe to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
the Glory and Majeſty of his Deity in his humane
Nature, otherwiſe than by doing ſuch Miracles as he
thought neceſſary for the Converſion of thoſe who
were to believe in him: Now after his Reſurrection
and Aſcenſion, the ſtate of his humane Nature was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
(as it may well be ſaid) much more glorious;
becauſe his Divine Nature did communicate unto his
Humane Nature. So many divine Dignities and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of his Deity (in reſpect of the hypoſtatical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
betwixt them) as the ſame was capable of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
turning of his Divine Nature into his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
It being always to be underſtood, that the ſaid
hypoſtatical and real Union, notwithſtanding there
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42183:73"/>
was never any Confuſion betwixt the two Natures of
Chriſt; both of them always retaining their diſtinct
and eſſential Proprieties. Which ground obſerv'd, we
may truly ſay, that the Attributes are admirable, which
in regard of the ſaid Union are and may be aſcribed
unto our Saviour Chriſt, as he is Man; eſpecially after
his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion. For ſome ſhort proof
hereof theſe following Places may ſuffice. Before our
Saviour Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles <hi>to go and teach
all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> he told them, (leſt they ſhould
have doubted whether he had any Authority to make
them ſo large a Commiſſion) <hi>that all power was given
him in Heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and in Earth.</hi> He alſo was before (as

things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 2.</note> and ſo had a true Intereſt in them; and after his
Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2. 9.</note> had the full poſſeſſion of them. <hi>We ſee
Jeſus</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>crown'd with glory and honour.</hi>
And again,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 20, 21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>When God raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, he
ſet him at his right hand, in heavenly places, far above all
Principality and Power, and Might and Domination,
and every Name that is named not in this world only, but in
that alſo which is to come; and hath made all things ſubject
under his feet.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 15.</note> And again, <hi>The kingdoms of this world are our

                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit, all that we have hitherto ſaid notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
though all the World doth actually appertain
to our Saviour Chriſt (now in Glory) as he is Man, in
reſpect of the ſaid Unition, or hypoſtatical Union: yet
did he not alter, after his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, the
manner of temporal Government, which he had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
throughout the World before his Incarnation, as he
was God (his humane Nature being inveſted by the
power of his Divinity in manner before expreſt with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42183:74"/>
all his ſaid Glory, and Authority:) but doth ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the ſole Monarch over all; diſtributing that his
univerſal Kingdom, as formerly he had done, into divers
Principalities and Kingdoms, and appointing temporal
Kings and Soveraign Princes, as his Subſtitutes and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
to rule them all by the Rules and Laws of Nature,
if they be <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> or if <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> then not only by
thoſe Rules, but alſo as well by the Equity of the Judicial
Laws, which he gave to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as by the Doctrine of
the Goſpel, more throughly opened and delivered with
all the parts of it, by himſelf and his Apoſtles, than in
former times it had been. Of Chriſtian Kings, we ſhall
have fitter place to ſpeak hereafter. Now we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
this point, concerning the Regal Authority of
Princes that are Infidels, and conſider more particularly,
Whether they did not, and ſo conſequently do not ſtill,
as lawfully enjoy their Kingdoms and legal Soveraignties
under our Saviour Chriſt, after his Reſurrection
and Aſcenſion, as they did before, either of them; and
likewiſe as they did before his Incarnation; according
to that which we have delivered in the former Chapter.

ſupported by all the Learned Men (as we ſuppoſe)
of his Society; and ſufficient to refel the Vanity of the
<hi>Canoniſts,</hi> and their Fellows in that folly. For if we
ſhould inſiſt herein upon the Authority of Men, all
the ancient Fathers do fully concur with us: that
through the whole courſe of the Scriptures, Obedience
was, and is as well preſcribed in the Old Teſtament to
Ethnick Princes, as unto the Kings of <hi>Judah:</hi> and ſo
likewiſe in the New Teſtament, as well to Infidel Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as Chriſtian: the Precepts of the Apoſtles in that
behalf being general, and ſo to be applied, as well to
the one ſort as to the other; in that they hold their
Kingdoms of Chriſt equally (as is aforeſaid) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to be equally obeyed by their Subjects, with
that general Caution which was ever underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi>
in thoſe things which they commanded them, and
were not repugnant to the Commandments of God.
And therefore the Judgments of the ancient Fathers,
being in this ſort only remember'd by us, we will not
much inſiſt upon them; but give that honour which is
due (eſpecially in a matter ſo apparent) unto the ſole
Authority of the Holy Apoſtles; who writing by the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42183:75"/>
direction of the Holy Ghoſt, thoſe things which Chriſt
himſelf before had taught them, do give unto all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
and Subjects, to what manner of Kings ſoever,
theſe Precepts following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>

For Princes are not to be feared for good
works, but for evil. Wilt thou then be without
fear? Do well: So ſhalt thou have praiſe of the

But if thou do evil, fear; for he beareth not the
Sword for nought: for he is the Miniſter of God to
take Vengeance of him that doth evil. Wherefore
ye muſt be ſubject, not becauſe of wrath only, but
alſo for Conſcience ſake. For this cauſe ye pay alſo
Tribute: for they are God's Miniſters, applying
themſelves for the ſame thing."</q> In which words of
the Apoſtle, in ſaying, that Princes have their Power
from God, and that he is God's Miniſter; there is no
repugnancy to that which we have aboveſaid, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great honour and dignity of the humanity of
our Saviour Chriſt, after his Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
to prove that Kings do hold their Kingdoms under
Chriſt, as he is Man, the Lamb of God, and Heir of
all the World. For we were very careful to have it
ſtill remembred, that all the ſaid Power and Dignity
which he hath, as he is Man, doth proceed from his
Divinity: and likewiſe, that by reaſon of the real U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the two Natures in our Saviour Chriſt, that
which doth properly belong to the one nature, may
very truly be affirmed of the other. So as it may, in
that reſpect, be very well ſaid, and truly; that all
Kings and Princes receive their Authority from Chriſt,
as he is Man; and likewiſe, that they receive their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42183:76"/>
Authority from Chriſt, as he is God: and that they
are the Miniſters of Chriſt, being Man; and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of God, without any limitation. But it is plain,
that the ſaid words of the Apoſtle do very throughly
refute the vanity mentioned of the Canoniſts, and
their new Companions: in that by the ſaid words it
appeareth very manifeſtly, That Kings do not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
hold their Kingdoms of the humanity of Chriſt,
than they did before of his divine nature. They have
their Authority (ſaith the Apoſtle) from God; and
they are God's Miniſters. And there is nothing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
either by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or by any other of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
which ſwerveth in any point from this Doctrine,

was ſo great, as ſome have imagined. For as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

firſt Place, and were appointed to exerciſe the Office of
Highprieſts; and under their ſoveraign Princes and
temporal Governours, (as we have ſhewed in our ſaid
firſt Book, cap. 18.) did bear the chief ſway in matters
appertaining to God. Next unto <hi>Aaron</hi> there were 24.
Prieſts of an inferiour Degree, that were termed <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
Sacerdotum,</hi> that governed the third ſort of Prieſts,
allotted unto their ſeveral Charges: and this third ſort
alſo had the reſt of the <hi>Levites</hi> at their direction. In
like manner theſe <hi>Levites</hi> neither wanted their chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to order them, according as the ſaid third ſort of
Prieſts did command (which Rulers were termed <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes
Levitarum,</hi> in number 24.) Nor their Aſſiſtants the
<hi>Gabionites,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Nethinaei,</hi> to help them in the
Execution of their baſer Offices. Of this notable Form of
Eccleſiaſtical Government, it may be truly ſaid in our
Judgments, That the ſame being of God's own framing,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42183:80"/>
it is to be eſteem'd the beſt and moſt perfect Form of
Church-Government, that ever was, or can be deviſed:
and that Form alſo is beſt to be approved and upheld,
which doth moſt reſemble it, and cometh neareſt unto
it.</p>
                  <p>We ſaid upon a fit Occaſion,<note place="margin">l. 2. c. 4.</note> That by the Death of
our Saviour Chriſt, the Church-Government then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> was greatly altered: and therefore do
think it very convenient in this place more fully therein
to ſet down our meaning. It is very true, that before
the Death of Chriſt, the outward Service of God did
much conſiſt in Figures, Shadows, and Sacrifices; the
<hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood itſelf (as it was to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his
Stock, and in ſome other Reſpects) being only a Type
of our High Prieſt, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But afterward, when
by his Paſſion upon the Croſs he had fulfilled All, that
was ſignified by the ſaid Figures, Shadows, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
and had likewiſe not only aboliſhed them, but
freed the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> of the charge of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and removed the High Prieſthood (as it was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical)
from the ſaid Prieſtly Tribe, unto the Regal
Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> the ſame being now ſetled in himſelf,
our only High Prieſt, according to the Order, not of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchizedech:</hi> He hath by that his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
of the Prieſthood,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 12.</note> freed his Church from the
Ceremonial Law,<note place="margin">—10. 10.</note> which contained in it little but Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns,
Shadows, and Figures of that one Sacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
by him upon the Croſs,<note place="margin">—9. 14.</note> which doth <hi>ſanctifie all the
faithful, and purge their Conſciences from dead works to
ſerve the living God.</hi> Nevertheleſs in this ſo great an
alteration, although all the ſaid Figures, Shadows, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
and whatſoever elſe was typical in the true
Worſhip of God, and Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> were truly
fulfilled, and had their ſeveral Accompliſhments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Natures of them. Yet we are further to
underſtand, that as from the beginning there was a
Church, ſo there was ever a Miniſtry; the Eſſential
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42183:81"/>
parts of whoſe Office (howſoever otherwiſe it was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with Ceremonies) did conſiſt in theſe three Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<hi>viz.</hi> (1.) Preaching of the Word. (2.) Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Sacraments: and (3.) Authority of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Government: and that none of all the ſaid Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
Shadows, and Sacrifices, or any other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law had any ſuch relation to any
of the ſaid three Eſſential Parts of the Miniſtry, as if
either they the ſaid three Eſſential Parts of the Miniſtry
had only been ordain'd for their continuance until the
coming of Chriſt; or that the accompliſhment or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the ſaid Ceremonies had in any ſort prejudiced
or impeached the Continuance of them, or any of them.
So as the ſaid three Eſſential Parts of the Miniſtry were in
no ſort aboliſhed by the Death of Chriſt; but only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
from the Prieſthood under the Law to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the New Teſtament: Where, in the judgment
of all Learned Men, oppoſite in divers points one to
another, they do or ought for ever to remain to the
ſame End and Purpoſe for the which they were firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the two firſt Eſſential Parts of this
our Miniſtry, or Prieſthood of the New Teſtament,
there are no Difficulties worthy the inſiſting upon, how
they are to be uſed. Only the third Eſſential Part of it,
as touching the Power of Eccleſiaſtical Regiment, is
very much controverted, and diverſly expounded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and applied. For ſome Men, relying upon
one Extremity, do affirm, That it was in the Apoſtles
time radically inherent only in St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and ſo, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
conſequence, afterwards in his ſuppoſed Vicar the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be derived from St. <hi>Peter</hi> firſt to the reſt
of the Apoſtles and other Miniſters, while he lived,
and then after his Death, in a fit proportion to all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Paſtors, and Miniſters to the end of the World
from the Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi> and that St. <hi>Peter</hi> during
his time, and every one of his Vicars, the Biſhops of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42183:81"/>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſſively, then did, and ſtill do occupy and
enjoy the like Power and Authority over all the
Churches in the World, that <hi>Aaron</hi> had in the Church
eſtabliſhed amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> There are alſo another
ſort of Perſons, that run as far to another extremity,
and do challenge the ſaid Power and Authority of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Regiment to appertain to a new Form of
Church-Government by <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> to be placed in
every particular Pariſh: Which Presbyteries (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them ſay) are ſo many compleat and perfect
Churches; no one of them having any dependency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other Church: So as the Paſtor in every ſuch
Presbytery, repreſenting after a ſort <hi>Aaron</hi> the High
Prieſt; there would be by this project (if it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)
as many <hi>Aarons</hi> in every Chriſtian Kingdom,
as there are particular Pariſhes. And the Authors of
both theſe ſo different, and extream conceits, are all of
them moſt reſolute and peremptory, that they are able
to deduce and prove them out of the Form of Church-Government,
which was eſtabliſhed by God himſelf
in the Old Teſtament. Howbeit, notwithſtanding all
their vaunts and ſhews of Learning, by perverting the
Scriptures, Councils, and ancient Fathers; the Mean
betwixt both the ſaid extreams is the truth, and to be
embraced: <hi>viz.</hi> That the adminiſtration of the ſaid
Power of Eccleſiaſtical Regiment under Chriſtian Kings
and ſupream Magiſtrates, doth eſpecially belong, by
the Inſtitution of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles, unto Arch-Biſhops
and Biſhops: This Mean bearing the true Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture,
and infallible Lineaments of God's own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
above-mentioned; and containing in it divers
Degrees of Prieſts, agreeable to the very order and
light of Nature; ſome ſuperiour to rule, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to be ruled, as in all other Societies and civil
States it hath been ever accuſtomed. So as we are bold
to ſay, and are able to juſtify it, That as our Saviour
Chriſt, as he is God, had formerly ordain'd in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42183:82"/>
Church amongſt the <hi>Jews, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> of
an inferiour Order, to teach them in every City and
Synagogue; and over them Prieſts of a ſuperiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
termed <hi>Principes Sacerdotum;</hi> and laſtly, above
them all, one <hi>Aaron</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to rule and direct
them: So he, no ways purpoſing by his Paſſion more
to abrogate or prejudice this Form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ordain'd by himſelf, than he did thereby the
temporal Government of Kings and Sovereign Princes;
did by the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, and Miniſtry
of his Apoſtles, ordain in the New Teſtament, that
there ſhould be in every National Church, ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of an inferiour degree, to inſtruct his People in
every particular Parochial Church or Congregation;
and over them Biſhops of a ſuperiour degree, to have a
care and inſpection over many ſuch Parochial Churches
or Congregations; for the better ordering, as well of
the Miniſters as of the People within the limits of their
Juriſdiction: And laſtly, above them all Archbiſhops,
and in ſome eſpecial places Patriarchs; who were firſt
themſelves, with the advice of ſome other Biſhops, and
when Kings and Sovereign Princes became Chriſtians,
then with their eſpecial aid and aſſiſtance, to overſee
and direct, for the better Peace and Government of
every ſuch National Church, all the Biſhops, and the
reſt of the particular Churches therein eſtabliſhed. And
for ſome proof hereof, We will conclude this Chapter
with the teſtimony of one of no mean account and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert:
Who (when Archbiſhops and Biſhops did moſt
obſtinately oppoſe themſelves, as being the Pope's Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
to the Reformation of the Church) was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Deviſer of the ſaid Presbyteries (though not in
ſuch a manner as ſome have ſince with too much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
urged) whereof, out of all Queſtion, he would
never have dream'd, if the ſaid Biſhops had not been ſo
obſtinate, as they were, for the maintenance of ſuch
Idolatry and Superſtition, as were no longer to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated.

                     <p>That the Form of Church-Government, which was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and the Evangeliſts ſuperiour to Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours:
And that the Apoſtles knowing themſelves to be

the ſaid form of Government in other Perſons; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral Miniſters in ſundry Cities, and over them
Biſhops; as alſo over ſuch Biſhops certain worthy Perſons
ſuch as Titus was, who were afterward termed Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;
to whom they did commit ſo much of their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Authority, as they held then neceſſary, and was to
be continued for the Government of the Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE had in our former Book the Scriptures at
large, containing the Hiſtories and Doctrine
both of the Law and the Goſpel, after the manner that
was then preſcribed, from the time of the Creation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the days of the Prophet <hi>Malachy;</hi> that is, for above
3500. years: Whereupon we did ground the particular
Points by us therein handled, concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as well Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal. And for the
Supply of the other years following till the Incarnation
of our Saviour Chriſt, we obſerved ſome things to the
ſame purpoſe out of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, ſecond to
the Scriptures, and to be preferr'd before all other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of thoſe times. But now foraſmuch as the New
Teſtament is but, in effect, a more ample Declaration
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42183:84"/>
the Old; ſhewing withal, how the ſame was moſt
throughly fulfilled by our Saviour Chriſt (without the
impeachment of any kind of Government, by himſelf
ordain'd, as before we have expreſt) and becauſe the
Books of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles do only contain
the Acts and Doctrine of our Saviour Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
with the Form and Uſe both of the Temporal
and Eccleſiaſtical Government, during the time whilſt
they lived here upon the Earth; (St. <hi>John,</hi> who lived
the longeſt of them all, dying about ſixty ſix Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt's Paſſion:) although the Holy Ghoſt did
judge the ſaid Books and Writings ſufficient for the
Church and all that profeſs Chriſtianity, to teach and
direct them in thoſe things which ſhould appertain ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to their Temporal or Eccleſiaſtical Government,
or ſhould be neceſſary unto their Salvation: Yet for the
ſaid Reaſons, we were induced, for the upholding of
the Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical Government in the
New Teſtament, to inſiſt ſo much as we have done
upon the Precedents and Platforms of both thoſe kinds
of Governments eſtabliſhed in the Old Teſtament;
albeit we want no ſufficient Teſtimonies in the New to
ratify and confirm as well the one as the other.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, therefore we do verily think, That if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Chriſt or his Apoſtles had meant to have erected
in the Churches amongſt the Gentiles any other Form
of Eccleſiaſtical Government than God himſelf had ſet
up amongſt the <hi>Jew:</hi> they would have done it aſſuredly
in very ſolemn manner, that all the World might have
taken publick notice of it: conſidering with what Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and Authority the ſaid Form was erected at God's
Commandment by his Servant <hi>Moſes.</hi> But in that they
well knew how the Form of the Old Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in ſubſtance, was ſtill to continue and to be, in
time, eſtabliſh'd in every National Kingdom and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Principality amongſt Chriſtians, as ſoon as they
ſhould become for number ſufficient Bodies and ample
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42183:85"/>
Churches to receive the ſame; as before the like oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
it was not eſtabliſhed amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> they
did in the mean while, and as the time did ſerve them,
attempt the erecting of it in ſuch ſort, and by ſuch fit
and convenient Degrees, as by the direction of the
Holy Ghoſt, they held it moſt expedient, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion,
till ſuch time as the work was (in effect)
accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>It hath been before touched, how our Saviour Chriſt
here upon Earth, did not only chuſe to himſelf, for the
buſineſs he had in hand, twelve Apoſtles, who were
then deſign'd, in time to come, to be the Patriarchs and
chief Fathers of all Chriſtians, with ſome Reſemblance
(as it hath been ever held) of the twelve Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
who had been in their days the Patriarchs and chief
Fathers of all the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> But likewiſe he took unto
him (over and beſides his ſaid Apoſtles, 70, or as ſome
read 72 Diſciples, to be in the ſame manner his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
in imitation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he choſe 70. Elders
to be helpers unto him, for the better Government of
the People committed to his charge. None of theſe,
either Apoſtles or Diſciples, had then any other Duties
committed to them, but only of Preaching and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing:
for the Power of Eccleſiaſtical Regiment they
might not then intermeddle with, becauſe it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to the Prieſts, and Courts of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
that want, and ſome other defects in them,
were throughly ſupplied, when our Saviour Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Reſurrection, and a little before his Aſcenſion,
enlarging their Commiſſion, did commit unto his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
the Adminiſtration of the Keys of the Kingdom
of Heaven; and ſhortly after furniſhed, not only them,
but the ſaid Diſciples alſo (according to their ſeveral
Functions) moſt abundantly with all ſuch Gifts, and
Heavenly Graces, as were neceſſary for them in thoſe
great Affairs which were impoſed upon them. Whereby
we find already two compleat Degrees of Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42183:85"/>
Miniſters, ordained by Chriſt himſelf immediately;
<hi>viz.</hi> His 12. Apoſtles, and his 70. Diſciples; the one
in Dignity and Authority above the other, the Diſciples
in that reſpect being termed <hi>Secondary Apoſtles;</hi> and
were the ſame (as 'tis moſt probably held) who were
afterward called Evangeliſts. We will not intermeddle
with the Prophets in thoſe times, of whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
make mention; becauſe divers of them were no
Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments, of whom only
we have here taken upon us to intreat; leaving in like
manner the ſaid 70. Diſciples, or Evangeliſts, as before
they had been aſſiſtants unto Chriſt, ſo now to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by his Apoſtles. Touching whoſe bleſſed calling
it is to be obſerved, that the end of it was not, that
they ſhould only for their own times, by Preaching
the Word, Adminiſtring the Sacraments, and likewiſe
by their Authority of Eccleſiaſtical Regiment, draw
many to the embracing of the Goſpel, and afterward
to rule and order them, as that they might not eaſily be
drawn again from it: but were in like ſort to provide
for a Succeſſion in their Miniſtry, of fit Perſons, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
Authorized by them, to undertake that charge,
and as well to yield ſome further aſſiſtance unto them,
whilſt they themſelves lived, as afterward; alſo, both to
continue the ſame, in their own Perſons, unto their
lives end; and in like manner to ordain, by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Apoſtles, given unto them, other Miniſters
to ſucceed themſelves: that ſo the ſaid Apoſtolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
being derived in that ſort from one to another,
there might never be any want of Paſtors and Teachers,
<hi>for the work of the Miniſtry, and for the Edification of the
Body of Chriſt,</hi> unto the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>This being the duty of the ſaid Apoſtles, and that
it may be evident what it was, which they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unto the Miniſtry; it is to be obſerved, that
ſome things in the Apoſtles were eſſential and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and was the ſubſtance of their Miniſtry, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42183:86"/>
the three Eſſential Parts before mentioned, of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
adminiſtring the Sacraments, and of Eccleſiaſtical
Government; and that ſome were but perſonal and
temporary, granted unto them for the better ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and approving of the ſaid Miniſtry with all the
Parts of it; there being then many Difficulties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
which did many ways hinder the firſt
Preaching and Plantation of the Goſpel. In the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the ſaid perſonal or temporary Gifts or Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
theſe may be accounted the Chief. (1.) That
they were called immediately by Chirſt himſelf, to lay
the Foundation of Chriſtian Faith among the Gentiles.
(2.) That their Commiſſion to that purpoſe was not
limited to any Place or Country. (3.) That they had
power, through Impoſition of their hands, to give the Holy
Ghoſt by viſible Signs. (4.) That they were directed
in the performance of their Office by the eſpecial Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Holy Ghoſt: and laſtly, That their
Doctrine which they deliver'd in Writing, was to be
a Canon and Rule to all Churches for ever. All
which perſonal Prerogatives, although they did
then appertain, and were then adherent to the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Apoſtolick Function, and were neceſſary,
at the firſt, for the eſtabliſhing of the Goſpel; yet it is
plain, that they did not contain in them any of the ſaid
Eſſential Parts of the Miniſtry, and likewiſe that they
could not be communicated by the Apoſtles unto any
others. So as either the Apoſtles, for the Propagation
and Continuance of the Ecceleſiaſtical Miniſtry, did
communicate to others the ſaid three Eſſential Parts
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Power to Preach, to Adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Authority of Government: wherein muſt
be Degrees, ſome to direct, and ſome to be directed,
or elſe they died all with them, which were a very
wicked and an idle conceit; the Apoſtles having Power
to communicate them all alike, as by their Proceedings
it will appear. At the firſt, they themſelves with the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42183:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Evangeliſts, and ſo many of the Prophets as were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Word and Sacraments, after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
many to the Faith; did execute in their own
Perſons, agreeably to their ſeveral Callings, all thoſe
Eccleſiaſtical Functions, as were afterward of neceſſity,
and in due time to be diſtinguiſhed, and ſetled in ſome
others. Whereby it came to paſs, that the Church in
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> during that time, had no other Deacons,
Prieſts, nor Biſhops, but the Apoſtles, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
and the ſaid Prophets. But afterwards the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
growing great, as to disburthen themſelves of
ſome charge, they Ordained Deacons; So their own
Company, Apoſtles, Diſciples, or Evangeliſts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
coming ſhort of that number of Labourers
which the ſaid Harveſt required; they did for their
future aid, chuſe unto themſelves, by the Inſpiration
of the Holy Ghoſt, certain other new Diſciples and
Scholars, ſuch as they found meet for that work; and
after ſome good experience had of them, made them by
<hi>the Impoſition of their</hi> hands,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 6.</note> Prieſts and Miniſters of
the Goſpel; but did not for a time tie them to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places, as having deſign'd them to be their
Fellow-Labourers, and Coadjutors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Men the Apoſtles had commonly in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and did not employ their Pains and diligent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the ſpeedier Propagation of the Goſpel, (which
was their firſt and moſt Principal Care) but likewiſe did
uſe to ſend them hither and thither (their Occaſions ſo
requiring) to the Churches already planted, as their
Meſſengers and Legates, ſufficiently authorized for the
diſpatching of ſuch Affairs as were committed unto
them.<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 21.</note> Of this number were <hi>Timothy, Titus, Marcus,
Epaphroditus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Sylvanus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philem. 1. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Andronicus,</hi> and divers others;
who in reſpect of ſuch their Apoſtolical Employments,
and becauſe alſo the Apoſtles did oftentimes commend
them greatly, and join'd their Names with their
own in the beginnings of ſundry their Epiſtles to divers
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42183:87"/>
Churches,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 7.</note> were Men of great Reputation and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
amongſt all Chriſtians in thoſe days,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 23.</note> and had the
name it ſelf of Apoſtles given unto them,<note place="margin">Phil 2. 25.</note> as formerly
it hath been obſerv'd of the 70. Diſciples. And theſe
were the Perſons, who were afterward, when they
were tied to the overſight of divers particular Churches
or Congregations, termed Biſhops, as it will afterward
appear. Now becauſe theſe Apoſtolical Perſons were
ſtill to attend upon the Apoſtles, and their Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as is above mentioned; and for that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Chriſtians every where did ſtill encreaſe, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
held it neceſſary to ordain, by impoſition of their
hands, a ſecond degree of Miniſters, who were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſtill to remain in the particular Churches or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
that were already planted in divers Cities
(for in thoſe populous places Churches were firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
whilſt the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and Prophets,
that were Miniſters, with their Coadjutors, were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
from place to place, as the Holy Ghoſt did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them, to plant and order other Churches in other
Cities elſewhere, as God ſhould bleſs their labours.</p>
                  <p>The office of this ſecond degree of Miniſters was by
Preaching and Adminiſtring the Sacraments, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and encreaſe, to their utmoſt ability, the number
of Chriſtians in thoſe Cities, where they kept their
reſidence; and likewiſe in the abſence of the Apoſtles,
by their common and joint counſel, to adviſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
every particular Congregation, and Member of it,
as well as they could, when any difficulties did occur.
Beſides, it appertained unto them by Preaching of the
Goſpel, and of the Law, and upon Conference with
ſuch as were Penitent, to bind and looſe Mens Sins,
and to keep back from receiving the holy Communion,
ſuch as were notorious and obſtinate Offenders, until
either willingly by their perſwaſion, or afterwards by
the Apoſtles further Chaſtiſements, they were brought
to Repentance. Only they wanted Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42183:87"/>
of Ordination to make Miniſters,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 23.</note> and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Keys to Excommunicate.<note place="margin">2 Tim 1. 6.</note> For the Apoſtles had
reſerv'd in their own hands thoſe two Prerogatives,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 14.</note>
and were themſelves (during thoſe firſt times,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 21.</note> now
ſpoken of by us) not ſo far from the ſaid Cities,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 2.</note> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 3, 5</note> and Miniſters, but that they well might, and did
throughly ſupply all their wants whatſoever, and alſo
ſet an order in all matters of difficulty, when they fell
out amongſt them, concerning either Doctrine or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,
ſometimes themſelves in their own Perſons,
and ſometimes by their Letters, or Meſſengers, as the
importance of thoſe Cauſes did require. In theſe times
it may well be granted, that there was no need of any
other Biſhops but the Apoſtles, and likewiſe, that then
their Churches, or particular Congregations in every
City, were adviſed and directed touching points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in manner and form aforeſaid, by the common
and joint advice of their Prieſts or Miniſters. In which
reſpect, the ſame Perſons who then were named Prieſts
or Miniſters, were alſo in a general ſenſe called Biſhops.
Howbeit this courſe dured not long, either concerning
their ſaid common direction, or their names of Biſhops
ſo attributed unto them; but was ſhortly after order'd
far otherwiſe, by a common Decree of the Apoſtles, to
be obſerv'd in all ſuch Cities where particular Churches
were planted,<note place="margin">Jerom. in Ep. ad Tit. c. 1.</note> or (as one ſpeaketh) <hi>in toto Orbe, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World.</hi> For the number of Chriſtians growing
daily in every City throughout thoſe Provinces and
Countries, where the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets,
with their Coadjutors, firſt travelled to plant the
Chriſtian Faith; it was ſtill more and more neceſſary,
that they ſhould be diſtinguiſhed into more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than they were before, and that alſo the number
of their ſaid Miniſters that were to be reſident amongſt
them,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> ſhould be accordingly encreaſed.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 11. &amp; 3. 4.</note> By reaſon of
which encreaſe,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 6. &amp; 3. 1.</note> as well of Chriſtians and particular
Congregations,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 2, 8.</note> as of their ſaid Miniſters;<note place="margin">Col 2. 4, 8, 18</note> as alſo for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42183:88"/>
that now it began to come to paſs,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 13.</note> that neither the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 2, 3.</note> nor the Evangeliſts,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 29, 30.</note> nor their Coadjutors and
Meſſengers could be always ſo ready,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1. &amp;c.</note> and at hand, or
preſent with them,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 18. &amp; 4. 1.</note> as before they had been; many
Queſtions, Diſſentions, and Quarrels, fell out amongſt
them (both Miniſters and particular Congregations
mentioned) as by the places quoted in the Margent it
is evident; the People being as apt, through affection
and private reſpects, to adhere to one Man more than
to another, as ſundry of their Miniſters then were
prompt for their own glory to entertain all Comers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24. 4. 17. 10. 12, 18. 11. 5, 23. 12. 11.</note>
and to embrace every occaſion that might procure them
many Followers; not ſparing to oppoſe themſelves in
their Pride againſt the very Apoſtles, and to charge them
with ambitious ſeeking of preheminence above their
Brethren Miniſters; as if they had meant to tyrannize
and domineer over all Churches.<note place="margin">3 Joh. 9.</note> Inſomuch as St. <hi>John</hi>
complain'd in his time of ſuch Inſolencies: and St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was driven to purge himſelf; but yet in ſuch ſort, as
he ſtood upon the Juſtification of his Apoſtolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
I grant, ſaith he, <hi>That they are Ministers of
Chriſt;</hi> but withal he addeth theſe words, <hi>I am more;</hi>
proteſting, that although he was more than they were,
yet he ſought <hi>to have no Dominion over the Faith of any.</hi>
The places quoted in the Margent deſerve due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and many other to the ſame purpoſe might
be added unto them.</p>
                  <p>Now foraſmuch as the Apoſtles did well underſtand
the ſaid Oppoſitions, Diſſentions, and Emulations; and
that the People had as well Experience, what Equality
wrought amongſt their Miniſters in every place, whilſt
each Man would be a Director as he liſt himſelf, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
broach his own Fancies without Controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or ſparing of any that ſtood in his way; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
how themſelves (the people) were diſtracted and led
to the embracing of Divers Sects and Schiſms: they
(the ſaid Apoſtles) having now no ſuch leiſure and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42183:88"/>
as that they could themſelves every where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
theſe Quarrels, did find it neceſſary to ſettle ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Courſe for the redreſs of them by others. For
whereas before, the Apoſtles held it convenient, when
they firſt planted Miniſters in every City, to detain ſtill
in their own hand the Power of Ordination, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Keys of Eccleſiaſtical Government (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they themſelves, for that time, with the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
and others their Coadjutors, were ſufficient to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſee
and rule them:) Now for the Reaſons above-mentioned
they did commit thoſe their ſaid two Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
containing in them all Epiſcopal Power and
Authority, unto ſuch of their ſaid Coadjutors, as upon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
tryal of their Abilities and Diligence, they knew
to be meet Men; both, whilſt they themſelves lived,
to be their Subſtitutes, and after their deaths to be their
Succceſſors, both for the Continuance of the work of
Chriſt, for the further building of his Church, and
likewiſe for the perpetual Government of it. And in
this manner, the Miniſters of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
who had the charge but of one particular
Church or Congregation, and were of an inferiour De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
were diſtinguiſhed from the firſt and ſuperiour
ſort of Miniſters, termed (moſt of them) before, <hi>The
Apoſtles Coadjutors;</hi> and now and from thenceforth cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Biſhops.</hi> Unto which ſort of worthy and ſelected
Coadjutors, and unto ſome others alſo of eſpecial Deſert
ſo advanced to the Titles and Offices of Biſhops, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
did commit the charge and overſight of all the
particular Congregations, Miniſters and Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that dwelt in one City, and in the Towns and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thereunto appertaining. And ſuch were the Angels
of the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 11.</note> who were then the <hi>Biſhops</hi>
of thoſe Cities, with their ſeveral Territories; and ſo
in all times and ages that ſince have ſucceeded, have ever
been reputed. And unto ſome others the moſt principal
and chief men of the ſaid Number, the Apoſtles did
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42183:89"/>
likewiſe give Authority, not only over the particular
Congregations, Miniſters and People in one City, and
in the Towns that did belong unto it; but likewiſe
over all the Churches in certain whole Provinces and
Countries,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 3.</note> as unto <hi>Timothy</hi> all that were in <hi>Aſia the
leſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> and unto <hi>Titus</hi> all that were planted throughout
the Iſland of <hi>Crete.</hi> And this ſort of Biſhops who had
ſo large Juriſdictions over the Biſhops themſelves in
particular Cities, were afterward called Archbiſhops:
Over whom, in like manner, as likewiſe over all the
reſt, Biſhops and Miniſters, and particular Churches,
the Apoſtles themſelves as the chief Fathers and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
of all Churches, had whilſt they lived, the chief
preheminence and overſight to direct and over-rule all,
as they knew it to be moſt convenient and behoofull for
the Church: communicating notwithſtanding unto the
ſaid Biſhops and Archbiſhops (now their Subſtitutes,
but in time to be their Succeſſors) as full Authority in
their abſence (with the limitations mention'd) for the
ordering of Miniſters, for the uſe of the Keys, and for
the further Government of all the Churches committed
to their charges, by the good advice and counſel of the
inferiour ſort of Prieſts, or Miniſters under them, when
Cauſes ſo required; as if they (the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
had been preſent, or could have always lived
to have performed thoſe duties in their own Perſons;
their Patriarchal Authority for Government not
ceaſing, or dying with them. Of this Authority of
Ordination and Government, given to Biſhops by the
holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he himſelf hath left to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
moſt clear and evident Teſtimonies; where wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to two of his ſaid Biſhops, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> he
deſcribeth very particularly the Eſſential parts of their
duties, and Epiſcopal Office, in manner and ſort fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

particulars might be hereunto added, were it not that
theſe are ſufficient for our purpoſe, to ſhow as well
what Power was given to the ſaid <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
(two Apoſtolical Biſhops newly deſigned unto their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42183:90"/>
Epiſcopal Functions) as alſo what Authority the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
himſelf had, whilſt he lived, both of preſcribing
rules unto them, and alſo of exacting the due obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them: He retaining ſtill in his own hands, as
full power and ample Juriſdiction over them, as they
the ſaid Biſhops had received from him over the reſt of
the Miniſtry, within their ſeveral charges.</p>
                  <p>And thus we ſee, how by degrees the Apoſtles did
ſettle the Government of the Church amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
converted to Chriſt, moſt ſuitable and agreeing
with the Platform ordain'd by God himſelf amongſt the
<hi>Jews.</hi> Miniſters are placed in particular Congregations,
as <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Levites</hi> were in their Synagogues. Four
and twenty Prieſts termed <hi>Principes Sacerdotum,</hi> had
in that Kingdom the charge over the reſt of the Prieſts:
and amongſt Chriſtians, one ſort of Prieſts named Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
or Arch-Biſhops (as their Juriſdictions were extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
had the overſight of the reſt of the Miniſtry or Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
Laſtly, as over all the Prieſts, of what ſort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and over the reſt of all the <hi>Jews, Aaron</hi> had the
chief preeminence; ſo had the Apoſtles over all the
Biſhops and Prieſts, and over the reſt of all Chriſtians.
There was only this want to the full accompliſhment of
ſuch a Church-Government, as was ſettled amongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> that during the Apoſtles times, and for a long
ſeaſon afterward, it wanted Chriſtian Magiſtrates
to ſupply the rooms of <hi>Moſes,</hi> King <hi>David,</hi> King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and of the reſt of their worthy Succeſſors. There is no
mention in the Scriptures of the particular ſucceſs that
the reſt of the Apoſtles had in planting of Churches
throughout all <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia the great,</hi> and a great
part of <hi>Europe:</hi> but we doubt not, but that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that ſame courſe in thoſe parts nearer, or better
known to us; they proceeding within their limits,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did within his. And moreover, we have
ſufficient warrant by the ſaid Practice of our Apoſtles
to judge, that if all the Kings, and Soveraign Princes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42183:90"/>
of the World would have received the Goſpel whilſt
the Apoſtles lived, they would have ſetled this Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of Church-Government under them in every ſuch
Kingdom, and Sovereign Principality: that as the
three Eſſential parts of the Prieſthood under the Law,
were tranſlated to the Miniſtry or Prieſthood in the
New Teſtament; ſo the external ſhew or practice of
them, might have been in effect the ſame under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes that it was under the godly Kings and
Princes of <hi>Judah:</hi> Chriſtians of particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be directed by their immediate Paſtors; Paſtors
to be ruled by their Biſhops; Biſhops to be adviſed by
their Archbiſhops; and the Archbiſhops, with all the
reſt, both of the Clergy and Laity, to be ruled and
governed by their godly Kings and Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

under colour of any thing that

of Eccleſiaſtical Government, as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> therefore it is not to be
ſuppoſed, that they meant at all to erect it:

to eſtabliſh that kind of Government in the

it was there eſtabliſhed: or, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had no further Authority of Church-Government
committed unto them, after
the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt,
than they had before his Paſſion: or, that
there was not as great neceſſity of ſundry
degrees in the Miniſtry, whilſt the Apoſtles
lived, one to rule, another to be ruled, for
the eſtabliſhing and government of the
Church, as there was whilſt the Prieſthood
of <hi>Aaron</hi> endured: or, that Chriſt himſelf
did not, after a ſort, approve of divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Miniſters, ſome to have prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence

Orders and degrees of Miniſters, who

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42183:91"/>
and of Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
given to the Apoſtles, was not to be
communicated by the Apoſtles unto others,
as there ſhould be good opportunity in that

which they could not communicate
unto others, therefore they had not power
to communicate to ſome Miniſters, as well
their Authority of Government over other

not included certain degrees to be in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
ſome to rule, and ſome to be ruled:
or, that it was not lawful for the Apoſtles
to chooſe unto themſelves Coadjutors, and
to make them Miniſters of the Word and

themſelves, and the Evangeliſts, were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited

placed in divers particular Churches in

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42183:92"/>
themſelves; which of them ſhould be moſt
prevalent amongſt the People, and drew
their Followers into divers Sects and

attend thoſe particular brawls and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies)
to appoint ſome worthy Perſons
in every City, to have the rule, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and direction of them: or, that when
ſuch Men were to be placed in ſuch Cities,
the Apoſtles did not make eſpecial choice of
them, out of the number of their ſaid Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors,
and likewiſe out of the reſt of the
Miniſtry, to execute thoſe Epiſcopal duties,
which did appertain to their Callings: or,
that when they had ſo deſign'd and choſen
them to be Biſhops, they did not communicate
unto them, as well their Apoſtolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Ordaining of Miniſters, and
power of the Keys, as of Preaching and
Adminiſtring the Sacraments: or, that it
was not the meaning of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
that ſuch Perſons, as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
were, ought to be made Biſhops in ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Countries as were that Province
of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and Kingdom of <hi>Crete,</hi> to have

or, that the Authority given by the Apoſtle
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or by any other of the Apoſtles to
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſuch like other
Biſhops or Archbiſhops, did any more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the Power and Authority which the

                     <head>The Sum of the Chapter following.</head>
                     <p>That the Churches and godly Fathers, that were immediately
after the Apoſtles times, and all the Ancient Fathers
ſince, did account the Form of Church-Government, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by the Apoſtles (of Prieſts and Miniſters for more
particular Charges; of Biſhops ſuperiour to the ſaid
Prieſts; and of Arch-Biſhops to have the care and overſight
of the ſaid Biſhops and Churches committed unto them) not
to have been ordain'd for their times only, but to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to the End of the World; the ſame reaſons exacting
the continuance of it, which moved the Apoſtles (by the
Direction of the Holy Ghoſt) firſt to erect it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have purſued the Form of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
ſo far forth as it is expreſſed in the
Scriptures, and as it was put in practice during the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
times. For the further proof whereof, we
have thought it expedient briefly to obſerve, what the
primitive Church, Ancient Fathers, and the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Hiſtories, have in their Writings teſtified, and
ſaid of this matter: as whether they held, that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> were Biſhops in the Apoſtles times, and
had Authority over the Churches and Miniſtry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their Charge: and whether that Form of
Church-Government in the Apoſtles times, wherein
were divers Degrees of Miniſters, one ſort to direct
and rule, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhops, and the other to be directed and
ruled, was only neceſſary for the firſt plantation of the
Churches, but not ſo afterward, when the Churches
were planted; as if it had been a lawful Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whilſt the Apoſtles lived, but upon their Deaths,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42183:94"/>
it became preſently to be unlawful. It is very apparent
and cannot be denied, That in many <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of
the New Teſtament, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are termed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in the Directions or Subſcriptions of two Epiſtles,
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did write unto them. Theſe are the
words of the ſaid Directions: <hi>The ſecond Epiſtle written
from Rome unto Timotheus, the firſt Biſhop elected of the
Church of Epheſus,</hi> And again, <hi>To Titus elect the firſt
Biſhop of the Cretians, written from Nicopolis in Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
Moreover, agreeable to the ſaid Subſcriptions, the
ancient Fathers generally, having (no doubt) upon
their due ſearching the Scriptures fully conſidered of the
Form of Eccleſiaſtical Government, whilſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
lived, do with one conſent, whenſoever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> or
have Occaſion to ſpeak of the Authority of thoſe two
Perſons, very reſolutely affirm, That they were by the
Apoſtles made Biſhops. And the ſame alſo, they do
teſtifie of St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle himſelf, called the
<hi>Lord's Brother;</hi> that he was made by the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
his Colleagues, Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> and ſo
alſo of the <hi>Seven Angels</hi> of the Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that they
were ſo many Biſhops of the Apoſtles Ordination.<note place="margin">Tertull. contra Marcion. l. 5.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the ſaid ancient Fathers did very well know that
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Hom. 10. in 1 Tim.</note>

                     <hi>and before Jeſus Chriſt, that thou keep this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that it was impoſſible for <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
to obſerve thoſe things till the coming of Chriſt, he
being to die long before: and that therefore the Precepts
and Rules which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had given unto him, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in his Epiſcopal Government, did equally apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as well to Biſhops, his Succeſſors, as to himſelf,
and were to be executed by them ſucceſſively after his
Death unto the Worlds End, as carefully and diligently
as he himſelf, whilſt he lived, had put them in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
<note place="margin">Ambr. ibid.</note> One of the ſaid Fathers doth write as followeth:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42183:94"/>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"With great Vigilancy and Providence, doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
give Precepts to the Ruler of the Church: for

but for his Succeſſors; that after <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Example
they ſhould obſerve the Ordination of the Church,
and begin themſelves to keep that Form which they
were to deliver to thoſe that came after them."</q> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
it is evident by the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, that
not only St. <hi>James, Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were made
Biſhops by the Apoſtles;<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 3. c. 35.</note> but that likewiſe <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was Biſhop of <hi>Antioch;</hi> ſo termed, becauſe of his

Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna;</hi>
and that St. <hi>John,</hi> returning from <hi>Patmos</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
went to the Churches round about, and made Biſhops
in thoſe places where they were wanting: and alſo,
that divers others of the Apoſtles Coadjutors, beſides
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were made by them Biſhops, and
did govern the Cities and Provinces where they were
placed, according to the ſame rules, that were preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Origen. in Rom. c. 16. Ambr. in Coloſſ. c. 4.</note> as <hi>Dionyſius the Areopagite</hi>

and we doubt not, but many more by diligent reading
may be found, that were in the Apoſtles times made
Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore it is apparent by the teſtimonies of all
Antiquity, Fathers, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, that
all the Churches in Chriſtendom, that were planted
and govern'd by the Apoſtles, and by ſuch their Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors,
Apoſtolical Perſons, as unto whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had to that end fully communicated their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Authority; did think, that after the Death, either
of any of the Apoſtles, which ruled amongſt them, or
of any other the ſaid Biſhops ordained by them, it was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42183:95"/>
the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, teſtified ſufficiently by
the practice of the Apoſtles, that the ſame Order
and Form of Eccleſiaſtical Government ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the Church for ever. And therefore upon the
death of any of them, either Apoſtles or Biſhops, they
(the ſaid Churches) did always ſupply their places
with others the moſt worthy and eminent Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them: who with the like Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that their Predeceſſors had, did ever ſucceed
them. Inſomuch as in every City and Epiſcopal See,
where there were divers Prieſts and Miniſters of the
Word and Sacraments, and but one Biſhop only; the
Catalogues of the Names, not of their Prieſts but of
their Biſhops, were very carefully kept from time to
time, together with the Names of the Apoſtles, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical
Perſons, the Biſhops their Predeceſſors, from
whom they derived their Succeſſion. Of which Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Biſhops, whilſt the Succeſſion of Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with it, the ancient Fathers made great account
and uſe, when any falſe Teachers did broach new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as if they had received the ſame from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
choaking them with this, that they were not
able to ſhew any Apoſtolical Church that ever taught

                  <p>Again, foraſmuch as it was thought by our Saviour
Chriſt, the beſt means for the building and continuing
of his Church in the Apoſtles times, to ordain ſundry

another, when ſuch a kind of preheminence might
have been thought not ſo neceſſary, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

is probable) have procured to themſelves ſufficient
Authority: How can it with any reaſon be imagined,
but that Chriſt much more did mean to have the ſame
ſtill to be continued after the Apoſtles days, when the
gifts of doing Miracles were to ceaſe, and when Mens
Zeal was like to grow more cold, than it was at the

ſhould be neceſſary to build the Church, but unfit to
preſerve it; or, that the ſame Artiſans, that are moſt
meet to build this or that Houſe, are not the fitteſt both
to keep the ſame in good Reparations, and likewiſe to
build other Houſes when there is cauſe. No Man can
doubt (who is of any reading) but that, when the
Apoſtles died, there were many defects in many
Churches: and that likewiſe there were a number of
places in the World, where the Apoſtles had never
been, and where there were no Churches planted, or
eſtabliſhed. Whereupon it followeth of neceſſity, that
if the ſaid Form of Government in the Apoſtles days
was then neceſſary for the planting and ordering of
Churches; that the ſame did continue to be as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42183:96"/>
neceſſary afterward, for the ſupplying of ſuch defects,
as were left in ſome Churches, and for the planting
and ordering of other Churches in thoſe places, that
had not received the Goſpel, whilſt the Apoſtles lived.
And to this purpoſe it doth much avail, that for ought
we can find, there can no one Nation or Country be
named ſince the Apoſtles days, neither in times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
nor ſince; but when it firſt received the Faith
of Chriſt, it had thereupon both Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
placed in it for the Government of the Churches,
that were there planted; imitating therein for their
more certain direction the Government of the Churches,
that were erected by the Apoſtles, and had been dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from them, agreeable (in ſubſtance) with the Form
of Eccleſiaſtical Government, that was once amongſt
God's own People the <hi>Jews.</hi> Which was no new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
amongſt the ancient Fathers; as it may appear by
the words of one of them;<note place="margin">Jeron. Ep. ad Evagr.</note> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Who ſaith (in effect)
that Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, may challenge

that the Apoſtles in eſtabliſhing of their Government
in the New Teſtament, had reſpect to that which
was in the Old; for as much as concern'd the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
parts of that Prieſthood."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover the Primitive Churches, preſently after
the Apoſtles times, finding in the New Teſtament no
one perſon to have been ordain'd a Prieſt, or Miniſter
of the Goſpel, mediately by Men, but either by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Apoſtles hands, or of their hands to whom
they gave Authority in that behalf, as unto <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſuch other Biſhops as they were; and
knowing that the Church of Chriſt ſhould never be left
deſtitute of Prieſts and Biſhops for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry:
they durſt not preſume upon their own heads
to deviſe a new form of making of Miniſters, nor to
commit that Authority unto any other, after their own
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42183:96"/>
Fancies; but held it their bounden duty to leave the
ſame where they found it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the hands of <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> and conſequently of other Biſhops their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
Whereupon it followeth very neceſſarily, that
none of the Primitive Churches, or ancient Fathers,
did ever ſo much as once dream, that the Authority
given by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to <hi>Titus,</hi> and to the
reſt, who were then made Biſhops, as well for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of Prieſts, as for the further order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, did determine by the death of the
Apoſtles: Conſidering, that preſently after, as long as
they were in being, and lived, and ever ſince till very
lately, it was held by them altogether unlawful, for
any to ordain a Prieſt or Miniſter of the Word, except
he were himſelf a Biſhop: and no one approved Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for the ſpace of above 1500. years, can be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(for ought we find) to the contrary. It is true,
that one <hi>Coluthus,</hi> being himſelf but a Prieſt, would
needs take upon him to make Prieſts, in ſpleen againſt
his own Biſhop (the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria)</hi> with whom
he was then fallen at variance: and that the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
was made by one <hi>Maximus,</hi> ſuppoſing himſelf
to have been a Biſhop, where he was indeed but a
Prieſt, as it was decided by the firſt <hi>Council of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
Howbeit ſuch their Ordinations were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
void, and utterly condemn'd as unlawful; they
themſelves not eſcaping ſuch juſt reproof, as ſo great
a Novelty and preſumption did deſerve. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that for the great dignity of the Action of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it was decreed by another Council, That Prieſts
ſhould lay their hands, with the Biſhop, upon him that
was to be made Prieſt: but they had not thereby any
Power of Ordination; but only did it to teſtifie their
conſent thereunto, and likewiſe to concur in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of him: neither might they ever in that ſort im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their hands upon any without their Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42183:97"/>
Again, the ſaid Primitive Churches and ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
finding how the Apoſtles, by the Inſpiration of
the Holy Ghoſt, had ordained Biſhops, <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi>
and ſuch like, for the ordering and appeaſing of ſuch
Quarrels and Contentions as ariſe amongſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and People, for want of ſome amongſt them of
Authority to govern them; they might thereby have
been confirmed more and more in their Judgments (if
at any time they had doubted of it) concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of that Apoſtolical Form of Government, that
it was for ever to continue, to the end the Schiſms and
contentious Perſons might be ſtill, by the ſame means,
ſuppreſſed, that they were whilſt the Apoſtles lived.
For they ever obſerved what the want of Biſhops would
work in the Church; and how the contempt of them,
and diſobedience to their directions, was always a chief
cauſe of Sects and Schiſms. Which made them eaſily to
diſcern, that if the Apoſtles had not provided for the
continuance of their Apoſtolical Authority in Biſhops,
who were to ſucceed them in the Government of the
Church; but had left an equality in the Clergy, that
every one might have proceeded in his own particular
Church after his own Faſhion; there would have been
nothing in the Church but Diſorder, Scandals, Sects,
Schiſms, and all manner of Confuſion. One of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers perceiving in his time, what Pride and
Contempt certain unſtaid and contentious Perſons ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward their Archbiſhops, did lay it upon them as a
property of Hereticks, and feared not to compare them
to the Devils. Theſe are his words, <hi>Quilibet haereticus,</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly it is to be obſerved, that in the Apoſtles times
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had wrought a great confuſion in all
the Kingdoms and Countries about it; whilſt in the
greedineſs of Honour in that ſtate they had ſubdued
their Neighbour Kings and Princes, and turn'd their
Kingdoms and Principalities into Provinces and Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and divers other ſuch like Forms of Regiment;
leaving the ſame to the Government of their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42183:98"/>
to whom they gave ſundry and different ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.
Which courſe, held by that ſtate, cauſed the
Apoſtles, in their planting of Churches, when they
could not perform that which otherwiſe they would
have done, to frame their proceeding as near unto it,
as they could. In the chief Cities, which had been
Heads of ſo many Kingdoms, and were ſtill the Seat
then of the principal <hi>Roman</hi> Officers, principal Perſons
were placed, who were Biſhops, and more than Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:
as St. <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (although <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
notwithſtanding it was honoured with the name and
title of the See of St. <hi>James,</hi> was not the Metropolitan
Seat, or Archbiſhoprick of that Province, but <hi>Caeſarea;</hi>
whoſe Right is ſaved in the giving that honour to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>

and then in <hi>Rome;</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>Alexandria:</hi>
who remain'd in thoſe places, as was then moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveful
for thoſe Churches, as ſo many principal Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
Patriarchs, to rule and direct all the Biſhops,
Prieſts, and Chriſtians, in <hi>Paleſtine, Syria, Italy,</hi> and
<hi>Egypt.</hi> And in other Cities alſo and Countries, not ſo
famous then as the ſaid four, there were appointed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the largeneſs of their Extents, in ſome, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
to govern the Miniſters which were in ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and in ſome others, ſuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
were, who (as we have ſhewed in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
had the overſight committed unto them, as well
of Biſhops, as of the reſt of the Churches within their
limits. All which particulars, ſo put in practice by the
Apoſtles, were very well know to the Primitive
Churches, and ancient godly Fathers, that lived the
firſt 300. years after Chriſt; and gave them full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that they might lawfully purſue in thoſe days
that Form of Church-Government which the Apoſtles
themſelves had erected: the ſtate and condition of the
times remaining ſtill one and the ſame, that it was,
when the Apoſtles lived. Whereupon, by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42183:98"/>
they did not only continue the Succeſſion of
Biſhops and Archbiſhops, in thoſe places where the
Apoſtles had ſetled them: ſupplying other Churches,
either not throughly ſetled, or not at all planted, when
the Apoſtles died (as before hath been mention'd) with
the like Church-Governours: but did likewiſe preſerve,
and uphold in thoſe parts of the World, where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity

Archbiſhops in the above-mention'd four moſt
principal Cities, <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>
Inſomuch as it is commonly held, that this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical

                  <p>The conſideration of all which particular points, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the placing of Archbiſhops and Biſhops in the
Territories of the <hi>Romans,</hi> according to the Dignities
and chief honours of the Cities and Countries where
they were placed; doth very throughly perſwade us,
that (as we obſerved in the former Chapter) if all the
ſaid Kingdoms, and Sovereign Principalities, then in
ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had been freed of that
ſervitude, and governed by their own Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as they had been before: the Apoſtles (though
the ſaid Kings and Princes had refuſed to receive the
Goſpel) would notwithſtanding as much as in them
lay, have ſetled in every one of them, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church there, the like Form that God
himſelf did erect amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
did eſtabliſh in their time in the like Heatheniſh
places, as is aforeſaid; that is, in every ſuch Kingdom
Miniſters in particular Churches, or Congregations;
Biſhops over Miniſters, and Archbiſhops to overſee and
direct them all. And aſſuredly, if when Chriſtian
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42183:99"/>
Kings and Sovereign Princes did free themſelves from
the Yoke of the Empire, they had either known or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the Ordinance of the Holy Ghoſt, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Churches within their Kingdoms and
Principalities; they would have been as careful to have
deliver'd their Churches from the bondage of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they were their Kingdoms from ſubjection
to the Empire. For all, that is commonly alledged to
the contrary, is but the fume of preſumptuous Brains.
The chief Archbiſhops, either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> have
as full Power and Authority under their Sovereigns, as
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had in times paſt over <hi>Italy,</hi> under
their Emperour: and by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, they
ought to depend no more upon the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> than
they do now one upon the other: or than the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
of <hi>England,</hi> under their moſt worthy Sovereign,
do depend upon any of them: as it will hereafter more
plainly (we hope) appear by that which we have to
ſay of that infinite Authority which the Pope doth
vainly challenge to himſelf.</p>

very truly (for ought that appeareth to the

                     <p>That our Saviour Chriſt, upon his Aſcenſion into Heaven,

Kingdom of Chriſt: Whereof when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
after they were repleniſhed with the Holy Ghoſt,
upon the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> had full underſtanding and
notice: they never dreamed (for ought that appeareth
to the contrary in the Scriptures) of any Worldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
or Principalities; who ſhould ſit here, and
who ſhould ſit there; but contented themſelves with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42183:106"/>
the ſame eſtate and condition of life that their Maſter
had led before them; remembring how he had deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the ſame unto them, when he firſt ſent them to

                     <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he unto them)
<hi>I ſend you as ſheep in the midſt of Wolves. Beware of men;
for they will deliver you up to the Councils, and will ſcourge
you in the Synagogues. And ye ſhall be brought to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours

the Gentiles. And ye ſhall be hated of all Men for my ſake.
When they perſecute you in this City, flee into another: the
Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his
Lord: If they have called the Maſter of the Houſe</hi> Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub;
<hi>how much more them of his Houſhold? Whoſoever
will be a perfect Diſciple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall be as his Maſter. Verily,
Verily, I ſay unto you, that ye ſhall weep and lament, and
the World ſhall rejoice.</hi>

                     <hi>The time ſhall come, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice.</hi> And
as Chriſt did thus foretel them, ſo it came to paſs. For
no ſooner did they begin to Preach the Goſpel, after
the Aſcenſion of Chriſt; but they were whipped, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
caſt into Priſon, bound with Chains, and moſt
cruelly entreated. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth teſtify ſomewhat
hereof; when writing in the name, both of himſelf
and of the reſt of the Apoſtles and Miniſters, he ſaith thus;
<hi>In all things we approve our ſelves as the Miniſters of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 4.</note>
                     <hi>in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes,
in ſtripes, in priſons, in tumults, in labours, by watchings,
by faſtings, by long ſufferings, by diſhonour, by evil report;
as Deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;
as dying, and behold we live.</hi> Beſides, that which he
ſpeaketh of his own particular condition, doth argue
the eſtate and condition of his Fellows; though one
would have thought, that little more could have been
added to the barbarous Cruelty laſt mentioned to have
been Executed upon them. For comparing himſelf,
and his pains, with certain falſe Brethren, that were
crept into the Church amongſt the Apoſtles, and ſought
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42183:107"/>
for their own commendation to impair the credit of
this our Apoſtle;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 23, &amp;c.</note> he writeth in this manner. <hi>They are
Miniſters of Chriſt; I am more: in labours more abundant,
in ſtripes above meaſure, in Priſon more plenteouſly. Of the
Jews five times received I forty ſtripes, ſave one. I was
thrice beaten with Rods. I was once ſtoned. I ſuffered
thrice Shipwrack. Night and day have I been in the deep
Sea. In Journying I was often, in perils of Water, in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
of Robbers, in perils of mine own Nation, in perils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Gentiles, in perils in the Wilderneſs, in perils
in the Sea, in perils amongſt falſe Brethren; In wearineſs and
painfulneſs, in watching often, in hunger and thirſt, in
faſtings often, in cold and nakedneſs. Beſides theſe things
which are outward, I am cumber'd daily, and have the care
of all the Churches.</hi> Much is not written of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
by the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke:</hi> but it is not to be doubted,
that his Caſe was as bad as any of his Fellows. When
he began to Preach,<note place="margin">Act 4. 21.</note> he was call'd in queſtion with
great eagerneſs;<note place="margin">—5. 18, 40.</note> and vehemently threatned. Alſo
with ſome other of the Apoſtles, he was caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and beaten. Likewiſe when <hi>James</hi> was killed by
<hi>Herod</hi>'s Commandment, <hi>Peter</hi> was again Impriſoned,
and loaden with Irons; and had aſſuredly, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood,
eſcaped hardly with his Life; but that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of the Lord delivered him.<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> In a word, after many
Afflictions, Injuries, Calamities and Miſeries, endured
by the Apoſtles, whilſt they lived in this World; they
were in the end (as well St. <hi>Peter</hi> as almoſt all the
reſt) moſt ſpitefully and cruelly, by the Enemies of
Chriſt, and of their own Salvation, put to Death. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the courſe of whoſe lives, in ſo great dangers and
manifold diſtreſſes; out of queſtion, they would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have marvelled, their hard Eſtates conſider'd, but
eſpecially St. <hi>Peter,</hi> if he had known himſelf to be the
ſole Monarch, under Chriſt, over all the World; and
that the Emperour, and all other Kings, had been at
that time his Vaſſals; and that likewiſe they (the reſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42183:107"/>
of the Apoſtles) had been under St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
and Temporal Princes, to have commanded
and ruled amongſt them throughout the whole World.
Neither do we ſee any true cauſe, that might have
moved St. <hi>Peter</hi> to have concealed that his ſo eminent
temporal Power and Authority; if he had thought it
to have been the Ordinance of God: or, at leaſt, if he
for modeſty would have been ſilent, why the reſt of the
Apoſtles ſhould not have publiſhed it; that the civil
and temporal States in thoſe times, who knew no ſuch
Ordination made by Chriſt, might have been left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable.
Beſides, the concealing of a truth of ſo great
importance, was an injury offered to all the faithful in
thoſe days; who had they been truly taught in theſe
Mens conceits, ought to have left their Obedience to
the Emperour in all temporal Cauſes; and for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Goſpel, to have adher'd unto St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to have
been directed in them, by him their temporal Monarch.
The conſideration of all which inconveniences and
conſequents, doth perſwade us to think, that none of
the Apoſtles ever dreamed of any ſuch temporal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty;
notwithſtanding, that they knew well the
Scriptures; how Chriſt told them, That All Power in
Heaven and Earth, was given unto him; how St. <hi>Peter</hi>
had two Swords; and how <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> for
lying to the Holy Ghoſt, were ſtricken ſuddenly from

the ancient Fathers, in the Primitive Church, would

<hi>Peter,</hi> knowing by the inſtinct of the Holy Ghoſt, that
Satan had poſſeſſed both their hearts, and how they
lied not to Men, but to God; did only pronounce that
Sentence of Death upon them, which the holy Spirit
did ſuggeſt unto him. Wherein although there may

St. <hi>Peter,</hi> through the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt;
there was aſſuredly no uſe of any material and civil
Sword: for if there had, another manner of Form of

they had been Executed. And to conclude this point,
We do freely profeſs, That the nature of Chriſt, his
Spiritual Kingdom being throughly weighed, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                  <p>IF therefore any Man ſhall affirm, under

either that our Saviour Chriſt hath
otherwiſe committed the World to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
under him by Kings, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Princes, but ſo, as he himſelf, with
his Regal Scepter, doth rule and govern
them all, according to his Divine Pleaſure:
or, that it is not a ſound Argument, that
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> in taking upon them
to be temporal Kings, have wholly perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Inſtitution of Chriſt in that behalf;
in that they are driven to juſtify their facts
therein, by the Examples of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi>
and thoſe times of ſo great confuſion: or,
that our Saviour Chriſt, whilſt he was
here upon the Earth, did not fully content
himſelf to be only a Spiritual King, to rule
in Mens hearts: or, that to the end he
might erect ſuch a Spiritual Kingdom, he
did not conquer the Devil, Sin, Death,
and Hell, and thereby took poſſeſſion in the
hearts of all true Believers: or, that before
our Saviour Chriſt doth begin to reign in
Man's heart, he doth not firſt, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of his Word, beget a lively Faith in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42183:110"/>
it: or, that whilſt he lived here in the
World, he did not ſatisfy himſelf, for our
ſakes, with a very mean and poor Eſtate,
being in himſelf moſt rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he was
God, and in his humanity, the Heir of all
things: or, that he did not Inſtitute and
Ordain a Prieſthood, or Miniſtry, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to the end of the World, for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and augmenting of his Spiritual

notwithſtanding that they are redeemed,
through Faith by Chriſt, and delivered out
of the Iaws of Hell, and Satan, are not

to arm themſelves accordingly againſt his

he told his Apoſtles and Diſciples, <hi>That the

would be a perfect Diſciple, ſhould be
as his Maſter,</hi> did not mean, that his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

Offices under him, to do as he did, when
he was a Mortal Man of poor Eſtate, and
ſubject to many bad Vſages, and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
or, that becauſe our Saviour Chriſt,
after his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, when
he was become a Man Immortal and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42183:110"/>
did then enlarge the Commiſſion of his
Apoſtles, and ordain'd by them a ſucceſſion of
the Miniſtry for the government of the Church
he did thereby make them any more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his Regal Authority, whereof
his humane nature was then actually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
for the ſtate and exerciſe thereof, by
reaſon of the free and unreſtrained Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Deity, than he made their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and corruptible Bodies, incorrupt and
ſpiritual Bodies, or endowed them in this
life, with any of that Glory, Power, and
Heavenly Eſtate, which they were to enjoy
after their Deaths, and bleſſed Reſurrection:
or, that the Apoſtles after Chriſt's Death
(not exempting St. <hi>Peter)</hi> did not find their
Eſtates in this World very ſuitable to their
Maſter's, whilſt he lived with them, all
things happening unto them, as he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
them: or, that either St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or any
of the Apoſtles, or of their Succeſſors, either
then, or ſince that time, could challenge ſo
much as this, or that one temporal farm,
by virtue of their Eccleſiaſtical Functions,
more than their Maſter had, or that either
they were themſelves poſſeſſed with, as
their own, before they were called to that
Miniſtration, or than was afterward given
unto them by godly Emperors, Kings and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42183:111"/>
Princes, and other devout and religious
Perſons: or, that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had known
himſelf to have been under Chriſt the ſole
temporal Monarch of the World, it had not
been his duty to have made the ſame known;
at leaſt, to the Apoſtles, and ſuch as were

have honour'd him accordingly, as his duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and loyal Subjects: or, that it had not
in all probability, if St. <hi>Peter</hi> meant to ſhew
himſelf to be a temporal King, by the Deaths
of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> been much more
expedient for the ſucceſs of the Goſpel in
thoſe days, if he had uſed ſuch his Regal
Authority againſt thoſe civil Magiſtrates,
which were Enemies to Chriſt, and to all
that Preached in his name: or, that it may
be rightly imagin'd, with our dutiful regard
of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sincerity, that ever he would
have been ſo earneſt with the diſperſed <hi>Jews,</hi>
to have <hi>ſubmitted themſelves for the Lord's ſake
unto Kings,</hi> and other Governours, to have
obey'd them and honour'd them, if he had
known them to have had temporal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
becauſe they did not acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be his Vaſſals: or, that it did not
proceed from the great Wiſdom of God, to
abridge in the Apoſtles of Chriſt (even in
St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf) that great Power and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42183:111"/>
Authority which Chriſt had; as appeareth
by his words, when he ſaid, that <hi>if he had
thought it fit, he could have twelve Legions of
Angels at his Commandment,</hi> to have defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him from all his Enemies (the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> with all their partakers;) in
that perhaps the Apoſtles, even St. <hi>Peter</hi>
himſelf, might have abuſed it: or, that it
is not more than probable, that howſoever
St. <hi>Peter</hi> would have uſed the ſaid Power
and Authority, if he had had it, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> had received it from him,
they would certainly have made great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
and confuſion in the World with it:
or, that if all the Kings and Sovereign
Princes in the World had been ſubject to
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and were thereupon in the like
ſubjection to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> they (both
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſors) might not
have had ready at their Commandment (if
Kings and Princes had done their duties)
more than twelve Legions, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
all Men, that ſhould have diſobey'd
them: or, that therefore it is not as abſurd
an imagination and conceit for any Man to
think, that Chriſt did give ſo great tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Authority, either to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or any of
his Succeſſors, over temporal Kings and
Princes, that they might have ſo great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42183:112"/>
when they liſt, at their directions;
as if any Man ſhould hold, that becauſe
they are Chriſt's Vicars, they may have
twelve Legions from Heaven to do them
ſervice, if perhaps temporal Kings and
Princes ſhould be negligent, or refuſe to be
at ſuch charges at their Commandment:
or, that it is not a kind of madneſs (the
true nature of Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom
and Church, here upon Earth conſider'd)
for any Man to conceive, and thereupon
maintain, that any ſuch Omnipotency of
temporal Power in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ever was, or

or remove him out of his Palace, or to

Chriſt, as he is our Spiritual King, and
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles,
with all their Succeſſors in their degrees,

made againſt it, he hath done more for us, againſt his
Will, to the prejudice of his Maſter, whom he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to uphold, than we could ever have expected at
his hands. Inſomuch, as we are verily perſwaded, the
time will come before it be long, that his Works will
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42183:113"/>
be thruſt into the Catalogue <hi>Librorum prohibitorum;</hi>
becauſe dealing with our Arguments, as he did in the
ſaid Books <hi>de Romano Pontifice,</hi> and thinking that he
would no further yield to the truth, by way of Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
than as he ſhould be able ſufficiently to refel it;
it hath often fall'n out with him, as it will ever do
with all Impoſtors, that the very meaning of the truth,
according to the nature of it, hath (notwithſtanding
all his cunning) very much prevail'd againſt him, to
the everlaſting glory of her own name, and forcible
ſtrength to diſcover Errors, like to the Sun's to expel
Darkneſs. We will not here otherwiſe make proof
hereof, than, as by the matter we have in hand, and
are purpoſed to proſecute, we are after a ſort urged
and compelled. For albeit hitherto he hath ſeemed to
have joined with us (as he hath indeed, more than
now, we are perſwaded, he doth well vouchſafe) yet
foreſeeing what tempeſts he was otherwiſe like to
have endured, in affirming ſo peremptorily (as he did)
that the Pope had no temporal Authority at all, as he
was either Chriſt's, or St <hi>Peter</hi>'s Vicar: he minced his
matter in the titles of his Chapters to that purpoſe with
the word <hi>Directè</hi> (whereof in his reaſons he never
made mention;) and then falleth upon this Iſſue, That
<hi>Indirectè,</hi> the Pope hath Authority over all Emperours,
Kings, and Soveraign Princes, to hurry them hither
and thither; to depoſe and remove them from their
Regal Eſtates and Dignities; to diſpoſe of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
according to his own Pleaſure; to releaſe their
Subjects of their Oaths and Obedience, and to thruſt
them into all Rebellions, Treaſons, Furies, and what
not againſt them. In the which his courſe this is
our comfort, that by direct dealing, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> did
find no ways or means how to withſtand the truth;
but is driven by indirect ſhifts and by-paths, to oppoſe
his labours (we fear, <hi>reclamante Conſcientiâ)</hi> how to
ſave his own Worldly credit, he might caſt a miſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42183:113"/>
upon the truth; if not to depreſs it (which was not
in his power) yet at the leaſt to obſcure it, to darken
it, and perplex it.</p>
                  <p>Some of the principal Reaſons, which he hath uſed
to this purpoſe mentioned, are of this kind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42183:114"/>
with ſuch ſophiſtications and compariſons betwixt the
Body and the Soul, the Fleſh and the Spirit, he falleth
upon ſome particulars; the more fully (as he ſaith)
to expreſs what he had formerly delivered. The ſum
of which particulars is,<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 5. c. 6.</note> That although the Pope, as
he is Pope, cannot <hi>ordinariè,</hi> ordinarily depoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Princes, or make civil Laws, or judge <hi>de rebus

them all. And this he taketh upon him to prove by
five main reaſons, grounded (God knoweth) upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weak Foundations.<note place="margin">Ibidem, c. 7.</note> Of which his odd number, for
the glory of them, this which followeth is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Civil Power is ſubject to Spiritual Power, when

therefore the Spiritual Princes may command tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Princes, and diſpoſe of their temporal affairs <hi>in
ordine ad Bonum ſpirituale,</hi> n order to a ſpiritual good."</q>
The Antecedent of which Argument may briefly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
for ought that he hath ſaid to juſtify it, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as followeth. For in ſaying, that this ſubjection of
the temporal Power to the Spiritual, is, but where
both theſe Powers are part of one and the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Commonwealth, he maketh the Eſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings and Princes, inferiour and worſe than the
Eſtate of thoſe that be Infidels: Whoſe political Power
being no part of any Chriſtian Commonwealth, is not
ſubject to the Eccleſiaſtical. Again, to prefer the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Authority of the Church, for honour and
dignity in this World, before the temporal Authority
of Kings and Princes, is in effect, to prefer the poor
and baſe Eſtate of our Saviour Chriſt, as he was a
mortal Man here upon Earth, ſubject to many wants,
oppreſſions, and injuries, before the glory and majeſty
of his Divine Nature: in that Kings have their Authority
and Calling from Chriſt, as he is God: Whereas all
Miniſters, even St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, and conſequently the

is inferiour, and of a lower degree, than is the

For if the Authority of ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets, Biſhops or Prieſts,
either Regular or Secular, cannot exempt them from
the Authority of Kings, it muſt follow of neceſſity,
that it is ſubject and inferiour to their temporal Power
and Authority.</p>
                  <p>Another of the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Reaſons, whereby he
would gladly prove the Pope's indirect temporal Power
(to omit the reſt of his abſurd trifling about the firſt)
is built upon a very traiterous Poſition, never heard of
in the Church in the times of the principal ancient
Fathers. For how earneſt ſoever he ſeem'd before in
refuting their Opinions, who hold, That no Princes
are to be obey'd, if they be Infidels; he thinketh he is
able to ſhift off that in effect with his jugling and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Fetches. Theſe are his traiterous words. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42183:115"/>
not lawful for Chriſtians to tolerate a King,<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 5. c. 7.</note> being an
Infidel, or an Heretick, if he endeavour to draw his
Subjects unto his Hereſy or Infidelity: but to judge,
whether a King doth draw his Subjects to Hereſy or
no, doth belong to the Pope, unto whom is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the charge of Religion, and therefore it belongeth
to the Pope to judge, whether a King is to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or not."</q> Concerning the Aſſumption of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
touching the preſuppoſed charge of the Pope,
in matters of Religion, over all the Churches in the
World, we ſhall have a fitter occaſion to touch it, after
a ſort, in the next Chapter: Now we will only briefly
handle the falſhood of his Propoſition, <hi>Of the Power of
Subjects over their Soveraigns.</hi> Where, after he hath
abuſed a place in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and ſpent ſome idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of his own, he writeth in this ſort. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Although

and ſuch like; <hi>id fuit, quia deerant vires tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales
Chriſtianis;</hi> it came to paſs, becauſe Chriſtians
did then want temporal Forces. For that otherwiſe
they might lawfully ſo have done, appeareth by the
Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Where he commandeth new
Judges of temporal Cauſes to be appointed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that Chriſtians might not be compelled to
plead their Cauſe before a Judge, that was a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
of Chriſt. Upon which Text the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this Gloſs. <hi>Sicut novi Judices constitui potuerunt;
ita &amp; novi Principes, &amp; Reges propter eandem cauſam,
ſi vires adfuiſſent:</hi> as new Judges might have been
appointed; ſo might new Princes and Kings for the
ſame cauſe, if the Chriſtians then had been able, by
reaſon of their Forces, to have created, to themſelves,
ſuch new Kings and Princes."</q> Thus the <hi>Cardinal:</hi>
Who undoubtedly was brought into ſome hard ſtreight,
or elſe he would never have written in this ſort. St.
<hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> lived and dyed under <hi>Nero,</hi> who
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42183:115"/>
was a Perſecutor: and ſhall we think, that St. <hi>Peter</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul</hi> had taught the Chriſtians in thoſe days,
to have thruſt <hi>Nero</hi> from his Imperial Seat, by force of
Arms, if they had been able? Certainly it is a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
aſſertion, and worthy of as great a Cenſure,
as if he had termed thoſe holy Men, in plain terms,
Diſſembling Traytors, or denied the Scriptures to have
been written by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt.
Again, he himſelf is not ignorant, how groſly he lieth,
even againſt his own Conſcience, in ſaying, that it
was for want of ſtrength, that the Chriſtians in the
days of the other perſecuting Emperours, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
againſt them; <hi>Tertullian</hi> in expreſs terms affirming
the contrary: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Firſt, that they, the Chriſtians in his
times, wanted no Forces to have born Arms, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd
the whole Empire; And ſecondly, That
it was far from their hearts ſo to do, becauſe they
had been taught otherwiſe by the Doctrine of Chriſt
in his holy Goſpel.</q> Beſides, it is apparent, that in
and about <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, theſe four were Biſhops of
<hi>Rome, Victor, Zephyrinus, Calixtus,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus:</hi> ſo
as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> doth in effect caſt a great Imputation
upon them of negligence, or inſincerity; that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in their days, wanting neither number nor
ſtrength to have bridled their bad Emperours, they
by their Papal Authority did not depoſe them. <hi>Diocleſian</hi>
began his Empire about the year 288. during the time
of whoſe Government, <hi>Gaius, Marcellinus,</hi> and <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
were Popes, when the number of Chriſtians was
greatly encreaſed throughout all the World: and yet,
for ought that appeareth to the contrary, no Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
either Pope, Prieſt, or Prelate, did ſo much as
then dream of this damnable Doctrine. <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi>
began his Reign about the year of Chriſt 360.
and <hi>Valens</hi> 8. years after him; in whoſe times <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and <hi>Damaſus,</hi> were Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi>
was a Man that wanted no Courage: nevertheleſs
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42183:116"/>
we do not read, that either he, or <hi>Liberius,</hi> ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to Excommunicate, or depoſe, either of thoſe
Emperours, or that they held it lawful for them ſo to
have done. In the ſpace of time betwixt <hi>Nero,</hi> and
<hi>Damaſus,</hi> the moſt principal Men of all the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
lived, as <hi>Juſtinus Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,
Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, Athanaſius, Jerom,</hi>
and <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> who never had learned, nor did in their
times teach it for ſound Doctrine, either that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
had Authority to bear Arms againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns;
or that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> might lawfully
depoſe Kings and Princes, either for Hereſy, or for
Cruelty, and thruſt their Subjects (to ſerve their
turns) into ſuch furious and rebellious courſes. So as
it was great boldneſs, for the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of his own
Head, to broach ſo palpable an untruth; eſpecially
ſeeing it carrieth with it ſo many Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
his want herein of all Honeſty, Sincerity, and
Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould we be ſo earneſt with the Man? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that although it be certain, that neither St.
<hi>Peter</hi> not St. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any of the ſaid ancient Fathers
or Popes ever thought it lawful to depoſe ſuch Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Kings as before we have ſpoken of, when they
ſhould be able through the Numbers and Forces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſo to do; Yet the ſame did proceed in the moſt
of them from their Ignorance and want of Learning.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"For (ſaith he) that Chriſtians, if they had been able,
might ſo have done, is apparent by the Apoſtle's
words: where it is plain, that they had authority to
make Judges; and conſequently, that if they had
been able, they might have thruſt the ſaid wicked
Emperours from their Thrones, and have made to
themſelves new Kings of their own."</q> Aſſuredly the
Devil himſelf did never abuſe any place of Scripture

as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> doth this: and therefore we will

beſtow no great Pains to refute him. It ſhall be
ſufficient briefly to obſerve, that in the Judgments
of <hi>Jerom, Auſtin, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> the
Judges which here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, were only
ſuch, as might by way of Arbitrement, end ſuch Suits,
as aroſe amongſt Chriſtians in thoſe days; and not ſuch
Judges, as by Law and Authority might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
them to have ſtood to their Sentences: for that
had been indeed to have encroached upon the Authority
of the civil Magiſtrate; which was far from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's
intent and meaning.<note place="margin">Theodoret. in 1 Cor. 6.</note> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And therefore, ſaith <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,
Sciendum eſt,</hi> &amp;c. It is to be obſerved, that
theſe words (of chuſing Arbiters) do not repugn to
thoſe things which are written to the <hi>Romans.</hi> For
here the Apoſtle doth not command Chriſtians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the Magiſtrates, but willeth them that are injured,
not to uſe the Magiſtrates:"</q> meaning, that it was fitter
for Chriſtians to compound their cauſes and quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

And the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s own Doctor, commenting
likewiſe upon this place doth write in this ſort, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Sed

in all the Forms of Baptiſms which hitherto have been
publiſhed, we cannot learn, that there was ever any
ſuch expreſs Covenant, as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> here mentioneth,
required of any King, when he came to be Chriſtned.
Baptiſm is the Entrance, ordain'd by Chriſt, into the
Church, which is his ſpiritual Kingdom; and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the nature of that Kingdom, all who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to enter into it, of what Calling or Condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they are, as well poor as rich; private Perſons as
Princes, are (according to the Rules of Baptiſm pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in all the particular Churches in the World, for
ought that is known to the contrary) either themſelves
in their own Perſons, or if they be Infants, by their
Sureties to profeſs their belief in Chriſt, and to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
that <hi>they will forſake the Devil, and all his Works,
the vain Pomp and Glory of the World, with all covetous
deſires of the ſame, and carnal deſires of the Fleſh; and that
they do conſtantly believe God's holy word, and that they will
keep his Commandments.</hi> The willful breach of any of
which points, and perſeverance in it without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
doth indeed deprive every Chriſtian Man, of
what Calling ſoever he be, from the intereſt he had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42183:118"/>
(by his ſaid profeſſion and promiſe, when he was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized)
to the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt in this Life,
(that is, from being a true and lively Member of the
Church and myſtical Body of Chriſt) and from the
Kingdom of Glory in the Life to come. But that any
Man, by the breach of any Promiſe made when he
was Baptized, ſhould loſe that which he gain'd not by
his Baptiſm; or that the Church did never receive any
King or Prince to Baptiſm, but either upon condition
in expreſs terms, or by implication made either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or by his Godfathers, that he would ſubmit his
Scepter unto Chriſt, that is, unto the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
(as the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s drift ſheweth his meaning to be) and
promiſe to keep and defend the Faith of Chriſt under
pain of the loſs of his Kingdom, is certainly <hi>a Doctrine
of Devils,</hi> and was never heard of in the Church of
Chriſt for many hundred years; but is utterly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Analogy of Scripture, and to the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Chriſtian Baptiſm. Theſe ſecret intentions
(for, as we have ſaid, there was never any Form of
Baptiſm, that contain'd any ſuch expreſs contract, as
the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſpeaketh of) Mental Reſervations, and
hidden Compacts, ſuch as Men were never taught in
the Primitive Church, nor ever dream'd of, or ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be thruſt into one of the holy Sacraments, may
well become the Impoſtors of <hi>Rome,</hi> but are altogether
contrary to the meaning of Chriſt, and of his holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:
In whoſe days, he <hi>that believed was baptized
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
without any ſuch jugling, or ſnares laid to hazard and
entangle Mens temporal Eſtates. There is nothing in
the Goſpel, whereof Men ought to be aſhamed, or
which will not abide the touchſtone of truth, if it be
compared with the reſt of the Scriptures; or, that
doth not promote the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, it
being called in that reſpect, <hi>Evangelium Regni, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of the Kingdom.</hi> Now whether this underhand
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42183:118"/>
bargaining be ſuitable or no, with the ſincerity of the
Holy Ghoſt; or whether if it had been known in the
Primitive Church, that all Men, who would ſubmit
themſelves to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
did thereby bind themſelves to be ſubject, and
at the Commandment of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for the
time being, under pain to loſe all their Worldly Eſtates;
the knowledge thereof would not rather have hinder'd,
than either promoted or further'd the good ſucceſs of
the Goſpel; no Man is ſo ſimple, but he may eaſily
diſcern it. Aſſuredly the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who did ſo long
oppoſe themſelves againſt the Authority which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> did challenge over all Churches, were
ignorant of this myſtical point of Baptiſm: and ſo were
all the Churches in the World for many Ages, or elſe
there would not have been ſo great ſtirs in the World
about the continual Uſurpations and Encroachments of
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as are many ways teſtified by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories. But we inſiſt too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſo ridiculous and impudent a fiction, and
therefore will come to the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s principal reaſon of
the Pope's ſaid indirect temporal Authority, to toſs
Kings and Kingdoms up and down as he liſt.</p>

                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Eccleſiaſtical Commonwealth (ſaith he) muſt
be perfect and ſufficient of her ſelf, in order to her
own end; (for ſuch are all Commonwealths that
are well inſtituted) and therefore ſhe ought to have
all neceſſary Power to the obtaining of her own end.
But the Power of uſing and diſpoſing of temporal
things, is neceſſary to the Spiritual End; becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
Evil Princes might, without puniſhment,
nouriſh Hereticks, and overthrow Religion: and
therefore the Eccleſiaſtical Commonwealth hath this

have Authority to diſpoſe of temporal Kingdoms, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42183:119"/>
to puniſh Kings by depoſing them from their Crowns,
if he hold it expedient: For the refutation of which
vain and falſe Aſſertion, there are very many moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and apparent Arguments: We will only touch
ſome few of them. Our Saviour Chriſt in his days,
and the Apoſtles in their times, and the Primitive
Churches for the ſpace of 300. years, brought the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Commonwealth (as here it is termed) unto
her Spiritual End, as directly and fully, as either the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Biſhops have at any time
done ſince: and yet they took no Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
upon them, nor did challenge the ſame, of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of temporal Kingdoms, or Depoſing of Princes.
Beſides, if ſuch an indirect temporal Power be ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in theſe days, for the upholding the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Commonwealth, as that without the ſame ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain the Spiritual End, or be a perfect Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Commonwealth, when there are ſo many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings and Princes; then was the ſame much
more neceſſary for the attainment of the ſame end, in
the ſaid times of Chriſt, of his Apoſtles, and of the
Churches in the Ages following for 300. years, when
the civil Magiſtrates were Pagans and Infidels, and
for the moſt part, Perſecutors of the truth. But we
hope, we may be bold without offence to ſay, that
there appeared then no ſuch neceſſity of this pretended
temporal Power and Authority, in any Eccleſiaſtical
Perſons, over Kings and Kingdoms, for the diſpoſing
of them; and that nevertheleſs, the Eccleſiaſtical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
in thoſe times, did attain her Spiritual
End, and was as perfect an Eccleſiaſtical Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as it is now under the Pope's Government,
notwithſtanding all his temporal Sovereignty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſo ruffleth. Again, we are perſwaded, that it
cannot be ſhewed out of any of the ancient Fathers, or
by any general Council, for the ſpace of above 500.
years after Chriſt, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were ever
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42183:119"/>
imagin'd to have ſuch temporal Authority to depoſe
Kings, as now is maintained; much leſs was it ever
dream'd of, during that time, that ſuch Authority was
neceſſary for the attaining the Spiritual End, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the true Church of Chriſt ought to aim; or, that
the Eccleſiaſtical Commonwealth, ordain'd by Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, could not be perfect without it. It
were a miſerable ſhift, if any ſhould either ſay, that
during all the times above-mention'd, firſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and then the holy Biſhops, Martyrs, and Fathers
after them, were ignorant of this new temporal Power,
or at leaſt did not ſo throughly conſider of the neceſſity of
it, as they might have done; or that whilſt they lived,
there could indeed no ſuch matter be collected out of the
Scriptures, for that in thoſe days the Scriptures had
not received ſuch a ſenſe and meaning as might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the ſame: but that afterward, when the Biſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> did think it neceſſary to challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſuch temporal Authority, over both Kings and
Kingdoms, the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture
was alter'd. But be this ſhift never ſo wretched or
miſerable, yet (for ought we perceive) they are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and ſtill will be, both in this cauſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
driven unto it: the Scriptures being in their
hands a very <hi>Rule of Lead,</hi> and <hi>Noſe of Wax,</hi> as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more fit place we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew:
moreover, if the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have this great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Authority over Kings and Soveraign Princes, to
preſerve the State of the Church here upon Earth, that
ſhe may attain her Spiritual End; aſſuredly he hath
made little uſe of it to that purpoſe. For it is well
known, and cannot be denied, that for the firſt 300.
years of Chriſt, the Doctrine of the Goſpel did flouriſh
far and near, in <hi>Greece, Thracia, Sclavonia, Hungary,
Aſia minor, Syria, Aſſyria, Egypt,</hi> and throughout the
moſt part of <hi>Africk,</hi> where there were many very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Apoſtolical, and notable Churches; in the moſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42183:120"/>
of which places, there are ſcarce in theſe days any
footſteps or viſible Monuments of them. And although
afterward during the ſpace of above 700. years, much
miſchief was wrought in theſe parts of the World, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known unto us than the reſt, by ſundry ſorts of <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and <hi>Northern People:</hi> yet after the days of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
the Seventh,</hi> when the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> did moſt
vaunt of this their Soveraign Power over Kings and
Princes, the <hi>Turks</hi> gained and encroached more upon
Chriſtendom, ſtill retaining that which they then had
ſo gotten, than at any time before. Whereby it is to
us very evident, that neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles,
ever ordained, that the means of building of the Church
of Chriſt, and the conſervation of it, ſhould conſiſt in
the temporal Power or Authority of any of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
to deprive Emperours or Kings from their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
or Regal Eſtates: and that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>
may be aſhamed, that having had ſo great Authority
in their own hands, extorted from the Emperours, and
other Kings, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> ſince <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh's
time, they have made no better uſe of it; but ſuffer'd
ſo many famous Countries and Kingdoms to be utterly
over-run and waſted by Pagans and Infidels; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they pretend themſelves to have ſo great an
Authority for no other purpoſe, but only the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, that ſhe might not be prevented of
her Spiritual End. But what ſhould we ſpeak of the
ſhame of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe forehead hath been ſo long ſince
hardned? or ever imagine, that Almighty God either
did, or will bleſs her Uſurpations and Inſolencies againſt
Emperours, Kings and Princes, for any good to his
Church, other than muſt accrue unto her through her
Perſecutions and Afflictions? For it were no great
labour to make it moſt apparent by very many Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
if we would inſiſt upon it, that the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in ſtriving firſt to get, and then to uphold (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their ſcrambling manner) this their wicked and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42183:120"/>
uſurped Authority of troubling and vexing Chriſtian
Kingdoms and States with their manifold Oppreſſions
and quarrels, have been ſome ſpecial means, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Saracens, Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> have wrought, and
by degrees brought ſo great a part of Chriſtendom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Slavery, as now they are poſſeſſed of. For
it is but an idle and a vain pretence, that the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of as much of Chriſtendom, as is yet free from the
<hi>Turk</hi> and Paganiſm, is to be aſcribed to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and his Authority, that ſo the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
might attain her Spiritual End, which ought to be the
planting of Churches and Conſervation of 'em: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt manifeſt, to as many as have any wit, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and ſound Judgment, that as the very ſituation
of the ſaid Countries, which now Pagans enjoy, made
them very ſubject unto the Incurſion and Invaſions of
<hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> God himſelf, for his own Glory,
having his Finger and juſt operation therein; ſo through
his moſt merciful goodneſs, and care of his Church, he
bleſſed the ſituation of the reſt of Chriſtendom, being
now free in that reſpect from thoſe kind of violences,
and endowed the hearts of Chriſtian Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with ſuch Courage and Conſtancy, in defence of
Chriſtianity, and of their Kingdoms, as notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Popes did greatly vex them in the mean
while, they did mightily repel the Forces of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and moſt religiouſly uphold and maintain the
profeſſion of Chriſt: So, as the preſervation of the
Goſpel in theſe parts of the World, may more truly be
attributed to the working of the Spirit of God in them,
than to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> who have been the
chief Authors and occaſions of many incredible miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
                  <p>Now laſtly, and for concluſion of this point; had
not Satan with all Power and Signs, and lying Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſo inveigled and ſeduced the hearts and minds of
the adherents to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that by degrees,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42183:121"/>
they leaving the love of the truth, are therefore <hi>given
over by God unto ſuch strong deluſions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
lyes</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh;) amongſt many
other of the groſs errours maintained by them, we
might marvel at this, that ever they durſt take upon
them, in theſe times of ſo great light, to write and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it with ſuch reſolution and confidence, that the
Eccleſiaſtical Commonwealth (as they term it) cannot
be perfect, nor attain her Spiritual End, except the
Pope may have the ſaid temporal Power and Authority
to depoſe Kings: conſidering how far the true nature
of the Church, which is the Spiritual Kingdom of
Chriſt; and the true Means and Armour, that Chriſt,
our Spiritual King, hath indeed ordained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for the Edification and Defence of this his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Kingdom, and for the attainment of the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and right end and beauty of it, are repugnant
to theſe their Carnal, and Worldly conceits. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true nature of the Church, and Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt, we have before ſpoken: and the true
Spiritual End of the Church, being by teaching the
ways of truth, to bring as many as poſſibly they can, to
the knowledge of their Salvation, through Chriſt, ſo
as by Faith they may become true Members of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Kingdom in the Life to come; the means or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
for that purpoſe, do contain the full duty and
office of all Biſhops and Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters; who
are furniſhed by Chriſt, neither with temporal Swords,
nor Imperial Authority to depoſe Kings and Soveraign
Princes, but ought to carry themſelves toward all Men,
eſpecially towards Kings and Princes, if they be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pagans, or Enemies to Religion, as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and his Apoſtles did; by Preaching and Praying
for them, by Humility and Patience, to endure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
puniſhment ſhall be thought fit to be impoſed
upon them for doing of their duties; and never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit
ſuch their pains and diligence, to the end, that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42183:121"/>
if it pleaſe God to bleſs thoſe their Miniſterial ſo great
labours, their Auditors of all ſorts, private Perſons,
Kings and Prince, may be brought to the knowledge
of the truth; that ſo Satan being expelled out of their
hearts, Chriſt by Faith may raign in them. To the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of which ſo great and ſo divine an alteration, and
change in Mens Souls, there is no Worldly Force, nor
temporal Sword, which will ſerve the turn. And
therefore the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of this matter, doth
write in this ſort;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not
carnal:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid; We do not come
with Troops of Men to promote the Spiritual Kingdom
of Chriſt; but with Weapons of another nature, with
the glad ridings of the Goſpel, with the Doctrine of
Salvation to all Believers, and with the Furniture of
the Holy Ghoſt: which Weapons are not weak, but
mighty through God, and able to caſt down holds,
that is, all the carnal Forces of Men, all Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Powers, that ſhall preſume to riſe up againſt
Chriſt. And through the aſſurance and experience,
which both St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, had
in the force of theſe Weapons, he ſaith further, <hi>that with
them they overthrew Councils, and every high thing, that
did exalt it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God; and that
they brought into Captivity, all imagination or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Apoſtles did ordain to be uſed, for winning
Men at the firſt to embrace the Goſpel: or,

either directly or indirectly, to Depoſe

himſelf put to death, as holding, that the
Church could not attain to her Spiritual
End, except he had ſo done: or, that by the
death of Chriſt, the Church did not attain
to her Spiritual End, without the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any Emperours or Kings from their
Regal Eſtates: or, that ever the Apoſtles
in their days, either preached or writ, that
the Eccleſiaſtical Commonwealth could not
be perfect, except St. <hi>Peter</hi> for his time, and
after him the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould have
temporal Power and Authority to Depoſe
Emperours and Kings, that the Church
might attain her Spiritual End: or, that
the Church in their days did not attain to
her Spiritual End, although no ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was then, either challenged, or put
in practice: or, that the Church could have
attain'd to that her Spiritual End in the
Apoſtle's times, if the ſaid temporal Power
and Authority had been then neceſſary for
the attaining of it: or, that our Saviour
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, did propound a
Spiritual End unto his Church, and left
no other neceſſary means for the obtaining
of it, than ſuch as could not be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
either in their days, or for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after: or, that the Churches of
Chriſt, after the Apoſtle's times, for the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42183:125"/>
ſpace of 300. years, being wonderfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with ſundry Perſecutions, did not
attain to their Spiritual End, without
this dream'd off Temporal Authority of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Kings and Emperours, then their
mortal Enemies, not in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but of the Doctrine of Salvation,
which they taught to their Subjects: or,
that this new Doctrine of the Neceſſity, that
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have temporal
Authority, either directly or indirectly, to
Depoſe Emperours and Kings, for any
cauſe whatſoever, (or that elſe the Church
of Chriſt ſhould not be able to attain to her
Spiritual End) was ever heard of, for
ought that appeareth for many hundreds of
years after the Apoſtles times, either in any
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, or in any of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers, by us abovementioned: or,
that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all their
Adherents, whilſt they would make the
World believe, that the Church of Chriſt
cannot attain her Spiritual End, except
they have temporal Authority, indirectly to
Depoſe for ſome Cauſes, Emperours,
Kings, and Soveraign Princes, are more
learned now, than either the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or the Apoſtles themſelves were;
and that they know the ſenſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42183:126"/>
better, than either they the ſaid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers did, or the Apoſtles that writ
them; who (for ought that was known
for many hundred years) never preached,
taught, or intended to have any ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
collected out of their Writings and
Works: or, that it may, without great
Impiety, be once imagined, that if ſuch a
neceſſary point of Doctrine, concerning the
ſaid great temporal Power in the Pope over
Princes, as without the which, the Church
of Chriſt could not attain her Spiritual
End, had been known to the Apoſtles and
Ancient Fathers, they would not have been
as careful and zealous to have preached and
divulged the ſame unto all Poſterity, as now
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Adherents
are: or, that we ought not rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their
Adherents, through their forſaking the love
of the Truth, are given over by God unto
thoſe ſtrong Illuſions, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
lies, and maintain them as ſtifly as
though they were true, than once to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the holy Apoſtles and ancient
Fathers, were either ignorant of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
temporal Authority to Depoſe Kings
and Princes, for the end ſo often mentioned,
or thought it fit to diſſemble it, or to write
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42183:126"/>
of it ſo darkly, as for many Hundred years
it could not be underſtood: or, that God
hath not wonderfully blinded the hearts and
underſtandings, both of the Popes, and
all their Adherents in this particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(amongſt many others) in that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Church, and Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt conſidered, they dare preſume
to maintain it ſo confidently, that the ſaid
Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to her Spiritual End, without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Temporal Authority, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly
in ſome Caſes, to Depoſe Kings
and Soveraign Princes: or, that the true
Spiritual End of the Church conſiſting in
this, that the Devil being baniſhed out of
the hearts of all her true Members, Chriſt
may retain his Poſſeſſion of them, through
their Faith and diligence, to repel Satan,
who daily laboureth to regain to himſelf his
own Poſſeſſion; it is not more than a kind
of phrenſy, to hold and maintain, that any
temporal Authority, managed by the Pope,
or by his Commandment, againſt Kings
and Princes, hath any force or power, to
work or procure this Spiritual End, either
by expelling or repelling of Satan, or to
nouriſh Faith, or to continue the reigning
of Chriſt in any Mens hearts: or, that it
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42183:127"/>
is not an impious and a profane aſſertion
for any Man to defend, that the Weapons
and Armour of this Spiritual Warfare,
undertaken by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and
by all godly Biſhops, and true Prieſts and
Miniſters of the Goſpel, are not ſufficient
of themſelves to procure to the Church her
Spiritual End, without the Pope's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Weapons, or temporal Authority to
Depoſe Kings, when to him, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance

have ſhewed at large, that our Saviour Chriſt, the
Son of God, having created the World, and taken upon
him to be the Redeemer of Mankind, after their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
through <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, did not only, as he was the Son

did (for his own Glory, and our endleſs Comfort)
erect for himſelf, in this World, a Spiritual Kingdom,
called his Church, conſiſting of ſuch Men, diſperſed

being himſelf the only Head and Governour of it (in

                     <hi>In the Gloſs of one of the Books of the Canon-Law,</hi>

                     <hi>not long ſince Printed, and approved by</hi> Gregory <hi>the

                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Item, quia Chriſtus, &amp;c."</q> Alſo, becauſe Jeſus Christ,
the Son of God, when he was in the World, and alſo from
everlaſting was the natural Lord; and by the natural Law
he might have given Sentences againſt the Emperour, and
any other whatſoever, of Depoſition and damnation, and
any other Sentences; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tpote in perſonas, quas creaverat,

<hi>What? would Pope</hi> Gregory, <hi>by his Canoniſts, make
Men to believe, that all Emperours, Kings, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Princes, are Perſons of the Pope's Creation? or,
that he doth beſtow on them freely, any gifts or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Nature? or, that their preſervation doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon his good favour and Providence? But the
idle Canoniſt, his Wit doth ſerve him no better, than
to make (in effect) this fond Collection: Chriſt, the
Creator of all things, doth govern, rule, diſpoſe, and
preſerve all his own Creatures: therefore the Pope muſt
likewiſe govern, rule, diſpoſe and preſerve them all,
though he created none of them. And why muſt he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42183:128"/>
ſo do? he wanteth not a very ſubſtantial reaſon that
moved him ſo to collect; which followeth in his own
words:</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Nam non videretur Dominus diſcretus fuiſſe

Harding, <hi>one of our own Countrymen, doth wholly

us to believe, that to one Man, the chief and highest of all
Biſhops, the Succeſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Rule and Government
of the Church, by God, hath been deferred. <hi>And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth expreſs his opinion to this effect;</hi> That if God
had not ordain'd ſuch a Monarchical Church-Government;
he ſhould have brought in amongst his faithful People, that
unruly confuſion and deſtruction of all Commonwealths, ſo
much abhorred of Princes, which the Grecians call an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
which is a state, for lack of order in Governours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Government at all.</p>
                  <p>That our Saviour Chriſt is the ſole Governour, Head,
and Archbiſhop of his <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as he is the
only Governour, Ruler, and Monarch, over all the
World: and that his Diſcretion, and Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is no more to be blemiſhed, or impeached, by
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42183:129"/>
the Cavils of any Impoſtors, in that he hath appointed
no one Prieſt, Archbiſhop, or Pope, to be his Vicar-General,
over the whole Catholick Church, than for
that he hath not aſſigned any one King, Emperour, or
Monarch, to rule the whole World under him; this is
the point, that here we purpoſe to make good: taking
it in this place for granted, that there was never any
one Man in the World, to whom our Saviour Chriſt
did commit the Government of it, after the time that
it was Peopled, and throughly inhabited; that is, from
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood at the leaſt hitherto. They, that labour
to prove, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Head of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church, and that Chriſt ſhould have ſhewed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Diſcretion, or Providence, if he had not ſo ordain'd
it, do inſiſt very much upon the grounds of natural
reaſon and philoſophy;<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 1. c. 2.</note> telling us out of <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,
Plutarch, Iſocrates, Stobaeus, Heſiodus, Euripides, Homer,
Herodotus,</hi> and divers others, That of all the kinds of
Government that are, the Monarchical Government is
the beſt; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That in a great Hoſt, conſiſting of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of divers Nations and Countries, and perhaps
of many Soveraign Princes, and Kings, there muſt
be one General to govern them all; That all things
naturally have a propenſion and aptneſs to Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government; That Bees of every Hive have
their King; That in every Flock of Sheep there is a
principal Ram; That in every Herd of Cattel hath a
Leader; That Cranes do not fly promiſcuouſly, and
in heaps, but have one whom they do all very orderly
follow;<note place="margin">Sand. de viſib. Monarch. l. 3.</note> That amongſt Coeleſtial Spheres, there is but
one <hi>Primum Mobile;</hi> That in the number of the lights
of the World, one is greater than the reſt; That
there is a certain Principality in the Elements; That
the Fountain is but one, from whence divers times
there flow ſundry Streams; That into one Sea all

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42183:129"/>
one,<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 1. c. 9.</note> which is ſimply one, than a multitude conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in one;"</q> And that for theſe, and many other
like reaſons, ſeeing the Monarchical Government is
beſt, and that we may be ſure, that Chriſt would
have his Church governed by the beſt manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
(except we ſhould think him to have dealt
abſurdly, as a Perſon void, both of good Diſcretion
and Providence); It followeth therefore, that Chriſt
committed the Government of it unto one; firſt to St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> and then to his Succeſſor, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
for the time being. If this one <hi>Jeſuit</hi> and his Fellows,
would upon the ſaid Philoſophical premiſes, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
thus, That it therefore had followed, that
Chriſt himſelf doth not only retain in his own hands,
the ſole Government of his Catholick Church, as he is the
only Redeemer of it, but likewiſe the ſole Government
of the whole World, as he is the Creator of it; the
Concluſion had been true, although the premiſes had
not enforced it. But how ſtifly ſoever they meant to
inſiſt upon the ſaid Concluſion, without any regard of
truth, ſo they may blear the Eyes of the ſimpler ſort
with ſuch their vain Illuſions; We may be bold (as
we hope) reſolutely to defend and maintain it, that
the ſaid natural reaſons are of as great ſtrength to prove,
That there ought of neceſſity to be one temporal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
over all the World, as one Eccleſiaſtical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
over the whole <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> although in
very deed they are far too feeble and weak, to prove
either the one or the other. For who knoweth not,
that when the Philoſophers did write in commendation
of the Monarchical Government, they only had Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to particular Nations and Countries; endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prove, that it was better for them ſeverally to be
ruled by that Form of Government, which is called
Monarchical, than by any of the reſt, Ariſtocratical,
Democratical, or any other? And it was ſo far from
their meaning, to have their ſaid reaſons wreſted to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42183:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prove, that one mortal Man ought to have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> the Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt; as they never dreamed (for ought that
appeareth) that one Man, in their Judgment, was fit
or able to take upon him the Temporal Government of
the whole World: To which purpoſe, a principal
Lawyer amongſt our Adverſaries,<note place="margin">Covatruv. 2. part. Relect. § 9. tom. 1. num. 5.</note> doth write in this
ſort. <hi>Naturâ ipſâ inſtitutum non eſt, quòd univerſus Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
uni Principi ſubditus ſit. It is not ordain'd by nature,
that the whole World ſhould be ſubject to one Prince.</hi> If
then it be an idle vanity for any Man to go about by
natural reaſon to prove, that one Man ought to be the
temporal Monarch of all the World, which nature
her ſelf did never intend: it is then certainly a kind of
madneſs or phrenzy, to rely upon ſuch proofs for the
Popes ſpiritual Authority over the whole <hi>Catholick
Church;</hi> neither of them both being comprehenſible,
or ſubject to the apprehenſions of nature.</p>
                  <p>Again, theſe Patrons for the Pope, and his Primacy,
over the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> have not only ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
as we have heard, drawn from natural reaſon,
but ſome likewiſe deduced from ſundry ſimilitudes, and
thoſe out of the Scriptures; upon which they rely with
ſome more confidence, as reaſon is they ſhould: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 1. c. 2.</note> that God made all Mankind, <hi>ex uno Adamo, of
one Adam;</hi> to ſignify thereby, that he would have all
Men to depend, <hi>ab uno, of one:</hi> but the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was a figure of the new; and that therefore, as
there was but one High-Prieſt amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
that one Church; ſo now there muſt be but one Pope
to govern all the Churches in the World: that <hi>Aaron</hi>
was not only a figure of Chriſt, but likewiſe of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
that the Church is compared to <hi>an Hoſt well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;
to a humane Body; to a Kingdom; to a Fold; to
an Houſe; to a Ship;</hi> and that therefore ſhe muſt have but
one Captain; one humane Head; one King; one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;
one Houſholder; and one Pilot: that although
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42183:130"/>
there be but one, and proper Head of the Church,
which is Chriſt, that governeth the ſame ſpiritually,
yet ſhe hath need of one viſible Head, or otherwiſe
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other Biſhops, Paſtors,
Doctors, and Miniſters, were needleſs: that although
Chriſt be the Head of the Church, yet he ought to
have one underneath him, by whom ſhe may be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned;
as a King, when he is preſent, may govern
his Kingdom himſelf; but being abſent, doth uſually
appoint another under him, who is called his Vice-Roy:
that every Dioceſs and Province hath her Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Archbiſhops, to govern the particular
Churches under them, within their ſeveral Charges;
and that therefore there muſt be one Biſhop of the
whole Catholick Church, to rule and govern them all:
Laſtly, That as there is but one God, one Faith, and
one Baptiſm; ſo there muſt be in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
but one chief Biſhop and Judge, upon whom all Men
ought to depend. Many more are the reaſons, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon divers other ſimilitudes, which our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
have heaped up together, to uphold the Pope's
Authority: all of them being as vain and frivolous as
the former. For it is certain and manifeſt, that as the
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> is reſembled in the Scriptures, to an Hoſt
well ordered, to a humane Body, to a Kingdom, to a Flock
of Sheep, to an Houſe, and to a Ship: ſo Chriſt only is
intended thereby to be her only General, her only Head,
her only King, her only Shepherd, her only Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and her only Pilot. Neither can any other thing
be inforced from the words mentioned of one Faith, and
one Baptiſm, but that as we are only juſtified through
a lively Faith in Chriſt, ſo there is but one Baptiſm
ordain'd, whereby we have our firſt entrance into his
Spiritual Kingdom, and are made particular Members
of his <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Beſides, in the like ſenſe, that
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is reſembled to an Hoſt well order'd,
to a humane Body, to a Kingdom, to a Flock, to an
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42183:131"/>
Houſe, to a Ship; ſo may the Univerſal Kingdom of
Chriſt over the whole World, as he is the Creator of
it, be reſembled to them all, and the aforeſaid Titles
reſpectively attributed unto him. The whole World
is an Hoſt, under him, well order'd, and he is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of it. The whole World is but as one Body,
whereof he is the Head; being the Life of all Men, from
whom, as from their Head, they have their Senſe,
Underſtanding, and Motion. The whole Univerſal
World is but his Kingdom, and he is the King of it,
ruling and diſpoſing it, as ſeemeth beſt to his divine
Wiſdom. The whole World is with him but one
Flock, and he is the Shepherd of it, all Men in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sheep of his Paſture, to whom he giveth food
and ſuſtentation in due ſeaſon. Alſo he ordereth all
the affairs in the World, as a good Houſholder doth
order and direct all the buſineſſes and troubles apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to his Family. Likewife the whole World may
aptly be compared to a Ship, in that the State of all
Mankind, living in it, is ſubject, as a Ship on the Sea,
unto all manner of contrary Winds, Tempeſts, and
Storms; of which Ship were not Chriſt, as he is the
Creator of the World, the only Pilot, the World could
not ſubſiſt. And as the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is reſembled
to a Fold, which containeth in it all that believe in
Chriſt; ſo may the univerſal Kingdom of Chriſt, over
all the World, be compared unto a Fold, in that it
containeth in it all Mankind generally, his Heavenly
Care and Providence evermore protecting them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as there is but one <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> one
Head, or Spiritual Ruler of it, (Chriſt our Redeemer)
one Chriſtian Faith, one Baptiſm, one Goſpel, one
Truth, one and the ſelf-ſame Form or Nature of all the
ſeveral Theological Virtues, and one Inheritance;
which are all of them to be taught, embraced, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by all that are true Members of the <hi>Catholick
Church:</hi> So there is but one Univerſal Kingdom in all
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42183:131"/>
the World (the Creator of it being the ſole Emperour
and Governour of it) one moral Faith, one Nature of
Truth to be obſerved amongſt all, one rule and nature
of Juſtice, one moral Law, one nature of Equity, one
Kind, Form, or Nature of all the ſeveral Virtues, both
Moral and Intellectual, which are to be put in practice,
as occaſion requireth, in this one Empire, by as many,
as expect from Chriſt, their Emperour, any happy
ſucceſs in their Worldly affairs. But as all theſe Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the temporal Monarchy of Chriſt, are no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
grounds to warrant this aſſertion, that there
ought to be one temporal King or Emperour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Chriſt to govern the whole World; ſo the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Unities, are not able to
eſtabliſh, or uphold this Inference; That one Pope
muſt of neceſſity have the Government under Chriſt of
the whole <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Alſo from the authority
of Scripture, that God made all Mankind of one <hi>Adam,</hi>
to ſignify, that he would have all Men to depend upon
one; why may it not as well be collected, that he
meant, that all the Men in the World ſhould depend
upon one Emperour for cauſes Temporal, as upon one
Pope in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical? Likewiſe it is a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
conceit, that our <hi>Jeſuit</hi> maintaineth, when he
ſaith, That although Chriſt be the Head of the Church,
yet he ought to have one underneath him, by whom
ſhe may be governed; as a King, when he is preſent,
may govern his Kingdom himſelf, and when he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
appoint his Vice-Roy. Of likelyhood this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
would perſwade us, that Chriſt is ſometimes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from his Church; to the end, that the Pope may
be his grand Deputy: For otherwiſe, by his own
Example, Chriſt may govern the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Pope; as the King, ruling himſelf in his own
Kingdom, needeth no Vice-Roy. That Chriſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
abſent from his Church; but doth by his Power,
Grace and Virtue of the Holy Ghoſt, ſtill defend and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42183:132"/>
protect it. It is plain by his own words, where he
ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Lo, I am with you always unto the end of the World.</hi>
It is true, that he told his Apoſtles, that <hi>he was to depart
from them;</hi> meaning, that they muſt be deprived of
his Corporal preſence: but did he ſignify unto them,
that for their comfort he would leave St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his
place, and after him the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Succeſſors, to govern his Church to the end of the
World? No ſuch matter. Theſe are our Saviour
Chriſt's words.<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go away:
for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">—v. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I will ſend him unto you.</hi> Again, <hi>When he
is come, which is the Spirit of truth, he will lead you into all
truth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 16, 17.</note> Again, <hi>I will pray to my Father, and he ſhall give
you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
even the Spirit of Truth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">—v. 26.</note> Again, <hi>The Comforter, which
is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will ſend in my Name,
he ſhall teach you all things.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">—v. 18.</note> And again, <hi>I will not leave
you comfortleſs; but I will come unto you.</hi> Which he doth
continually, when he upholdeth his Church daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Satan, and all that do malign it. So, as we may
far more rightly and ſafely, term the Holy Ghoſt to be
Chriſt's Vicar-General over all the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
than we may aſcribe that title to the Pope: the Holy
Ghoſt being ever preſent and ready, not only to defend
the Church generally, but to aid and comfort every
particular Member of it, whereſoever they are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon the face of the Earth; which we ſuppoſe the
Pope is not able to perform.</p>
                  <p>We have before laboured to make it manifeſt, that
our Saviour Chriſt is the Creator of the World, and
the Governour of it; that he hath redeemed and ſanctified
unto himſelf his Church, whereof he is the ſole
Monarch; that he hath neither appointed any one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
under him to govern the whole World, nor
any one Prieſt or Archbiſhop, to rule the whole <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church;</hi> that, as in reſpect of Chriſt, the Creator,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42183:132"/>
all the World is but one Kingdom, whereof he is the
only King; ſo, in reſpect of Chriſt our Redeemer, all
that believe in his name, whereſoever they are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
are but one <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and that the ſaid one
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> is not otherwiſe viſible in this World,
than is the ſaid one Univerſal Kingdom of Chriſt, the
Creator of it; <hi>viz.</hi> by the ſeveral and diſtinct parts of
them, as by this, or that National Church, by this, or
that temporal Kingdom. For our Saviour Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made the external Government of his <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> ſuitable to the Government of his Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
over all the World, hath by the Inſtitution of
the Holy Ghoſt order'd to be placed in every Kingdom
(as before in another place we have obſerved) Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
Biſhops, and inferiour Miniſters, to govern
the particular Churches therein planted; Prieſts, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
in every particular Pariſh, and over them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
within their ſeveral Dioceſſes; as likewiſe Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
to have the Inſpection and charge over all the
reſt, according to the Platform ordain'd (in ſubſtance)
by himſelf in the Old Teſtament; as he hath in like
manner appointed Kings and Sovereign Princes, with
their inferiour Magiſtrates of divers ſorts, to rule and
govern his People under him, in every Kingdom;
Country, and Sovereign Principality; ſome of their
ſaid inferiour Magiſtrates having Authority from their
Soveraigns in particular Pariſhes, ſome in Hundreds,
ſome in Shires or Countries, and ſome in Governments
of larger extents; there being amongſt them all divers
degrees of Perſons, one over another, and their Kings
and Soveraign Princes, excelling them all in Power
and Authority, as the Perſons appointed by God, to
rule and direct all their Subjects, of what calling ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
in the right uſe of the Authority and Magiſtracy;
which they have committed unto them.</p>
                  <p>And we cannot but wonder, as well at our ſaid <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi>
where he ſaith, That although there be but one,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42183:133"/>
and proper Head of the Church, which is Chriſt, that
governeth the ſame ſpiritually; yet ſhe hath need of
one viſible Head, or otherwiſe the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
all other Biſhops, Paſtors, Doctors, and Miniſters,
were needleſs; as likewiſe at our Countryman <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
who ſaith (as is above-noted) that if God had not
deferred to one Man, that is, to <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
the Rule and Government of the Church, he
ſhould have brought, amongſt his faithful People, that
unruly Confuſion which is called an Anarchy. For,
were theſe their vain conceits and imaginations true,
then would it by the ſame reaſon follow, that albeit
there be but one, and proper Monarch over all the
World (which is Chriſt that created it) yet the ſame
hath need of one viſible Monarch; or otherwiſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
and all other Kings, Princes, and civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
were needleſs; or otherwiſe, Chriſt ſhould
have left amongſt his People throughout the World,
that unruly confuſion and deſtruction of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
ſo much abhorred of Princes, which the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
call an Anarchy; which is a ſtate, for lack of
order in Governours, without any Government at all.
The fondneſs of which two conſequents, do ſo plainly
argue the folly and falſhood of the two former, as we
need no other refutation of them. For if all Chriſtian
Kingdoms, and Soveraign Princes, would baniſh the
Pope, with his Uſurped Authority, as the Monarchy
of <hi>Britany</hi> hath done, and retain under them the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Form of Church-Government, by Archbiſhops
and Biſhops, with other degrees of Miniſters (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have divers times ſpecified) they ſhould find
the Churches, in their ſeveral Dominions, as well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by them (the ſaid Archbiſhops and Biſhops)
without one Pope to rule the whole <hi>Catholick Church;</hi>
as they have experience of the ſufficiency of their
own Regal and Soveraign Form of Government in
their ſeveral Kingdoms and Countries, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42183:133"/>
there be no one Monarch over all the World to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or direct them. And for an Example not to be
controlled, to make this good that here we affirm; we
leave unto them God's own Form both of Temporal
and Eccleſiaſtical Government, eſtabliſhed by himſelf
amongſt his own people the <hi>Jews.</hi> Nay, why ſhould
we doubt, but that Kings and Soveraign Princes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Miſts and Darkneſs wherewith the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have daily ſought to dim their Eyes,
have had long ſince a Glimpſe of this Light, and Truth?
About 400. and ſome odd Years ſince, in the latter end
of the Reign of <hi>Henry the ſecond,</hi> and in the days of
<hi>Richard the firſt,</hi> both of them Kings of <hi>England,</hi> firſt
<hi>Baldwin</hi> and then <hi>Hubertus</hi> being Archbiſhops of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
there was a mighty Controverſy betwixt them
and the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the erecting of a new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church in <hi>Lambeth;</hi> the ſaid Kings and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
having a reſolution utterly to baniſh out of this
Kingdom the Popes Authority, if the Monks of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
in their Allegation to Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> againſt the ſaid
Cathedral Church, did inform him truly. Theſe are their
Words, as they are recorded by <hi>Reginaldus,</hi> one of the
ſaid Monks (as it ſeemeth) then living, who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a whole Book of that matter.<note place="margin">Reginaldi Ep. de temp. Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wini. p. 98. col. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>In tantum enim jam
opus proceſſit, quod ibi ordinatur Decanus, Praepoſitus, &amp;

Eccleſiae, ſed (quod Deus avertat) ne hujus rei
occaſione ſedis Apoſtolicae Autoritati in partibus Anglicanis

Henricus machinabatur, approbant quamplures Epiſcopi;
hâc de cauſâ (ut dictum eſt) ut poſſent de ſub jugo ſanctae Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae
Eccleſiae colla excutere. Now the building of the ſaid
Church is ſo forward, that there is ordain'd there a Dean,
a Provoſt, and more than 40. Canons, founded of the Goods
of the Church of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>by birth Noblemen, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Wealth, Allies of the King, and of the Biſhops.
Some of them do adhere to the King; ſome have Offices in
the Exchequer; all of them familiar Friends to the Biſhops,
and of a Confederacy with them. Againſt ſuch and ſo great
Perſons, what is the Church of</hi> Canterbury <hi>able to do? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is to be feared, not only that the Church of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
<hi>ſhall hereby be overthrown; but that upon this occaſion,
the Authority of the Apoſtolical See (which God forbid) ſhall
in</hi> England <hi>be greatly diminiſh'd und prejudiced. For when
this Canonry or Cathedral Church was founded, it was the
common fame, and the opinion of every Man, that it was
founded to this end, that Biſhops ſhould be there as it were
Cardinals, and that the Archbiſhop ſhould ſit amongſt them
as Pope, and that there all Appeals and complaints ſhould be
determined. This aſſuredly was plotted by King</hi> Henry, <hi>and
the ſame very many Biſhops do allow, for this cauſe or end,
that ſo they might deliver their Necks from under the Yoke
of the Holy Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>Again after the Death of <hi>Celeſtin</hi> the Fourth, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
being at ſo great a Diſſention amongſt themſelves
as that they could not agree for the ſpace of a Year and
nine Months, who ſhould ſucceed him; both the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>
and the <hi>French</hi> were greatly moved and offended
therewith. The Emperour finding his advice unto
them to haſten their Choice, to be deſpiſed and
ſcorned, and how diſhoneſtly ſome of them had broken
their Promiſes and Oaths unto him made in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
he gathered a great Hoſt, and dealt ſharply with
them. And from <hi>France</hi> they received a Meſſage, that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42183:134"/>
if they continued to dally, as they did, in prolonging
the choice of a new Pope, they would utterly leave
<hi>Rome,</hi> and chooſe to themſelves a Pope of their own,
to govern the Churches on this ſide the <hi>Alps.</hi> Hereof
<hi>Matthew Paris</hi> writeth thus.<note place="margin">Matt. Paris ad annum 1243.</note>

that either the Cardinals ſhould more ſpeedily provide

due choice of a new Pope: or elſe they themſelves (the
French) becauſe of their negligence, would forthwith fall
into deliberation of chooſing and providing for themſelves a
Pope on this ſide the Mountains, whom they might be bound
to obey. Thus the ſaid Hiſtory. Whereby, as alſo by
the former words of the Monks of <hi>Canterbury</hi> it is very
evident, that both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> was long ſince
in deliberation to have abandon'd the Authority of the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> out of both thoſe Kingdoms, as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no neceſſity of the Univerſal overſwaying power
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Papacy; and that the Churches within
their ſeveral Countries and Territories, might receive
as great benefit and comfort, by the Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their own Archbiſhops, in every reſpect,
as ever they had done from the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> For
as it may truly be ſaid, not of one King to govern all
the World, but of every particular King in his own
Kingdom; ſo may it be truly affirmed, not of one Pope
to govern the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but of every
Archbiſhop, in any National Church and Province, to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42183:135"/>
rule and direct the ſame; that under the Government
of one <hi>(viz.</hi> of Kings for temporal Cauſes, and of
Archbiſhops for Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes) there is the beſt
order, the greateſt ſtrength, the moſt ſtability for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
and the eaſieſt manner and form of ruling.</p>
                  <p>We have ſpoken hitherto of the Government of the
Church, eſpecially as it was in the Apoſtles times and
afterward, for the ſpace of 300. years, when the civil
Magiſtrates were Enemies unto it. Whereby we do
infer, that if the particular Churches, ſetled then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in every Country and Nation throughout the
World, had ſo good ſucceſs, when there were no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Magiſtrates, nor had any aſſiſtance of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Sword, for the ſtrengthning of their Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government, but only Miniſters, to teach and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their Pariſhioners in the ways of Godlineſs; and
Biſhops over them in every Dioceſs, to overſee and
rule, as well the Miniſters, as the ſeveral People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge, that they taught no new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or ran into Schiſms; and Archbiſhops over
them all, in every National Church and Province, for
the moderating and appeaſing of ſuch oppoſitions and
diſſentions, as might otherwiſe have riſen amongſt the
Biſhops, and ſo conſequently have wrought great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
betwixt their <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Churches: how much
more then are the ſaid particular Churches like to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
and proſper, under ſuch a Form of Eccleſiaſtical
Government, wherein the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to be, as the chief Member of the Church, ſo
the chief Governour of it; to keep as well the ſaid
Archbiſhops within their bounds and limits, as all the
reſt of the Clergy, and Chriſtians, Biſhops, Miniſters,
and Pariſhioners, that every one, in their ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
may execute and diſcharge their diſtinct Offices
and Duties which are committed unto them.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall have fit occaſion hereafter to ſpeak of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42183:135"/>
Authority of Chriſtian Princes in Cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:
here we do only ſtill proſecute the Government
of the Church (when temporal Kings and Princes
were her great and mortal Enemies) and the Folly, (if
not the obſtinacy) of our Adverſaries, who either ſee
it not, or will not acknowledge it, that peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs
may as well be preſerved, in all the Churches in
the World, by Archbiſhops and Biſhops, without one
Pope to govern them all; as by Kings and Sovereign
Princes in all the Kingdoms and temporal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the World, without one temporal Monarch
to rule and overſway them. For our Adverſaries ſhall
never be able to prove, that it may be aſcribed (as we
have before ſaid) more to any want of diſcretion and
due Providence in our Saviour Chriſt, that he hath
not appointed the Pope to govern the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church,
than that he hath not aſſigned the Government of the
whole World to one King or Emperour. Rather it
is to be attributed to their audacious temerity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
that will either enforce our Saviour Chriſt
to be contented with that Form of Government in his
Church, which they think good to aſſign unto him,
and ſo make him to divide ſtakes (as the Phraſe is)
with the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> or elſe to be reputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them for a Perſon of little Diſcretion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and to have dealt abſurdly, in ordering and
ſetling the external Government of his Church, as he
had ordered and ſetled the external Government of his
Univerſal Kingdom, over all the Kings and Princes in
the World. Which profane, wicked, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
proceedings with Chriſt, will (no doubt) in
ſhort time, receive a heavy Judgment; in that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Man of ſin hath long wrought in a myſtery,
and taken upon him, for his time, and ſo every one of
his Succeſſors, during their Lives, to <hi>ſit in the Temple of
God,</hi> vaunting, that the ſaid Temple, or Spiritual
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42183:136"/>
Kingdom of Chriſt, is wholly at his Command; yet
now he beginneth to be revealed and diſcloſed to be
that Impoſtor, that by the aſſiſtance of Satan, hath
with power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveableneſs
and unrighteouſneſs, long abuſed the
Chriſtian World, and is conſequently to be conſumed
by our Saviour Chriſt, with the Spirit of his mouth.
In the mean while, and till this work be throughly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
we are not to cenſure Chriſt, either for his
Diſcretion, or Divine Providence, but indeed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
and magnify them both; conſidering, that by his
Government, both of the Univerſal World, as he is
the Son of God, and of his <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as he is
the Redeemer of it (in ſuch manner and form as we
have before expreſſed, by ſeveral Kings and Prieſts,
within their Kingdoms, Provinces, and Dioceſſes) he
hath left unto them certain general rules and motives,
which being diligently obſerved, do tend to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
good and preſervation, both of the one and the
other; though they have no aſſiſtance therein from
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as it is an apt and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to perſwade all Kings and Kingdoms, to live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
with their Neighbour Princes, and Nations, and
to be at a firm League and Friendſhip with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have all but one Heavenly King, are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and Subjects of one Univerſal Kingdom; have, or
ought to have, but one moral Faith, one rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
one ſquare for Equity, one nature of Truth, one
moral Law, one Kind, Form, and nature, of all the
ſeveral Virtues, both Moral and Intellectual; one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Inſtinct, to know God, and to worſhip him,
and one Form and Rule of mutual love and affection:
So the particular Churches, diſperſed over the World,
when they had ſmall Comfort from the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
held themſelves bound to have a ſpecial care
one over another, that matters of Religion might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42183:136"/>
by one rule, with mutual Agreement and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
for avoiding of Schiſms; in that they well
knew, they had all but one Redeemer and Saviour, one
Heavenly Spiritual King, or Archbiſhop, were all of
them Members of one myſtical Body, whereof Chriſt
was the Head, had all of them but one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
one Spiritual Food, one Hope, one Bond of Charity,
one Redemption, and one Everlaſting Inheritance in the
Life to come. Which were ſuch Arguments of mutual
Conſociation in thoſe days, as when any great matters
of importance did fall out in any one Country, through
the willfulneſs and obſtinacy of Hereticks and crafty
Seducers of the People, which perhaps were counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
with ſome of ſtrength and greater power than
could eaſily be withſtood; their Neighbour Churches
adjoining, did ſometimes aſſiſt them, by their Letters,
with the beſt counſel they could give them; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
did ſend ſome eſpecial Learned Men unto them,
for the better ſuppreſſing of thoſe Evils; and ſometimes
(when occaſions fell out thereunto moving) ſundry
Archbiſhops and Biſhops of ſeveral Countries, with
other learned Prieſts, and Perſons of principal note, did
as they might, for fear of danger, meet together, and
upon due and mature deliberation, did ſo order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of matters, as thereby Hereſies and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were ſtill ſuppreſſed, and the Churches in thoſe
Countries received great comfort and quietneſs. And
if in thoſe troubleſome times the peace of the Church
were thus preſerved; how much more, now under
Chriſtian Magiſtrates, may it be ſtrengthned, upheld,
and maintain'd without the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only within
their ſeveral Kingdoms, but likewiſe throughout (in
effect) all theſe Weſtern Parts of the World, if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings and Soveraign Princes would agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a general Council; to the end, that all thoſe
Hereſies, Errours, Impoſtures and Preſumptions,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42183:137"/>
wherewith the Church of Chriſt hath been long, and
is now miſerably ſhaken, and diſturbed, might be at
the laſt utterly ſuppreſſed and extinguiſhed?</p>
                  <p>Many other means might here be alledged, to ſhew
how the ſtate of Chriſtian Religion is to be upheld and
maintained, without any aſſiſtance from the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> But our purpoſe being in this place to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and compare the government of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
with the Univerſal Government of the Son of God,
over the whole World; We hold it ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
That every National Church, may as well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of her ſelf, without one Univerſal Biſhop, as every
KIngdom may do without one general Monarch. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
we acknowledge, that in this particular
Tractate we have been very tedious; and it may be
thought perhaps by ſome, that our pains therein is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſuperfluous; becauſe many of our Adverſaries
do (in effect) acknowledge, that there is the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of one Emperour to govern all the World, as
there is of one Pope to have the overſight and ordering
of the whole <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Indeed, upon the ſifting
of the uſurped Authority of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> our
Adverſaries finding, that by their Arguments to bolſter
up his ſaid Authority, the Erection of one Man to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the World in temporal Cauſes, is as neceſſarily to
be inforced, as of one Pope to govern the whole Church
in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes; they are grown to this moſt
admirable Inſolency, and moſt high preſumption, as
that they dare affirm, and do take upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all modeſty, to maintain it, That the Pope is both
the Monarch of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of all the World. Which myſtery of theirs is
thus managed, and by piece-meal unfolded after this
ſort: <hi>viz.</hi> That to eaſe the Pope, leſt he might be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with multitude of affairs, if he ſhould take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, in his own Perſon, to govern the whole World,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42183:137"/>
as he doth direct the eſpecial affairs of the <hi>Catholick
Church;</hi> they do aſſign unto him Power and Authority
to create and delegate under him, as his <hi>Feudatary,</hi> or
Vaſſal, this one ſuppoſed Emperour, to whom (they
ſay) he may commit the ſpecial Execution of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Sword, to be drawn and put up, at his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and commandment.<note place="margin">Dr. Marta de Juriſd. par. 1. c. 20.</note> And for this one baſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

temporally, and likewiſe ſufficient Power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute

all the Kings and Princes in the World, may ſee moſt
evidently, how groſly and ſhamefully they are abuſed,
and how notably they neglect the greatneſs of their

or ſhall be hereafter Emperours, in that they do
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42183:138"/>
intermeddle any thing at all with the Pope, or receive
from him, either their Confirmation or Coronation;
in that thereby he preſumeth moſt ridiculouſly, and
without any ſhew of truth, to challenge them for his
Servants and Vaſſals. It hath been before ſhewed, by
the Judgment of the <hi>Cardinalized Jeſuit,</hi> That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> have no temporal Poſſeſſions at all; but
ſuch as they have received from the Emperour, and
other Kings and Soveraign Princes. In conſideration
whereof, ſeeing, that now they inſult ſo notably over
them all, both Princes, Kings, and Emperours, being
ſo far from acknowledging themſelves to be the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Subjects, or to hold their ſaid Poſſeſſions, either
of him, or of any King, that beſtowed them upon
them: We do verily think, that the ſaid Princes,
Kings, and Emperours, who have been ſo beneficial
to the ſaid Biſhops, ſhall never ſhew themſelves to be
of that Princely Magnanimity, and Proweſs, which
their high places do require, nor free their Sceptres
from the thraldom and baſe ſubjection to their uſurped
Authority; until either they take from them, what
before they gave them, or bring them to a more duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acknowledgment of their Duties unto them. And
what we ſay of the Popes, we likewiſe do hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all the Clergy beſides, in <hi>Europe,</hi> or elſewhere,
that, if they ſhall either withdraw themſelves from
their ſubjection unto their temporal Soveraigns, under
whom they live, or deny to hold the Poſſeſſions of
their ſeveral Churches of their ſaid Soveraigns, or to
do them Homage for the ſame; they may lawfully, in
our Judgments, not only reſume the ſaid Poſſeſſions
into their own hands, but likewiſe proceed againſt
them as Rebels and Traytors, according to the Form
of their ſeveral Laws. But this is a Digreſſion. For
in the beginning of this Chapter, we undertook to
deal with thoſe only, who, though they maintain the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42183:138"/>
Popes general Supremacy over the Catholick Church;
yet they deny upon many weighty reaſons, that God
did ever ordain any one Emperour to govern all the
World. But how long they will deny it, we know
not;
in that the principal <hi>Jeſuit</hi> himſelf writeth thus:

That our Saviour Chriſt ſhould

that in every particular Country, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42183:139"/>
Form of Temporal Government
was the beſt) to be extended to prove, that
there ought to be either one Biſhop over
all the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (whereof they had

have their beginning from <hi>Adam,</hi> it doth
not as well follow, that there ought to
be one Emperour to govern all the World,
as one Biſhop over the whole <hi>Catholick
Church:</hi> or, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was any more

to the Vniverſal Kingdom of Chriſt over

that Hoſt, the Head of that Body, the King

the Church, to prove, that there
muſt be one Biſhop under him, to govern
all the particular Churches in the World:
or that, becauſe Kings, when they have
occaſion to be abſent from their Kingdoms,
do commonly appoint ſome Vice-Roy, to
Rule their People until their return; it

his corporal abſence from his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Kingdom the Church, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
preſence of the Holy Ghoſt, was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42183:140"/>
of neceſſity to leave one carnal Man to be

Chriſt held it expedient for his <hi>Catholick

great preſumption for any Man to tell us,
that his corporal preſence is neceſſary for the

and ſeveral kinds of Governments
in it (and perhaps in a ſort, and by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
when ſome Neighbour Kings,
either in Perſon, or by their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,

viſible on the Earth, than by the ſeveral,

have no viſible Head, all other Biſhops,

there is no one King to govern all the
World, therefore there is no uſe of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,

more follow, that Chriſt ſhould have left
his Faithful People in a confuſed Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
except he had left St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his

than it doth, that the whole World hath

innocent, and ſo abſolved him. Which Fact of his was
afterward approved by <hi>Boniface</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Caeleſtinus</hi>

Cauſes for theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts, there lay Appeals to the

both of them a haſty Retreat, and pretended very
earneſtly, that it was utterly unlawful for any Biſhop
to ſeek ſo great an Authority over all other Biſhops
and Churches. And firſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> oppoſing himſelf
againſt the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wrote
thus to certain Biſhops:<note place="margin">1 Epiſt. Pelag.</note>

himſelf, whereby he may ſeem, in any reſpect, how little
ſoever, to diminiſh the honour of the reſt of his Brethren.</hi>

Rome <hi>ſhould be the Head of all Churches.</hi> For his [Again]
he might well have left it out; as alſo his Phraſes of

of <hi>Councils,</hi> nor <hi>Fathers,</hi> dealeth more truly, and ſaith,
That the Church of <hi>Constantinople ſibi vendicare cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur,</hi>
that place, which <hi>Boniface</hi> obtained from the
Emperour <hi>Phocas:</hi> and that the ſame was obtained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe grounds, <hi>viz. That whereas the Biſhop of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople
<hi>inſisted, eò loci primam ſedem eſſe debere, ubi
Imperii Caput eſſet; It is anſwered by the Biſhop of</hi> Rome,
<hi>and his Agents, that</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>was but a Colony, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of the City of</hi> Rome; <hi>and therefore, that the City
of</hi> Rome <hi>ought still to be accounted Caput Imperii: That
the Grecians themſelves, in their Letters, termed their
Prince the Emperour of the Romans; and that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>were called not Grecians, but Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
Indeed <hi>Platina</hi> further ſaith (being peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our mind) that he will omit, how the Keys
of the Kingdom of Heaven were given to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
ſo to the Roman Biſhops, his Succeſſors, and not
to the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> and we likewiſe, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
his Example, as a thing impertinent to our
purpoſe, will here omit the ſame. Only we do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that the contention betwixt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was <hi>de Primatu;</hi> and
that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> obtain'd that place by <hi>Phocas</hi>
his means, which the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to himſelf. Whereupon we offer to Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
theſe two Arguments. Whoſoever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
upon him that Primacy, or place in the Church,
which <hi>John,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> did challenge
to himſelf, is the forerunner of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> but
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42183:148"/>
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> do take upon them that Primacy
and place: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Again; Thoſe Prieſts, which do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
unto him, that taketh upon him that place and
Primacy, which <hi>John,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did
challenge to himſelf, are an Hoſt prepared for the King
of Pride: but all the Prieſts, that do adhere to the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> do adhere unto him, that taketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him that Primacy and place, which <hi>John,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> did challenge to himſelf: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
But our purpoſe is not to diſpute: only this we add,
that till this time, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
ſo far with <hi>Phocas,</hi> as is aforementioned, his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,

very great riches and ample poſſeſſions. Of all which
zealous Diſpoſitions, benefits and favours they ever
made, above all other Biſhops, their greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
by imploying the ſame to the advancement of

much helped, and further'd by the Authority which

Beſides, if we ſhall deal ſincerely and truly (as we
hold our ſelves always bound, and more ſtrictly in a
cauſe of this Importance;) we muſt needs confeſs,
that it hath been the manner of Divines, from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
times almoſt, to magnify and extol the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and excellency of their own calling: which was a
very commendable and neceſſary courſe in many (the
ordinary contempt of the Miniſtry conſider'd) and had
been ſo in all of them, if they had not therewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
too much the Dignity and preheminence of
Kings and Princes. Compariſons in ſuch Caſes were
ever worthily held to be odious. Biſhops and Prieſts,
might without any juſt reprehenſion, have been reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to Gold, to the Sun, and to what elſe is excellent;
without comparing the higheſt Magiſtrates, under
God, in reſpect of themſelves, to the Moon, to Lead,
and to ſome other things of ſuch like baſe Eſtimation.
And we doubt not, but that they would have refrain'd
from ſuch Compariſons, if they could have foreſeen,
how the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> would to the diſgrace and
diſhonour of civil Authority, have wreſted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
them: notwithſtanding, that their Inferences
thereupon have ever had more ſhew and probability,
than ſubſtance and truth; except we ſhall ſay, that
the Callings of Schoolmaſters and Phyſicians, are in
Dignity to be preferr'd before all other Temporal Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
becauſe the end of the one is the inſtructing of
Mens underſtandings, and of the other, Health; which
either are, or ought to be, both of them in their kinds,
of greater Eſtimation, than any other things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall not need to trouble our ſelves with the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of any Authorities, to prove how eagerly the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> (eſpecially after <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third had
obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi> the ſaid Supremacy) have preſſed
the ſame Compariſons; It is ſo evident, both in their

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42183:149"/>
who from time to time, have laboured with all

great; whilſt by the Incurſions of the ſaid Barbarous

Parts: Yet not many Years after the <hi>Lombards</hi> ſetting
Foot into <hi>Italy</hi> did greatly impair the ſame. But the
utter ruin of it did principally proceed (for ought we

Fourth,<note place="margin">Platin. in vitâ</note> greatly favouring <hi>Benedict</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">Benedict. 2.</note> gave the

from that time forward their Biſhops, without any
further expectation of the Emperour's Authority to
approve and confirm the ſame (little remembring the
Wiſdom and Providence of <hi>Juſtinian)</hi> they, the ſaid
Biſhops, grew to great Preſumption and Boldneſs againſt
their ſucceeding Emperours; until by their means,
<hi>Rome, Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the Empire were
utterly cut off from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Empire: which <hi>Juſtinian,</hi>
and his Succeſſors by keeping the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in
ſome due Subjection, through their Authority in their

No ſooner had the ſame Emperour given the Biſhops of

dangerous Quarrels aroſe amongſt the Citizens of
<hi>Rome</hi> in the choice of their Biſhops, ſcarce 20. Years

                  <p>IT was great Policy in the <hi>Emperours</hi> (as we have

of their Authority in placing of the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and in beſtowing of other Biſhopricks and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacies
within their Dominions: But ſuch was the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Hypocriſie and Superſtition of thoſe Times,
ſo far ſpread by the inferiour Biſhops and Prieſts, and
ſo rooted every where in men's Hearts by the Biſhops
of that <hi>See,</hi> under colour of Religion, and of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Supremacy, derived by them from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as
they feared not to attempt any thing againſt any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
ſo the ſame might tend to the Advancement of
their own Authority. Again, it was a great Overſight
in <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> conſidering his Wiſdom, and that
he well knew the proud and aſpring Minds of thoſe
Biſhops, that after his own Coronation at <hi>Rome</hi> by
<hi>Leo</hi> the Third, he did not provide for the benefit of
his Succeſſors, that none of them after that time ſhould
ever be Crowned there, or by the Biſhop of that Place.
For that Slip and Omiſſion, being not well look'd to,
and Reform'd by any that did ſucceed him, became at

                  <p>Which Weakneſs of the <hi>Empire</hi> being throughly

                  <p>About that time there was a great Rebellion againſt

he was both a Biſhop and King; relying not only upon

choſen them to be both Prieſts and Kings.</hi> And to prevent
an Objection, leſt any Man ſhould ask, where it might
be found that the Lord had ſo choſen them to both thoſe
great Dignities; he telleth us, that <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by a
Divine Revelation, gave unto <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> with a Crown
of Gold, the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt.</hi> But yet
he hath ſome better proofs to this purpoſe. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

the Pope replyed, ſaying, that St. <hi>Peter wrote ſo to his

own Subjects, and did not therein include himſelf:</hi> and that
moreover he might not only have remember'd, that it
was not ſaid to any King, but to a Prieſt, <hi>Behold I have
placed thee over Nations and Kingdoms,</hi> (and ſo followeth
the words of the Text:) but likewiſe, that <hi>as God made
two lights in the Firmament of Heaven, a greater and a leſs,

the Sun, which is the great Light, and the Regal the

it might be known, that there is a great difference
betwixt Pontifical Biſhops and Kings, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Sun and the Moon.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt a little digreſs,<note place="margin">Matt. Paris in Johan.</note> to obſerve, that
this Pope, being ſwoln as big as the Sun, caſt his
Beams, not only into <hi>England,</hi> and ſcorched King <hi>John</hi>
exceedingly about the Year 1212. by thundering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

him <hi>Frederick</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plat. in Innoc. 3.</note> And when he had played theſe
two Feats, amongſt many other, he held a Council at
<hi>Lateran, Anno</hi> 1215. wherein, to ſtrengthen ſuch
Traiterous Proceedings, he cauſed it to be ordained,
(as it is pretended) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That if any Temporal Lord,<note place="margin">Concil. Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. c. 3. Oper. Innoc. Tom. 1.</note>

might denounce his Vaſſals abſolved from

Upon this Canon, many, in theſe days, do
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42183:160"/>
much rely: although indeed it was but a Project, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many other, to have been concluded in

it was broken off;<note place="margin">Platin. in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noc. 3.</note> which the Pope labouring to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
died in that Journey.</p>
                  <p>And now we return from whence we digreſſed; and
leaving <hi>Innocentius,</hi> do addreſs our ſelves to <hi>Boniface</hi>
the <hi>Eighth,</hi> who had as great dexterity, as his ſaid

                     <note place="margin">Luc. 22. 36, 38.</note> 
                     <hi>and buy one;</hi> they anſwered, ſaying, <hi>Lord,
we have two ſwords:</hi> This Pope inferreth, <hi>there is, in
the Church, a Spiritual Sword, and a Temporal;</hi> and that
conſequently they are both at the Commandment of
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo to make the matter more
clear, touching the temporal Sword, which ſhould rule
the World in all temporal Cauſes; he (ſaith <hi>Boniface)</hi>
that ſhall deny, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had this temporal Sword,
doth not well underſtand Chriſt's Words, when he bad
St. <hi>Peter</hi> (after he had cut off <hi>Malchus</hi>'s Ear) that he
ſhould put up his Sword.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15.</note> Again; whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
doth teach us, that <hi>the ſpiritual Man judgeth all
things, but is judged by none;</hi> this good Biſhop doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs
theſe words to the only Uſe of the Popes; and
thereupon concludeth, that they have Power to judge
and cenſure all Earthly Powers and Authorities; but
are themſelves exempted from the Checks and Cenſures
of any, as being only ſubject to God, and to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And again, that the Spiritual Authority may
inſtitute and judge the Terreſtrial, it is verified by the
Prophecy of <hi>Jeremy, Behold, I have placed thee this day
over Nations and Kingdoms:</hi> for the perverting of

<hi>In the beginning God made Heaven and Earth:</hi> Therefore

                     <hi>Of his fulneſs we have all received,</hi> he was able to

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42183:162"/>
inſufficient, that he had ſaid before) he buckleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to certain Facts of the Popes and Emperours;
ſaying, That <hi>Constantine</hi> did give the Empire to <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester;</hi>
that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> made <hi>Charles the Great</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;
and that likewiſe <hi>Otho</hi> the Firſt was created
Emperour by Pope <hi>Leo:</hi> But at the laſt, He ſtriketh this
Point dead; becauſe (ſaith He) it is manifeſt that
Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> depoſed the King of <hi>France,</hi> and abſolved
all his Barons from their Oath of Fidelity; that <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi>

make up all, ſpeaking of the Emperour's Crowns, and
the Cuſtom (as it ſeemeth) then in uſe; He ſaith,
That the Emperour did receive a Crown of Gold from

him with his Foot,<note place="margin">Ibidem c. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>But hitherto we have heard this great Schoolman by
way of Diſcourſe, wherein peradventure he is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
and diſſolute, than when he preſſeth his Points Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically,
as the manner is in the Schools: We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
trace him a little in that Path; if firſt we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that it is his cuſtom, when He handleth a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
that doth concern the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſoon as
He hath propounded it, He firſt proceedeth with his
<hi>Videtur quòd non,</hi> and bringeth ſometimes both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Fathers for the Negative part; his purpoſe
ſtill being to encounter them with his, <hi>Sed contrà est;</hi>
but, <hi>ſuch or ſuch a Pope holdeth the contrary:</hi> And then
He cometh in firſt with his Concluſion, and ſecondly
with his <hi>Dicendum eſt;</hi> wherein He ſo laboureth and
beſtirreth himſelf, as that always the ſaid Scriptures
and Fathers are wrung and enforced to yield to the
<hi>Pope:</hi> As for example, Having propounded this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<hi>Whether for Apostaſie from the Faith a Prince doth
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42183:163"/>
loſe his Dominion over his Subjects;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2a. 2ae. Quaeſt. 12. art. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſo conſequently, if
he be Excommunicated,</hi> (there being the ſame Reaſon
for the one, as there is for the other, as two great Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
do affirm) He falleth upon his <hi>Videtur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Card. Toledo.</note> ſaying,<note place="margin">Card. Alanus.</note> 
                     <hi>It
ſeemeth that a Prince for Apoſtaſie from the Faith doth not
loſe his Dominion over his Subjects, but that they are ſtill
bound to obey him:</hi> For St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Julian</hi> the
Emperour though he were an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> yet had under
him Chriſtian Soldiers; to whom when he ſaid, Bring
forth your Army for Defence of the Commonwealth,
they obeyed him. Therefore for the Apoſtaſie of the
Prince, their Subjects are not abſolved from his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Moreover, an <hi>Apoſtata</hi> from the Faith is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel:
but ſome holy men are found faithfully to have
ſerved Infidel-Maſters, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did <hi>Pharaoh, Daniel
Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Mardochee Aſſuerus;</hi> Therefore for
Apoſtaſie from the Faith, it is not to be yielded, but that
ſuch a Prince muſt be obeyed by his Subjects. <hi>Sed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
eſt, quod</hi> Gregorius <hi>ſeptimus dicit; But</hi> Gregory <hi>the
Seventh is of a contrary Opinion,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>We keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Statutes of our holy Predeceſſors, do by our Apoſtolick
Authority abſolve from their Oath thoſe who are bound to
excommunicate perſons by Fealty, or the Sacrament of an
Oath; and do by all means prohibit them, that they keep not
their Fidelity unto them, until they come to ſatisfaction.</hi>
Whereupon <hi>Thomas</hi> concludeth, <hi>That all</hi> Apoſtata's <hi>are
Excommunicated, ſicut &amp; Haeretici, As all Hereticks are;
and that therefore their Subjects are delivered from their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and Oaths of Fidelity unto ſuch Lords and Princes;</hi>
and ſo addeth his <hi>Dicendum eſt:</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Where dallying and
ſhifting with his Diſtinctions, the Anſwer which he
maketh to the Words of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> is this; at that
time the Church being in Her minority, had not the
power to bridle Princes; and that therefore ſhe
ſuffered the Faithful to obey <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtata</hi> in
thoſe things, <hi>Quae nondum erant contra Fidem, Which
were not then againſt Faith; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t majus periculum Fidei
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42183:163"/>
vitaretur, That the greater danger of Faith might be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.</hi>
And the ſecond Objection He more ſlightly
paſſeth over, ſaying, That there is not the like Reaſon
of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Apoſtata's.</hi>"</q> And thus this great School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
relying upon the Authority of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
had adventur'd to oppoſe himſelf againſt the
Examples alledged out of the Old Teſtament, againſt
the Practice of the Primitive Church, and againſt the
Judgment of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> not caring how many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
by this Rebellious Doctrine might come to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
ſo as the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> might have the
World at their commandment. We here omit, how
as <hi>Thomas,</hi> and divers others writ many large Volumes
upon <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> the <hi>Maſter of the Sentences,</hi> his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions;</hi>
ſo afterward, and eſpecially of later Times,
Books upon Books have been publiſhed upon his (the

they come unto it, this ſeditious and trayterous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ſo Clerk-like handled by their Maſter: Only we
obſerve this great Schoolman's Conſcience, how in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to ſhift off the Truth maintain'd by St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi>
he could paſs over a Lye in <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh,
where he ſaith, <hi>That in abſolving of Subjects from their
Oath of Obedience, and in prohibiting them from performing
their Duties and Fidelity towards their Soveraigns; He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Statutes of his holy Predeceſſors:</hi> Being himſelf
the firſt that ever durſt be ſo deſperate: As alſo that
he confeſſeth, it was not in St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his time, <hi>contra

were either <hi>Infidels,</hi> or Excommunicate; and likewiſe
how thankfully the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> accepted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus</hi> the Fourth did ſo admire him,

Reaſons to be ſubject unto it: Whereupon in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of them, and to ſtrengthen their own Aſſertion,
they alledged, that one Bee was never the Captain
over all Bees, nor one Crane the General of all Cranes,
nor one Beaſt the Leader of all Beaſts; that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law of God, the Law of Nature, and the
Law of Nations; that there was never any Monarchs
ſo great, but there were in the World many Kings
who were never ſubject unto them; that the place of
Scripture is to be underſtood of all places in the World
that were then under the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no further; That a Monarchy is then beſt, when
it is contain'd within ſuch limits, as it may well be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd;
that all Monarchies hitherto had ever their
bounds, which were well known: That it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for all men to fetch Juſtice from one place, or to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42183:166"/>
receive thence any benefit by their Appeals; and ſo
after many other ſuch Arguments, they do conclude,
that to think that the Emperour ought to have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of all the World, is a vain, an abſurd, and
an untrue conceit.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to conſider, how in all theſe troubled
Diſputations and Oppoſitions, the <hi>Gloſſographers, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
School-men and Paraſitical Divines, that were
ſworn to the Pope, behaved themſelves. As ſoon as
the Civil Law began to flouriſh, as being read by the
Emperour's Commandment, in ſundry Univerſities;
<hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth,<note place="margin">Carion. Chron.</note> began to ſmell what was like to
come of it, and therefore did afterward forbid it to be
read in <hi>Paris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Genebr. Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nol.</note> being the eſpecial Place then (as it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
where it was moſt eſteemed. But as touching
the Point ſo controverted, when theſe Champions of
the Popes ſaw how the Matter went, That either they
muſt hold, that there ought to be but one Emperour
over all the Kingdoms in the World, or elſe be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to confeſs, that there ought not to be One Pope
over all the Churches in the World (the ſame Reaſon
being as pregnant for the one, as for the other) they
joyned with the <hi>Italian Civilians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ferdin. Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez. ut ſuprà. Barth. Caſſan. ut ſuprà.</note> that there ought to
be but one Emperour. Marry how? Forſooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
<hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Fourth,
<hi>Innocentius</hi> the Third, and that great <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,
Boniface</hi> the Eighth, and divers other Popes, how Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour-like
they had demeaned themſelves, and what
great Authority they challenged; the ſaid Pontifical
Champions fell to this Iſſue, That the Pope being
Chriſt's Vicar, who was <hi>Lord of lords, and King of
kings,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that the Pope was likewiſe
that One Emperour, who was to govern all the World,
in Temporal Cauſes, as he did all the Churches in the
World in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes. And thereupon they
reaſoned in this ſort: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Chriſt is Lord of all the World:
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42183:167"/>
but the Pope is Chriſt's Vicar on Earth: therefore
the Pope is Lord of all the World. Again; The
Emperour is the Pope's Vicar, and his Succeſſour, in
all Temporal Cauſes: therefore the Emperour is
Lord of all the World; all Temporal Juriſdiction
being habitually in the Pope; and from him derived
to the Emperour."</q> And many of the <hi>Italian</hi> Lawyers,
eſpecially ſuch as mixed their Studies with the Canon-Law,
were well enough content, that ſo as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
might be Lord of all, how, and whence he had
it, whether from God, or from the Pope, they ſtood
indifferent. But for all this, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Lawyers ſtuck to their tackling, and were peremptory,
That neither the Pope, nor the Emperour had any ſuch
Univerſal Dominion over all the World. And divers
likewiſe of the ſaid <hi>Italian</hi> Doctours, that were not
too much addicted to the Canon-Law, were not afraid
to hold, and maintain, That the Emperour held as well
from God the Authority, which he had, as the Pope
did his Papacy. Howbeit ſuch was the Clamour of
the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> of the <hi>Gloſſographers,</hi> and of the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and <hi>Divines,</hi> that took their part in the Pope's
behalf (upon whom all their Preferment, Credit, and
Countenance did depend) as they would needs, by
force, carry the Bell away; though their Oppoſites,
each of them, were very confident, that the common
Opinion ſway'd with their ſide; more ſtanding for
them, than were againſt them.</p>
                  <p>We have before briefly touched the chief Grounds and
Reaſons, whereupon the <hi>Civil Lawyers</hi> (divided amongſt
themſelves) did inſiſt: and therefore, that we may
not ſeem partial, we thought it fit to hear the <hi>Canoniſts</hi>
with their Adherents, whilſt they tell us, That all the
World is the Pope's, at his diſpoſition; as well the
Emperour, as any other the meaneſt Perſon whoſoever:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Becauſe (1.) that Chriſt had all Power given him.

That the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> do anoint them. (4.)
That the Church Triumphant hath but one Prince.
(5.) That <hi>Innocentius</hi> told the King of <hi>France,</hi> that
he did not intend to abate his Juriſdiction; whereby
it is collected, that, if he had pleaſed, he might have
ſo done. (6.) That in the Vacancy of the Empire
the Pope hath the Government of it. (7.) That
the Pope tranſlated the Empire from the <hi>Grecians</hi> to
the <hi>Germans.</hi> (8.) That the Papacy exceedeth the
Empire, as far as Gold doth Lead, or as Men do
Beaſts.<note place="margin">Staniſl. Oriſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius in Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ.</note> (9.) That Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſaith, Chriſt gave

<hi>Optimum optima decent:</hi> but the Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

That no Man giveth that to another which he hath

the Emperour, and to govern in Temporal Cauſes.
(12.) That as the Body is for the Soul, ſo Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

to any, that alſo is thought to be committed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which it cannot be executed: but except the

diſcharge the Office, that is committed unto him.
And (14.) <hi>lastly,</hi> (to omit infinite ſuch like Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
this Argument is reſerved after many other, by
a great Clerk, that it might ſtrike home, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is defined, by <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, that <hi>No

carries with it divers other of little leſs Force than
it ſelf; as that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a Sword, becauſe Chriſt

that ſtill they have been ſupported in all their wicked

Life, <hi>terreni ſimul &amp; coeleſtis imperii Jura, the Intereſt
both of the Earthly and Heavenly Empire;</hi> which he caſteth
away, either as an Aſſertion, forged by <hi>Gratian,</hi> (the
ſame being not found in the ſaid Pope's Writings) or elſe
to have another ſenſe, this (as it is urged) being againſt
the ſaid Pope's direct Words, in one of his Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Propoſition,<note place="margin">c. 2.</note> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That the Pope is not Lord of
all the World,</hi> he juſtifieth, in reſpect, (1.) That
Infidels are not his Sheep. (2.) That he cannot
judge Infidels. (3.) That Princes, Infidels, are true,
and ſupreme Princes of their Kingdoms; becauſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is neither founded in Grace, nor Faith; as it
appeareth, becauſe God approved the Kingdoms of
the Gentiles, both in the Old and New Teſtament.
And upon theſe ſaid Reaſons, he inferreth it to be a
ridiculous Conceit, for any Man to think, That God
gave to the Pope any Right over the Kingdoms of
the whole World; conſidering, that he never gave
unto him Ability to uſe any ſuch Right."</q> And for the
confirmation of his ſecond Propoſition,<note place="margin">c. 3.</note> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That the Pope
is not Lord of all the Chriſtian World;</hi>"</q> he proveth
the ſame, by theſe Reaſons. (1.) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Becauſe if he had
any ſuch Dominion, by the Law of God, the ſame
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42183:171"/>
ought to appear, either in the Scriptures, or by ſome
Apoſtolical Traditions: but it appeareth by neither:
<hi>Ergo.</hi> And his ſecond Reaſon is this; Chriſt neither
did, nor doth take Kingdoms from any, to whom
they do appertain; but doth rather eſtabliſh them:
therefore when the King becometh a Chriſtian, he
doth not loſe his Terrene Kingdoms, which lawfully
before he enjoyed; but he obtaineth new Right to
the everlaſting Kingdom: Otherwiſe (ſaith he) the
benefit received by Chriſt ſhould be hurtful to Kings,
and Grace ſhould deſtroy Nature. Alſo he confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ordinary Diſtinction amongſt the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi>
and <hi>Canonists,</hi> who affirm, That the Pope hath both
Powers in himſelf, but doth commit the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Civil Power unto others, and writeth thus:
Whatſoever Emperours have, they have it from
Chriſt: and therefore (ſaith he) the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
may either take from Kings and Emperours the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of their Authority, (as being himſelf the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
King and Emperour) or he may not: If he may,
then is he greater than Chriſt: If he may not; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
he hath not in truth any Regal Power."</q> And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
this Point, with this Obſervation; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>As the Sun
did not make, or inſtitute the Moon, but God himſelf:
ſo likewiſe the Empire, and the Pontifical Dignity are not
One, neither doth the One abſolutely depend upon the
Other.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">ibid. cap. 4.</note> To prove his third Propoſition, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That the
Pope hath no Temporal Juriſdiction directly,</hi>"</q> he reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in this ſort. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Chriſt, as he was Man, whilſt he
lived here upon Earth, neither took, nor would take
any Temporal Dominion: but the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
is Chriſt's Vicar, and doth repreſent Chriſt unto us,
<hi>qualis erat, dùm hîc inter homines viveret, as he was,
whilſt he lived here amongſt Men:</hi> therefore the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no Temporal Dominion."</q> Now before
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42183:171"/>
he comes to the Proof of the the firſt Propoſition of this
Argument, and that he might make the Ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
more plain; he ſaith, (1.) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That Chriſt was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
as he is the Son of God, the King and Lord
of all Creatures, in the ſame ſort that the Father is.
(2.) That his Kingdom is Eternal and Divine, and
neither taketh away the Kingdoms of Men, nor can
agree to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> (3.) That Chriſt, as he
was Man, was the Spiritual King of all Men, and
had moſt ample Spiritual Power over all Men, as
well faithful as Infidels. (4.) That this Spiritual
Power of Chriſt, ſhall, after the Day of Judgment,
be ſenſible and manifeſt. (5.) That the Glory of
this Kingdom, did begin in our Head, Chriſt, when
he aroſe from the dead."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon which Grounds he maketh theſe Inferences.
(1.) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the ſaid Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt,
(the Glory whereof began after His Reſurrection)
is not a Temporal Kingdom; ſuch as are the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of our Kings. (2.) That the ſaid Spiritual
Kingdom of Chriſt over all Men, cannot be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it pre-ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the Reſurrection. (3.) That Chriſt, as he was
Man, if he had liſt, and had thought it expedient
for him, could have taken upon him a Kingly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but would not: and therefore neither did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any ſuch Authority, neither had not only the
Execution of any Dominion, or Kingdom, but not
the Authority, or Power of any Kingdom Temporal."</q>
And ſo he cometh to the Proof of his ſaid Propoſition;
ſaying, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That if Chriſt had any ſuch Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
He had it, either by hereditary Succeſſion, or
by Election, or by the Law of War, or by the Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Gift of God: but He had it by none of theſe four
ways;"</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> He had no ſuch Dominion. For the
Proof of all which Particulars, he taketh good Pains,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42183:172"/>
and then cometh to the Explication of theſe words in
his ſecond Propoſition of the firſt Argument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this point, <hi>viz. That the Pope doth repreſent
Christ unto us as he was, when he lived here amongſt Men;</hi>
and ſaith, (1.) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"We cannot attribute unto the Pope
thoſe Offices which Chriſt hath, either as he is God,
or as he is an immortal and glorified Man; but thoſe
which he had, as he was a mortal Man. (2.) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath the Pope all the Power which Chriſt had,
as he was a mortal Man. For he, becauſe he was
both God and Man, had a certain Power, which Men
call <hi>the Power of Excellency,</hi> whereby he ruled both
Faithful, and Infidels: But the Faithful only are
committed to the Pope. (3.) Chriſt had Authority
to inſtitute Sacraments, and to work Miracles by his
own Authority; which the Pope hath not. (4.)
Chriſt had Power to abſolve Men from their ſins
without the Sacrament, which the Pope cannot
do."</q>
