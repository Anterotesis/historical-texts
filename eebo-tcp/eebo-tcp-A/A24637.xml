            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of ſome few of the Exploits of <hi>Don Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo Pharmacopola(alias</hi> Deputy <hi>L—m</hi>) haſtily collected againſt his Name-ſake's Day; for the Edification and Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the honeſt Inhabitants of <hi>Biſhopſgate-Ward.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">(The Firſt Part.)</head>
            <p>TO begin, <hi>1ſt.</hi> He invaded the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in ſigning an illegal Warrant to Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Quiny,</hi> to bring a Company of the trained Bands to <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> to keep the Citizens from coming to ſwear the Sheriffs that were duly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois.</hi> And having thus invaded the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he next voted for the Surrender of it, and was of that Committee of Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in Sir <hi>W. P</hi>'s Mayoralty, in the Year 1682. that drew up <hi>an Addreſs</hi> to the King, <hi>to ſubmit all the Privileges and Franchiſes of the City of</hi> London <hi>to his Majeſty's abſolute Diſpoſal;</hi> and purſuant to it, he went in a Coach with ſix Horſes to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> to lay the ſame at his Feet; and expected to have been <hi>Knighted,</hi> for his Treachery, in betraying the City; but the Fool came home without the expected Feather in his Cap, to his great Grief and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: yet in the laſt Common-Council the City then had, he did, to the laſt Breath, ſtrongly inſiſt upon the gratifying of the King, according to the former Addreſs, with the Surrender of all our Liberties and Privileges, and to ſubmit to all the villanous Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that <hi>Jefferies and his fawning Creatures</hi> ſhould impoſe upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> He went to King <hi>James</hi> with a Catalogue of thoſe Men that he thought would be fit Tools for Parliament-men, to take off the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſt;</hi> amongſt whom, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being one, was put up as a Candidate, and was troubled that he loſt it. And he owned publickly, and gloried in it, that he had pick'd out ſuch Men as King <hi>James</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleaſed with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> He was one of that <hi>bloody Jury</hi> that murdered Alderman <hi>Corniſh,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Gaunt;</hi> and was one of Mr. <hi>Culliford</hi>'s merciful Jury, that gave but 100000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> Damages to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> againſt him, though not a Farthing Damage proved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> He carried <hi>Goddard</hi> (Sir <hi>Samuel Daſhwood</hi>'s Beadle) in a Coach to the Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Office, (ſo that the Deputy and the Beadle were Companions) to inform, contrary to their Oaths, againſt Capt. <hi>Foſter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Norcot,</hi> two of their Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: Whence will ariſe this Query, Whether or no the Deputy be not guilty of Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he paid the Beadle's Coach-hire?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> He was more than ordinarily zealous in the late Common-Council, againſt the Liberties and Franchiſes of the City, when he pleaded ſo ſtrenuouſly againſt the Freemen of <hi>London,</hi> and would have had the <hi>Foreigners</hi> to have had equal Privileges with the <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi> in all Elections of <hi>Common-Council-men,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen; contrary to his Oath, as he was a Freeman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> He promoted and ſigned <hi>a ſcandalous, falſe and groundleſs Petition</hi> againſt the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington,</hi> late Lord-Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> conſiſting of ſeven Paragraphs, with no leſs than ſix notorious Falſhoods in it; and which directly ſtruck at our preſent legal and happy Settlement in the City, as moſt evidently appeared to the Preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>To conclude for the preſent, I query, Whether he that was the principal Engine in the Arbitrary and Illegal Management of the Ward of <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> in the Year 1682, and afterwards of the ſurreptitious procuring an Act of Common-Council to divide the ſaid Ward, by falſe Inſinuations and Suggeſtions, (as hath publickly appeared ſince before the Common-Council, by whoſe Act it hath been lately reunited) whether he be a fit and proper Perſon to be elected again, to be as it were a ſole Manager of the Affairs of that Ward, I ſubmit to your ſerious Conſideration; and whether, if you elect him, 'tis not in effect to make your ſelves Parties, and to juſtify him in all his publick Crimes.</p>
            <p>The preſent Hurry of Buſineſs will not permit the adding the ſecond Part at preſent, but it may be expected upon the next occaſion.</p>
