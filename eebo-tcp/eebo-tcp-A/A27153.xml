            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>RIGHT HONORABLE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS there is no Grace that giveth more glory to God, ſo there is no Grace that hath <note place="margin">Rom 4. 20.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:55550:3"/>
more honour from God then Faith: Who though he doth all our work for us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould have all the glory from us; yet is pleaſed that Faith ſhould go away with the praiſe of that which himſelf<note place="margin">Mark 5. 34.</note> only doth. <hi>Daughter thy Faith hath made thee whole,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the woman, that by the touch of his garment received virtue<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 29, 30.</note> from him and was healed. <hi>By faith the Iſraelites paſſed through the Red-ſea, as on dry ground. By faith the wals of Jericho fell down.</hi> When we know that the Waters of the one, and the Bulwarks of the other obeyed the ſoveraign authority of the Word of Gods command. Yea further, as there is no Grace that brings more glory to God, ſo there is no
<pb facs="tcp:55550:3"/>
Grace that yeelds more benefit to us then Faith: It is a Grace as the moſt uſefull, ſo the moſt ſucceſſefull, and of the largeſt capacity for our good. <hi>As thou</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 13.</note> 
               <hi>haſt believed, ſo be it done unto thee,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion. He that is inlarged in his faith cannot be ſtraightned in his comfort. Through Faith God the Father is our portion, God the Son is our pledge, God the Holy Ghoſt our earneſt; Heaven our home, Holineſſe our way, the Angels our gard, the Saints our company, the World our ſervant, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe under ſeal our ſecurity. And what would we, what can we have more? yea ſuch is the large capacity of this Grace of Faith, that could we be rich in
<pb facs="tcp:55550:4"/>
that grace, we might have our wils even with an overplus. <hi>Oh</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 28.</note> 
               <hi>woman,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the woman of Canaan, <hi>great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt. Luther</hi> was ſo ſtrong in faith, and therefore ſo powerfull in Prayer, that when <hi>Frederick Myconius</hi> his dear friend was ſick, he prayed for his recovery, and uſed theſe words, <hi>Hoc peto &amp; volo, &amp; fiat voluntas mea,</hi> This I aske, and this I will, and let my will be done; a while after <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius</hi> recovered according as he had prayed. Whereupon <hi>Juſtus Jonas</hi> ſaid of <hi>Luther, Iſte vir po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit quod voluit,</hi> That man could have what he would.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons why through faith we may have what we will, and more then we will, are theſe three.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55550:4"/>
Firſt, Becauſe by Faith we live the beſt life in this world; From life to life, how vaſt a diſtance is there? from the life of the higheſt Angell to the life of the loweſt Muſhrome, how great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? 1 There is the life of Vegetation, and that is the life of Plants. 2 There is the life of Senſe, and that is the life of Beaſts. 3 There is the life of Reaſon, and that is the life of Men. 4 There is the life of Faith, and that is the life of Saints. Now according to the kinde of life, ſuch is the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the creature. The life of a Beaſt is more excellent then the life of a Plant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more capable of good. The life of a Man is better then the life of a Beaſt; and the life of
<pb facs="tcp:55550:5"/>
a Saint far above the life of a<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 26</note> meer Man. <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> and therefore more capable of good, the good of the body and the ſoul, the good of this life and of that which is to come. As we have believed, ſo ſhall it be done unto us, much faith, and much comfort, whilſt we live: rich in Faith, and rich in Glory, when we ſhall go hence and be no more ſeen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe other Graces make us like unto God, as Wiſdome, Holineſſe, and Righteouſneſſe; but Faith makes<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> us Sons of God: <hi>As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his name.</hi> And if we be Sons, we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:55550:5"/>
of an inheritance incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and undefiled, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reſerved for us in the heavens; <hi>For if Sons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Heirs, Heirs of God, and co<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>heirs with Chriſt, who is heir of all things.</hi> Such a man is capable of being heir to an Eſquire of a vaſt eſtate; not becauſe he is like him, but becauſe he is his Son. Other graces make us like unto Chriſt, as Humility, Zeal for Gods glory, and Love to the Brethren: but Faith makes us members of Chriſt: and it is our memberſhip, our union to Chriſt, our communion with Chriſt, that makes us capable of all that grace and glory that he hath for us, for he is only the Saviour of his body. A painted arme and a woodden legge are like thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:55550:6"/>
members, but they draw no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from the head. It is, becauſe we by faith live in Chriſt, and<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 16.</note> grow up with Chriſt, <hi>That of his fulneſſe we receive grace for grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Faith is a grace by which we venture upon the willingneſſe and power of Chriſt to ſave and ſuccour us. Every true believer is a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant adventurer, whoſe returns muſt be greater then his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or he cannot live; even ſo it is with every believer, if God whoſe thoughts are above our thoughts, ſhould not ſend in to our Faith more then we come for, we ſhould live but<note place="margin">Mark 2. 5.</note> barely. The believing Palſie man and his friends, venture upon Chriſt for health; but when
<pb facs="tcp:55550:6"/>
Chriſt ſaw their faith, by which they brake through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (for they would uncover the roof of the houſe where he was, rather then not come to him) he gave him health, and the pardon of his ſins too, which was more then they came for. The Prodigal ſon ventures far<note place="margin">Luk. 15 22.</note> upon his Fathers love, yet craves no more but the place of an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſervant; but he is entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Son, he is clad with the beſt robe, and fed with the fatted Calfe; he hath a Ring for his hand, and Shooes for his feet, very rich ſupplies not only for neceſſity, but ſober delight, which was more then he deſired. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons venture into <hi>Egypt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 45 25, 26.</note> for Corn in a time of Famine, and they return with Corn, and
<pb facs="tcp:55550:7"/>
Money in their ſacks, yea with very good news at laſt, <hi>Joſeph is alive and Governour of all Egypt.</hi> Even thus it is with a believer that can in a ſtraight venture upon God in Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a promiſe; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns are often above his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Faith is the greateſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thergood in the world; for it is not only according to our faith, but often abo ve our faith. When the prayers offai th are anſwered mercies are multiplyed. When <hi>Solomon</hi> through faith beg'd of God for a wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, by which he might be able to judge his people; God gave him wiſdome, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over riches and honour more then any King had before him, or ſhould have after him, ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:55550:7"/>
his returne was far above his venture.</p>
            <p>Are theſe things ſo? what an happy condition are they in then that believe in the name of the Lord Jeſus? and who would not upon theſe terms make it good to their own ſouls, that they have obtained this precious grace of Faith? And that they have this grace, I know no better evidence then this, That they have high thoughts of it, and ſet a great price upon it. Now undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as have a true eſteem of faith, will improve all times and talents, will imploy all means for the ſervice of their faith, that they may abound therein. And what better means can be uſed for the advancement of faith in the growth and ſtrength

            <p>To commend which duty to ſuch as deſire to grow in this grace of Faith, and abound therein with thankſgiving, is (Right Honorable) the main ſcope of this preſent Subject, which I have taken the boldneſs to dedicate to your Honors; and do humbly pray that it may paſſe abroad under your Name and Patronage. If any aske why I trouble the Preſſe, that in theſe dayes is ſo oppreſt with a glut of Books. I anſwer, that it was not out of any vain humor of mine to appear in Publick, who am ſo far privy to mine own wants and weakneſſes, that I may truly ſay, not onely as

               <hi>of all Saints;</hi> but as <hi>Ignatius</hi> once ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Non ſum dignus dici minimus,</hi> I am not worthy to be called the leaſt: So that I could never judge my ſelf able to write any thing that might endure the teſt of your judicious eyes, or the cenſure of this criticall age. But indeed, that which principally hinted to this ſervice, was partly a deſire I had to promote a common good; being very confident that ſuch Chriſtians who walk much with God, and obſerve him in the wayes of his Providence, may be provoked to this duty, and reap much good thereby. For without doubt, this work here commended, is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though the duty be ſeldome
<pb facs="tcp:55550:10"/>
practiſed, becauſe the ſubject is rarely handled. It is as untro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a path, as ever I have gone; who have had ſcarce a little day hole of light to direct me, much leſſe a Cloud of witneſſes, or a Pillar of fire, or a Star to guide me. Partly, and indeed, that which chiefly incouraged me hereunto, was the memory of thoſe great favours which I have received from both your Honors; the one my moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Patron, <hi>Qui curat oves ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umque Magiſtros,</hi> A true friend to the Church of God, and the Miniſters of it. The other, my moſt bountifull Benefactor. Nor would I give your Honors thanks <hi>in aurem vel in angulo,</hi> but ſo publickly that I may have as many eye-witneſſes of my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:55550:10"/>
acknowledgement of your goodneſs, as there may be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Readers of this Book. And do preſnme that if your Honors will be pleaſed to throw away an hour or two in the peruſall of theſe lines, you may be hence encouraged more and more to obſerve God in the wayes of his providence, and keep ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials by you of his goodneſſe to you and yours; which may much encreaſe your faith in him, enlarge your love to him, and fortifie your hearts againſt the evils of theſe times. <hi>Confidius</hi> a Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> one day boldly told <hi>Caeſar, That the Senators durſt not come to Councell for fear of his Souldiers.</hi> He replyed, <hi>Why then doeſt thou goe to the Senate?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Becauſe</hi>

               <hi>my age takes away my fear.</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtians ſhould be very bold and couragious in evill days, becauſe they are or ſhould be ſtored with much experience, which will much encreaſe their faith, and abate their fears. God in rich mercy to you and many others, hath added to your lives many daies, and your hoary heads are a crown of glory to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and therefore you are by this time I hope above the fears and flatteries of all the world. Now that the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath abounded toward you both, not only in the outward comforts of Honor and Wealth in the eyes of men, but that which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the knowledge of God

and practiſe of holineſſe before his Saints, would make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to do his will, and work in you an encreaſe of all thoſe graces of his Spirit, that do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly accompany ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that you may live in his fear, die in his favour, reſt in his peace, and riſe to his glory; is, and ſhall be the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of</p>

When walking after the Lord in a wilderneſſe, we had leſſe allowed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

but more inward enlargedneſſe of Spirit. At which time he had the happineſſe of a younger <hi>Eliſha</hi> (not to<note place="margin">2 King. 3. 11.</note> powre water on the hands, but) to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the droppings of that great <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> that renowned man of God in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Reverend Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> and hath had ever ſince the bleſſing and ſavour of much of his ſpirit reſting on him, as was ſaid of <hi>Eliſha.</hi> And having<note place="margin">Chap. 2. 15.</note> mentioned that Name of pretious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Worthy Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> now at reſt with the Lord (Saint <hi>Hooker,</hi> I may call him as <hi>Latimer,</hi> Saint <hi>Bilney)</hi> it is a reall practiſe of this Chriſtian Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, to acknowledge with all hearty thankfulneſſe to God in Chriſt, before the world, that great mercy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable bleſſing, which <hi>Eſſex Chelmſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> this Author, my ſelf, and many others then enjoyed, in the labours of that Powerfull, Soul-ſaving, Heart-ſearching Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt: for which rich grace and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, we hope ſome of us ſhall bleſſe and praiſe his glorious Name, in a better world, to all eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55550:14"/>
As for this Authors painfulneſſe, and faithfulneſſe, it's well known to all that know him, how greatly they ſhined forth in him, whilſt in a very ſmall place, and how ſince advanced (by the bounty of his truly Noble and Honorable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, to a higher, and but neceſſary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence) they have continued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; In Catechizing, Preaching on the Lords dayes, and working dayes, holding up the uſe of thoſe ſoul-feaſting Sacraments, even unto theſe our dayes; wherein theſe Wels have been either ſtopt up, or leſſe drawn at; theſe choice diſhes, either ſet off the table quite, or ſeldome fed on, to the leanneſſe of many ſouls.</p>
            <p>Neither is he only a Practicall, but in life and practiſe a Preacher as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars, ſo in the ſubject of this Treatiſe, Thankfulneſſe; which as he hath put forth a monument and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of herein to God and Man; ſo I hope, his name ſhall live in it, and I heartily deſire, thy ſoul and mine might live more thankfully by it. As <hi>David</hi> towards the end of his Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſo this finger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> towards the end
<pb facs="tcp:55550:14"/>
of his dayes, ſummons a conſort of all, to bleſſe the Lord; for which thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in ſo many gratulatory Pſalms, ſome have thought the former, and we may in charity hope the latter, a man after Gods own heart.</p>
            <p>Which ſacrifice of Thanksgiving and Praiſe, exciting others alſo, and calling them to it, is now the more ſignally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in him, as his outward eſtate is not overmuch, (he being rich eſpecially in <hi>Aſhers</hi> bleſſing, many children) and<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 24.</note> whileſt he with many other burning and ſhining lights, once rejoyced in, yet now are become Lamps deſpiſed, by<note place="margin">Job 12. 5.</note> many at eaſe, and troden out as ſnuffes, before God put on the extinguiſher of death.</p>
            <p>I ſay now, to ſet himſelf over the Thankſgiving, and ſet out ſuch a Pſalm of praiſe, is thankfulneſſe in deed, and<note place="margin">Neh. 11. 17. &amp; 12. 8.</note> worthy of an <hi>Higga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Praiſe and thankſgiving is a ſervice becoming the upright, proper to the Saints, a work of pure grace when pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered; Confeſſions, petitions, nature, outward wants may excite to; but as they ſay of vain ſwearing, curſing, it's all Devill, no profit, pleaſure tempts to it;<note place="margin">Os Diaboli, <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>

            <p>Are theſe things ſo? How great is Gods goodneſſe to us?

For this end God hath ordained Sacraments, as that of the Paſſover under the Law, and this of the Lords Supper under the Goſpel; that as at the celebration of the<note place="margin">Exod. 13. 3.</note> one, <hi>Iſrael</hi> might remember their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> ſo we at the adminiſtration of the other, might remember Chriſt, by<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 74.</note> whom we are <hi>ſaved from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate us.</hi> This Supper is not onely a repreſenting, a ſealing, and a conveying ſigne, but a commemorative ſigne.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 24, 26.</note>

Sometimes (that we may come to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter intended) God appointed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Regiſters of his mercies, Hiſtories and Journalls of the noble acts and loving kindneſſes of the Lord to his people, to be kept and conveyed to poſterity, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come might know them, even the children that ſhould be born, <hi>who ſhould</hi>

               <hi>ariſe and declare them to their children,</hi> Thus the Lord commanded that the Hiſtory of <hi>Amalek</hi> ſhould be written in a Book, their malice and Gods mercy, their war and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw; and it muſt be rehearſed to poſterity,<note place="margin">Exo. 17. 14.</note> that it might never be forgotten. What this Book was, we ſhall not much enquire. Some ſay it was the Book of <hi>Jaſher,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Joſh. chap. 10. which was a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of the acts of the people of the Lord, which is loſt. Some ſay it was the Book of the <hi>Judges.</hi> Some ſay it was a Book of the <hi>Battails of the Lord,</hi> mentioned Numb. 21. 14. Others, and that moſt probably, that it was no other but this Book of <hi>Exodus; Junius</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi> But why this Hiſtory muſt be written in a Book is more worthy of our inquiry, and more ſutable to our purpoſe. And the reaſons may be theſe two:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a thankfull remembrance of ſo great a deliverance from ſo malicious an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, might be continued in the generations following.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the people of God knowing what ſentence was denounced againſt <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55550:28"/>
which ſhould be executed in due time, (as it was in the Reign of <hi>Saul)</hi> might be the better encouraged to fight againſt them, and through faith expect the victory over them: And thus in this Chapter God would have the Journals of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> recorded, that the great things God had done for them by the way, might not be forgotten; for ſo it is ſaid in the Text. <hi>Moſes wrote their goings out according to their journeys, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter two parts are obſervable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. An <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Journall is recorded, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, to <hi>v.</hi> 50.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A direction is given them, concerning their proceedings in and with the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Which is threefold:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they ſhould caſt out the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, <hi>v.</hi> 52, 53.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they ſhould deſtroy their idols, <hi>v.</hi> 52.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they ſhould divide the Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them by lot, <hi>v.</hi> 54.</p>
            <p>The two former whereof are ſeconded with a moſt ſharp threatning, that if they did not punctually obſerve Gods command therein:</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the preſent, that people ſhould prove a continuall ſnare unto them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the future, what God had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to theſe their enemies, ſhould fall upon their own heads: all this to the end of the <hi>ch.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55550:28"/>
In the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Journall two things are to be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The duty is in generall propounded, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have an Hiſtoricall enumeration of their ſeverall Journeys, in <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>In which three things are to be noted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The matter that ſtands upon record, and that is <hi>their journeys, according to their goings out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scribe that recorded them, and that was <hi>Moſes, Moſes wrote,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The authority by which he did it; and that was <hi>the commandement of the Lord,</hi> he had very good warrant for what he did. The firſt of theſe, namely, the matter that ſtands upon record, <hi>their journeys,</hi> is that which I ſhall principally take notice of.</p>
            <p>In which Journall this is obſervable,</p>
            <p>That there is not onely a particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place from which, and the place to which they journeyed, as from <hi>Rameſes</hi> to <hi>Succoth,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo a ſingular mention is made of all the great paſſages of Gods good hand of providence over them, together with their murmurings and rebellions, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they provoked him. All which are in this <hi>ch.</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and ſome particulars are expreſſed, as you may finde, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 14, 38, 40. This <hi>ch.</hi> being but a ſhort Epitome or abridgement of the whole Hiſtory. So that in the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Journall you ſhall finde how here God gave them bread from heaven, there water out of

the rock, in one place he delivered them from the violence of the mighty waters; in another, from the fury of their potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Now he ſaved them from the cruelty of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> at another time from the malice of the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> and ſoon after, from the ſting of the fiery Serpents. To day he gives them Manna and Quails, good food for their hungry bodies; to morrow he delivers them his Law, with many divine ordinances and ſtatutes, for the good of their ſouls: In all their goings out he afforded them plentifull pledges of his care of them, bounty to them, and patience towards them. Who, notwithſtanding the many grievous ſins by which they provoked him, being full of compaſſion, forgave their iniquities,<note place="margin">Pſa. 78. 38, 39.</note> and deſtroyed them not; yea, <hi>many a time he turned away his anger, and did not ſtir up all his wrath, for he remembred that they were but fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By this time we are come to the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is intended, and may hence be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and that is this,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> To keep a Journall or Diary by us, eſpecially of all Gods gracious dealings with us, is a work for a Chriſtian of ſingular uſe.</p>

               </gap>g-man being at a Tavern in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and threatning to ſwear the Conſtable out of the Town, if he came there; in a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fit running after one to make him pledge him a pinte of ſack at a draught, fell down the ſtairs, and dyed inſtantly, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1. 1626.</p>
            <p>A Fiſher-man (that I knew) bringing Mackerell to a Port-town in Suffolk, where the people (becauſe they were new, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55550:36"/>
firſt that came that yeer to Town) preſſing eagerly to buy them, and ſome againſt his will being entred into his boat, he took up a ſtone, and ſware by the name of God he would make them ſtand further off, inſtantly ſunk down, and ſoon after dyed.</p>
            <p>How many in my time have I noted! Would others do the like, how would men conſider ſuch things, and underſtand the righteous judgements of the Lord?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Finally, conſider ſeriouſly, and obſerve very ſtrictly, what the Nationall Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſin of the time and preſent generation may be. Where iniquity abounds, it is hard to determine, but queſtionleſſe every age hath a peculiar diſtemper. In times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, when the bands of love are broken into ſeverall parties and factions, as they have been lately amongſt us, it is more eaſily diſcerned.</p>
            <p>A noble Gentleman of ſingular abilities, and one much employed in affairs of State in his time (whom I knew well) adviſed his friends at ſuch a time to buy up all the Pamphlets that were printed, if of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable worth; for when people fall out, they commonly ſpeak out; and if they be once drunk with paſſion, and their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers boyl to any height, the moſt ſecret venome will ſwim on the top: By which means you may eaſily ſeel the pulſe of the preſent time, and diſcover what is the Nationall and moſt predominant ſinne:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55550:37"/>
and it will be worth our praiſe to know it.</p>
            <p>Which that we may the better doe, let us look back a little to the generations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some times have been more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for drunkenneſſe. <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Book <hi>de Lingua Latina,</hi> obſerves this of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in his time, that their <hi>vivere</hi> was <hi>bibere,</hi> not only in their pronunciation, as he noted; but in their practice, as other well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who lived that they might drink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> foretold ſo much of ſome times, that men ſhould be ſo drowned with this ſin of drunkenneſſe, that <hi>plurimum meri ſumpſiſſe virtus eſſet,</hi> it ſhould be eſteemed a virtue to ſtrive with the Brewers horſe who ſhould carry more liquor; and with ſome it hath been of that eſteem, that not <hi>as drunk as a Begger,</hi> but <hi>as drunk as a Prince,</hi> hath been a kind of proverbial commendation of ſome.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Aeſchines</hi> commended <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> for a Joviall man, who would drink freely; <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> being by, told him, that this was a good quality in a Spunge, but not in a Prince.</p>
            <p>Drunkenneſſe is a ſin that layes men open to all iniquity more then any ſin. <hi>Ebrietas in ſe culpas complectitur omnes.</hi> What ſin is not<note place="margin">Prov. 23 33.</note> a Drunkard ſubject to? <hi>Their eyes ſhall behold ſtrange women,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) and their hearts ſhall utter perverſe things.</hi> And a ſin it is that God hath more frequently and ſuddenly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55550:37"/>
plagued with death in the very act then any other ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edgar</hi> a King of <hi>England,</hi> obſerving in his time that exceſſive drinking abounded in the Land, through the example of the <hi>Danes</hi> that dwelt in divers parts of the Kingdome; to prevent that evill, ordained that their cups they drank in ſhould have certain pins or nails put in them, beyond which if any drank at one draught, he ſhould pay ſo much money.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some generation hath been more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for that ſin of Swearing, and that by the name of God, even at every word here in <hi>England.</hi> Inſomuch that a family in this Land, and that no mean one, was ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for this ſin, that they had the name of the <hi>Bygods</hi> given them, and were ſo uſually called.</p>
            <p>I remember, Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts and Monuments of the Church,</hi> reciting many evidences whereby he proved the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Prieſts Marriage, ſets down the copy of a Releaſe made by <hi>William Bygod,</hi> Lord of <hi>Little Bradley,</hi> to <hi>Henry Denardeſtone</hi> Clerk, and <hi>Alice</hi> his Wife; and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that name of <hi>Pigot</hi> was originally the ſame, though in ſucceſſion of time, and very wiſely it was changed: <hi>Omne peccatum ſuam habet excellentiam:</hi> Every ſin hath ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vileneſſe, wherein it may be ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel other. There's not any ſin that doth more plainly diſcover the great profaneneſſe of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55550:38"/>
the heart, as common ſwearing, eſpecially<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 34.</note> by the name of God, for <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Some times that are gone over our heads, and therefore far behinde us, have been infected with an itching humour after Superiority, wherein perſons not content to abide in the calling that God ſet them in, have indevoured to go beyond their proper line, and ſo broke their ranks. Thus <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> was not content with the place of a Son, nor <hi>Hazael</hi> with the rank of a Subject, nor <hi>Jezabel</hi> with the condition of a Wife, whoſe deſires ſhould be ſubject to her Husband, whoſe right it was to rule over her. Thus the loweſt of the people under the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> would be Prieſts, and it was a ſmall thing in the eyes of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, that God had brought them<note place="margin">Num. 16. 9.</note> nigh unto himſelf to do ſervice, but they muſt ſeek the Prieſthood alſo. Thus <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> the Servant of <hi>Solomon</hi> is not contented,<note place="margin">1 Ki. 11. 26.</note> unleſſe he may lift up his hand againſt his Maſter. How ſad was that time amongſt the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who whileſt they made their third Expedition into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and tarryed ſeven yeers (as <hi>Juſtin</hi> in his Hiſtory reports) were turned out of their beds and poſſeſſions by their ſervants that were left behinde to keep their cattle, and at their return were kept out by force of Arms by thoſe ſlaves who had taken their Wives, and poſſeſſed their goods. Not much unlike that of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55550:38"/>
people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſervants ruled over them,<note place="margin">Lam. 5. 8.</note> and there was none to deliver them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> riding one day through a Towne, was asked by one, whether there were any ſtriving for offices and places of honour in that place, anſwered that he had rather be the chief man in that little Village, then the ſecond perſon in <hi>Rome;</hi> an itching humour it is after greatneſſe, that hath run in a blood from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to this day, who were not content with their ſtanding, but would be as Gods, knowing good and evill: Now as the root of this humour is extreme pride, ſo the fruit is confuſion; firſt I ſay pride is the cauſe, there are none that are ſo low in their deſerts, but are very high in their thoughts; even the bramble hath great thoughts and high words too of his ſhadow,<note place="margin">Judg. 9 15.</note> and it was but a ſhadow. <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> thought they could manage the affairs of a Kingdome better then <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Benhadad,</hi> or <hi>Ahab,</hi> or <hi>Solomon.</hi> Every ſimple Cobler thinks he can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Laſt, and preach far better then his Prieſt: <hi>Ye Sons of Levi</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take too much upon you:</hi> But the fruit of ſuch ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is miſchief and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Some Countrey Peſants that behold the ſtars to gliſter in the horizon on the top of a mountain, think if they were there they could reach the heaven, &amp; order the ſtars, but being exalted on that mountain, they are as far to ſeek as before. What became of <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55550:39"/>
the Rebel, and <hi>Hazael</hi> the Traitor, and <hi>Iezebel</hi> the Proud? of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the Servant, and <hi>Corah</hi> and his company? As none did ſo ill, ſo none ſped worſe, their miſchief ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on their own heads, and (like to <hi>Phaeton)</hi> their violent dealing on their owne pates. Thoſe <hi>Scythian</hi> ſlaves, though their Maſters could not beat them with their weapons, yet at the ſight of their Maſters rods and whips ran all away, and at laſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>But you will ask me, What may be the ſin of this time? Somewood is more apt to breed worms, and ſome cloth more ready to breed moths, and ſome times have their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſins. But, what is the ſin of this age? which is more conſiderable for us, then the looking back to the times that are paſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some ſay our great diviſions, our moſt bitter contentions, and that amongſt Brethren, is the ſin. And indeed this evill is grown to that height, that they that ſhould dye one for another, can hardly live one by another. Surely ſuch diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that profeſſe godlineſſe, cauſe great thoughts of heart, for the neerer the union is, the more dangerous is the breach; broken bones are not ſo ſoon healed, nor ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news that are cut ſo ſoon knit, as great gaſhes in the fleſh may be cured; if a cable rope be broken, it is very hardly tyed together. If the Father and the Son, if the Husband and the Wife fall out, they are hardly reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;

and, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A brother offended</hi>

               <hi>is harder to be won then a strong City.</hi> We do not finde that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ever met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again after they parted aſunder,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 39.</note> through their ſharp contention. Which made <hi>Coſmus</hi> a Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> ſay, We are commanded to forgive our enemies, but we never read that we are bid to forgive our friends. And that which makes our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſo much the more grievous, is, that one ſpeciall means that God hath appointed for the uniting of Brethren, is become a ground of the greateſt quarrell. The Lords Supper is a feaſt of Loves, a communion or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to nouriſh union, and yet at this feaſt we have found a bone of contention, and an apple of ſtrife. And it is obſervable, that when any liſten to ſeducing ſpirits, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from this ordinance, they grow ſowre and ſullen to their deareſt friends. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt foretelling the evills of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes, gives this as a badge of the laſt and worſt, the old and cold age of the world: <hi>Iniquity ſhall abound, and the love of many ſhall grow cold.</hi> But what is the cauſe of both? <hi>Many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall ſeduce many;</hi> and ſurely the difference of judgement will ever cauſe a diſtance in affections. Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands though they doe not ſmoak more when they are out of the chimney, yet I am ſure they offend more, and may prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The novel opinions of theſe times kept within dores do too much harm; but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55550:40"/>
ſpread abroad by the boutefewes of theſe times through their burning charity are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſet all on fire. And moſt people either out of ignorance or eaſineſſe, are like foot-travellers, who when they come to a ſtile that ſtands neer a gap, leave the ſtile and go in at the breach; take up any error that cauſeth diviſion, rather then take the pains to try the ſpirits, to prove all things, and keep that which is good. Unity is the higheſt myſtery in heaven, and would be the greateſt happineſſe on earth, could we enjoy it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Union is from God, diviſion from the Devil, who where he comes with his cloven feet, ſeparates chief friends; and ſurely ſuch are factors for hell that cauſe diviſions, that obſerve <hi>Machidvel</hi>'s rule, they divide that they may rule; but ſurely the end of ſuch wayes will be their owne confuſion. The cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion <hi>Mile</hi> when he thruſt his hands into the clefts of an Oak, thinking thereby to make the breach the wider, was caught, and there held till he was devoured by wilde beaſts. God grant that ſuch envyous perſons, that do ſow the tares of diviſion, may reap the fruit of ſuch labours, even confuſion. He<note place="margin">Jer. 32.</note> graciouſly fulfill his promiſe, and give us one heart and one way; He hear the prayers<note place="margin">Job. 17.</note> of his dear Son, and grant that we may be one; He turn our heart-burnings into heart-breakings, and unite us faſt together in the <hi>unity of the ſpirit, with the bond of peace.</hi> This I conteſſe is one of the ſickneſſes of theſe

               </gap>olineſſe, and the power of godlineſſe. Such was <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtate.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that tame Foxes, if they break looſe, and turn wilde, will do more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief then any. <hi>Iulian</hi> was once a Chriſtian, and a forward profeſſor, but turning back to Heatheniſme, drew more from the Faith by fraud, then any of his predeceſſors did by force. <hi>Baldwine</hi> and <hi>Bolſack</hi> turned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and were hired by the Papiſts to write
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55550:43"/>
the Life of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and proved deſperate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to the truth. <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> had ſometimes a taſte of the truth, but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, proved moſt bitter enemies to the Church of God. The greateſt enemies that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man can have, are thoſe of his own houſe. He was of the ſociety of Jeſus that betrayed him. Such Apoſtates are not onely inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to others, but in concluſion are the greateſt enemies to their owne ſouls. To fall backward is more dangerous to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to apoſtatize is moſt dangerous to the ſoul. What became of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate his <hi>Viciſti Galilaee?</hi> which taking a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of blood and flinging it up into the air againſt Chriſt, told all the world that<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 38.</note> his end was miſerable. <hi>If any man draw back</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>my ſoul ſhall have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuch.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>France,</hi> after his revolt to Popery, was perſwaded by a great Duke about him, not to readmit the Jeſuites into the Land, who had been juſtly baniſhed by the State. He anſwered, Give me then ſecurity for my life: and thereupon admitted them, and gave them one of his owne houſes for a Colledge; but did that ſecure him? certainly it did not; the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites would never truſt him, for firſt one by their procurement ſtab'd him in the mouth, and after that another to the heart, and that was the end of ſo great an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And ſurely he that draws back from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55550:43"/>
the God of truth muſt needs embrace error; if from the God of wiſdome, will be a fool; if from the God of happineſſe, cannot but be miſerable.</p>
            <p>This is a great ſin, but not that ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. So that if I may take liberty to expreſſe my thoughts, with humble ſubmiſſion to better judgements, I am of opinion, that not onely an unwillingneſſe to ſubmit unto, but a moſt violent oppoſition againſt the Kingly government of Jeſus Chriſt in his Church, by his owne officers and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is the ſin of this preſent generation. It is very obſervable, that the offices of Chriſt have met with ſtrong oppoſition, ſome in one age, and ſome in another, more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</p>
            <p>Some times have been more notorious for the oppoſition that was made againſt his Propheticall office, as when the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> defaced and burnt the Scriptures: So did the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who made it death for any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to have and read any part of the Old or New Teſtament. The ſame grand Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks have made their Injunctions, Precepts, Traditions, of equall authority with the Word of God: So did the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> at their fourth Seſſion.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>times</hi> have been more infamous for the oppoſition that was made againſt the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, who made peace for us by his Death, and ſtill maintains our peace by his Interceſſion. Thus the <hi>Papists</hi> have mightily
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55550:44"/>
oppoſed Chriſts Prieſthood, by their doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Juſtification by Works, their fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Purgatory, works of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prayers to Saints. Every man (ſay they) muſt ſuffer for his owne particular; yea, the works of one may ſuffice for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So ſay the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> in their Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Rom 8. 17. Col. 1. 24.</p>
            <p>But theſe times are ſuch as do more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fight againſt the Kingdome of Chriſt; and herein cunningly they ſtrike at the root, and undermine all his offices, the end whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> his Kingly office, being to ſupport the Prieſthood and Propheſie of Chriſt in their vigour and efficacy, that as a Prince and Captain of ſalvation to the Elect, he might bring them to God. A practicall, vigorous, open oppoſition of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office exerciſed in his ordinances, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more eminent then in theſe days. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are ſo many <hi>Gallioes,</hi> or <hi>Gadarens; Gallioes,</hi> that care not for thoſe things, as either too far below their greatneſſe, or too heavy a yoke to put their necks under; or <hi>Gadarens,</hi> who ſay plainly, <hi>We will not have this man reign over us,</hi> but deſire him to depart out of the Countrey; who are not only an unwilling, but a rebellious people in the day of his power.</p>
            <p>The reverend and learned Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> met together in their Provinciall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, in their Vindication of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to uſe their owne words, ſay as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55550:44"/>
much: <hi>We are not ignorant that this government hath many adverſaries.</hi> The ignorant perſon hates it, becauſe it will not ſuffer him to go blindfold to hell; the profane perſon hates it, becauſe it will not ſuffer him to eat and drink his owne damnation, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy coming to the Lords Supper; the Heretick hates it, becauſe after two or three admonitions it rejects him; the Jeſuite hates it, becauſe it is an invincible bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark to keep out Popery; the Schiſmatick hates it, becauſe the main deſigne of it is to make all the Saints of God to be of one lip, one heart, and one way. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, the Devill hates it, becauſe if rightly managed, it will in a ſhort time blow up his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And indeed, hence are all our miſeries and miſchiefs. Church-diſcipline is like the hem to the garment, rend off that, and how ſoon will all Religion ravell cut to nothing? It is like the hedge to the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, if that be pluckt up, how ſoon will the Boar out of the Wood, and the wilde beaſts of the field devour it? What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks break in upon it? all that paſſe by the way pluck it: <hi>Antitrinitarians, Antinomians, Antiſcripturiſts, Socinians, Familiſts, Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. would dig up this Vineyard by the very roots. How are Chriſts ordinances deſpiſed, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures queſtioned, Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters miſuſed? They were never
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55550:45"/>
more learned, more pious, or more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and yet never more ſcorned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued then at this day. All Sectaries and Schiſmaticks, though they differ much amongſt themſelves, yet agree all in this, an irreconcileable hatred of, and a bitter oppoſition againſt a godly faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
            <p>But it is no wonder, for if the Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel turn round, it is impoſſible that the ſpokes ſhould ſtand ſtill; if the Church and her diſcipline ſuffer under ſo many turnings and changes, ſurely her officers can have no reſt.</p>
            <p>Now, if any ask what the reaſon is that this government, formerly ſo much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo much deſired, is now ſo mightily oppoſed, as the moſt tyrannicall.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: It is not becauſe we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to more light then our Forefathers had, as is pretended; but,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Partly, becauſe the inſtruments are changed, the actors upon the ſtage that oppoſe it are new men. It was notable advice that <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Councel of War gave him after that <hi>Ahab</hi> had beaten him in that firſt battle. <hi>Take the Kings away every one out</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ki. 20. 24.</note> 
               <hi>of his place, and put Captains in their roomes.</hi> It is an old and a moſt politick device, If a deſigne receive a check, it may eaſily be driven on by changing the inſtruments, and hath often prevailed, where God hath not ſtept in and prevented it, as he did here.
<pb facs="tcp:55550:45"/>
That which is unſufferable in a Prince, may be commendable in a Captain. The ſame errors that were formerly taught, and as generally loathed, becauſe the broachers of them were Prelaticall, are now embraced gladly, and ſwallowed downe greedily, becauſe taught by ſuch as have a name of Sanctity. Take away the Biſhops every one out of his place, that ſo mightily oppoſed this diſcipline; and ſet up ſome rare gifted men in their room, that ſhall as much perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and oppoſe it; and then the ſame people that earneſtly laboured for this government, will now as violently reſiſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the wickedneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſſe of mens ſpirits, this being the laſt and worſt age of the world, and we are faln upon the very dregs of time. This govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very ſtrict, and mens ſecure lives will not eaſily ſubmit to Chriſts ſevere laws: We are become their enemies, becauſe we tell them the truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But chiefly, becauſe of the croſſe and froward diſpoſition of moſt men: If they be commanded any duty, they peremptorily reply, <hi>There is no hope, we will walk after our</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 18. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>owne devices, and we will every one do the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of his evill heart.</hi> If they be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den any thing, <hi>nititur in vetitum,</hi> they eagerly purſue what before they ſtubbornly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Let people be denyed what is petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they grow the more boldly importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, even to a kinde of violence; let their
<pb facs="tcp:55550:46"/>
deſires be granted, they not onely loath what before they liked, but grow higher in their demands.</p>
            <p>Whence <hi>Franciſcus Sodorinus</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Preneſte</hi> was heard to ſay to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth, that to grant to ſome people their petitions was but the way to ſlight the grant, and prepare for more. How many inſtances may we give of this?</p>
            <p>When God commanded Circumciſion, though under the ſharpeſt penalties, how unwillingly did people ſubmit to it? The<note place="margin">Exod 4. 24, 26.</note> neglect whereof had wel-nigh coſt even <hi>Moſes</hi> his life. And now the Lord hath taken it away, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> will be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
            <p>Time was when Chriſtians met in Lanes and Woods to hear the Word, even with the perill of their lives, being wholly reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all places of publick meetings. Oh! how much did they deſire that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might be granted to them! And what coſt were they at, when they had liberty given them to enjoy them! But in our dayes, when we aſſemble freely in ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places, every thing is too much that is beſtowed on them; with <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> we cry out, <hi>What needs this waſte?</hi> and, <hi>It is too much.</hi> And with what ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt do many turn their backs againſt thoſe places, and creep into corners?</p>
            <p>The ſame people, when they were reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from hearing Sermons, eſpecially the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55550:46"/>
Sermons of ſome men; How did they then flock to our Congregations, as Doves to the windows? they went from ſtrength, notwithſtanding the many penalties they endured: But now they have liberty to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſame perſons and places, they ſay, <hi>Depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thoſe wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Time was when Baptiſme was willingly and generally embraced by moſt, provided that their children might not be baptized with the ſigne of the Croſſe, which was then enjoyned; but now when that offenſive cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is removed, many of theſe care not whether ever their infants be admitted into the Church by that Sacrament or no.</p>
            <p>Heretofore people came moſt willingly and frequently to the Lords Supper, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they might not be brought up to the Rail, at which moſt ſtumbled, and be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed with as touching their geſture; but now, when what was deſired is granted, and that burthen (that neither we nor our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to bear) is removed, they loath that ſpirituall Manna, and ordinarily turn their backs upon that royall feaſt and company.</p>
            <p>Theſe people, when they were ſorbidden to meet together in private, where they uſed to afflict their ſouls before the Lord, for their own ſins, and the evils of the times, by prayer and faſting; and that notwithſtanding the ſevereſt cenſures of thoſe in power, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

ſuch meetings as unlawfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles; yet did meet, and that frequently, and (it is hoped) fruitfully: Now having free liberty granted, ſo to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeldome come together for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Martyrs have formerly gone more willingly to the ſtake to be burned, then theſe to this excellent ordinance, where their hearts may be warmed and refreſhed.</p>
            <p>Even ſo, when this government was ſtrongly oppoſed by the State, and all hopes of enjoying it, altogether fruſtrate, how did our Fore-fathers pray for it, preach for it, diſpute for it, print for it; yea, ſuffer even to bonds and impriſonment for it? Inſomuch that divers loſt their liberties, and ſome hazarded their lives. Amongſt the reſt, Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dall</hi> a learned and godly Miniſter, was at a generall Aſſizes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye for writing in defence of it: the Story of whoſe Impriſonment, Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Arraignment, I have ſeen: Yea, of ſo high account it was with ſome in thoſe days, that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the King of <hi>Scots</hi> wrote their Letters in his behalf to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> requeſting that he might not ſuffer for that Cauſe: Yea, King <hi>James</hi> then King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a Speech of his to the Generall Aſſembly, told them that he bleſſed God that he was born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was a member of ſuch a Church; his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, becauſe the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd other Churches in diſcipline; <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55550:50"/>
had true doctrine, but wanted true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. And now that we may enjoy it, the State in a full Parliament declaring for it, men loath and abhor it as the moſt tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Antichriſtian, and cry out, <hi>Not him but Barabbas,</hi> and chooſe rather to put their necks under any heavy yoke, then ſubmit to this gracious diſcipline, formerly ſo much deſired.</p>
            <p>Now the God and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt advance the Kingdome of his dear Son, that he may be Governor amongſt us, that he may rule in us, and reign over us; even he that is the Prince of peace, that came into the world with a <hi>ſong</hi> of peace, that going out of the world left us a legacy of peace, whoſe government is a government of peace, whoſe Miniſters are Embaſſadors of peace; whoſe wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſſe, and all whoſe paths are peace. He unite our hearts together in the unity of the Spirit, with the bond of peace. That God that could find out a way to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelf and mankind, He that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come too late in any danger, that can never be to ſeek in any ſtraight; heal our wounds that grow ſo deep, repair our brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that grow ſo wide: He in his good time give us one heart, and one way, that we may fear him for ever; for the good of us, and our children after us.</p>

            <p>Take but a little notice of the preſervation of our children; nay, but of one childe, and you will ſay that all our care is nothing without his watchfull eye. I will give you a memorable inſtance of a Childes delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

who, whileſt divers in the family, with many other friends were met together to faſt and pray, went out to a pond very much frozen, (for it was in an hard cold Winter) either to ſlide, or to whip his top, I remember not which; where two holes were made in the ice for the ſafety of the fiſh, and the taking up of water, into one of theſe he fell up to the arm-holes; the childe was ſoon miſt, and ſearch being made, he was found there: Had the hole been wider, or he not ſpread out his arms, or he not ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably found out (for it was about the time the company brake up) he had periſhed. I was then at the houſe, an eye-witneſſe of that deliverance.</p>
            <p>Another example I ſhall give you of a Man.</p>
            <p>A certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain in the Wars of <hi>France,</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, whom Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> aſſiſted againſt his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; being quartered in a Town lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the enemy, carryed himſelf with that civility toward his Landlord, as became an ingenuous Gentleman; and yet with that fidelity too, as ſuited with the honor of his command in chief; that he won very much reſpect from the Maſter of the family: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſome time after, the enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the Towne again, beaten the Kings party, ſlain many, and wounded more even unto death; at the end of the day, when the Armyes were retired, the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55550:56"/>
came out to cut throats, and to take the pillage: By providence this Landlord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, came to this Gentleman, ſorely wounded, and ready to dye; whom he beſtrides, and drawing his ſword proteſts he would there dye, rather then his friend ſhould ſuffer any further harm: And ſo by the help of others, he brought him home to his own houſe, where by chirurgery and good diet, with all carefull attendance, he recovered. This ſtory I heard the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman relate to me and others.</p>
            <p>Thus God creates deliverances; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, preſervation from danger, is nothing elſe but a continued creation. There is ſcarce any thing in the wayes of God more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable then Deliverances. And indeed, it is neceſſary that God ſhould take the charge of us at all times; for our dangers are ſo many and great, that none are wiſe enough, or ſtrong enough to deliver us, but the Lord.</p>

Hence as all our duties are preſented from us to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore are accepted; ſo all things are conveyed to us from God by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo are ſanctified. Chriſt is not onely our Mediator, but our Husband alſo, and ſo we enjoy all good things with him and by him; we have conjugal communion with him; ſo that we may ſay as <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Sechem</hi> ſaid to their people (the better to perſwade them to be circumciſed, and to marry into <hi>Jacob</hi>'s family) <hi>Shall not all their</hi>

Chriſt, and become one with him, ſhall not all be ours through him who is heir of all? Not onely his wiſdome to inlighten us, and his power to uphold us, but the world to ſupply us; ſo that if this Husband of ours he honorable, we cannot be mean; if he be rich, we cannot be poor; and ſo a little with him is a great portion, when the whole world without him is nothing. Hence the Saints of God, out of their love to Jeſus Chriſt, do uſe to ſet Jeſus Chriſt above all; <hi>his name</hi> alſo <hi>ſhall be above every name.</hi> Princes in their Proclamations, Charters, and Grants, ſet their names in the beginning, on the top, as <hi>James by the grace of God King of England,</hi> &amp;c.

The <hi>Grecians</hi> ſet the <hi>ſumma totalis</hi> of their bills of accompt in the top of the page, as we do in the bottome.

            <p n="2">2. Set Jeſus Chriſt above all the men and means of any good.

If there be many means, God muſt bleſſe them; if but few means, he can mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply them; if they be contrary means, he can uſe them; if there be no means, he can create them, or work without them: He it is that appoints all means of our good: He gives virtue to thoſe means that he appoints, he draws out that virtue that he gives, he bleſſeth that virtue that he draws out, and by the finger of his providence points us to the uſe of thoſe means that he will bleſſe; and in the want of all will work wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for our good. In the Creation, God had light without Sun, Moon, or Stars. He made the earth fruitfull, and cauſed every<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 5, 20.</note> plant to flouriſh when there was no rain, nor any man to till the ground, and could finde out an help for <hi>Adam</hi> that was moſt meet, though he could not.</p>

He redeemed all<note place="margin">Rom 8. 29, 30.</note> from preſent ruine, but called, and juſtified, and glorified onely whom he knew before, and had predeſtinated to be conformed to his Image.

Therefore, in the next place, be very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in the uſe of theſe things. Take heed you laſh not out too much of your love upon them, and delight in them.

It is reported of Pope <hi>Sixtus quintus,</hi> that before he attained the Papall dignity, he was the moſt humble crouching Fryer that (as my Author ſaith) was ever lodged in an oven; but once ſeated in that chair, the ſtouteſt and proudeſt Prelate that ever ware a triple crown. Some have obſerved, that even <hi>Judas,</hi> before he had the Bag-office, carried himſelf honeſtly and ſoberly; but afterward, he grew ſo covetous, that rather then he would want money, he would ſell his Maſter.</p>
            <p>Oh therefore take heed that your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions run not out in ſo full a ſtream to theſe things. Height of affection, as well as height of eſtate is dangerous. <hi>Set not your affections</hi>

            <p>There are two things that I deſire daily to make the matter, not only of my praiſe, but admiration. And the firſt is, that God hath preſerved from the beginning to this day, a little flock of ſheep amongſt a world of Wolves, and Lions, and Bears, that are ſet on miſchief. And the ſecond is, that God maintains a little grace in life, in the midſt of ſo much corruption that the heart is poyſoned with; a little faith, and a little
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55550:102"/>
humility, in the midſt of ſo much unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and pride. The reaſon why the Church is not waſted, is becauſe the Lord is their God; why this grace is not overwhelmed, and that our corruption breaks not out eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment into moſt notorious ſcandall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is, becauſe the corruption is ours, but the grace is the Lords. Hath God kept you therefore any day, that your heels have not been tript up? Forget not to bleſſe him for ſuch a mercy. A notable example of ſuch a thankful ſpirit we have in <hi>David,</hi> who by the humble and prudent counſel of <hi>Abigail,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtayed from imbruing his hands in the blood of <hi>Nabal</hi> and his family, bleſſed God<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 32, 33, 34.</note> and her that he was prevented. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith he to her) <hi>which ſent thee this day to meet me, and bleſſed be thy advice; and bleſſed be thou that haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood, and from avenging my ſelf with mine own hand,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="5">5. And finally, love the Lord for his goodneſſe.

and ſaith, Oh! love you the Lord; Let the drunkard love his cups, and the adulterer his harlots, and the covetous perſon his bags; but do you that are Saints love the Lord.<note place="margin">Pſal 31. 23.</note> For, <hi>the Lord preſerveth the faithfull, and pleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rewardeth the proud doer.</hi> When one buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket goes downe, the other will come up.

Oh! love the Lord therefore. And indeed, love is all that God looks at in us, and expects from us; and where there is love, there is no lack. After ſo large a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the great things God hath done<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 12.</note> for <hi>Iſrael, What</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to them) <hi>doth God now require for all this, but that you would love him?</hi> And indeed love is <hi>complementumle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> the fulfilling of the Law. <hi>Neither cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, nor uncircumciſion availeth any thing,</hi>

But in the 3. place, God himſelf ſeems to keep a Journall by him of all the care he hath of us, the coſt he beſtows upon us, and the good things he gives to us. He hath a book of remembrance of every paſſage of providence that concerns us. And indeed, the Scripture for a great part is little elſe but a hiſtory of his goodneſſe to his people. And that you may ſee that God is very pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in keeping accompt of his mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, you ſhall find that in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel<note place="margin">Joh. 2. 11.</note> of St. <hi>John,</hi> when Chriſt turned the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into wine; it is ſaid, <hi>This is the beginning of miracles that Jeſus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory.</hi> And when he healed<note place="margin">&amp; 4 54.</note> the noble mans Son; <hi>This is again the ſecond miracle that Jeſus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee.</hi> Thus God doth keep an account of his mercies beſtowed on us.
