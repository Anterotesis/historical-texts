            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NO man (Chriſtian Reader) can ſerue two maſters, ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt; for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that is of God is ſweet and delectable: but this is not for al men, but for thoſe only, which deſpiſe the vanities of this world. It is impoſſible to taſte of God and his pleaſures, &amp; to loue diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately the things of this life. All men would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy gladly the ſweet conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord; but few there be that will forgoe their owne worldly deſires, and willingly deſpiſe their earthly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: they deſire greatly to haue the inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the ſoule; but withall, they deſire to ſatisfy their own extraordinary luſts and appetites. This may well appeare in the Apoſtaſy of this Noble man, very godly &amp; carefully broght vp in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeeres in the true Religion, who caſting off all true feare of God, loue of true Religion, and the great honour &amp; commendations that his houſe &amp; predeceſſors had, for profeſſing &amp; maintaining the ſame againſt the enemies therof, ſuffering himſelfe in the prime of his yeres, with pride and preiudice, two of his chiefe guides into Italy, to be bereft of that precious &amp; ineſtimable pearle of Chriſts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for pride inſinuating her ſelfe, crept into his ſoule (a moſt dangerous gheſt) &amp; taking once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion, is very hard to be expelled againe. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice on the other part, ſo great an enemy to the
<pb facs="tcp:19016:4"/>
truth, that it makes the mind vncapable of it; for if in his heart he had laid a ſure grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, all his enemies had not ſhaken it, much leſſe ouer thrown his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Ye ſee, be loued, what it is to ſerue two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as he would haue done. I compare him vnto thoſe, who kindles a fire vnder greene wood, and leaues it ſo ſoone as it begins to flame, leauing off a good beginning, for want of ſeconding it with a ſuteable proceeding: but rather lazily &amp; cowardly being ouercome with the pleaſures of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, and the curioſity of his young and vayne conceits, forgetting the ſeruice of God, wherin he had liued before, betook him to the ſeruice of Antichriſt, &amp; with-drew himſelfe, as with a diſcontented mind, from the company of his chiefe Gouernour, both graue, wiſe, and godly, giuing himſelfe ouer to the company of thoſe deuouring Serpents, who neuer left him, vntil he was broght into the endleſſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borinth of their ſuperſtitious Idolatry, &amp; made his ſoule drunk with the new wine of the cup of the Beaſt. I beſeech you therefore, all that loue your owne ſaluation, to take here your example, and eſchue the company of the vngodly &amp; wicked, but eſpecially ſuch, as in the habits of ſimple Lambs, come ſecretly as Wolues, to infect and deuoure your ſoules, vnder the pretence of holineſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: and ſo I bid you farewell.</p>

                  <p>SIR, I am to render you exceeding great thanks, for the receiuing in ſo good part, the newes of my returne: but if any other hath noted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in you, that hath bin againſt my intention &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who haue nothing in more reſpect, then to ſerue you, and not in any ſort to offend you. Theſe faire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which pleaſed you to giue me, haue brought into me a great ioy and contentment, imagining with my ſelfe, that they haue proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a perſon of ſuch learning, as you be; and that beare mee ſuch good will, as to loue me: the one, knowne to the whole world, the other beleeued of me with a great ſatiſfaction. But this diſcourſe, which it hath pleaſed you to propound, touching the manifeſt difference of 2.

I will rather intreat you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me in the controuerſies, then to ſtrengthen mee in my beleefe. And firſt, to ſhew me, if the viſible Church hath remained any ſpace of time in her purity, and how long? or if ſhe hath euerſo remained; or if ſhe hath had only that quality of purity ſince <hi>Caluins</hi> time? Secondly, if ye hold for conſtant and firme, the heads of Religion, that were debated &amp; reſolued vpon, in the ſoure firſt generall Councils?

Eyghtly, if all bodies bee circumſcribed or not? I pray you now, not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſo ſubtilly, that I cannot vnderſtand you, leſt perhaps, you may diſtruſt, that ſome other, and not my ſelf haue made them: as you may iudge, that the order and the ſtile cannot proceed but from ſuch an ignorant perſon as I: ſo alſo, the ſubiect and matter is concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in my ſpirit, by writing of that, to which, for the moſt part, there is need of no other anſwere, but your nay.

               <body>
                  <p>SIR, I prayſe God with my whole heart, that in the end he hath put in your mind, this iuſt &amp; right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to keep one eare for the truth, the which
<pb facs="tcp:19016:8"/>
being in this world, as in a ſtrange &amp; for raine country, or as it were impriſoned by the father of lyes, incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more enemies that accuſe her, then of aduocates that defend her. I know her accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by thoſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which it hath pleaſed you to demaund of me: your modeſty requires, that I receiue them, as from the part of an ignorant: but it is a long time ſince I learned, that the moſt profound Doctors of <hi>Sorbon</hi> could not bring forth more better, nor more beautifull. Neuertheles, I reioyce to behold you to take on the quality of a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that binds your conſcience to delay all reuolting at leaſt, vntill that time, that ſure knowledge ſhall teach you both the reaſon &amp; the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therof: but I beſeech you to pardon me, if my anſwers ſurpaſſe a little the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of yea and nay, which your letter hath preſcribed me, conſidering, that there requireth a little more time to draw a ſtone out of a pit, then in caſting of it in; and that the center &amp; the circumference of an anſwer, well made, is not only ſo much the wil of him that makes, the demaund, but principally the need he hath to know &amp; vnderſtand it. Alſo I perſwade my ſelf, that ye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the name of diſciple after the maner of the <hi>Pithagoreans,</hi> that alledge for all reaſons &amp; anſwers, the yea and the nay of their maſter: a ſtyle, which for the preſent is not fitting but to the diſciples of the Pope, of whom only ſelfewil holds the place of all reaſon &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And although you deſire to be rather inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the controuerſies, then fortified in your beleefe: and that you perceyuing ſo clearely, that ſuch anſwers, vpon doubtfull and intricate queſtions, ſhould ſerue meerely all, eyther for the one, or for the other, and would increaſe in you, rather the number of your
<pb facs="tcp:19016:8"/>
doubts, then lighten the darkneſſe of your ignorance, by the light of that ſame knowledge, which conſiſteth not in the ſimple affirmation or negation, but in ſolide and neceſſary demonſtration. Such was the opinion of S. <hi>Auſten</hi> prayſing <hi>Nebridius,</hi> which hated greatly a ſhort anſwere to a great queſtion, iudging him that knew not how many things might and ought therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee ſpoken, was not worthy to haue propounded them. And ſince that the almighty God would not permit that I ſhould remayne neere your perſon, vntill that time, that your age ſhould bee more capable of more exact inſtructions: I thought, notwithſtanding my farre abſence, I was bound to repayre that breach, that in taking vpon you the title of a diſciple in your letter, you haue honored me in that, which ſometime I inioyed: and hauing not ſince changed any thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my dwelling, and not my affections to continue my ſeruice towards you, I ſhould bee thought vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your good will and kindnes, if I ſhould content mee, after the maner of Trumpets, to haue giuen you courage by my former letter, without bringing now the helpe and ſuccour, which you craue againſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of your doubts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Queſtion, or rather doubt, which you demaund of mee, is this, <hi>If the Church viſible hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned any certayne time in her purity, and how long? Or if ſhe hath remained continually? Or whether ſhee hath this purity ſince</hi> Caluins <hi>time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To them then who aſſault you, and that make no other Buckler but of the Fathers, they ſhall ſuffer me to anſwere to this queſtion by the mouth of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> or by <hi>Egyſippus,</hi> who is more ancient then <hi>Euſebius;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19016:9"/>
and very neere to the age of the Apoſtles themſelues, who ſayes in his Hiſtory eccleſiaſtical, that the Church hath remayned virgin-pure, chaſte, and whole, ſo long as the Apoſtles did liue; and after the generation of thoſe, who had heard that heauenly wiſedome with their owne eares, then errour entred, and tooke poſſeſſion within the Church: but to others that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire inſtruction, there is required a more particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, leſt they ſhould thinke, that wee deſire rather to cut the knots, then to looſe them: I ſay then, that this purity is to be conſidered, either in regard of the doctrine, or good life; and that both the one and the other is in the Church, according to the condition and meaſure, which is aſſigned to her, during the ſpace of her reſidence heere on the earth: <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.</note> in the which eſtate, as touching her head, who is Ieſus Chriſt, ſhe is euer pure; but not altogether pure in herſelfe: for ſeeing euery member of the ſame is ſubiect to fayle, as well in doctrine, as in life, and that wee knowe her heere but in part; the body which is compoſed of theſe members, cannot bee <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 7.</note> wholy pure and perfit: and to conſider the body of the Church, without her members particular, whereof ſhee is compound, were as much, as to tranſforme her into an <hi>Idea Platonica,</hi> only the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by a vocation, and ſpeciall prerogatiue, and by an aſſiſtance and helpe immediate &amp; extraordinary of the holy Spirit, were exempt and free of all errour in the doctrine, the which in this reſpect, and by good reaſon, is the true and onely rule of all purity: and according as the Church drawes either neere, or is far diſtant, the meaſure of her purity increaſeth or decreaſeth: and
<pb facs="tcp:19016:9"/>
when ſhe is called pure, that is, either in reſpect of her head, or in regard of a part thereof, which is receyued in the heauens, which they call the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; or, rather in regard of the end ſhee aymes at in this world; euen ſo, as they call a houſe, an edifice, which is but yet in building, and before it be complete and ended. And like as the purity of the Church is ſubiect to alteration; euen ſo is her forme or externall behauiour, in reſpect whereof, they call it viſible: for although ſhe remayne euer viſible in her ſelfe, yet ſo is it, that ſhe is not alwayes viſible to others, eſpecially to thoſe that haue not the eyes which be requiſite for the ſeeing of her; as the Sunne it ſelfe is not to be ſeene by <note place="margin">Heb. 18. 38. Apoc. 12. 14. Math. 2. 13.</note> a blind man: and the Almighty, for the preſeruing of her from her perſecutors, retyred her ſometimes to the wilderneſſe, to ſecret caues and dennes, euen as he did withdraw his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus into Egypt, to preſerue him from the rage of <hi>Herode:</hi> And then ſhee became inuiſible, but not to God, neyther to herſelfe, but only to the eyes and iudgement of the blind world. I ſay then, that the Church militant hath euer retained that meaſure of purity, which the holy Ghoſt hath communicated to her, not only ſince <hi>Caluins</hi> time, but the Apoſtles dayes, euen to vs preſent this day: As alſo the ſayd meaſure was much different &amp; diuers in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times &amp; places, the which vndoubtedly did moue the ancient Fathers, to compare the Church vnto the Moone, which ſheweth her ſelfe ſometimes of more, otherwhiles of leſſe light, as it were eclipſed, and hides herſelfe altogether, as it were, from the world, without danger notwithſtanding all this, either to be loſt or ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as well appeared in the Church of Iſrael, in the
<pb facs="tcp:19016:10"/>
time of <hi>Ely</hi> the Prophet, where there was a Church of ſeuen thouſand, that did not bow their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> which was not perceiued there externally. If your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended teachers ſhall not graunt vnto me, that which heretofore is alledged, I ſhall cauſe them, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to deny the purity of their owne Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, and after this maner I will proue it: <hi>The Church that may altogether bee compounded of vnfaithfull perſons, wicked and reprobates, can haue, neither puritie in her faith, nor in her life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſo it is, that the church ſo deſcribed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> may be wholy compoſed of ſuch people: therfore ſhe can haue no kind of purity. The Aſſumption is proued and made cleare in his booke of the Church, in the laſt <note place="margin">Bellar. li. 3. cap. 2. de eccl.</note> Paragraph, where <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that is the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, according to the which, ſome be of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; not of the ſoule thereof, hauing no internall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and being as it were, the haire, the nayles, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours of the body of man: and of ſuch ſort be the Infidels, wicked and reprobates, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſſeth them, who may make external profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate to the Sacraments, &amp; ſubiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Pope, which be the 3. eſſentiall conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and only neceſſaries according to this Cardinall, for to be in the Church. By the ſame Authour, I will argue againe after another maner.</p>
                  <p>That which may be deſtitute of fayth, hope and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, cannot remaine in purity, yea, rather may loſe all.</p>
                  <p>But the church according to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> may be voyd of al thoſe qualities: therfore ſhe may loſe al her purity.</p>
                  <p>But if any ſhall reply, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> adioynes, that the ſayd vertues are to bee found neuertheleſſe in the
<pb facs="tcp:19016:10"/>
Church. I aske, whether they be of the eſſence of the Church, or not? If the firſt, wherfore ſayes he in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, that they be not neceſſary? But if the ſecond, how can a Church without faith, hope and charity, bee thought pure?</p>
                  <p>Learne then (ſir) by theſe two arguments, as by two marks, or rather enſignes, the purity of the place, where thoſe people would lodge you: neuertheles, this is that <note place="margin">Annal. tom. 6. an. 484. §. 4. &amp; tom. 7 an. 530. §. 5.</note> Church which Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> maintaynes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends to haue neither ſpot nor blemiſh.</p>
                  <p>Wheras ye write &amp; deſire, that the time may be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and marked, in the which errours and vncleannes haue entred into the Church of Rome: ſurely, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would prolong too much my letter, which you deſire me to make ſhort, &amp; would importune more by her prolixity, then it ſhould inſtruct you by her vtility, more proper to a hiſtory then to doctrine. Is it inough, that a poore Hydropique ſhould beleeue to be ſicke, &amp; to haue need of phiſike, when he is ſo ſwolne, that he is almoſt in danger to burſt, although none can preciſely mark &amp; ſhew him the houre when as his liuer began to be conſumed? Surely, while as the fire is in the houſe, the water within the ſhip, the enemies within the town, the Wolfe within the fold, thoſe that hope to preuent the danger, or rather to preſerue them be more aduiſed and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect, then thoſe that wil beleeue nothing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they ſhew them at what time, &amp; how that is come to paſſe, and who buſies the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in ſearching the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; the beginnings. we know, that already in the daies of the Apoſtles, the myſtery of iniquity began to work <note place="margin">2.

Behold then, how he handles theſe two of the firſt 4. generall Councils: for the reſt iudge, if ye pleaſe, which is moſt reaſonable, to ſubmit themſelues to the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cils, becauſe the Pope doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them, who maintaines himſelfe to be aboue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or becauſe the Councils haue ſubmitted themſelues to the word of GOD; the one, which is taught in the Church of Rome; the other, in our Church.</p>

The third queſtion is, <hi>Concerning the ſending of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <note place="margin">3</note> if it be neceſſarie for them, and of whom</hi> Caluin <hi>had it?</hi> I anſwer, that it is neceſſary; and that <hi>Caluin</hi> had it of the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Farel</hi> his predeceſſor, who had alſo his of the people of <hi>Geneua,</hi> who had right and authority to inſtitute &amp; depoſe Miniſters: for ſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth S. <hi>Ciprian,</hi> ſaying, that the people obeying to the <note place="margin">Lib. 1.

                  <p>The fourth queſtion is touching the interpretation <note place="margin">4</note> and vnderſtanding of the Scriptures, to wit, <hi>If euery one be capable of the vnderſtanding of it, interpreting it by it ſelfe?</hi>

                  <p>The fift demaund is, touching the confuting of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, to wit, <hi>If that we hold them not for well and iuſtly</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:19016:12"/>
doth not condemne hereſies, but in ſeeming to bee an enemy to them, to the end the better he may eſtabliſh his owne: as did <hi>Zophyrus,</hi> that by ſuch ſlights wonne Babylon. The moſt ordinary and common argument of the Pope, for to refute hereſies, is by the fagot, &amp; the hand of the hangman, according to the Logick of the Inquiſition of Spayne, and the practiſe of the Ieſuites, their Apoſtles in the New found world, againſt the poore Pagans; notwithſtanding that the ſcholaſticke diuines maintaine, that the Infideis ought not in any <note place="margin">The 21. 9 O art. 8.</note> caſe to beforced to receiue the faith; yea, not after ye haue ouercome them in warre, and made them ſlaues. But in this there appeares to vs yet one of the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the pretended Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt, with his maſter the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion which the one giues to his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, beares this; <hi>Go ye, teach all nations, &amp;c.</hi> That which <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> the other giues to his, is, <hi>Go kill, maſſacre, poyſon all people, who will not obey me.</hi>

and propheſying in a part, and that they haue not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the whole trueth, but only according to the meaſure of the grace of Ieſus Chriſt: we eſteem them for Inſtruments of God, where they haue ſpoken the <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 7.</note> truth; but where they haue a little erred, in going out of the right way, we ceaſe not neuertheleſſe to hold them for the children of God, beleeuing that the heauenly Father hath couered their infirmities: neither doe wee deſpiſe the faire harueſt of learning, that aboundeth in their writings, for certain cares of cockle, which are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with them: but we do hate thoſe, who gather no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Cockle and their errors, who defile and corrupt, as much as they may, by their <hi>Index expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorius,</hi> the good grayne, which is there, who preferre their Briers to their Roſes, and in ſtead of concealing their owne ſhame, kiſſed it, and cauſed it to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the people. As for their teſtimonies in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s concerning the matter of fact, we accept them in things of their times, &amp; that be of their knowledge, eſpecially when it is well grounded and aſſured: for it ſhalbe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they haue miſtaken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues both in the one and in the other; and there is none, except the Prophets and the Apoſtles, to whom, by a ſpeciall prerogatiue, pertaineth the condition of witneſſe without reproof, <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 48. Act. 1. 8</note> and free of exception. Otherwiſe, the writings of the Fathers, at leaſt, thoſe who write the Hiſtory of their times, ſhould be equal to the Canonicall Scriptures.

more faith, then any authority of the Ancients; and in another place, that which the moſt true &amp; ſincereſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue reported of the Apoſtles, hath not remained in her owne integrity, without corruption.</p>
                  <p>As touching <hi>The Inuocation of Saints,</hi> your ſeuenth queſtion: <hi>I</hi> anſwere, It ſhould bee reiected in regard of both the two reaſons alledged by your ſelfe; to wit, as well, becauſe it is ſacriledge againſt God, as alſo, vnprofitable for vs: for to ſee, heare, vnderſtand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, &amp; to heare the requeſts of all apart, al at one time, and in all times; this is a propriety belonging onely to God, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, from whom they ſteale his honor, &amp; make the Saints to vſurpe his office, when one S. <hi>Iames,</hi> another S. <hi>Clowd,</hi> is called vpon in one ſame time, in a thouſand places, from the Eaſt to the Weſt, of a million of perſons, for thouſand and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of diuers things: alſo, when they beleeue that the Saints can vnderſtand, &amp; are ſufficient to ſatiſfie &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent euery one. And by this you may perceiue the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Ieſuites, who perſwade you, ſeeing it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to aske the help of the liuing, that it cannot bee prohibited to call vpon the dead alſo, of whome wee haue as little certainty that they can heare vs, as of commaundement that we ſhould reclayme them.</p>
                  <p>Your laſt queſtion, is, <hi>Of the circumſcription of the body.</hi> To which I anſwere, that euery true body is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and to be a body and not to be circumſcribed, that is to ſay, limitted and bounded, imports contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: for if the dimenſions be eſſentials to a body; and if it be neceſſary, that the dimenſions be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was neuer yet denyed, it followes then of neceſſity, that it is bounded and circumſcribed: and if
<pb facs="tcp:19016:14"/>
this neceſſity accompanieth all bodies in generall, how much more, a humane body, or body of man, which is not Mathematicall, neither compoſed only of matter and of forme; but which is organick, compoſed of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like parts &amp; of diuers kinds? of which then followes, that thoſe that take from him the circumſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end, to lodge him in one time &amp; inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in diners places: and inſted to amplify the power of God, deſtroyes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both his verity &amp; wiſdome, his might and his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head altogether: His verity, in ſo much as hee ſhould haue in him, yea &amp; no: if that he might ſay of one ſelfe ſame body, that he is circumſcribed, &amp; not circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; one, and none; organick, and not organick: His wiſedome, becauſe there would be diſorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his works: his power, becauſe it ſhould haue imperfection, to wit, a humane body, not hauing that, <note place="margin">Didy. de Spirit.

To conclude his Godhead, becauſe the creature finite ſhould be equal to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who is only infinite; by the which argument, the Ancients foreſaw the Deity of the holy Ghoſt: but if they will ſay, that the place is not of the eſſence of the body, &amp; conſequently, that the one may be without the other: it muſt be demaunded, if the time is not as well out of the eſſence of the body, as a body may bee then without time? Conclude ſo, ſhould not this be without time &amp; without ſence: if they reply again, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, although a true body, yet it is not contayned by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place, that inuirons it without. The anſwere is, that for all that it is not exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of circumſcription, being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcribed by the limits of her proper greatnes, &amp; forme inſeparable fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: and euen ſo, the bodies of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that while they ſhalbe tranſported aboue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,

You ſay to the firſt, which is of the purity of the church, that incontinent after the death of the Apoſtles, that it was corrupted: And <hi>Caluin</hi> referres himſelfe to the <note place="margin">Cal. lib. 4 ſect. 3.</note> ancient Church of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> and S. <hi>Austen.</hi> This is in his booke of Inſtitutions, and Lord <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> affirmes the firſt eyght hundred yeres, who was the firſt that gaue mee the occaſion, to read the Hiſtory of that age. In another poynt, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſending of the Miniſters, you ſay that <hi>Farrel</hi> had it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people: it behoueth then, that eyther the people there were Catholiks, or that they were inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the religion by ſome Doctor; &amp; by conſequence it is neceſſary, that a Doctor of the Religion procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people of the Religion, &amp; ſo without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or calling vnles it was extraordinary, or elſe from the Church of Rome. You alledge a paſſage of S. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> who ſayes, the people obedient to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, ſhould ſeperate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from a wicked guide, &amp; not to meddle with a ſacrilegious Prieſt. If ye receiue after that meaning, where he ſaies that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may diſcharge their guide, that is to ſay, a Paſtor: wherefore alſo receiue ye him not in that which he ſaies, that the Prieſt ſacrifices, &amp; that ſhewes at leaſt, that this was holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certayn in thoſe dayes. Finally, for what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or errour was it of the reformed Church, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth,
<pb facs="tcp:19016:17"/>
that her paſtors ſhould haue their ſending (as you ſay) in a part from the Church of Rome, as from an inſtrument corrupt? This is to do, as the Church of the Huſſeits in Germany, whereof all the Doctors for the moſt part, had their order of Prieſthood from the Church of Rome, fayning to be thereof, at the leaſt, as I heard it, of the greateſt part of their owne country people: but whether that bee or not, it imports not much. Beſide this, I demaund you, the way of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being in all ages open, and our Sauiour Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuffered for al them, who ſhould apply vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the merit of his death, what doctrine, I pray ye, held they that were the faithfull, three or foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres ſince? And if you had beene in that time there, in what Veſſell had you put your ſelfe, to haue arriued to the port of ſafety? Touching the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Fathers, you ſay, you accept of them, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the queſtions of the fact of the things done in their time. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> ſayth, that he cauſed the Maſſe to be celebrated. This is a queſtion of fact, and a thing done in his time.</p>
                  <p>I abuſe your patience, in detayning you ſo long, to read nothing that is worth your paynes, and I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you no farther, but to aſſure you, that I am more then any perſon</p>

                  <p>SIr, I perceiue by that which it pleaſed you to write to me by the Gentleman coming to this place, that with my anſwere vpon your honeſt demaundes, yee are ſatiſfied with that which I haue ſpoken co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning fiue of them, to wit, <note place="margin">1</note>
                     <hi>Of the authoritie of the foure gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells: the interpretation of the holie Scriptures: <note place="margin">2</note>the the refutation of Hereſies. <note place="margin">3</note>The inuocation of Saintes, <note place="margin">4</note>the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription of Bodies:</hi>

I anſwere, if ſo be that ye conſider rightly of my letter: ye ſhall finde it is not I that pronounce the ſentence, but <hi>Egeſippus</hi> and after him, <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus:</hi> and that my intention is to put that ſentence in your hands, only to cloſe the mouths of thoſe who eſtourdiſſis &amp; deaffes you with their ſturre of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But for the chief poinct of the queſtion, &amp; for your inſtruction, I haue anſwered, altogether other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and largelie enough, to the which ye replie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, the ſubſtance of my anſwere is, that the Church militant hath retained euen to our time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, the meaſure of puritie which the holie Ghoſt hath giuen her: But to haue reſerued this
<pb facs="tcp:19016:18"/>
pureneſſe, it followeth not, that ſhe hath conſerued nothing which is not pure: or that the inuentions of men, or the ordinances of the Popes doe make parte of the puritie, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Hydropſie</hi> makes part of the health of a mans bodie, although it be therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and incloſed. Euen as the health of mannes bodie conſiſteth not in a poinct indiuiſible, alſo neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the puritie of the myſticall bodie of the Churche militante, and compaſſed with her infirmities, as well the faith as in the life; &amp; as they call a man whole, who neuertheles is not without ſome euill humours in his bodie, comparing him to a ſicke patient, faſt tyed to the bed, and conſumed with the pocks. So doe wee call the Church, that was nereſt to the Apoſtles pure, in regard of the ages following, in the which the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of iniquitie was conuerted in the miniſtrie, or rather into the kingdome of wickednes and Idolatrie, the one and the other is a noyſome humour in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Churche, but the one is in ſecret, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publike, the one in ſeede, and the other ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp, the one in the parts indifferents, the other in the noble partes: the one a ſcabbe, the other a ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cancre, the one proceeding for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in thoſe who were come from heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cuſtome, the other in lacke of conſcience in them, who would from Chriſtianiſme, bring vs to Paganiſme, Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme and Atheiſme.</p>
                  <p>Touching that which I haue anſwered to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, concerning the calling of the miniſterie, and eſpecially of <hi>Farrell,</hi> who had it of the people, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie authorized to geue him the ſame, according to the teſtimonie of <hi>S.

                     <pb facs="tcp:19016:18"/>
go before a people of the religion, for to teache them. 2. the ſecond that by the teſtimonie which I alledge, forth of the ſaid Father, it apeareth, that in thoſe times the Prieſts ſacrificed. To the firſt poinct I anſwere fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer things. Firſt that in which you ſay that it ought to be done, it is done when the order is in his entier: But that in a generall diſorder and confuſion, ſuch as was the Popiſh in the time of the reformation, all the formalities of order, ſhould no more be required, then they may be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Secondly that the Doctors ſent by God ought not <note place="margin">2</note> at all times to acknowledge the cornet cappes, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:19016:19"/>
Cardinalls, diſorder was verie great and extreame in the ſaid Church, and that ſhee had neede of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well in the head as in the members, as well in the Faith as in the maners. Beholde in the Frier <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi> this notable apothegme of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> 4. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated &amp; confirmed by the pope <hi>Marcell.</hi> That ther is <note place="margin">Oauph.

                  <p>As touching that where ye ſay that it is a great fault to the reformed Church that it behooueth that hir Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had her ſending in a parte from the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> as from a corrupt inſtrument: I anſwere, that my letter beareth not, that it is neceſſary of right; but that this was found wanting in our firſt paſtors: this was not any want, but to acknowledge the fault to amend it, our chiefe perfection conſiſting to acknowledge &amp; to correct our imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſeing we be neither Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts who acknowledge not the Churche, where there is a great &amp; notable want in maners, neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, who maintaineth that their Church cannot erre in the faith, an error, or rather a receptacle, couertour &amp; goulf of al the errors of the world, which carry away with it not only the feeling of the diſeaſe, but alſo the hope of their healing. He that furniſhed to you this point, ſhould conſider, that in throwing it againſt the Church reformed, he might verie well retorque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the <hi>Romane</hi> church, in the which we finde the Popes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to haue bene made by inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts very corrupt: &amp; among others the Pope <hi>Simmachus</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by King <hi>Theodorick</hi> who was an Arrian, <note place="margin">Theod. le. ior. lib. 3.</note> leauing to ſpeake of thoſe that were rather monſters then Byſhops or men, hath giuen the ſending or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:19016:19"/>
to the whole race of their Hierarchie. And as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the feminine Papeſſe <hi>Iane,</hi> ye haue learned in your voyage that in <hi>Rome,</hi> they holde not the whores there for corrupt inſtruments, &amp; by the teſtimony of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the magiſtrates ſin not, in aſſigni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <note place="margin">Bell. de a miſſ. in grat. &amp; ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum pro 2. 18. Beron, tom. 9. Ang. 26. &amp; verſe 54.</note> to them to haue a quarter within the Cittie, for theyr dwelling, albeit he knowe perfectly that they would abuſe it to an euill purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Clergie of the holy citie, not being ſo ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as were they of <hi>Grece,</hi> in the time of <hi>Theodorus Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites,</hi> who ſaid that it was a da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous thing for the ſoul of a Frier to haue but one beaſt of the feminine kinde.</p>
                  <p>And to the ſecond point of your Reply, I ſay, that wee avowe that there was ſacrifices in the time of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp; that there ſhall be ſacrifices to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the world. But yet that concludes no thing for the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, pretended reall, propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie for the liuing and for the dead, for their ſinnes paines, and ſatisfactions: good to coniure ſtormes, to heale diſeaſes, to winne Battels, to purge the great crimes to draw the ſoules out of purgatorie, to finde things loſt, &amp;c. The word ſacrifice is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for the whole office and diuine ſeruice: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he ſacrificed the Goſpel. And he called <note place="margin">Rom. 15. Philips 3.</note> ſacrifice the faith of the faithfull, alſo their prayers to God, their almes for the poore, their collecting for the Miniſterie, the offerings that were made to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aſſemblies, and from whence they tooke the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſte,</hi> was called Sacrifices: &amp; this is one of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, for the which the name was attributed to the holy Supper. The ſame anſwere may ſerue to your laſt Reply. As touching that which I ſpake of the teſtimonie of the Fathers: whereon you conclude,
<pb facs="tcp:19016:20"/>
ſeing that I accept then on the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of fact in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their time, I ought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accept the Maſſe, which S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> witneſſeth to haue cauſed to be celebrated in his time, I ſay that the ſame equiuocation which is in the word of ſacrifice, is in the word of <hi>Meſſe:</hi> albeit the vſage of this heere, is farre more new in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, then that was of theirs. In diuers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is not found at all, &amp; onely but touched in S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> &amp; that but in a writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> work which the moſt learned holdeth to be counterfeit: &amp; that alwayes in a farre different ſignification than it is taken for nowe adayes. I counſell you to take it into that ſame ſence which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth, by the proper confeſſion of of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (that is) <hi>Promiſsione</hi> for one diſmiſſing, and that you giue one fare well to the Maſſe, which is called in Lattine, <hi>Miſſam facere miſſam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Touching that newe queſtion, which you make in your letter: to wit, ſeeing that the way to ſaluation hath beene open in all Ages: to all thoſe who will apply vnto them the mirrit of the death of our Lord. What doctrine (I pray you) profeſſed they who were of the chooſen number, three or foure hundred yeeres ſince: and if I had beene in thoſe dayes, in what veſſell ſhould I haue caſt mee into, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the port of ſaluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> anſwere that the great Doctor of the Elect in all Ages, is the holy Spirit: for they are taught of God, <note place="margin">Iohn 6. ver. 11.</note> as witneſſed <hi>Ieſus Christ:</hi> and all their doctrine in all times is that of the olde and newe Teſtament: which neither Sathan, neither his Vicar the Antichriſt, could euer deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Of this doctrine, God hath alwaies reuealed as much as was neceſſary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whether they did read by themſelues, or that they vnderſtood it by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<pb facs="tcp:19016:20"/>
you haue an notable example in the Hiſtorie of S. <hi>Barnard,</hi> who being a little while before the time which you ſet downe perceiuing the corruptions of <note place="margin">In the life of S. Barnard neere the mids therof.</note> his time, at the very houre of his death (rempted by Sathan) he clenſed himſelfe of that filthineſſe, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he could not obtaine ſaluation by his merits, (which was the doctrine publiquely taught in the Schooles at that time) neither pretending it but by grace: declaring that our Sauiour poſſeſſeth it by a a double right, by the inheritage of the Father: and by the merit of his Paſſion, and that contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the one, he gaue him the other, if you deſire a more particular clearing of this queſtion; ſee the Book of the Cathologue of the witneſſes of the troth, and you ſhall finde that there hath beene no age ſo darke, wherin the troth hath not ſpread ſome beames amids the ſmoakes which ariſe out of the bottomles pit of Rome: And if God had giuen me life in thoſe times, I beleeue aſſuredly, that he would haue giuen me the grace, either to abſtaine from this Papiſticall poyſon; or to vomite it vp in time, preſeruing me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this infection: as hee preſerued his children from the fire of the Babylonian Furnace. In briefe, I would haue done that, which afterwards I did in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that which I wiſh you had performed in the ſame place, by the example of ſome of your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, making their prayers, and exerciſes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in priuate, without defiling themſelues with idolatrie, which is committed in publique: &amp; to goe out of this <hi>Babylon</hi> in heart, though they found them as touching the body, there engaged. The totall ſumme is: to ſaile in the ſea of this world which is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and materiall is required a ſhip viſible and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall:
<pb facs="tcp:19016:21"/>
but to arriue at the hauen of ſaluation, as this port is ſpirituall, &amp; in no wiſe of this world: ſo many enter there without materiall and viſible veſſell: that is, without being locally, and corporally in any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine materiall Temple, or viſible Church. And this I maintaine is happened to many, during this great and generall reuolt, vnder the tyrannie of Antichriſt, foretold in the Scripture; which like a long and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tempeſt hath rent and ſtrangely diſfigured the ſhip of the viſible Church, by the wines and waues of humaine inuentions which haue made many both Pilots, and paſſengers, for to looſe the Loadſtarre of Gods ordinances.</p>
                  <p>But ſuffer mee I (pray you) Sir, to aske you, to what port, or hauen you pretend to attaine in this ſhip of neutralitie, in which you ſtay ſo long in the roade, betweene the two barques of Preaching, &amp; the Maſſe, And if he, who iudgeth men ſuch as he findeth them, calling you vnexpectly to appeare before his throne, finde you thus diſpoſed, what ſentence would you hope from his mouth. I beſeech him with al my heart, to cauſe you to thinke vpon it, and ſo to prepare and direct you, rather by change of life, then Religion. In the meane time, I reſt:</p>
