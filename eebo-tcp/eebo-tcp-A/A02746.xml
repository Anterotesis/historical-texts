         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the godly and
wel-affected Reader.</head>
            <p>GEntle Reader, I haue
here preſented vnto
thy view, the ſumme
and ſubſtance of diuers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which I preached vnto
mine owne Charge, and ſome
adioyning neighbours: who
receiuing (as they profeſſed)
much good by my Labours,
were earneſt with me either
to beſtow vpon them ſome of
my notes, or elſe to publiſh in
Print, that which I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
in word. Whoſe requeſts
I could not well with-ſtand,
being vrged by ſome, that my
<pb facs="tcp:14956:5"/>
calling makes me a common
ſeruant for any good I may in
publike, as well as in priuate.
And I was rather induced
vnto this taske in a double
reſpect. Firſt, becauſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst
the heape of bookes that are
printed, too few ſtrike downe-right
at ſin, or lend a hand to
helpe forward the worke of
Grace. Secondly, becauſe the
iniquity of the time is ſuch,
that with too many (who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the faſhions of the world)
grace is out of faſhion, and of
all other things the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
or looked after; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(as I ſhall make it
plaine) it be the only thing to
be deſired, as that which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies
and well-ſeaſons euery
condition heere, and makes
way for happineſſe hereafter:
<pb facs="tcp:14956:5"/>
for the want of Grace cuts off
all hope of future glory, and
precipitates people into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
woe and miſery. Nature
by its ſtrength may in time
worke out, or weare out many
bodily maladies, without the
aduice of the Phyſician, or any
helpe of phyſick: but the ſoule,
ſo deadly ſin-ſick as it is, can
neuer be helped and healed,
without the Balſam of grace;
which alone is able in time to
worke out thoſe malignant
humors, which the ſoule hath
contracted vnto it ſelfe. A
rare thing it is to finde that
man or woman which wil not
eaſily be perſwaded, for the
preuenting or curing ſome
deadly diſeaſe, to take (though
otherwiſe loathing phyſicke)
ſuch things as ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb facs="tcp:14956:6"/>
them for their good:
for Nature ſeekes to preſerue
it ſelfe. Hence it is that the
Toad (vpon diſtemper) runs
to the Plantin, the Hart to the
Dittany, and the Dog to the
Graſſe. Therefore, vnleſſe we
will ſhew our ſelues to haue
leſſe vnderſtanding than the
vnreaſonable creatures, wee
muſt looke out for Grace, the
only cure of our diſtempered
and diſeaſed ſoules.</p>
            <p>Reade then, I beſeech thee,
this ſmall Treatiſe with the
ſame affection, and heart, in
which it was compiled for
thee; and that is (God knows)
an earneſt deſire of bettering
thy ſpirituall eſtate, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
forward thy ſaluation:
that the worldly wiſe-man
may grow more wiſe for his
<pb facs="tcp:14956:6"/>
ſoule; that the vngodly may
labour for grace; that the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
may be more ſincere
and vpright; and that the
gracious heart may grow in
grace, and with more comfort
hold it out vnto the end. If
vpon the firſt taſte thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
but little, or no ſweetneſſe
herein, let me intreat thee to
aſſay the ſecond time; one bit
may draw down another. It is
a rare feaſt where euery gueſt
likes, and loues all the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that is made; yet he is an
vnworthy gueſt which will
feed of no diſh, or bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with his friend which
inuited him, becauſe ſome
one or two diſhes bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
which hee likes not.

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:14956:13"/>
Although the Author
cannot ſpeake for himſelfe
to claime his right, or
to vindicate that wrong

yet the matter of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeakes ſufficiently for
its Author, and authority.
Why ſhould any queſtion

Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Enſigne, and

there was in concealing of
his name; the want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

proue it was not <hi>Pauls,</hi> for
then (by the ſame reaſon)
we may ſay, that it had no

            <p>Sometimes it is taken

<hi>2 Tim. 1. 9. Hee hath ſaued

his purpoſe and grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Somtimes it is taken for
the imputation of Chriſt
his righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom. 5.

            </p>
            <p>Sometimes grace is taken
for the guidance, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <p>Sometimes Grace is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the bleſſed eſtate of
Gods children after they
be iuſtified, and ſanctified,
<hi>Rom. 5. 2. By whom we haue

            </p>
            <p>Sometimes grace is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for glory, the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Hope to the end, for the grace

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14956:15"/>

            </p>
            <p>From whence we may

(ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> wiſht grace

wrote, aboue, and before

Grace.</hi> No doubt, if any

more beneficiall, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
vnto the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> he
would haue wiſhed it vnto
them: but ſeeing he begins
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14956:16"/>
and ends this, and other his

<hi>Grace be with you:</hi> we may
ſafely conclude, that <hi>Paul</hi>
eſteemed Grace to be the

wiſh them, or they par

            <p>Long and large diſputes

therefore (from a better

we conclude, that
the prime good, the beſt

Grace: for I may truly ſay

as it is worſe than nought;
and therefore we ſhould be

How much then doth it

the riſing and perſeuerance
thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of the ground and
beginning of grace. Know
we that all grace commeth
from God the fountain of
grace:<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Euery good giuing,
and euery perfect gift is from
aboue, and commeth downe
from the Father of lights.</hi>
Grace commeth from
grace: for there is grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing,
and grace infuſed.
Now that you may the
better diſtinguiſh the one
from the other: before I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14956:19"/>
fall vpon the differences,
giue me leaue to acquaint
you with the nature of that

grace is deriued vnto vs.
<hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the grace of God.<note place="margin">Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note>
                  <hi>Grace is the free good will of
God to man,</hi> whereby he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
of vs in <hi>Chriſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> it is called the free
good will of God, vtterly
to exclude all merit on our

Scripture in diuers places
doth diametrally oppoſe
grace and merit: As <hi>Rom.
11. 6. If it be of grace, it is
no more of works, or elſe were
grace no more grace.</hi> For
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14956:19"/>
grace is all grace, or no
grace. So <hi>Epheſ. 2. 8, 9. By
grace yee are ſaued, it is the
gift of God, not of works, &amp;c.</hi>
Light is not more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnto darkneſſe, good
ſtands not in more oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnto euill, than grace
and merit do oppoſe each
other. Merit in the beſt
ſenſe, in the leaſt ſenſe,
doth marre the ſenſe of
grace. Yea grace excludes
that preuiſion of our
workes, which ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to be the ground of
Gods louing vs; or if not
the ground, a maine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
and great meanes of
Gods beſtowing his grace

ſuch preuiſion, &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14956:20"/>
of our workes. The

grace muſt needs bee
free, it being his meere
good wil, and owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to reſpect vs. As he
told the people of Iſrael,
<hi>Deut. 7. 8.</hi> Nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God moueth him, or
can any wayes allure him
to beſtow his grace vpon
vs. Hee found vs in our
bloud,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> vnlouely, lothſome,
vnworthy to be beloued:
wherefore we conclude,
that grace is Gods free
good will.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath beene much puzled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this doctrine of Gods
free grace, and therefore in
generall termes they will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14956:20"/>
ſeeme to ioyne iſſue with
vs, as if they ſaid not, as if
they held not any other
thing than that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
alleageth,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24</note> 
                  <hi>Rom. 3. 24.
That wee are iuſtified freely
by his grace;</hi> but like the
Deuill their father, they
ſpeake the truth in a falſe
manner; their words haue
a wicked meaning, which
ouerthrowes the nature of
Grace, and the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For by <hi>Iuſtification</hi> they
doe not vnderſtand the free
grace of God in himſelfe,
and that right0eouſneſſe of
Chriſt, freely imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, but ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as God freely works
in vs: So by grace, they
do not vnderſtand the free
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14956:21"/>
and vndeſerued loue &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of God to man, but
certaine gifts of grace,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
habituall graces, as
faith, loue, mercy, &amp;c.
which God freely workes
in vs, and for which (ſay
they) he doth accept of vs.
Now what is this, but to
ouerturne grace, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
Iuſtification, and to
make vs our owne ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours?
When for certaine
graces of our own, and our
owne inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
God doth accept of
vs. From whence we may
boldly conclude: that the
doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> doth ouerthrow the
foundation, it peruerts the
nature of grace, and takes
away the truth of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14956:21"/>
For Iuſtification
rightly conſidered, implies
two things: Firſt, an vtter
emptineſſe and want in
vs: Secondly, an abſolute
fulneſſe and ſufficiencie in
Chriſt. I would know
how this can be, if any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or worth be in vs; if we
merit, there is ſomething
in vs; if ſomething in vs,
then not an vtter empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
neither is there an all-ſufficiencie
in Chriſt: thus
they take away Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they make Chriſt no
abſolute Sauiour, and ſo
no perfect Chriſt, and ſo
no Chriſt at all. Let vs
therefore abominate the
doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that ſatanicall Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue;
let vs hold it to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14956:22"/>
bee Antichriſtian, againſt
Chriſt, and their doctrine
to be againſt the truth of
grace, and (to ſay truth) a
graceleſſe doctrine. To put
it out of all queſtion that
grace is the free gift of
God, Saint <hi>Faul</hi> telleth vs,
<hi>2 Tim. 1. 9.</hi> that it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto vs before the
world was. True, ſay the
Papiſts: But how? tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Gods foreſeeing our
workes. But this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
confutes in the ſame
verſe, telling vs, <hi>that it is
not according to our workes,
but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and grace.</hi> Againe, in
<hi>Eph. 1. 5, 6.</hi> He telleth vs,

if it came not

appeare in its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
it will ere long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
its rottenneſſe, it will
vaniſh, periſh, and come to
nothing.</p>
               <p>Some there be in whom
the corruption of Nature
is ſo reſtrained, that they
are of a very ingenious
temper and diſpoſition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable,
courteous, gentle,
peaceable, not giuen vp,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14956:37"/>
nor inclined vnto any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant

in themſelues a freedome
from thoſe foule ſinnes
which others are defiled
withall, doe by and by
bleſſe themſelues in their

may be, they are taken of
others (like or worſe than
themſelues) to be maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
good people, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

whoſe grace is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

vertue or ſtrength of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

but as droſſe and dung, as
<hi>Phil. 2. 8.</hi> Gods worſhip
and the performance of

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14956:39"/>
very forme, wanting zeale
and all ſpirituall vigour, or
life in the performance of
them; and will you ſay that
the bare, naked, and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
performing of good

thou mayeſt be a Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

doing good duties, becauſe
thou haſt alwayes done
them, and not through the
power and ſtrength of true

or inabling thee vnto the
performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them. True
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14956:39"/>
and ſauing grace comes not
from nature &amp; good bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but from ſpirituall
regeneration; from vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and communion with
Chriſt, who is the Head
which giues ſpirituall life
and motion vnto all his
members. Euery gracious
perſon is knit vnto Chriſt
by ioynts and bands, as
<hi>Col. 2. 19.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> Theſe ligatures
are the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
by which euery good
heart being conglutinate
and graffed into Chriſt,
drawes daily from him
ſuch ſpirituall ſtrength, as
inables him to the practice
of good duties. So that if
grace be truly wrought in
thee, thou liueſt in Chriſt,
as a ſiene in the ſtocke, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14956:40"/>
Chriſt liues in thee, as the
root liues in the branches:
Then the minde and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Chriſt will be in
thee, thou wilt doe good
duties not of forme, but in
faith, in loue, yea with a
kinde of holy neceſſitie, as
if it were thy nouriſhment,
thy meat and thy drinke,

ſome other of the family,
or to be well eſteemed of

               <p>And there be others that

is moſt ſweet
and comfortable vnto his
ſoule; and yet this hee
knowes is but a glimpſe of
that comfort he ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14956:43"/>
of, at the appearing of
the Lord Ieſus: Therefore
he longeth for that day,
knowing that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt
his life ſhall appeare, then
ſhall he alſo appeare with
him in glory,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Coloſſ. 3. 4.</hi>
Now take an hypocrite,
and temporary profeſſour
at the beſt, and it wil ſoone
appeare that hee growes
none of theſe wayes. Firſt,
hee growes not into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaiutance
with his owne
heart, for that doeth euery
day more &amp; more deceiue
him. Secondly, he growes
not into a hatred of his
old wayes, for hee is ſtill
the ſame he was, as rotten
at the core as euer he was,
and as well pleaſed now
with his luſts as before;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14956:44"/>
though haply for ſome
by-reſpect he may ſeeme
to forbeare them, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or ſuppreſſe the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſme</hi>
&amp; return of them.
Thirdly, as for louing the
appearing of the LORD
CHRIST, he doth it not,
he cannot doe it heartily,
whatſoeuer outwardly hee
may make ſhew of; for he
cannot be ignorant of that
which Chriſt hath ſaid of
hypocrites, which ſay, but
doe not, or doe all their
workes to be ſeene of men,
and take Gods Couenant
into their mouths, but hate
to be reformed, that none
of theſe ſhall eſcape the
damnation that is to
come.<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 33.</note> The conſideration
of which things, workes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14956:44"/>
in them a dread of the
dreadfull and terrible day
of the Lords comming,
wiſhing it might neuer be,
or euer be deferred.</p>
               <p>A third difference, is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the failings and falling of
thoſe that bee endowed
with true grace, and thoſe
that are hypocrites. For
we may not ſay, that grace
is perfect in the beſt of
Gods children, becauſe in
this life, ſo long as wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in this earthly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
wee muſt looke for
no perfection: in many
things we ſin all; nay, the
childe of God may haue
many relapſes into the
ſame ſinne, though he haue
a ſound heart, and labour
to walk vprightly towards
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14956:45"/>
God and men: yet there is
a great deale of difference
betwixt his relapſes, and
the falls of thoſe whoſe
hearts are not ſound.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, a gracious
heart alloweth not of the
committing of any ſinne,
<hi>Rom. 7. 15. I allow not that
which I doe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 15.</note> If he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
and ouertaken with
any euill, he approues not
of it, his heart is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
or affected with
the doing of it. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
had numbred the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Text ſayes that <hi>his
heart ſmote him, 2 Sam. 24.
10.</hi> Which ſhewes, that
though hee were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
yet hee did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the euill hee had
done. Whereas an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14956:45"/>
howſoeuer hee may
ſeeme outwardly to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
with himſelfe, or to be
angry with his ſinne, yet al
is well betwixt his heart &amp;
his ſin, as the Ferry-man
in the Boat, he lookes one
way, though moues ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He wants that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>Grace,</hi> which alone
oppoſeth ſinne, and makes
not only the iudgement to
miſlike it, but checkes the
conſcience, and grieues the
heart for it; whereas a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
hart wanting this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
may haply reſolue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſinne, and promiſe
better things: as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would
let the people of Iſrael go,
but preſently returnes to
his old hardneſſe and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:14956:46"/>
Secondly, a gracious
heart is bettred by his fals.
He grows more and more
(as was ſaid euen now) into
acquaintance with his own
heart: he ſees his own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
he is more fearefull of
falling, as the old ſaying is,
<hi>The burnt childe dreads the
fire.</hi> He is more carefull of
his wayes, and watchfull
ouer himſelfe, as one that
is climbing vp into a tree,
if one foot hath ſlipt, or the
bough broke on which
hee ſtood, how doth hee
tremble? how carefull is
he of ſure footing, leſt hee
fall? So the childe of God
being by occaſion fallen
into any fault, takes heed
vnto his ſteps, &amp;c. gathers
his wits together, to keepe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14956:46"/>
himſelfe vpright from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
againe; vvhereas the
hypocrite is no whit at all
bettered by any ſin, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
he may be terrified,
there may be ſome pauſe,
ſome forbearance, but no
bettering: ſome ſay, a leg
once broken, and vvell ſet
againe, is ſtronger than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
it is true in grace, for
this growes more ſtrong
after a fall than before. As
appeares by <hi>Peter,</hi> vvho
though at firſt he vvas ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the breath of a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
yet like a Cedar in
<hi>Lebanon</hi> grew ſo ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that death it ſelfe could
not ſhake, or ouerturne
him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the falls of the
righteous driue them clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14956:47"/>
vnto God by prayer
and godly ſorrow. How
vvas <hi>Dauids</hi> heart broken
after his fall? What heart-broken
petitions did he put
vp vnto the Lord, to vvaſh
him thorowly from his
iniquitie, &amp; to cleanſe him
from his ſin, to create in
him a cleane heart, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
vnto him the ioy of
his ſaluation, and to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
him vvith his free
Spirit? Whereas a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
heart is either ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
of his danger, and
GODS diſpleaſure, and
therefore ſeeks not to God
by prayer, that ſo he may
make his peace againe with
God; or elſe if he be griped
or ſtung a little, he ſeekes
to allay his griefe by Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14956:47"/>
as <hi>Saul</hi> did, or with
merry company or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes,
to put it from him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the falls of the
godly make them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of themſelues, and
cry-out vpon their ſinne, as
<hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Dauid, Pſal.
51. 3, 5.</hi> whereas a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
heart is ready to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
his ſin; would none
did worſe than this; I hope
this is not ſuch an hainous
matter: or elſe excuſes
himſelfe, and ready to lay
it vpon others. But the
childe of God, with a kind
of indignation aggrauates
his ſinne, abhorres it vvith
a deteſtation, intreats the
Lord for mercy in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of that is paſt, and for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14956:48"/>
aid to helpe him in time to
come.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, a gracious
heart by his falls hath his
heart knit more ſtrongly
vnto the Lord. O how
much doth he thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
bound vnto God, for
ſparing and not confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him? What ſhall he
render vnto the Lord, for
bringing his ſoule out of
the ſnares of the Deuill,
and deliuering him from
the danger into vvhich ſin
had plunged him? He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that it vvas Gods
mercy that he vvas not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.
And becauſe God
hath ſpared him, his ſoule
is knit more ſtrongly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, than euer
before. I haue read (how
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14956:48"/>
true it is I know not) of a
great kindneſſe that a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did ſhew vnto a man,
who had formerly pulled a
thorne out of his foot; and
will not grace teach a man
(thinke you) to loue the
Lord for doing greater
things for him? Nature
teacheth a man, to loue
thoſe that preſerue our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
liues, or reſcued vs in
extreme danger; and ſhall
not grace doe this much
more? So that you ſee a
wonderful great difference
betwixt the falls of thoſe
that partake of grace, and
ſuch as want it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
ſometimes a ſtrong
corruption &amp; a violent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
may ſhoulder out or
keepe downe the worke
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14956:49"/>
of grace in Gods children,
yet he is not pleaſed with
this condition of his; for
theſe relapſes and preuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of his, doe coſt him
hot water and the ſetting
on, he hath many a gripe
and ſting, many a heart-breaking
groane by them:
vvhereas thoſe that yeeld
any voluntary ſubiection
to their luſts, and giue their
euill affections the reines;
though ſomtime they may
feele and expreſſe ſome
gripes and horrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
yet by that vvhich
hath beene ſpoken, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that they are far from
any euidence of true grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth and laſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
'twixt ſound and
counterfeit Grace, lyes in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14956:49"/>
perſeuerance. Counterfeit
grace is but temporary, it
lookes freſh, and ſeemes to
flouriſh for a ſeaſon, but
euery little froſt of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
or blaſt of trouble,
nippes it in the head, and
makes it giue in. If he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
that hee is like to
miſſe of his hopes, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
or ſome rubs vvill be
in his vvay, or that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
bring trouble or
perſecution; then he giues
in, he thinks it is good ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in a vvhole skin, and
therefore falls off, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
profeſſion hee hath
formerly made: And that
becauſe hee wants a ſound
bottome, hee is not built
vpon the Rock Chriſt: his
principles were from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14956:50"/>
education, or the
world; and not from vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and communion vvith
Chriſt; his holy profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was taken vp vpon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and fleſhly termes; not
out of loue to pietie, but
out of ſelfe-loue and by-reſpects,
vvhich vvhenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they faile, his pietie
quailes; if they faile or fall,
they beare downe his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
vvith them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
ſound grace in an honeſt
and good heart, being built
vpon a ſure rock, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
whereof is laid in
Chriſt, holds it out in all
ſtormes, he is no reed ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the wind, no vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
vveather-cock, no
time-ſeruer; he knowes in
vvhom he hath beleeued,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14956:50"/>
and therefore abides the
heat of Summer, the rage
and violence of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he endures the froſt in
Winter, all thoſe croſſes
and loſſes vvhich befall
him, ſtill runneth with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
that race vvhich is
ſet before him,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb. 12. 1.</hi>
So that it is with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and counterfeit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
as with many rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
&amp; worme-eaten peares
and plummes in a garden:
looke vpon them, vvalke
by them, and none ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to the eye, none ſo
louely to behold as they,
but lay hands vpon them,
or ſhake the tree on which
they grow, and down they
tumble preſently; whereas
that fruit vvhich is ſound,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14956:51"/>
though it make not ſo faire
a ſhew, hangs ſtill for all
your ſhaking. Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in this are like the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars
of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the wind blowes them,
the deeper root they take,
the ſurer they ſtand.</p>
               <p>Now in a few vvords
to apply that vvhich hath
beene formerly deliuered
concerning this point of
difference, let that vvhich
hath beene ſpoken, bee a
meanes of ſending vs eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one into the Cloſet of
his owne heart; let vs ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſearch and try our
ſelues, that vve be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
about the truth of
grace. It is a thing of the
greateſt conſequence that
can be, I meane, the triall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14956:51"/>
of the truth and ſoundneſſe
of grace in vs; for if we be
deceiued in this one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
vvee are vndone for
euer. A man may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in outward things,
bee deceiued in vvorldly
bargaines, and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
a happy man: hee
may haue his ſoule, though
he loſe his ſubſtance: but
if he be gulled in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of grace, he is irrecoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
miſerable. Doth it
not then ſtand vs vpon, (as
I ſaid before) to conſider
whether vvee be deceiued
or not?</p>
               <p>If there were plenty of
waſht gold ſtirring, or
great ſtore of bad &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
ſiluer abroad, euery
one would looke vvhat he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14956:52"/>
takes, for feare he ſhould
be deceiued. O my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

dayes wherein many make
faire ſhewes, godlineſſe is

almoſt euery body would
be accounted religious, but
as for the power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the truth of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
(God knowes) it is
found in very few: All is
not gold that gliſters, all
haue not grace that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and do alſo take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to be gracious: A
man may goe farre in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
appearance, and yet
goe to hell in the end, for
want of ſauing grace. As
for example.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a man may be free

from groſſe ſinnes, from

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a man may
be ſtrict in the duties of
the ſecond Table, iuſt of
his word, true in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as many ciuill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

                  <hi>the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law, Rom. 2.
14. Cato</hi> and many other
Heathens were admirable
in reſpect of Morality.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man may ſet
vp Gods ſeruice in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and giue himſelfe to
faſting and prayer, as the
Iewes did, <hi>Eſay 58. 2, 3.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, a man may

and yet <hi>returne with the

                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> and for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14956:53"/>
want of ſound and ſauing
grace bee damned in the
end. Now ſeeing it may be
thus, tell mee in good ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
if thou doſt not think
it to be a matter of great

trie thine owne heart?</p>
               <p>How many thouſands
be there which come ſhort
of theſe things before-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
and yet take vp their
reſt, flatter themſelues, and
ſpeake peace to their owne
ſoules, reſoluing to be no
other, deſirous to bee no
better, and therefore neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this duty of triall and
examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of themſelues.
But aſſuredly a time vvill
come, vvhen the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of theſe people (which
are now caſt into a deepe,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14956:54"/>
if not a deadly ſleepe) will
be awakened; when death,
iudgement, and hell will
preſent themſelues vnto
their view; when their ſins
like toads will croake ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
againſt them, when
<hi>Ezekiels</hi> book will be laid

is written within &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,<note place="margin">Ez. 2. 10.</note>
                  <hi>lamentations, and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

howling? what roaring?
what wringing of hands,
and breaking of hearts? to
conſider that old and new

and they not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14956:54"/>
Then (when it will

               <p>Tell me then (my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued)
in coole bloud, if it
be not a point of high wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to looke to this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
not to truſt our

weightie matter, ſeeing
our hearts are aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
deceitful, and as thoſe
lying ſpirits in the mouths
of <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe prophets,
wil flatter vs, bid vs go on,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14956:55"/>
and proſper, when we run
to our owne deſtruction. I
beſeech you therefore (my
beloued brethren) by the
tender mercies of God,
and in the bowels of the
Lord Ieſus, I entreat you
to looke to your ſelues in
this one particular ſearch,
and trie your owne hearts,
how things ſtand betwixt

neuer minding to make

vntil the Bayliffe hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them vnder arreſt, if

Slight not ouer theſe
things, leſt hereafter, when
it will bee too late, you
finde and feele that to be

true, which now you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Conſider (I ſay) with your

not be amiſſe, to let you
know, that the worke and
truth of grace wrought in
the heart of Gods childe,
hath in Scripture ſundrie
appellations, though all
ſignifying one and the

is called <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Gal. 5.

                  <hi>and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

it is called <hi>A new creature,

2 Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in

places tend to this purpoſe,
to let vs know, that we are
then ſpirituall, renued, or
borne againe, effectually
called and ſanctified, when
the work of grace is truly
wrought in vs: Which
work ſooner or later, more
or leſſe is wrought in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14956:57"/>
one of GODS elect;
whereby he becomes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the former fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
of his fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and ſanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
for as ſinne, like an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemicall
euill, diffuſed it
ſelfe into al parts of a man;
as Wine or Beere put into
a muſtie cask, is all equally
tainted; ſo grace, if it enter
into any, it ſanctifies him
throughout; it puts a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life, not into one
or two parts, but into the
whole man, renewing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part and faculty of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and ſoule: For grace
comes into the ſoule, as the
ſoule comes into the body,
not infuſed by degrees,
though it be a maxime in
Philoſophy, that the heart
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14956:57"/>
firſt liues: which is not ſo
to be vnderſtood, as if life
were ſome while there,
when it is wanting to all
other parts of the body,
but becauſe the heart is the
ſeat (as it were) of life, and
firſt of all moues, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
life aboue any other
parts of the body. So grace
is wrought at once, though
it growes by degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt weak, as is a babe,
before wee bee ſtrong
men in Chriſt. Know alſo,
that though grace once
wrought, bee infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole man, yet it
ſhewes it ſelfe not alike in
all faculties at all times,
becauſe of the contrary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of corruption, which is
ſtronger in ſome part and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14956:58"/>
faculty of the body and
ſoule, than in other ſome;
yet if the life of grace be
inſpired, it ſhewes it ſelfe
more or leſſe in the whole
man. This much I thought
fit to premiſe, to let you
vnderſtand, that if the truth
of grace appeare in any
one thing, though not in
another, or but weakely,
you may aſſure your ſelues
that you are truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and ſo members of
the Lord Ieſus by ſpiritual

Such as profeſſe they

as doth caſt a man

vents it ſelfe for the

                  <hi>Prou. 10. 21.</hi> Hee

the lips are oft dropping of

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly and laſtly, if
thy knowledge be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
it is a growing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
The more thou

deſireſt to adde to that

                  <hi>As a new

that thou mayeſt grow in it,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14956:65"/>
1 Pet. 2. 2.</hi> This growth I
beleeue is not meant of the
letter only and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but eſpecially of the
feeling and power of the
Word, euery day finding
more comfort, and taſting
more ſweetneſſe in the

as <hi>Ier. 15. 16. is the ioy and
reioycing of thine heart:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 15. 16.</note> It

if thy knowledge be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
it groweth in thee,
and thou groweſt into it.
And this growth ariſeth
from two properties in a
gracious heart. Firſt, hee
receiueth the Word in <hi>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:14956:66"/>
in the generall, and then
he applyeth it to himſelfe
in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a gracious heart
puts his hand and ſeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euery diuine truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
and embracing all
thoſe truths he meets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
whether they be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
promiſes, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his

the Word, as did
thoſe Noble <hi>Bereans with
all readineſſe, Act. 17. 11.</hi>
This ſhews the ſoundneſſe
of his ſpirituall conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the goodneſſe of
his heart; for as it is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14956:66"/>
a ſound conſtitution
feeds heartily vpon any
good creature prouided
for him, refuſeth nothing
that is mans meat, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and good; whereas a
bad ſtomacke will pingle,
and picke here a bit and

but thoſe that are daintily

euen ſo it fareth with

no more relliſh in it, than
in the white of an egge.</p>
               <p>Again, a gracious heart
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14956:67"/>
makes a particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word, as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

this then may ſpeake hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily,

graceleſſe, and it is grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,

other graces, hope, loue,
&amp;c. If faith be weak, hope
and loue cannot be ſtrong;
little faith, little hope, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
loue; no faith, no hope,
no loue at all. So that faith
muſt needs be a ſound eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of grace; for vntill
ſuch time as the heart bee
purified, and waſhed in the

either Atheiſticall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue

or elſe it is Sophiſticall to

if the heart be once ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

the heart being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely

bee no loſt labour to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the truth of our faith.
For you muſt know that it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14956:77"/>
is poſſible for a wicked

beleeue that Chriſt died
for him; yea to die in a

(if you will beleeue them)
as many vile wretches and
graceleſſe perſons? They
wonder what people mean
to doubt of Gods loue, for
their part they neuer, as
yet, called it into queſtion.
They thanke God they
haue euer had as ſtrong a

               <p>There lyes a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <p>The firſt difference is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the ground,<note place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce 'twixt Faith and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> out of which

True faith is wrought in
all Gods children by the
miniſtery of the Word, as
<hi>Rom. 10. 17.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> Firſt, the Law
conuincing vs, diſcouering
vnto vs our ſins, <hi>Rom. 7. 7.</hi>
ſhewing vs both the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

and our miſery into which
ſinne hath plunged vs; and
not onely ſo, but an vtter
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14956:79"/>
impoſſibility of our ſelues,
either to ſatisfie the iuſtice
of God for the leaſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
or to bee freed
from that wrath &amp; venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
which hangs ouer our
head, by reaſon of our ſins.
The conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
terrifying and afflicting
a poore ſinner, makes him

<hi>Act. 2. 37.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>What ſhall I doe?</hi>
Then commeth in the
Goſpell, the Word of
comfort, and the meſſage
of reconciliation, which
diſcouers and preſcribes a
remedie, whereby a poore
ſinner may be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fauour with God, and
accepted with him; come
out of the ſnares of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and be freed from the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14956:79"/>
curſe and malediction of
the Law; and that is, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of the Lord Chriſt,
in whom <hi>all the promiſes of
God are yea and Amen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20</note>
                  <hi>And by whom wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption

                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 7.</note>

begins to hunger and thirſt
after Chriſt, ſeeing, and
knowing no other way, no
other meanes whereby he
may be ſaued, or haue his
ſpirituall wants ſupplied.
As the prodigall ſaw no
meanes of comfort, but
ſtarue he muſt, vnleſſe hee
get home againe, and bee
receiued into his fathers
family; ſo the poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
knowes his ſoule will
famiſh, if he get not into
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14956:80"/>
Chriſt; and therefore hee
labours to bee made one
with Chriſt; his ſoule hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and thirſts after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much as Chriſt: all
the world is dung vnto
him in compariſon of
Chriſt. Oh that he may be
found in Chriſt: to liue or
die, Chriſt is all in all vnto
him; hee layes hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his righteouſneſſe, and
ſhrowds himſelfe for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
vnder his wings: and
as <hi>Ioab</hi> laid hold vpon the

<hi>I will die heere, 1 King. 2.
30.</hi> So the poore beleeuer
layes hold vpon the Lord
Chriſt, reſteth onely vpon
Chriſt, and if he periſh, he
will periſh at the feet of
Chriſt; whereas the faith
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14956:80"/>
of vnbeleeuers and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
ariſeth either out of
their education, common
illumination, or from ſome

good in themſelues, for
which they are perſwaded
God loues them, or elſe
hee would neuer haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſo much vpon
them, haue done theſe or
theſe things for them. So
that their faith is no other
than a faithleſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence,
a vaine preſumption, or
ſome Satanicall illuſion,
neuer wrought in them by
the Lord Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2</note> 
                  <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

was but for a while, a little
Sermon-ſicke, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
wambling, while
the Word was deliuered
vnto them, and no longer;
If this mans faith had bin
begun, or hee begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of the Word of God;
as a new borne babe hee
would more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it, <hi>that hee might grow

but he finds no ſweetneſſe,
takes no true content in the
Word, any further than he
is ſenſible of ſome art or
ſome noueltie in the ſame,
which doth affect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

(thou that boaſteſt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeſt
ſo much of thy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14956:81"/>
faith) how thou diddeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto it, when it was
firſt wrought in thee;
which if thou canſt not,
thou haſt iuſt cauſe to fear,
thy faith is but thy fancie.</p>
               <p>Heere a queſtion will
fall in very fit to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that is, whether
euery one that beleeueth
can tell when or how faith
was wrought in him?</p>
               <p>This ſcruple and ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the truth of their faith,
becauſe they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
lay downe the time

faith was wrought in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For their education and
bringing vp was alwayes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14956:82"/>
godly and religious; from
their child-hood they haue
entertained the Word of
God; they haue alwayes
borne a good will to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
and loued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours
of the truth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
approued of the beſt

the truth of faith and

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of ſuch, let me firſt of
all tel them, that if all were
not well, twenty to one the
Deuil would not be ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
with them, to perplex
&amp; trouble them with theſe
pious feares &amp; holy doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
We ſeldome heare

theſe troubles, or that put

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14956:82"/>
But for the ſatisfying of
thy ſcruple; conſider firſt
what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 8.</note>
                  <hi>Ioh. 3. 8. The wind

Therefore though thou

               <p>A ſecond difference lies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in the fruits and effects of

Confidence of Gods loue
emboldens him to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and makes him to ſin

in him. Certainly, if euer
the Lord ſpeake peace to
thy ſoule through Chriſt,
hee will ſo inflame thine
heart with the loue of his
truth, his Image, his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
that theſe will ſo

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, faith

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 27.</note> It is

Whereas the hypocrites
faith doth embolden him
vnto liberty, it makes him
looſe and licentious, laying
all vpon Chriſt back, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Chriſt dyed for vs, his

Let the Miniſters of Chriſt
ſay what they can, threaten
what they wil, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued

are infallible eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences

Why then, cheere vp
thy drooping ſpirits; the

grace hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14956:90"/>
thee: for nothing but grace
is able to keepe the loue of
ſin out of the heart, though
peraduenture (as was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the beginning)
ſome other thing may for
a while keepe it out of thy
hand: Ciuility and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
may a little ſnib ſin,
or bid it for a while to
ſtand aſide and giue way
to better things, but it is
only grace that ſtrikes this
<hi>Goliah dead,</hi> and takes <hi>off his
head.</hi> It is only grace which
cures a ſoule-ſick ſinner of
thoſe diſeaſes, which by
ſinne hee hath contracted
vnto himſelfe; as only <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
aboue al other waters,
could heale <hi>Naaman of his
leproſie.</hi> Now leſt any one
ſhould bring himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14956:90"/>
a fooles paradiſe, and
pleaſe himſelfe with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of his owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
becauſe of the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſome ſinne, or the
laying downe of ſome baſe
carriage, which formerly
hee had taken vp: let him
know that there is a maine
difference between the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
of ſin, in &amp; through
the ſtrength of grace, and
any other by-reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Corruption is kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in a gracious heart,
meerely in loue to God,
and hatred of ſinne, as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi>
ſpeakes of thoſe that

                  <hi>They ſhall feare the

3.</hi> 5. Though naturally
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14956:91"/>
thou mayeſt loue this or
that ſinne more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
yet grace will helpe
thee to abhor and loath it:
a better euidence of grace
cannot be, then when the
heart is ſet againſt its old
loue; for it muſt needs be a
ſupernaturall power, and
the worke of grace, which
moues any to diſlike and
loath that euill which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
he loues. Whereas
in the hypocrite ſinne is
ſomtime forſaken, becauſe
ſinne hath left him, he hath
no meanes of committing
it; or elſe he forbeares ſin,
as many a fearful dog doth
meat in the platter, becauſe
of the whippe or cudgell
that is held ouer him: So
the hypocrite loues his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14956:91"/>
credit, loues his purſe, loues
his skin, it may may bee;
and therfore, leſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of ſome ſin, which
hee lingers after, ſhould
make a flaw, or a hole or
rent in him, hee forbeares
the committing of it. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
thy heart therefore
in this particular, what
mooues thee to forbeare
thy ſin? what is the ground
of that diuorce vvhich
ſeemes to be betwixt thee
and thine old louer? If any
thing in the world but
grace, thou art in a bad
condition, whatſoeuer is
become of thy ſinne.</p>
               <p>Art thou one whoſe
heart likes well of ſinne,
though thou canſt not, or
dareſt not commit it? Art
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14956:92"/>
thou one, who when thou
art conuinced of, or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for any failings, thy
heart riſeth againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
though for thy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
or profit ſake thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
to welcome, &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to entertaine that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe?
I tel thee, thou art
in a dangerous condition:
thou haſt but weake and
ſlender euidence of grace,
if any at all. For where
true grace is, there (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer,
(as was ſaid before)
for a time in a paſſion or
tentation, corruption may
preuaile) will be a welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the meanes, and
helpes that may keepe vs
from falling into ſin, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

the Lord and <hi>Abigail,</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:14956:92"/>

the heart will bleed, &amp; the
tongue will freely againſt
it ſelfe acknowledge the
fouleneſſe of thoſe ſins he
hath committed.</p>
               <p>Know moreouer, that
the nature of grace is to
ſtrike at all ſinne, great and
ſmall, whether more or
leſſe profitable &amp; pleaſing,
as <hi>Pſal. 119. 104.</hi>

                  <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hate all the wayes of
falſhood.</hi> A gracious heart
is ſet for the glory of God
in all things, in all places,
at all times: he labours to
ſhun all things diſpleaſing
to God, or grieuous to his
Spirit, makes conſcience
not only of open, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
ſinnes, not onely of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14956:93"/>
groſſe and foule, but of
the leaſt euils, not onely

and periury, foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthed
ſins, but of thoſe
that ſeeme more faire, as
faith and troth, &amp;c. So that
as ſome Phyſicians haue
their <hi>Catholicon</hi> for the
purging out of euery pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
humour: ſo grace is a
Catholike expeller &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of all knowne ſinnes,
whereas hypocrites and
double-minded men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
ſinne but in part, and
that very partially too; not
out of any hatred they
beare to ſinne, but becauſe
of ſome euill conſequent
which waits vpon ſin. He
keepes one ſinne or other
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14956:93"/>
cloſe, one hole in his heart
for ſome baſe luſt or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one <hi>Dalila</hi> or darling
ſinne he hath, from which
he will not be diuorced, as
if God and men muſt giue
him leaue in ſome thing to
take his libertie; hee hath
one ſin which al the world
ſhall not bring him out of
loue withall, much leſſe to
leaue, and to forſake it. But
let al ſuch know, that God
will none of their patcht
holineſſe and piece-meale
reformation; as good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a whit, as neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
All ſuch will one day

<hi>He that ſaith, I know him, &amp;
keepeth not his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is a lyer, and the truth

Grace teacheth a man to
reduce his knowledge into
practice: for by the power
and ſtrength of grace the
will of man is made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obey God in all
things, ſo that it wil be our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14956:95"/>
meat and drinke to doe the
will of our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Here ſome will be
ready to cry out, and ſay,
that by this doctrine wee
deſtroy the liberty of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
will, and turne it into a
meere neceſſity. But they
ſpeak they know not what.
For when we affirme that
by the power of grace
mans wil becomes willing
to obey, this is not to take
away or deſtroy, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to rectifie the liberty
of our will, which conſiſts
not in an vnſtable change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
to bend euery
way, but in a ſettled and
firme reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in al things
to doe that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
When the will
by the power of grace
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14956:96"/>
doth pitch vpon Gods wil,
adheres vnto it with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
not to ſwarue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

No, no: this deſire and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Dauid</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the truth of
grace infuſed into his hart;
after which infuſion, the
will inclines it ſelfe moſt
willingly and cheerefully,
to obey the will of God.
Doe wee not pray daily,
<hi>Thy will be done on earth as
it is in heauen?</hi> Thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
ſpirits obey willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
cheerefully, conſtantly,
hauing neither will nor
power to diſobey. How
ſo? are their wills mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
and fettered? or is it
a wrong vnto them, that
they can doe no other?
Surely no, for the power
and ſtrength of grace in
them, will giue them no
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14956:97"/>
leaue to doe otherwiſe.
This obeying and ſeruing
God, is perfect liberty and
freedome; and it is the
LORD, by the worke of
grace in our hearts,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 36.</note> which
muſt make vs thus free.
Now becauſe an hypocrite
wanting grace, may goe
far in outward obedience,
it will be very requiſite to
lay downe ſome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
betwixt that obedience
which is performed by the
powerfull worke of grace,
and that which is done vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
outward &amp; by-reſpects:
For you muſt know that
an hypocrite may goe far
in outward obedience. Did
not <hi>Cain</hi> offer ſacrifice as
well as <hi>Abel?</hi> Did not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
humble himſelfe at the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14956:97"/>
hearing of threatnings, as
well as <hi>Hezekiah?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King 21. 27.</note> in ſome

<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for he rent
his cloaths, he faſted, and
lay in ſack-cloth, which
acts of humiliation are not
reported of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Did
not <hi>Iehu</hi> beſtir himſelfe in
fulfilling the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

ſell their poſſeſſions,
and lay them downe at the
Apoſtles feet, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 1, 2.
And many other inſtances
there may be brought, to
proue how far hypocrites
may wade in outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
therefore outward
obedience and conformity
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14956:98"/>
is no infallible euidence of
true grace. Wherein then
lyeth the difference? In
theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, true grace aymes
at the whole will of God,
it teacheth a man to walke
in all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

counterfeit grace picks and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14956:98"/>
culls out heere and there,
ſuch precepts as ſtand with

that wilfully and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
breakes any one of

ſaid to keepe any of them,
becauſe he keeps them not

labors to obey at all times,

Hee will not for

in the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

often, &amp; hinders the work
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14956:100"/>
of grace: not that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is of it ſelfe ſtronger
than grace, if God will put
to his ſtrength: for this
were to make God weaker
than man, and the fleſh
ſtronger than the ſpirit; but
becauſe if God at any time
leaue vs to our ſelues, or
neuer ſo little withdrawes
the power of his Spirit, we
are more inclined to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ſinfull motions of
our corrupt fleſh, than the
holy and gracious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Spirit of God:
For if <hi>Adam</hi> in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
when he knew no
euill, being left but a while

the efficacious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

eaſily drawne to ſin; much
more the corrupted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of ſinful parents, who
are but in part ſanctified,
and haue too much affinity

to diſobey God, if he help
vs not with his Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the motions of ſin,
and back vs againſt all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and prouocations
to diſobedience. For you
muſt know, that God is
not alwayes alike preſent
with his children, but in
great wiſdome withdraws
from them ſometimes that
effectuall preſence of his
grace, which at other times
he affords them, and that
for theſe and ſome other
cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, to ſhew vs
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14956:101"/>
our owne inſtability and

are of our ſelues to ſtand

he took the wheeles

downe wee fall preſently.
How quickly did <hi>Peter</hi> fal,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Lord doth
this, to humble and abaſe
vs, to cut our combes, and
to coole our courage, who
are ready to thinke too iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
of our ſelues, and to
lift vp our ſelues aboue our
brethren, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, who
tells Chriſt that he would
ſtick faſt vnto him, though
the reſt of the Apoſtles
ſhould flinch, and fall off
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14956:101"/>
from him; but they ſtand,
when he falls to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhame and deeper hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
this, to make vs the more
watchfull ouer our ſelues:
that we be not too bold or

and carnal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
ruſh vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and tentations vnto

would needs aduenture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the High Prieſts Hall,
in confidence of his owne
ſtrength, where (being left
vnto himſelfe) he fell moſt
ſhamefully and foully, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the Lord doth
this, to bring them cloſer
vnto him, by continuall &amp;
earneſt prayer for the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his grace, that he
would ſtand by them, that
he would not leaue them
nor forſake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The child
when it hath caught a fall,
through ſelfe-confidence,
or letting goe its hold of

                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:14956:103"/>
Thirdly, a gracious heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
obeyeth willingly and

his heart, with all his ſoule,

<hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 27. There may
be an vniuerſall obedience
(I meane in outward ſhew

not a hearty and cheerefull
obedience. A ſeruant may
goe thorow-ſtitch with his

So hypocrites may obey,
but it is no heartie and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14956:104"/>
cheerefull obedience, but a
halting and vnwilling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe;
if they could tell

2 <hi>Cor. 8. 12. If a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

the crowne vpon his owne

for his poſterity after him,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14956:105"/>
than the obeying of Gods

in the ſight of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 2.</note>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. Therefore to
conclude this point, as we
deſire any ſound euidence
to our owne hearts of true
grace, let our life be a life
of obedience; and that we
may not be loſers in the
end by all our obedience,
but gainers: looke (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you) that your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
bee rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
let it be an intire and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14956:106"/>
perfect obedience, make
conſcience of all good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and that at all times,
and in all places, beware of
diſpleaſing God, to pleaſe
man. Beware of culling out
here and there ſome good
duties to ſerue thy turne
withall: there muſt be no
parting of ſtakes betwixt
God and the Deuill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Chriſt &amp; the world.
A piece-meale obedience,
is in Gods eſteeme no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
no other than diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as appeares in <hi>Sauls</hi>
killing the Amalekites, and
ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and <hi>ſome of
the cattell.</hi> To reforme
ſome things, nay, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in many things, and
not in all, is no conformity
at all, but deformity. What
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14956:106"/>
auailes it a man to bee a
Saint abroad, and a deuill
at home? To frequent the
aſſembly of Saints, and
to faſhion himſelfe to the
world? To be ſtrict in the
duties of Religion, &amp; looſe
in the workes of morality,
&amp; outward righteouſneſſe?
Or to walke in a tracke of
ciuility, and to neglect, if
not abandon the way of
pietie? As if holineſſe and
righteouſneſſe were two
enemies, and could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and agree together!
Againe, that which thou
doſt, do with al thy might,
and (to make al good) laſt
of al caſt in the ſalt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
to ſeaſon al thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
doe nothing to bee

which makes al obedience

               <p>Therefore that thou

a kinde of obedience,<note place="margin">Motiues vnto ſound obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, know that vntil
thou findeſt thy heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
and thy wil framed
to this obedience, which
I haue formerly ſpoken
of, thou art no friend of
Chriſts;<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee are my friends</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt) <hi>if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
I command you.</hi> Many
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14956:107"/>
can bee content to receiue
good by Chriſt, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

few returne loue and duty
vnto Chriſt, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
him their Lord, in
keeping his Word, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his wil, &amp; doing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
hee commandeth
them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thou wanteſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
(as hath beene formerly
proued) ſound euidence of
thy regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for whom
God reneweth, he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
throughout; he fills
him with the ſeeds of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
ſo as his life is
fruitful in obedience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the richer thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
art in obedience, the more
bountiful wil the Lord be
in rewarding. He that gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14956:108"/>
fiue talents, had the
rule ouer fiue Cities: <hi>For
euery one ſhall receiue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his worke, Rom.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly and laſtly, this
wil procure (as you ſhal
heare by and by) outward
proſperity; it wil fetch in
a rich portion of outward
benefits and bleſſings, <hi>Eſay
1. 19. If yee be willing, and
obey, yee ſhall eat the good
things of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, to draw to a
concluſion of this point;
ſeeing you haue heard of
theſe euidences of true
grace: let me in the bowels
of the Lord Ieſus beſeech
you, my brethren, to goe
home to your own hearts,
make there a diligent ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
and narrow ſearch,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14956:108"/>
whether you finde theſe
euidences in your poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or not. Are the eyes
of your vnderſtanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
with ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
Is thy knowledge
rightly qualified? Is it
practicall, or is it meerely
theorical? Is it a transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
knowledge moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thee to the Word?
Is it ſuch a knowledge as
vents it ſelfe continually
for the glory of God, and
the good of others? Doſt
thou find thy heart, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,
knit vnto God
through Chriſt, louing
him, and fearing him for
his owne ſake, as well as
for his Chriſts ſake? Doſt
thou find the throat of thy
corruption cut in thee, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14956:109"/>
thy ſins bleeding to death,
and gaſping in thee? Is thy
heart ſet againſt euery euil
way, and thy ſoule deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the practice of that
which is good? Doth thy
heart ſtoope to GODS
Word, and thou yeeld vp
thy ſelfe to be at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and that willingly,
cheerefully, and in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of heart fearing God?
Then bleſſed be the time
that euer thou wert made
acquainted with theſe high
prerogatiues; God hath
done more for thee, than if
(wanting theſe) he had put
vpon thee all the honour,
pompe, and glory of the
world. But woe and alas,
how few are there in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
theſe euidences are to bee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14956:109"/>
found! Oh that ſuch as
want them, had but eyes to
ſee their miſery, and hearts
to conſider how full of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiueable
horror their
conſciences will one day
be, when they come to bee
awakend, &amp; perceiue how
they haue trifled away the
day of grace, turned the
grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
receiued the grace of
God in vaine, ſo as they
haue no part in the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
either of grace, or of
glory! Know and beleeue
(deare brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that things
will not alwayes ſtand at
this ſtay with you. A day
is comming, wherein yee
muſt lay down theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tabernacles of yours, &amp;
with them all your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14956:110"/>
profits and honours,
when none of all theſe will
ſtand you in any ſtead, or
afford you any comfort,
but will rather (wanting
grace to vſe them aright)
increaſe your griefe &amp; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
A day will come,
wherein (if theſe euidences
be not in thee) thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will not ſpare to tell
thee to thy face, that (wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
grace) thou art a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of wrath, ordained and
prepared for deſtruction.
Oh the troubles, ſorrowes
and feares, into which (in
that day) thy poore ſoule
will be plunged for want
of grace! Oh what woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou not then giue for
one dram of grace? How
happy wouldeſt thou take
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14956:110"/>
thy ſelf to be, if thou hadſt
but a little time to redeem,
wherein thou mighteſt
come to partake of the
meanes of grace, which
formerly thou haſt ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ouer, making no more
account of them than of
thine old ſhooes? Thou
wilt then ceaſe to wonder
at Gods faithful Miniſters
ſo inueighing againſt the
neglect of grace, and ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
preſſing and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the neceſſitie thereof.
Thou wilt then ſay, that a
little grace were more
worth than all the world
beſide, and that they are
only happy that doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of it. Whereas the
childe of God hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of Gods goodneſſe,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14956:111"/>
and made partaker of his
grace, is filled with vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable
ioy &amp; comfort,
finding himſelfe deliuered
from the power of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and tranſlated into
the Kingdome of Ieſus
Chriſt. His conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dead works
by the bloud of Chriſt, &amp;
his heart purified by faith,
he can looke death in the
face, take him by the hand,
and bid him welcome; he
can lye downe and reſt in
peace, and in full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(or if any doubtings
through Satans malice do
ariſe, in hope) of eternall
life through Ieſus Chriſt.
And this ſhall ſuffice to
haue ſpoken of the euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of true Grace. I now
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14956:111"/>
come (according to the
method and order which
in the beginning I propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
to lay downe ſome
grounds and reaſon, <hi>Why

partake of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt Reaſon.</note> becauſe it is the
onely thing which giues
content to the heart and
minde of a Chriſtian, in
euery eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatſoeuer God hath
placed him. Contentment
is the thing which euery
one aymes at, and deſires
in all his courſes. Why do
men toile and moile in the
world early and late, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
thicke and thin, but to
ſatisfie their minds in theſe
outward riches? Why do
people follow, and with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14956:112"/>
vnwearied and vnlimited
deſires and affections, hunt
after the honors and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of this world, but to
ſatisfie their deſires, and (as
they ſuppoſe) to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
content? But this is
a meere impoſture of our
wicked heart, falſly think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that our deſires are
ſatisfied with deſiring,
when as (the truth is) they
are increaſed. Why doe
men and women deck and
adorne (as they thinke,
whereas indeed they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme)
their bodies with
ſtrange attire, with coſtly
ornaments, but to giue
themſelues content, and to
pleaſe their mindes? For
if you aske them a reaſon
of their practice, they will
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14956:112"/>
tell you it is their pleaſure
ſo to doe. But they deceiue
themſelues, in looking for
content in worldly things,
or to be ſatisfied with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as appeares, <hi>Eſay 55. 2.
Wherefore doe you ſpend mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

                  <note place="margin">Eſay 55. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and labour for that
which ſatisfieth not?</hi> Is it
poſſible that vanity, and
vexation of ſpirit, ſhould
giue content to the heart
of man? All things vnder
the Sunne are no better, no
other than vanity, if wee
will beleeue the Preacher,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 14. Onely grace

the Lord ſees that riches

               <p>Thirdly, from the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of his prayer, which
God alwaies heares. Chriſt
prayed for all beleeuers,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. firſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 15</note> that <hi>the Lord

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14956:129"/>
they may be with him, and

And this prayer the Lord
Chriſt our Aduocate ſtill
continues, though not in a
vocall manner,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeing hee
euer liueth to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for vs, Heb.</hi> 7 25. Theſe
things conſidered, it is as
poſſible to plucke Chriſt
out of his kingdome, as to
rent the pooreſt beleeuer
from him, once made a
true and liuely member of
his myſticall body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee proue it
from the nature and office
of the Spirit, which is to
ſeale vp, and make ſure the
inheritance of Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.
All that partake of the
couenant of grace,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> are <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the holy Spirit of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14956:129"/>
promiſe, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. which
ſealing is not for a day, a
month, or a yeare, but for
euer,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>vnto the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Seale (all know)
is to make things ſure. The
decree of the Medes and
Perſians, that it might bee
irreuocable, was ſealed
with the Kings ſeale,<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Dan.
6.</hi> 8. Leſt the Diſciples
ſhould come by night and
ſteale Chriſt out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
wherein hee was
laid,<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>They went and made
the ſepulchre ſure, and ſealed
the ſtone, Matth.</hi> 27. 66.
When wee haue put our
ſeale to a writing, by the
law of Nations it is firme.
Shall the Seale of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man bee of that force,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14956:130"/>
that no law can alter it; and
ſhal the obſignation of the
holy Spirit be of leſſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and power? This were
to make God leſſe than
man.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is the earneſt
<hi>of our inheritance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>vntill the
redemption of the poſſeſsion
purchaſed vnto the praiſe of
his glory.</hi> Now the nature
of an earneſt (we know) is
to binde any contract or
bargain, and to giue a kind
of ſtate, and poſſeſſion of
the thing bargained for.
Gods Spirit is his earneſt
which he hath laid for his,
to aſſure the hearts of his
children, of their full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of that inheritance
which Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
&amp; God hath prepared
for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:14956:130"/>
Now if any ſhal obiect,
that we may either loſe or
forfeit our earneſt, and ſo
miſſe of the bargaine: you
muſt know that the Spirit
of God doth neuer finally
and wholly depart from
thoſe vnto whom it is once
giuen, as appeares <hi>Ioh. 14.
16,</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>But had not <hi>Dauid</hi> loſt
the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> when he
prayed ſo earneſtly vnto
the Lord, that hee would
<hi>reſtore</hi> vnto him the ioy of
his ſaluation,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 12.</note> and ſtabliſh
him with his free Spirit?</p>
               <p>This obiection may be
ſaid to anſwer it ſelfe.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
Could <hi>Dauid,</hi> without the
preſence and aſſiſtance of
the Spirit, haue beene thus
earneſt with the Lord in
prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:14956:131"/>
Again, a difference muſt
be put betwixt the preſence
of the Spirit, and the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or comfort of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
A hand benummed
with cold, or ſtunted with
ſome blow, may hold a
thing, and yet haue no fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it. It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that (therefore) Gods
Spirit hath vtterly forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a man, becauſe in his
apprehenſion and feeling
he takes it to be ſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in ſtead of perplexing
and troubling thy ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
needleſſe feares of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
and finall falling
from grace, labour to bee
furniſhed with ſound eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of true grace; and
then (my life for thine)
<hi>God, who hath begun a good
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14956:131"/>
worke in thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>will confirme it
vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt,
Phil.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>Here ſome weake belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
may reply,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and ſay; If
I had as good a heart as
many haue; or if I were
indowed with as much
grace as ſome be, I ſhould
then haue leſſe feare, and
more hope of holding out
vnto the end; but (alas) I
am a poore ſinful creature,
full of frailties, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
about with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
infirmities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
feare my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For thy comfort,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> thou
muſt know, that Gods
grace is ſufficient for thee,
and his power is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
through weakneſſe. It
is not the greatneſſe, but
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14956:132"/>
the truth of grace which
the Lord reſpects,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>A brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
reed ſhall he not breake,
and ſmoking flax ſhall he not
quench, vntill he bring forth
iudgement vnto victory.</hi> If
grace in thee be ſound and
true, though it be no more
than a graine of muſtard-ſeed,
it ſhall bee able to
bring thee vnto glory.</p>
               <p>It may be ſo,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> if I could
beleeue this, but I cannot
be fully perſwaded of this
thing.</p>
               <p>If thou beleeue not,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yet
<hi>abideth God faithfull, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny himſelfe,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſayes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>Let no man, from this
which hath beene ſpoken,
grow ſecure &amp; careleſſe, as
if he were out of all feare
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14956:132"/>
and danger of loſing his
comfort, or leſſening that
grace which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For though it be true,
that true grace cannot bee
vtterly loſt, yet through
pride, ſecuritie, earthly-mindedneſſe,
and the like,
the childe of God may fall
into ſuch languiſhing fits,
that the life of grace may
appeare to bee vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
in him.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe our bodies were
of that temper and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
that no poiſon or
infection could make a rent
betwixt the ſoule &amp; them;
were it not folly, nay were
it not madneſſe for any one
to cut &amp; wound himſelfe,
or through miſ-dieting of
himſelfe, and ſurfets, ſo to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14956:133"/>
impaire his ſtrength and
health, that his life ſhould
bee a continuall faintneſſe
and ſickneſſe. Euen ſo it is
with vs, in reſpect of grace,
the life of our ſoules, for
that ſoule which is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of grace, is dead whiles
liueth,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.</note> as appeares 1 <hi>Tim.
5.</hi> 6. What though grace
once ſeazing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſoule,
cannot be wholly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from it? yet may it
through our ſpirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
take ſuch a ſurfet,
as little ſtrength, or power
thereof may euer appeare
in vs. Therefore that no
man may bee ſettled vpon
the lees of ſecurity, or ſing
a <hi>requiem</hi> vnto his owne
ſoule, conſider daily what
ſtrength and life is in that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14956:133"/>
grace which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon thee; leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou beeſt aware of
it, grace be cooled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
in thee; which if it
be, will appeare by theſe
ſymptomes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is an inordinate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
appetite vnto ſuch things
as are noxious and hurtfull
vnto the ſoule.<note place="margin">Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of declining in grace.</note> For as our
bodily health is impaired
and weakened, by feeding
vpon ſuch things as are in
antipathie vnto our nature
and conſtitution; ſo it fares
with our ſoules, if wee bee
bold with ſinne the ſoules
bane, the ſtrength of grace
growes quickly feeble in
vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of our ſpirituall taſte;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14956:134"/>
when wee finde not the
ſweetneſſe and comfort in
the Word, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we haue done; when we
feed not vpon the Word
with that deſire and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
which once wee did,
this argues ſome diſtemper
in the ſoule. For as in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
meates, when they
grow vnſauoury to our
pallats, it is moſt euident
that our ſtomackes haue in
them ſome diſtemper; ſo
it is with our ſoules: if the
ſame Word haue not the
ſame relliſh with vs now,
which ſometime it had, we
may ſay there is ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
diſtemper.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when we brook
not, when wee digeſt not
the Word as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14956:134"/>
we haue done. Euill
concoction of onr meat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
a cold ſtomacke, or at
leaſt an abatement of the
natiue heat: ſo when people
digeſt not Gods Word,
the food of their ſoules, but
vomit it vp againe, either
by ſtorming againſt it, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
of it, or wilfully
neglecting the power and
practice of it, it is a ſigne of
declining in grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
there bee a cold, drowſie,
and formall performance
of the duties of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and ſeruice: when a
man is not ſo cheerefull
and liuely vnto, &amp; in good
duties, as of old, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
a decaying of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſtrength. As in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14956:135"/>
labour, when a man
beginnes to giue in, when
there is not that ſtrength
and power in his armes,
legs and back, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hath beene, wee ſee,
and ſay, nature is debillita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and weakened in ſuch a
man; euen ſo, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
not holy duties with
that zeale and ſpirituall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
(though it may bee
with leſſe ſtrength of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
the organes being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
through age or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
which formerly we
haue done, wee may feare
grace is in ſome decle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore, my
brethren, I beſeech you,
ſeriouſly of theſe things,
that ſo you may (by the
grace of God) be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

able to preuent decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or being fallen, may

yee are fallen,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 5.</note> and repent,
and doe your firſt worke.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you with the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
betwixt true and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit

downe the euidences of
true grace; and thirdly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſhewed the reaſons
why grace is of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
&amp; worth aboue all
the world: I now come to
the fourth and laſt thing
which I propounded, and
that is, to make ſome vſe &amp;
application of the point.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> as hath beene
proued, that grace is the
beſt thing wee can partake
of? Then lamentable is the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14956:136"/>
blindneſſe, and pitifull is
the ignorance of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of the world, who
neither ſee their want, nor
yet the worth of grace.
How many be there who
place all happineſſe in theſe
outward things, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
pleaſures, &amp;c? Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thoſe to be the onely
happy men, whoſe bellies
the Lord fills with earthly
treaſures. O, he is a happie
man (ſay they) he cannot
doe amiſſe, hee hath the
world at will. Theſe are
ſuch as liue by ſenſe, <hi>Whoſe

They encumber the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues

with the things of this life,
neglecting grace, the only
thing needfull, yea, that
which is of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
vnto ſaluation. Is it not
a thing much to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that in this glorious
noone-tide of the Goſpell,
people ſhould ſo dote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the world, as if there
were no other goodneſſe
vnder the Sunne, but to be
great, to be honourable, to
eat and drink, to take their
ſports, and follow their
pleaſures and profits? If
<hi>Paul</hi> in his daies could not
ſpeake, nor write it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
griefe and weeping, to
conſider how many went
a madding after the world,
minding earthly things;
ſurely if hee liued in theſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14956:137"/>
our times, his heart would
not ake, but breake, to ſee
how eager people are vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the world, how little grace
is reſpected and looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
no more than the ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
and parings of our
nailes. Whereas, if a man
had all the world, &amp; want
grace, hee hath in account
nothing, but if he want all
outward things, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with grace, he hath
enough, for grace is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for him: yet, alas, as
the Iſraelites were ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp and downe Aegypt
to gather ſtubble,<note place="margin">Exod. 5. 12.</note> and to
picke vp ſtrawes; ſo the

hunt vp and downe, beat

and ſtretch their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14956:137"/>
for thoſe things
which (compared with
grace) are no better than
ſtraw or ſtubble. The
condition of many people
would bee a great deale
more tolerable, (if any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
may be of euill) if
their want of grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from meere igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the price &amp; worth,
or the neceſſitie of grace:
but too many there bee
who are deſtitute of grace,
meerly through their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the means of grace;
nay (which is worſe) from
a graceleſſe &amp; wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of it, ſcoffing and
ſcorning the practice of it,
whereſoeuer they behold
it. Where ſhall a man liue,

where hee ſhall not meet

<hi>Iſmael,</hi> or ſome ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

how is hee maligned and

               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vſe. 2.</note> is grace the moſt

ſet an edge vpon our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

<hi>Gen. 30. 1. Giue mee

wouldeſt crie out, Lord,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14956:140"/>
giue mee of thy grace, or
elſe I die. I ſee how wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and miſerable I am
wanting grace: Oh what
ſhall I doe, that I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
grace? Be intreated
therefore to throw downe
thy ſelfe before the throne
of grace; confeſſe thy ſins
vnto the God of Grace; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
his Maieſtie to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
the poore confounded
worke of his owne hands,
by the malice of Satan and
the poiſon of ſin moſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
defiled. Beſeech him
for his Chriſts ſake, to
breathe into thy emptie
ſoule ſome blaſt of grace,
to fill thy emptie, barren,
and graceleſſe heart with
the fruits of his Spirit.
This earneſt deſire of thine
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14956:140"/>
will be a good euidence to
thy ſoule of ſome good
comming towards thee, of
ſome ſeed of grace already
ſowne in thee, it being an
effect of grace to bewaile
the want of grace, and to
be earneſt with the Lord
for a ſupply thereof. If
thou wert in any bodily
want or neceſſity, Towne
and Countrey (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
ſhould heare, if not
ring of it. Thou canſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
pray for, and earneſtly
ſeeke out for outward ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
food, clothing,
fire, &amp;c. But to whom doſt
thou make thy complaint
of the want of grace?
Whereas grace being the
moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing, ſhould
in the firſt place be deſired
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14956:141"/>
for thy ſelfe, thy wife, thy
husband, thy children, &amp;c.
If thou haſt grace, thou
haſt gotten a rich portion,
a great poſſeſſion, thy line
is falne in a faire ground. If
thou ſeeſt grace wrought
in the hearts of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
thou mayeſt be freed
from carefulneſſe, or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
great things for them,
they haue a great, a rich
portion. The Heathen
could ſay that <hi>Vertue was
a ſufficient Dowrie.</hi> And
the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The
Lord wil not famiſh the ſoule
of the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how hard a thing is
it for a Miniſter of Chriſt
to beat this into the heads
of people, eſpecially the
poorer ſort, who moſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14956:141"/>
neglect grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can riſe early, lye

can call and crie for theſe
outward things for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

few will ſtirre one foot, or
wet a finger for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

one thought tending
that way? not ſo much as

of grace, and therfore
trouble not themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

ſo the Lord cut off theſe

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe. 3.</note> if <hi>Grace be the

in the heart of Gods child,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14956:143"/>

               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way euill things.</note> we muſt be

carefull to plucke vp root
and rinde of al ſuch weeds
as may ouer-grow, choak,
and hinder the proſpering
of grace. One maine and
ranke weed is ſpirituall
pride and ſelfe-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
which growes too
faſt in the beſt ſoile, being
watered and cheriſhed by
the Deuill; who when he
cannot procure the childe
of God to ſtoope to his
lure, and bite at his bait of
impietie and profaneneſſe,
then labours he to poiſon
him with his owne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome,
to puffe him vp and
make him ſwel with pride
of his gifts. He will make
him proud of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
proud of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
praying, &amp;c. yea,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14956:144"/>
(rather than faile) hee will
make him proud of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
proud that he is not
proud. Pluck vp this weed

grace.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>God reſiſteth the

with good things, and ſends
away the full emptie, Luk. 1.
53.</hi> Humble your ſelues
therfore, and the Lord will
exalt you. The more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and lowly thou art, the
freer thou art from ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and ouer-turning: for
wee ſee low houſes ſtand
faſt, when many loftie and
high buildings are blowne
downe &amp; fall. The higher
any hill or mountaine is,
the more barren it is; for
the dew and raine which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14956:144"/>
waters the earth, to make
it fruitfull, tarries not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
high hils, but fals down
into the valleyes, &amp; makes
them fruitfull; euen ſo the
meanes of grace lighting
vpon an high and lofty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
do fall from him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſoaking or entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; whereas lighting
vpon the humble and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they make him fertile,
for <hi>the humble he will teach
his way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 9.</p>
               <p>Another weede which
muſt bee pluckt vp, is ſelfe-confidence,
or ſecuritie.
When Chriſtians begin to
beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vpon their
own ſtrength, and to grow
preſumptuous, the Lord
oft withdrawes from them
the ſtrength of his grace,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14956:145"/>
and then downe they fall.
<hi>Dauid</hi> was too ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,<note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 6.</note>
when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall
neuer be moued:</hi> therefore
God ſoone hides away his
face, and <hi>Dauid</hi> was as
quickly troubled. But of
all other examples there is
none for our purpoſe more
remarkable than that of
<hi>Peter,</hi> who took it in foule
ſcorne to be thought to be
ſuch a daſtard, and white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerd
ſouldier, yea, ſuch
a falſe-hearted ſeruant, as
to forſake his Lord &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in greateſt extremitie;
and therefore (if you will
take his word) he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
flinch, hee will die for
Chriſt, before he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him. But (when Chriſt
fore-told his Apoſtles of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14956:145"/>
their flinching from him)
if <hi>Peter</hi> had thus replied;
Lord, it may be thou ſeeſt
more into me, and know'ſt
my heart better than I
know my ſelfe; we are of
our ſelues weake and fraile,
ready to pull in our heads
vpon euery ſtorme; but
Lord, the ſpirit is willing,
though the fleſh be fraile;
of our ſelues we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
any further than thou
wilt aſſiſt vs; ſtrengthen vs
therefore with thy grace,
and then we will neuer flie
from thee. If thus <hi>Peter</hi> had
anſwered Chriſt, all had
been well; but being foole-hardy,
and ſelfe-confident,
the Lord ſets him vpon his
owne legs, leaues him vnto
himſelfe; and what became
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14956:146"/>
of this boaſter? at the word
of a Maiden he denyes and
forſweares Chriſt, curſes,
and damnes himſelf if euer
he knew him. Thus when
Gods children grow care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
too confident, or are
ouer-take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a dead ſleep
of carnall ſecurity, the
Lord oft ſtands by, lets Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
looſe, and layes the
reines vpon their owne
necks, whereby they come
oft-times to be ouer-taken
with groſſe and ſhamefull
ſins: the Lord in wiſdome
vſing (as bodily Phyſicians
oft doe) deſperate medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
and remedies, for the
curing of ſome deſperate
diſeaſe preuailing in them,
or growing vpon them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
there is another weed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14956:146"/>
to be plucked vp, and that
is <hi>Inſinceritie,</hi> if I may ſo
call it; the want of truth
and vprightneſſe of heart:
call it <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> if you wil,
that ſtinking weed, which
like the wilde Gourd,<note place="margin">2 King 4. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the Pottage, 2 King.
4.</hi> 40. The Lord loueth
truth in the inward parts,
and loathes the contrary.
Vprightneſſe and ſincerity
helpes forward the worke
of grace, as appeares, <hi>Pſal.
84. 11. The Lord will giue
grace and glory, and no good
thing will he with-hold from
them that walke vprightly.</hi>
The want of vprightneſſe
will make grace to wither.
It is not poſſible for that
tree to ſtand long, which is
rotten at the root, it may

no root downeward, ſo it
will not (long) beare fruit

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:14956:149"/>
leſt they ſtrike into thee,
and would thee; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
alwayes that they are
thornes, good in their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

noxious and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
They are thornes, they
will ouer-grow and choak
all good things that grow
neere them, if they be let
alone.</p>
               <p>Againe, there be many
bad humours, fooliſh and
noyſome luſts which muſt
be purged out of the heart,
or elſe grace will neuer
thriue nor proſper in it; to
wit, enuy, hatred, malice,
guile, diſſimulation, filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
euill ſpeakings, &amp; the

Therefore S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:14956:149"/>
exhorting his brethren, to
whom hee wrote, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the ſincere milke of
the Word, that they might
grow therby, prepares the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to this, by aduiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
lay aſide thoſe baſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
for they do much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the growth of Grace:
where they are, they take

of a Chriſtian, and make
him vnſeemely in the eyes
of his brethren; they dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his luſtre, and do blot
and blemiſh his holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
Therefore away
with theſe, lay theſe aſide,
not as a man doth his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
with a reſolution to
take it vp againe; but as the
captiue maid, when ſhe was
to be maried, laid aſide the

               <p>Laſt of all, take heed &amp;
beware of the needleſſe &amp;
familiar ſocietie of grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and godleſſe perſons;

There is a kind of poyſon
and venome in the words
and ſociety of the wicked,
which will fret, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſayes, like a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene;
and mens ſoules are
more ready to take the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

are to take the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

take vp a long time, and

proue a large diſcourſe, to
ſhew how many wayes, &amp;
by what degrees miſchiefe
doth grow by haunting
wicked company. By of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hearing filthy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene
ſpeeches, zeale in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is quenched, and ſuch
language growes in-offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue.
By often ſeeing lewd
prankes and wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
men can look on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

of the wicked quells a

as you loue your ſoules,

                  <hi>deceiuing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

euils muſt be auoided, ſo (if
you would grow in grace)
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:14956:152"/>
good things muſt be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed;
as the means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
health of body is firſt
to purge out malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and then to take

good diet.</p>
               <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">Good things to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</note> firſt of all

ſoluble, be euery day aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at the ſight of thy ſins,
and the ſenſe of thy vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and vnworthineſſe.
The way for a man to get
any good at Gods hand, is
to acknowledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
his emptineſſe, to
grieue and mourne for his
vnworthineſſe. God hath
made a promiſe to fill the
hungry with good things,
<hi>Apoc. 21. 6. I wil giue to him

               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:14956:153"/>
Thirdly, Be frequent in
hearing and reading of the
Word; the Word of God
is the <hi>Word of grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>which

Act.</hi> 20. 32. Therefore,
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. As new-borne
babes, deſire the ſincere milke
of the Word, that you may
grow thereby.</hi> If this Word
be thy delight, it <hi>will make
thee fruitfull, Pſal.</hi> 1. 2, 3.
Hence it is, that in <hi>Eſay 55.
10,</hi> 11. the Word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto raine, <hi>which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
the earth,</hi> and makes
it to <hi>bring forth,</hi> and bud,
<hi>that it may giue ſeed,</hi> &amp;c.
The barrenneſſe of many
ſouls proceeds from the
want of the Word to make
them fruitfull. <hi>Paul</hi> tels the
Coloſſians, Chap. 1. 6.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14956:153"/>
                  <hi>That they were fruitfull

                  <note place="margin">Col. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>from the
day that they heard it, and
truly knew the grace of God.</hi>
The miniſtry of the Word
is Gods holy ordinance, to
beget and increaſe grace in
his children, beating them
off from the world, raiſing
them vp to a higher pitch
of heauenly-mindedneſſe,
teaching them which way
to preuent occaſions of ſin,
and to beat backe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Deuill, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Oh, pity then, pity thoſe
poore ſoules, which want
theſe liuing waters, &amp; this
bread of Life. How many
thouſands in this our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Iſrael periſh for want
of viſion, the meanes of
grace? What will become
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14956:154"/>
of all cruell ſoule-murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in the day of the Lord?
Oh let vs continually bow
the knees of our hearts to
the Father of ſpirits, that
hee would put bowels of
compaſſion into thoſe that
haue authority, that the
Church may be purged of
all vnſauoury ſalt, and a
ſupply made of a faithfull
Miniſtery, which might
feelingly and tenderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the flocke of Chriſt,
which hee hath purchaſed
with his bloud: And let all
ſuch (as to whom Wiſdom
hath ſent her maidens,<note place="margin">Prou. 9. 3, 4, 5.</note> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them that are deſtitute

God looks for fruits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe

anſwerable to the
meanes of grace beſtowed
vpon them, leſt they be in
the number of thoſe which
<hi>receiue the grace of God in
vaine, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to increaſe thy ſtocke
of grace, ſet thy grace on
work,<note place="margin">Prou. 10. 4.</note> let it not be idle. <hi>The

ſaith <hi>Salomon, Prou.</hi> 10. 4.

                  <hi>in all labour there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
Prou.</hi> 14. 13. I
dare boldly ſay, it is in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more true, nay in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo true, as in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement
of grace; vſe

grace. That ſeruant
which vſed and improued
his Maſters <hi>Talents,</hi> gained

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14956:155"/>
Whereupon Chriſt infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 29.</note>
                  <hi>Mat. 25. 29. Vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Inſtruments and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
for want of vſe, doe
(oft-times) grow worſe,
and vnſeruiceable. Gifts
and graces of the Spirit,
are bettered by improuing
them; according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſaying, Vſe makes
perfect. Hence it is, that
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 15. Paul</hi> aduiſeth
him, <hi>Theſe things exerciſe, &amp;
giue thy ſelfe vnto them, that
it may be ſeene how thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteſt</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſt of all,
bee earneſt with the Lord
in prayer, that he would
put a ſpirit of life &amp; power
into all thoſe meanes vſed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14956:155"/>
by thee, or beſtowed vpon
thee, for the increaſe of
grace.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 6.</note> For <hi>Paul may plant,
and Apollos may water, but
God muſt giue the increaſe,
1 Cor.</hi> 3. 6. without his
bleſſing all meanes are but
naked and empty. He is the
Author and perfecter of
euery good thing begun
in any. Hence it is that the
Apoſtle prayes for the
<hi>Philippians 1. 9. that their
loue may abound more and
more.</hi> And that the <hi>Coloſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
1. 9. may bee fulfilled
with knowledge,</hi> and verſ.
10. <hi>fruitfull in all good
works.</hi> Teaching vs, that
prayer is the only helpe to
obtaine increaſe of any
good from God.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fulneſſe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14956:156"/>
of our hearts,
and the abundance of ſelfe-loue,
which abides in the
beſt of Gods children, we
are too readie to flatter, &amp;
to thinke too well of our
ſelues, taking oft-times
mole-hils for mountaines;
it will not bee amiſſe to
make ſome priuie ſearch,
whether wee finde any
growth of grace in vs, or
whether it ſtand at a ſtay,
or bee in declenſion. A
ſhame it will be for al ſuch
as liue vnder the meanes,
vpon whom God doth
daily beſtow coſt, wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them with heauenly
dewes, if they thriue not.
If grace bee true and not
counterfeit, more or leſſe,
ſome way or other it will
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14956:156"/>
grow. For to ſay truth, it
is only the good heart that
groweth and brings forth
fruit: and euill heart may
giue ſome appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, make
ſome ſhew of growth, but
growes not like to an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe,</hi>
one whoſe meat
doth him no good, he eats
and drinkes, and it may be,
with a greedy appetite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoures
more than is fitting,
yet battles not, but rather
falls away; euery day more
meager and leane than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
This (as was touched
before) ſhewes there is no
ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnion betwixt Chriſt
and ſuch: that they are no
true and liuely members of
Chriſts body: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there
would appeare ſome fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
<hi>Ioh. 15. 5. He that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:14956:157"/>
abideth in me, and I in him,
the ſame bringeth forth much
fruit.</hi> Well then, ſeeing the
Lord hath planted vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the riuers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
let vs take a view of
our growth &amp; fruitfulnes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thou mayeſt know
thou groweſt in grace, if
thou groweſt more and
more into a diſlike of ſin,
(as was ſaid in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
if thy wants &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
doe worke in thee
daily, deeper humiliation.
For as grace diſcouers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
ſo the more it
growes (as a light that
comes into a dark roome)
the more it ſhewes vs the
filthineſſe and odiouſneſſe
therof, and makes vs more
and more aſhamed of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:14956:157"/>
Secondly, thou mayeſt
know thou groweſt in
grace, by thine appetite to
Gods ordinances. Doeſt
thou taſte more and more
ſweetneſſe in the Word? Is
prayer more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to thy ſoule? Doſt
thou receiue more &amp; more
comfort by the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?
Doth thy ſoule more and
more delight to be in the
place where Gods honour
dwelleth? And are the feet
of thoſe that bring glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of ſaluation more &amp;
more beautifull in thine
eyes? Whence ariſe theſe
fruits, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſeed of
grace ſowne in thy ſoule?
I tell thee for a truth, that
if theſe fruits be in thee, and
thy affections to the means
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14956:158"/>
of grace, be more &amp; more
intire and hearty, thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
no more doubt of the
growth of grace in thy
ſoule, then thou wouldeſt,
or doſt queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the growth

and the parts &amp; members
of thy body, euery day
more actiue &amp; liuely than
other, &amp; more ſtrong and
able vnto their ſeuerall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
For certainly it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grace which makes the
ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of God alwayes
ſweet vnto vs. For to a
graceleſſe pallet they are
for the moſt part vnſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
What made <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo
much to long after Gods
Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuary? It was the grace
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14956:158"/>
of his heart, which ſet an

and made his ſoule <hi>(euen as

doe raiſe thee vp

&amp; doe
more and more beat off

the abundance of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which thou findeſt in

               <p>But may not a graceleſſe

in Gods ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had a pleaſant

               <p>The taſte of the wicked

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:14956:160"/>
A wicked man may
taſte of Gods ordinances,
but hee eates them not, hee

by ſuffering he ouercame.
And therefore, as one that
had experience of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
he hath taught vs
to pray, <hi>lead vs not into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but deliuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euil:</hi>
as if we ſhould ſay, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
(holy Father) thou haſt
determined to expoſe vs
for our triall, vnto tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet ſuffer vs not to be
vanquiſhed or ouer-come
by any euil. Now wee
know, or at the leaſt ſhould
know, that (if we pray in
faith) God alwayes heares
vs: if not to be preſerued
from the tentation, yet to
be vpheld and aſſiſted with
ſufficiencie of grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

the power of it ſhall

elſe our ſtrength to beare
it, ſo increaſed, that we ſhal
by the help of his grace, be
able to wade thorow &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
it. For God knows
our ſtrength, and what our
backes are able to beare,
and therfore doth ballance
and proportion the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the ſtrength of his
children; weaklings or
younglings he will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-load
with ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
as may breake their

tentations. Whereas his

trialls; yet no other than
ſuch as they ſhall manfully
vndergoe, without fainting
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14956:162"/>
vnder them, though not
without the feeling of the
ſmart of them. So that as
they haue iuſt cauſe to crie

&amp;c. For is God the God
of <hi>Paul</hi> only? Is his grace
ſufficient only for <hi>Paul,</hi> or
ſome few other ſpecially

               <p>Secondly, this may
wonderfully comfort vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the outward croſſe,
as well as the inward tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The way to heauen
(we know) is not ſtrowed
with ruſhes and violets, but
beſet with thorns; a rough,
narrow, and troubleſome
way, whereupon many of
Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and are ready to faint
vnder the croſſe, when it
lyes any thing heauie vpon
them. If theſe had eyes to

of the excellency and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of grace, which

whatſoeuer the Lord
will lay vpon vs, well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the Lords orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and diſpoſing of vs;
they would reioice in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe,
and be comforted
againſt the croſſe. It may
be thou thinkeſt thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are ſuch, as thou ſhalt
neuer bee able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
&amp; therfore art ready
euen to faint vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and

Oh but conſider the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of grace, wherewith
the Lord hath hitherto
ſupported thee in thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions!
Hath not God ſaid,
<hi>I will not faile thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

he not ſaid, <hi>My grace ſhall
be ſufficient for thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What though thou beeſt
plunged into a gulfe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
through manifold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
which haue befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
thee?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 6.</note> ſo that for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thou art in heauineſſe
through them; yet through
the power of grace thou
ſhalt be able to hold vp thy
head from ſinking, yea to
reioyce in the end with
ioy vnſpeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. What
though the Deuill ſwell &amp;
rage againſt thee? What
though his wicked inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
doe combine and
bandie themſelues againſt
thee, ſeeking to ſpoile thee
of all outward and inward
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14956:164"/>
comfort? What though
thy neereſt and deareſt
friends doe now turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their faces from thee,
yea, hate and abhorre thee
as an out-caſt &amp; alien? Let
<hi>Dauids</hi> comfort be thine,
who being in great ſorrow
becauſe of the rage of the
people which intended to
ſtone him, comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in the Lord his God,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. So doe thou
comfort thy ſelfe in the
grace of God. Hath he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
his loue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee?
Hath he giuen thee of his
grace? Though thy outward
calamities be neuer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
neuer ſo great, though
thine enemies be neuer ſo
mighty, neuer ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet <hi>ſtronger is he that is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:14956:165"/>
in thee, than he that is in the
world, 1 Ioh.</hi> 4. 4. If God
grace thee, what though all
the world ſhould caſt the
dung of reproch in thy
face to diſgrace thee? If he
loue thee, his loue is better
than life, and he will keepe
thee from taking infection
or hurt, from the rage and
malice of all the world
that hate thee.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that which hath
beene ſpoken concerning
the excellencie of Grace,
may comfort thee againſt
the dregs and reliques of
corruption, and the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of the old man yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
in thee, which, it
may be, doe ſo perplex thy
ſoule, and wound thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14956:165"/>
that thou groneſt

                  <hi>O

becauſe of the grace of
God abiding in thee: <hi>For
ſinne ſhall not haue dominion
ouer you: for ye are not vnder

Rom.</hi> 6. 14. It is a good
ſigne there is life, where
wounds do bleed &amp; ſmart;
the griefe of thy ſoule for
ſin, argues the life of grace
abiding in thee; for thoſe
that are dead in ſins, feele
no ſmart, are not grieued
with corruption. Sin is not
