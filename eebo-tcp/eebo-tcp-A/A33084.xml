            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S we conceive, that the many crying evils, for which the Lord hath been and is ſmiting us, which hath been held forth former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as cauſes of Solemn Humiliations, ſhould be ſeriouſly laid to heart and mourned for, and eſpecially that maine and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall evill, the woefull ſource and root of all our other Provocations, the contempt of the Glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, the ignorance of him amongſt the generality of the Land, and the great negligence even amongſt the beſt of ſeeking to him for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, and entertaining Communion with God through him, and obtaining grace from him for walking acceptably in our Perſons and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; So particularly we judge the Lord in his Providence is calling us to mourn before him;</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the growing evidences of his diſpleaſure againſt the Land, in the continuance of his ſad afflictions upon all ranks of Perſons, notwithſtanding our former Humiliations before him, the Lord teſtifying his anger even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prayers of his People: and no wonder, conſidering the great abuſe of that holy Ordinance by our formalities and Faſting unto our ſelves and not unto God.</p>

            <p n="3">III. The encreaſe and heightning of all our woefull differences and diviſions, to the great ſcandall of the Reformed Chriſtian Religion, and apparant ruine of the Work <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">

            <p n="4">IV. The many ſad encroachments from diverſe hands made and like to be made upon the precious Liberties of the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious truſt committed to us from him, and tranſmitted to us from our zealous and faithfull Predeceſſors, who, in the obtaining and preſervation of them, loved not their lives, even unto the death.</p>

            <p>For theſe, amongſt many things, we deſire the People of God throughout the Land may mourn, every man ſearching his way, and ſaying, <hi>What have I done,</hi> rather then to lay all the weight on the ſins of others; And withall, humbly to pray, That the Lord would powre on the Land the ſpirit of mourning and repentance, that, in the depth of his own wiſdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he would finde out wayes of healing of our woefull differences, and in the mean while poſſeſſe our hearts with the ſpirit of love, ſtedfaſtneſſe, and a ſound mind, and with reſolution and courage for enduring whatſoever the Lord in his wiſe Providence ſhall call us to ſuffer in the maintainance of his truth.</p>
