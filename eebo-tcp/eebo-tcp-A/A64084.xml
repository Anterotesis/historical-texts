         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Reverend Father in GOD, RICHARD, Lord Bishop of PETERBOROUGH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving, many Years agon,
when your Learned and
Judicious Treatise of the
Laws of Nature was first
published, carefully perused it to my
great satisfaction, I also thought it
necessary to make an Epitome, or
Abridgment of it, as well for my
own better Remembrance, as that
<pb facs="tcp:53522:3"/>
I believed it might be also useful,
as an Introduction to Ethicks, for
some near Relations of mine, for
whom I then designed it. These
Papers, after they had lain by me
several Years, I happened to shew
to some Friends of mine, (and
in particular to the Honourable
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>;) who so well approved
of the Undertaking, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
me to make it publick, as
that which might give great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to those of the Nobility and
Gentry of our own Nation, (as well
as others of a lower rank) who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do not understand <hi>Latin,</hi> or
else had rather read Epitomes of
greater Works, than take the Pains
to peruse the Originals. Which Task,
tho' not very grateful to me, yet
I was prevailed with to undertake,
and to look over those Papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and add several considerable
<pb facs="tcp:53522:3"/>
Passages out of the Treatise itself;
and this not for Fame's sake, or the
honour of being thought an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
since I was satisfied, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that nature could be due
to one, who does not pretend to
more, than to Translate or Abridge
another Man's Labours: Yet I am
willing, in pursuance of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Principle, to sacrifice all these
little private Considerations to the
<hi>Publick Good,</hi> as being sensible, that
in the Trade of Learning (as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Trades) divers, who cannot be
Inventors, or chief Merchants, may
yet do the Publick good service by
venting other Mens Notions in a
new dress; especially since I have
also observed, that things of this
kind, if well done, (and with due
acknowledgment to the Authors
from whence they are borrowed)
as they have proved beneficial to
<pb facs="tcp:53522:4"/>
those whose Education, or constant
Employments in their own Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
will not give them leave to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse
many Volumes, written perhaps
in a Language they are no great
Masters of; so also, they have not
failed of some Commendation from
all Candid Readers. Thus Monsieur
<hi>Rohault</hi>'s Abridgment of <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s
Philosophy, and Monsieur <hi>Bernier</hi>'s
of <hi>Gassendus</hi>'s, (to mention no
more) have been received with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Applause, not only by all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Men of the <hi>French,</hi> but also
of our own Nation, who understand
that Language.</p>
            <p>And the Learned and Inquisitive
Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> hath thought an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of this kind so useful for our
Nobility and Gentry, as to give us
his own elegant Translations, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abridgments in <hi>English,</hi> of his
two ingenious Treatises of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:53522:4"/>
of the Earth. And I doubt not,
but your Lordship would have done
somewhat in this kind, with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Work of yours, had not
the constant Employments of your
Sacred Function, as well as your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
severe and useful Studies, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you from it.</p>
            <p>But, perhaps, it may be thought
by some, that this Task hath been
very well performed already by
Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in
his Treatise, entituled<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
               <hi>A Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Laws of Nature,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needs not be done over again.
But to this I shall only say, that as
he hath borrowed all that is new
in that Work from your Lordship's
Book, so it is with so slight an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of that Obligation,
that since he owns himself behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you for no more than the
first Hint, or main Notion, no
<pb facs="tcp:53522:5"/>
wonder if he hath fallen very short
of the Original from whence he
borrowed it, both in the clearness,
as well as choice of the Arguments
or Demonstrations, and in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
setting forth of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments derived (by
God's appointment) from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Men, and the Frame of
Things; which can only be done
according to that exact Method
your Lordship hath there laid
down. Tho', I confess, there is one
thing that is particular in that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
Undertaking, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Account he there gives us of
the great Differences and Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
among the most famous of the
Heathen Philosophers, concerning
Mans Soveraign Good, or Happiness,
chiefly for want of the certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a future state, and that clear
conviction we now have, that Mens
<pb facs="tcp:53522:5"/>
chiefest Good or Happiness consists
in God's Love and Favour towards
them: As also his observation, That,
notwithstanding all that can be said
of the Natural Rewards of Vertue,
and Punishments of Vice, <hi>nothing
but the reasonable hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Happiness in a Life to come,
can in all Cases bear us up under all
the Miseries, Sorrows and Calamities
of this.</hi> And herein I must own
I agree with him; and therefore
hope your Lordship will pardon me,
if I have in the ensuing Discourse
insisted somewhat more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon these future Rewards and
Punishments, which I doubt not
may very well be proved from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the necessity of supposing
them, in order to the asserting and
vindicating God's Justice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
Tho' I grant, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
or Divine Revelation, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:53522:6"/>
us more firm grounds for this
our Belief, than we had before by
the mere light of Nature.</p>
            <p>But supposing this Work of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Parker</hi> never so well perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as I do not deny, but it hath
all the advantages of a Popular and
Gentile Stile, and that neat Turn
he gives to all his Writings; and
therefore I have not scrupled to
transcribe, out of his Discourse, one
or two Passages, where I thought
either his way of urging your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Arguments, or the close sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them up, was not to be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any other Pen: Yet since (as
I have already observed) the whole
is not done from your Lordship's
Work, and is also too concise, and
full of Digressions, and besides wants
your solid Confutations of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s
Principles, it seems necessary, that
another Treatise more exact in the
<pb facs="tcp:53522:6"/>
kind, should be published as more
agreeable to your Lordship's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
Whether this which I now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with, be such, I must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to your Lordship's and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
judgment.</p>
            <p>But since I have undertaken this
difficult Province with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
approbation, it is fit, that I
give you, as well as the Reader,
some account of the Method I have
followed in this Treatise, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it differs from yours.</p>
            <p>First then, to begin with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
The substance of it is wholly
yours, except the Introduction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the usefulness of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true Grounds of the
Law of Nature, in order to a right
understanding of Moral Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
nay Christianity itself.</p>
            <p>But for a Conclusion to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
I have also made some Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:53522:7"/>
wherein. I have shewn your
Principle of Endeavouring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good, is not a new Invention,
but that which several Great Men
had before delivered, as the only
firm Rule, by which to try not only
all our Moral Actions, but all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Laws, whether they are right and
just; that is, agreeable to right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or not. And I have also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it with a set of Principles,
very necessary to be understood, for
the proving the Truth of all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Religion, and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
tho' the two last alone are the
Subject of your Lordship's Book,
as well as of my Abridgment of
it.</p>
            <p>But to speak more particularly
of the Discourse itself, since I here
design no more than an Epitome, I
hope your Lordship will not take it
ill, if I have omitted most of your rare
<pb facs="tcp:53522:7"/>
Instances and Parallels drawn from
the Mathematicks, many of which
are above the capacity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Readers, (tho' therein your
Lordship hath shewn your self a
Great Master) and have confined
my self only to such plain and easie
Proofs and natural Observations as
Men of all capacities may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
So also if in the Chapter of
Humane Nature, I have left out
divers curious Anatomical Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherein the Structure of Mens
Bodies differs from that of Beasts,
if I thought they were at all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
or doubtful, or such as
did not directly tend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that Mens Bodies are fitted
and ordained by God for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the Common Good of
others of their own Kind, above
all other Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:8"/>I have also made bold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the Chapters in your Work,
into a lesser number, having dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the substance of them into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, or else quite omitted
some, as not so necessary to our
purpose: As for example, I have
placed most of the Matter of the
third Chapter, <hi>De bono naturali,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the explanation of the word
<hi>Good,</hi> in our Description of the
Law of Nature, in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
reserving what remained of it
to the second part for the Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Principle of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
That no Action is Good or Evil in
the State of Nature. So likewise
for the fourth Chapter, <hi>De Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus
Practicis,</hi> I have set down
the Substance of it (omitting the
Mathematical Illustrations) in our
second Chapter of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So also the sixth Chapter,
<pb facs="tcp:53522:8"/>
entituled, <hi>De iis quae in Lege Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali
continentur.</hi> And the seventh
and eighth, <hi>De Origine Dominii, &amp;
Virtutum Moralium.</hi> I have partly
disposed the substance of them into
the first Chapter of the Nature of
Things, but chiefly into your fourth
Chapter, reducing all the Laws of
Nature, and Moral Vertues therein
contained, into this one Principle,
of Endeavouring the Common
Good of Rational Beings. But as
for your last Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that
part of it which contains the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectaria,</hi>
or Consequences deducible
from the foregoing Chapters, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and all
Civil Laws; I have made bold to
omit, since it is plain enough, that
all the Precepts of the Decalogue
do tend either (in the first Table)
to the Honour and Glory of God,
in his commanding himself to be
<pb facs="tcp:53522:9"/>
the sole Object of our Worship,
and that without any Images of
himself; or else (in the second
Table) to our Duties towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
wherein the highest Vertue
and Innocence are prescribed. And
so likewise, that all the Laws of the
Supreme Civil Powers have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but as they pursue this
Great Rule, or Law of Nature, of
procuring the Common Good of
Rational Beings; that is, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Worship of God, and the
Peace and Happiness of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and of Mankind in general:
And whereas your Lordship hath
here also solidly and briefly confuted
many Gross Errors in Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
as well as Politicks, some of
those Confutations I have made
use of in the second Part, <hi>viz.</hi> those
that relate to that Author's Moral
Principles, which, if they are false,
<pb facs="tcp:53522:9"/>
his Politick ones will fall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I must beg your
Lordships Pardon, if I have made
bold to alter your Method, as to
your Confutation of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
For whereas you have thought
fit to do it in the Body of your
Work, and as they occurred under
the several Heads you treat of;
since I perceiv'd the placing your
Answers after that manner, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the Connexion and Perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Discourse, I thought it
better to cast those Answers into a
distinct part, digested under so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Heads, or Propositions, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in which they stand in Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s
Books, <hi>de Cive,</hi> and <hi>Leviathan,</hi> where
the Reader, if he pleases, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
what I have quoted out of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:10"/>And I hope your Lordship will
not take it amiss in me, if (to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Work more pleasant and
grateful to common Readers, and
that it may not look like a bare
Translation) I have added several
Notions and Observations, some of
my own knowledge, and others out
of History, and the Relations of
Modern Travellers, concerning the
Customs of those Nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
counted Barbarous, who yet
by their amicable living together,
without either Civil Magistrates, or
written Laws, serve sufficiently to
confute Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s extravagant Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That all Men by Nature are
in a State of War.</p>
            <p>I have likewise presumed to add
those Aphorisms of Good and Evil
contained in Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of Natural Religion, and
Dr. <hi>Moor</hi>'s <hi>Enchiridion Ethicum,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:53522:10"/>
the Reader may see them all at
once, tho' I confess they are most
of them to be found (tho' dispersed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
in your Lordship's Work. I have
also inserted some things, in answer
to the Objections at the end of the
first Part, out of that noble contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
Philosopher, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
of <hi>Humane Vnderstanding</hi>;
since he proceeds upon the same
Principles with your Lordship, and
hath divers very new and useful No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning the Manner of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Knowledge of all Truths,
as well Natural, as Divine, and the
Certainty we have of them.</p>
            <p>But, I fear, I have trespass'd too
much upon your Lordship's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
by so long an Epistle, and
therefore shall conclude with my
Prayers for your Lordship's Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Health, since I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
you cannot but prove more
<pb facs="tcp:53522:11"/>
useful for the common good of our
Church and State, in this high and
publick Station to which Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
have thought fit to call you,
than you could have been in a more
private Condition: And I hope
your Lordship will look upon this
Dedication as a small Tribute of
Gratitude, which all the World must
owe you for your Learned and
not Common Undertakings, of
which Obligation none ought to be
(or indeed is) more sensible than,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, By way of INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Suppose you are not ignorant, that the
Study of Moral Philosophy, or the Laws
of Nature, was preferred (by <hi>Plato, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,
Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> the wisest
of the Heathen Philosophers) above all other
knowledge, whether Natural or Civil, and that
deservedly, as well in respect of its usefulness,
as certainty, since it was to that alone (as most
agreeable to the Natural Faculties of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
that Men, before they were assisted by
Divine Revelation, owed the Discovery of their
<pb facs="tcp:53522:12"/>
Natural Duties, to God, themselves, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
as <hi>Cicero</hi> hath shewn us at large in
those three excellent Treatises, <hi>De Officiis,
De Finibus,</hi> and <hi>De Legibus.</hi> And tho' I
grant we Christians have now clearer and
higher Discoveries of all Moral Duties, by the
Light of the Gospel, yet is the Knowledge of
Natural Religion, or the Laws of Nature, still
of great use to us, as well for the confirmation
as illustration of all those Duties, since by their
Knowledge, and the true Principles on which
they are founded, we may be convinced, that
God requires nothing from us in all the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Duties of revealed Religion, but our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Service; that is, what is really our
own interest, and concerns our good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to observe, as the best and most perfect Rule
of Life, whether God had ever farther enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them or not by any revealed Law. And
tho' I do not deny, that our Saviour <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> hath highly advanced and improved
these Natural Laws, by more excellent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
Precepts of Humility, Charity, and Self-denial,
than were discovered before by the
wisest of the Heathen Philosophers, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as to the greater assurance we have of that
grand Motive to Religion and Vertue, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Soul, or a Life either eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
happy or miserable, when this is ended:
Yet certainly it was this Law of Nature, or
<pb facs="tcp:53522:12"/>
Reason alone, by which Mankind was not only
to live, but also to be judged, before the Law
given to <hi>Moses,</hi> and it must be for not living
up to this Natural Light, that the Heathens
shall be condemned, who never yet heard of
<hi>Christ,</hi> or of a revealed Religion, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly declares to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans)
believe on him of whom they have
not heard,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.14.</hi> And therefore the
same Apostle, in the first Chapter of the same
Epistle, appeals to the knowledge of God, from
the things that are seen, that is, the Creation
of the World, as the foundation of all Natural
Religion, and their falling [notwithstanding
this knowledge,] into that gross Idolatry they
professed, as the only reason, <hi>why God gave
them up to their own hearts lusts, because
that when they knew God, they glorified
him not as God, neither were thankful, but
became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkned,</hi> v <hi>21.</hi> And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the second Chapter, the Apostle farther
tells them, <hi>that when the Gentiles, who have
not the Law, do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law, these having not the Law,
are a Law unto themselves, shewing the
work of the Law written in their hearts;</hi>
that is, the Law of Nature or Reason, as the
main substance or effect of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law.
And that it is by this Law alone, that they
<pb facs="tcp:53522:13"/>
shall be judged, mark what immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>Their consciences bearing witness, and
their own thoughts</hi> (or reasonings, as it is
rather to be rendred) <hi>in the mean while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
or excusing each other.</hi> And indeed
the Apostle supposes the Knowledge of God as a
Rewarder of Good Works, as the foundation
of all Natural, as well as revealed Religion,
and the first Principle of saving Faith, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. <hi>11.</hi>
v. <hi>6. But without faith it is impossible to
please him, for he that comes unto God
must first believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of all them that diligently seek
him.</hi> But I need speak no more of Natural
Religion, and how necessary it is to the true
Knowledge of the Revealed, since the Reverend
and learned Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> Late Bishop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
hath so well perform'd that Noble Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
in that excellent Posthumous Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
published by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi>
now Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to which
nothing needs to be added by so mean a Pen as
mine.</p>
            <p>But since the Laws of Nature, as derived
from God the Legislator, are the foundation of
all Moral Philosophy and true Politicks, as
being those which are appealed to in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
between Civil Soveraigns, and also
are the main Rules of those mutual Duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="tcp:53522:13"/>
Soveraigns and their Subjects: It is
worth while to enquire how these Laws may be
discovered to proceed from God as a Legislator.
Now whereas this can only be done by one of
these two ways, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Either from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and manifest Effects and Consequences
that proceed from their observation; Or, <hi>2dly,</hi>
From the Causes from which they are derived.
The former of these hath been already largely
treated of by others, especially by the most
learned <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> in his admirable Work,
<hi>De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis.</hi> And by his Brother
<hi>William,</hi> in that small Posthumous Treatise,
<hi>De Principiis Juris Naturalis.</hi> And by the
Iudicious Monsieur <hi>Puffendorf,</hi> in his learned
Treatise, <hi>De Jure Naturae &amp; Gentium:</hi> As
also by our own Countryman, Dr. <hi>Sharrock.</hi>
Who have all undertaken to prove their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
from their general belief and reception
by the wisest and most civilized Nations in all
Ages. To which we may also add the learned
Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> in that most elaborate Work, <hi>De
Jure Gentium juxta placita Hebraeorum.</hi> And
as I do acknowledge, that those Great Men
have all deserved very well in their way, so
I think none deserves greater commendation,
than that excellent Work of <hi>Grotius</hi> the Elder,
which as it was the first in its kind, so it is
worthy of enduring as long as Vertue and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
shall be in esteem among Mankind. And
<pb facs="tcp:53522:14"/>
tho' the Objections which are wont to be
brought against this Method of proving the
Laws of Nature, are not of so great moment,
as to render it altogether fallacious or useless,
as some would have it to be; yet I freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
they can chiefly serve to convince
Men of sincere and honest minds, and who are
naturally disposed to Vertue and right Reason:
So that I conceive it were more useful, as well
as certain, to seek for a firmer and clearer
Demonstration thereof, from a strict search and
inquisition into the Nature of things, and also
of our own selves, by which I doubt not but we
may attain not only to a true Knowledge of the
Laws of Nature, but also of that true Principle
on which they are founded, and from whence
they are all derived.</p>
            <p>But it will not consist with the narrow bounds
of a Preface, to propose and answer all the
Objections that may be made against their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of proving the Law of Nature, from the
Consent of Nations, neither perhaps can it be
done at all to the universal satisfaction even of
indifferent persons; since it may be still urged
by those that do not admit them, that altho'
some Dictates of Right Reason may be indeed
approved of by our Vnderstandings, and are
commonly received and practised by most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for their general usefulness and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency:
Yet it must be acknowledged, that there
<pb facs="tcp:53522:14"/>
is still required the Knowledge of God as a
Legislator, by whose Authority alone they can
obtain the force of Laws. The Proof of which
(tho' the most material part of the Question)
hath been hitherto omitted, or but slightly
touch'd, by former Writers on this Subject.</p>
            <p>But besides the Objections of some of the
Ancients, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> have
also argued against this Method, tho' upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Principles, and from different Designs,
the latter intending, that no body should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
these Dictates of Reason, as obligatory to
outward Actions, before a Supreme Civil Power
be instituted, who shall ordain them to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
as Laws. <q>And tho' he sometimes vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes
them that Title, yet in his <hi>De Cive,
cap. 14.</hi> he tells us, That in the state of
Nature they are but improperly called so,
and that tho' the Laws of Nature may be
found largely described in the Writings of
Philosophers, yet are they not for this cause
to be called Laws, any more than the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
or Opinions of Lawyers are Laws, till
confirmed and made so by the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, on the other side, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> more
fairly finds fault with the want of Authority
in these Dictates of Reason, (considered only
as such) that he may from hence shew us a
necessity of recurring to the Legislative Power
<pb facs="tcp:53522:15"/>
of God, and that he may thereby make out,
that those Dictates of Reason do only acquire
the force of Laws, because all our knowledge
of them is to be derived from God alone, who
when he makes these Rules known to us, does
then (and not before) promulgate them to us
as Laws. And so far I think he is in the right,
and hath well enough corrected our common
Moralists, who are wont to consider these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Reason as Laws, without any sufficient
proof, that they have all the Conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make them so, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
and declared to us by God as a Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who hath annexed to them sufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments. But I think it is
evident, that if these Rational Dictates can
by any means be proved to proceed from the
Will of God, the Author of Nature, as Rules
for all our Moral Actions, they will not need
any Humane Authority, much less the Consent
or Tradition of any one or many Nations to
make them known to be so: Therefore, tho' I
grant this learned Author hath taken a great
deal of pains to prove from divers general
Traditions of the Iewish Rabbins, that God
gave certain Commands to <hi>Adam,</hi> and after to
<hi>Noah,</hi> contained in these seven Precepts, called
by his Name; and that those various Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
this learned Author hath there produced,
do clearly prove, that the Iews believe, that
<pb facs="tcp:53522:15"/>
all Nations whatever, altho' they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> yet are obliged to
observe the same Moral Laws, which they
conceive to be all contained under the Precepts
above mentioned; and tho' this Work is indeed
most learnedly and judiciously performed, and
may prove of great use in Christian Theology,
yet I must confess it still seems to me, that he
hath not sufficiently answered his own Objection
concerning Mens Ignorance, or want of Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Law-giver; for altho' it should be
granted, that those Traditions they call the
Precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> should be never so generally
or firmly believed by the whole Iewish Nation,
yet are they not therefore made known to the
rest of Mankind, and one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That
of not eating any Part or Member of a living
Creature, is justly derided and received with
scorn by all other Nations. So that it seems
evident to me, that the unwritten Traditions
of the learned Men of any one Nation, cannot
be looked upon as a sufficient promulgation made
by God as a Law-giver, of those Laws or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
therein contained; and that all Nations,
who perhaps have never heard of <hi>Adam</hi> or
<hi>Noah,</hi> should be condemned for not living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them, especially when we consider,
that it is but in these latter Ages of the World,
that the Iewish Rabbins began to commit these
Traditions to Writing; and that it is most
<pb facs="tcp:53522:16"/>
probable the ancient Iews knew nothing of them,
since neither <hi>Josephus,</hi> nor <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> take
any notice of these Precepts in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>Therefore that the Divine Authority of
those Dictates of Right Reason, or Rules of
Life, called the Laws of Nature, may more
evidently be demonstrated to all considering
Men, it seemed to me the best and fittest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to inquire first into their Natural Causes,
as well internal as external, remote as near,
since by this Series of Causes and Effects, we
may at last be more easily brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Will of God, their first Cause,
from whose intrinsick Perfections and extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Sanctions, by fit Rewards and due Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we have endeavoured to shew, that as
well their Authority as Promulgation is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>I know indeed, that the greatest part of
former Writers have been content, to suppose,
that these Dictates of Reason, and all Acts
conformable thereunto, are taught us by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or at most do only affirm in general, that
they proceed from God, without shewing us
which way, or the manner how. Therefore it
seemed highly necessary to us, that we ought
to inquire more exactly how the force of Objects
from without, and of our own Notions or Idea's
from within us, do both concur towards the
<pb facs="tcp:53522:16"/>
imprinting, and fixing these Principles in our
Minds, as Laws derived from the Will of
God himself; which Work if it be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
we hope may prove of great use, not
only to our own Nation, but to all Mankind;
because from hence it may appear, both by
what means Men's Vnderstandings, may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to a true, and natural Knowledge of the
Divine Will, or Laws of God; So that if
they practise them not, they may be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuse: And this Principle will likewise
serve for a general Rule, by which the Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Laws of every Common-wealth may be
tryed, whether they are Iust, and Right, or
not; that is agreeable with the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and so may be corrected, and amended
by the supreme Powers, when-ever they have
deviated from this great End of the common
Good. And from hence may also be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that there is somewhat in the Nature of
God, as also in our own, and all other Men's
Natures, which administers present Comfort
and Satisfaction to our Minds, from good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as also firm Hopes, or Presages of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Happiness, as a Reward for them
when this Life is ended; whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side the greatest Misery, and most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Fears, do proceed from wicked, or evil
Actions, from whence the Conscience seems
furnished, as it were <hi>with Whips, and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:17"/>
to correct and punish all Vice, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probity:
So that it may from hence appear,
that Men are not deluded in their moral No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
either by Clergy-men, or Politicians.</p>
            <p>I grant, the <hi>Platonists</hi> undertake to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
all these Difficulties a much easier way,
only by supposing certain innate <hi>Idea's</hi> of moral
Good, and Evil, imprest by God upon the Souls
of Men. But I must indeed confess my self
not yet so happy, as to be able thus easily to
attain to so great a Perfection, as the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Laws of Nature by this natural
Instinct, or Impression: And it doth not seem to
me either safe, or convenient to lay the whole
Stress of Natural Religion, and Morality upon
an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which hath been exploded by
all Philosophers, except themselves, and
which can never alone serve to convince those
of <hi>Epicurean</hi> Principles, for whom we chiefly
design this Work: But whosoever will take
the Pains to peruse, what hath been written,
against these innate <hi>Idea's</hi> by the
inquisitive, and sagacious <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Ioh. Lock.</note> Author
of the late <hi>Essay of humane Understanding,</hi>
will find them very hard, if not impossible to
be proved to have ever been innate in the Souls
of Men, before they came into the World:
Therefore as I shall not take upon me, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to deny the Being, or Impossibility of
such <hi>Idea's,</hi> so I shall not make use of any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb facs="tcp:53522:17"/>
drawn from thence in this Discourse,
Though I heartily wish that any Reasons, or
Motives, which may serve to promote true
Vertue, and Piety may prevail as far as they
deserve, with all sincere and honest Men.</p>
            <p>And the same Reasons, which deterred me
from supposing any natural Laws innate
in our Minds, have also made me not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
suppose, as many do (without any due
proof) That such <hi>Idea's</hi> have existed in the
Divine Intellect from all Eternity. And
therefore I looked upon it as more proper, and
necessary to begin from those things, which
are most known, and familiar to us by our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and from thence to prove that certain
Propositions of immutable Truth prescribing
our Care of the Happiness, or common Good
of all rational Agents considered together, are
necessarily imprinted upon our Minds from the
Nature of things, and which the first Cause
perpetually determines so to act upon them:
And that in the Terms of these Propositions,
are intrinsecally included an evident Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Truth, and certainty, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from God the first Cause in the very
intrinsick Constitution of things: From whence
it will be also manifest, that such practical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
are truly and properly Laws, as being
declared, and established by due Rewards, and
Punishments annexed to them by him, as the
supreme Legislator.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:18"/>But after it shall appear, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of these Laws, and a Practice confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to them are the highest Perfection, or
most happy State of our Rational Natures: It
will likewise follow, that a Perfection Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
to this Knowledge, and a Practice confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to these Laws, must necessarily be in the
first Cause; from whence proceeds, not only
our own Natural Perfections, but also the most
wise Ordination of all Effects without us, for
the common Conservation, and Perfection of
the whole Natural System, or Vniverse, which
our Eyes daily behold: For that is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by me among the things most certainly
prov'd, That it must be first known, what Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
is, and what those Laws enjoyn, in whose
Observation all Iustice consists, before we can
distinctly know, that Iustice is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God, and that his Iustice is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
by us as a Pattern, or Example for us to
imitate. Since we do not know God by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Intuition of his Essence, or Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but only from the outward Effects of his
Providence, first known by our Senses, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
Neither is it safe to affix Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to him, which we cannot sufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
or make out from things without
us.</p>
            <p>Having now shewn you in general, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between our Method, and that which
<pb facs="tcp:53522:18"/>
others have hitherto followed, it is fit we
here declare, in as few words as we can, the
chief Heads of those things which we have
delivered in this Treatise. Supposing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those natural Principles concerning the
Laws of Motion, and Rest sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by Naturalists (especially such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon Mathematical Principles) since we
have only here undertaken to demonstrate the
true Grounds of Moral Philosophy, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them from some supposed Knowledge of
Nature, and as they refer to our Moral Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
I have here therefore supposed all the
Effects of corporeal Motions, which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and necessary, and performed without any
Intervention of humane Liberty, to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Will of the first Cause. And,
<hi>2</hi>dly. (which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself likewise in his
<hi>Leviathan</hi> admits) that from the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Inquisition into these Causes, and
from the Powers, and Operations of natural
Bodies, may be discovered the Existence of
one Eternal, Infinite, Omnipotent Being, which
we call God.</p>
            <p>So that every Motion impress'd upon the
Organs of our Senses, whereby the Mind is
carried on to apprehend things without us,
and to give a right Iudgment upon them, is a
natural Effect; which by the Mediation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferiour Causes, owes its Original to the
<pb facs="tcp:53522:19"/>
first Cause. From whence it follows, that God
by these natural Motions of Causes, and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
delineates the Idea's, or Images of all
natural and moral Actions on our Minds; And
that the same God, after he hath thus made
us draw various Notions, from the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
does then excite us to compare them
with each other, and then joyn them together,
and so determines us to form true Propositions
of the things, thus singly received and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
So that sometimes a thing is exposed
whole, and all at once to our View, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is more naturally considered successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
or according to its several parts; And
the Mind thereby perceives that the Notion of
awhole, signifies the same, with that of all the
several Idea's of the particular parts put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so is thence carried on to make a
Proposition of the Identity of the whole,
with all its parts. And can truly affirm, that
the same Causes, which preserve the whole,
must also conserve all its constituent parts;
and then from a diligent Contemplation of all
these Propositions, (which may justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the Title of the more general Laws of
Nature;) we may observe, that they are all
reduceable to one Proposition; from whose fit,
and just Explication, all the Limits, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
under which the particular Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are proposed, may be sought for, and
<pb facs="tcp:53522:19"/>
discovered, as from the Evidence of that one
Proposition, which may be reduced into this, or
the like Sence, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The endeavour as far
as we are able of the common good of the
whole System of Rational Beings conduces, as
far as lies in our Power to the good of all its
several Parts or Members, in which our own
Felicity is also contained as part thereof;
Whereas the Acts opposite to this Endeavour,
do bring along with them Effects quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
thereunto, and will certainly procure our
own Ruine, or Misery at last. Therefore the
whole Summ of this Proposition, may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to these three Things. <hi>1.</hi> That which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Matter of it, to wit, the Knowledge
of its Terms drawn from the Nature of Things.
<hi>2.</hi> Its form, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Connexion of those
Terms contained in this practical Proposition,
and particularly such, which because of the
Rewards, and Punishments annexed to them,
may make it deserve to be called a Divine,
Natural Law, as proceeding from God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of Nature. Or, <hi>3.</hi> The Deduction of
all other natural Laws from this, as their
Foundation, and Original, from that Respect,
or Proportion they bear to the common Good, or
happiest State of the whole aggregate Body of
Rational Beings.</p>
            <p>But as to the Explication of the Terms
of this Proposition: I hope the Reader will
<pb facs="tcp:53522:20"/>
not be scandaliz'd, that we attribute Reason
to God, and have reckoned him as the Head
of Rational Beings, since we do not thereby
mean, that Sort of Reason which consists in
deducing Conclusions from prior Propositions,
but rather that absolute Omniscience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Wisdom, which we understand to be in
God, which <hi>Cicero</hi> himself could not better
describe, than by the Name of <hi>Adulta Ratio;</hi>
or, <hi>the most perfect Reason.</hi> And if we
Mortals can know, or apprehend any aright,
thing of him, it is as we do partake of some
part, though in an infinitely lower Degree of
that only true Knowledge, and Vnderstanding.
So that if we can once rightly judge, that the
common Good of Rational Beings, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of all others; it is no doubt true, and no
otherwise true, than as it is so apprehended
by the Divine Intellect; As when it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to us, that the three Angles of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,
are equal to two right ones, no doubt,
but the Deity it self, had before the same Idea
of it. So likewise if we have affirmed, that
we can contribute any thing to the good, and
happiness of rational Beings, by our Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
towards them, and so may seem to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that there is a certain good common to
us, and the Deity<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and which we may some way
serve to promote: We desire to be understood
not as if we imagin'd, that by our testifying
<pb facs="tcp:53522:20"/>
our Love, and Honour towards God, in any
internal, or external Acts of Worship; we
could add, or contribute any thing to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Happiness, and Perfections; but only as
judging it more gratefull, and agreeable to his
Nature, if by our Deeds we express our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and Obedience to him, by imitating him
in our Care of the common good of Mankind,
than if we deny his Being, or blaspheme his
Attributes, and violate, or contemn his Laws:
So likewise, if in our Thoughts, Words and
Actions, we express our Worship, and Love
towards him, we doubt not but it is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and agreeable to his Divine Nature,
than if by the contrary Actions we should
signifie our neglect, or hatred of him.
For if we abstractively compare any two rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Natures together, we must acknowledge a
greater Similitude, when one of them agrees,
and co-operates with the other, than if we
should suppose a Disagreement or Discord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, or that the End or Design inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the one should be crossed, or opposed by
the other. Neither do I see what can hinder,
but that the same may be affirmed, if one of
these rational Natures be supposed to be God,
and the other only Man. Therefore, as it is
known by our common Sense, that it is more
gratefull to any Man to be beloved, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
than to be hated, and contemned. So
<pb facs="tcp:53522:21"/>
it may be found by a manifest Analogy of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that it is more gratefull to God, the
Head of rational Beings to be belov'd, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
by the Service and Worship of us Men,
than to be hated, and contemned. For as
the Desire of being beloved argueth no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in us; so likewise in God, it is
so far from giving the least Suspicion thereof,
that on the contrary, it rather argues his
Goodness, since our Natures are perfected, to
the highest Degree they are capable of, by
our Love to him, and Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
So that, when we speak of any Good,
common to us with the Divine Nature, it is
only to be understood Analogically; for those
things which we perceive to conserve, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
our own Nature we call gratefull to us,
that is, as they render the Mind pleased, and
full of Ioy, Pleasure, and Satisfaction: And
though we confess we cannot contribute any
thing to the infinite Perfection of the Deity,
Yet since this Ioy, or Complacency proceeding
from our Love, and Service towards him may
be conceived without any Imperfection, they I
think may be safely attributed to his Divine
Nature, and look'd upon as a sort of good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
by us for him, since God esteems our
Love, and Service as the only Tribute we can
pay him, and therefore he hath inseparably
annexed the highest Rewards to this Love of
<pb facs="tcp:53522:21"/>
himself (as shall be proved in this following
Discourse) which certainly he would never
have done, unless it had been his Will, that
we should thus love, and worship him. So that
though I grant, that the Divine Good or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
is not at all advanced by our Worship
of him; yet will not this at all derogate from
our definition of endeavouring the Common good
of Rational Beings, which may be made out by
these following Considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That all Rational Beings, or Agents are,
and must be considered together, as naturally,
and necessarily constituting one intellectual
System, or Society; because they agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to prosecute one chief End, <hi>Viz.</hi> The
good of the Vniverse, or World, especially of
that intellectual System; by the fittest Means
applicable to that End since, whilst they are
truly rational, they cannot differ in judging
what is that best End; nor avoid chusing the
same necessary Means, leading thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That although God, the Head of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
System, be indeed uncapable of any
Addition to his infinite Happiness, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
yet the whole System (in as much as it
includes all finite rational Beings) is capable
of Improvement in these its finite parts, which
Improvement God cannot only desire, but ever
did, and will promote both by his own Power, as
also by that of all subordinate voluntary Agents,
<pb facs="tcp:53522:22"/>
whereby God's Essential Goodness becomes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to us: And the good of the whole
System may reasonably be judged as grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or pleasing to God the head thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it can add nothing to himself: thus in
Embryons all the other Members daily grow,
and improve, after the Head or Brain is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have attained its full bigness.</p>
            <p>These voluntary, or free Actions of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Agents, when they concur with God's
wisdom and goodness, are naturally and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
known to be more pleasing (as being rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him) than malevolent Actions opposite
to this chief end, which fight both against God
and Men; nor does the consideration of God's
rewarding such good Actions, imply any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Divine Perfections. So that our
Benevolence towards God, and consequently,
our worship of him, is but our free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
that he naturally, and essentially
is (what he ever was and will be) the same
infinite, good, and wise Disposer, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the whole System of rational Beings;
and this our benevolence by giving him Glory,
Love, Reverence, and Obedience fulfils all the
Duties of humanity towards those of our own
kind, which answers both the Tables of the
moral, or natural Law; and in this consent
of our minds with the divine Intellect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
that compleat harmony of the Vniverse
of intellectual Beings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:22"/>The great influence of these Principles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the parts of natural Religion, may be
more fully express'd and made out; by these
following considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The voluntary acknowledgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of our minds to the Perfections of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature and Actions, include the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and concurrence of our chief Faculties,
<hi>viz.</hi> The understanding, and will, therewith;
and moreover, naturally excite all our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to comply with them, and so strongly dispose
us in our future Life, and Actions, to compose
our selves to the imitation thereof, to the utmost
of our Abilities; particularly these Principles
naturally produce in us. First, Praises, and
Thanksgivings to God, private and publick,
for goods already done to our selves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
wherein the Essence of Prayer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Hence also arise Hope, Affiance, or
Trust in God, which I willingly acknowledge
is fullest of assurance, when founded not only
on observations, or past experience of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
but hath also revealed promises
annex'd, relating to future Good. 3. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
when our Acknowledgment, and high
esteem of the divine Attributes move us to
the imitation thereof, we must needs thereby
arise to those high degrees of Charity, or the
endeavour of the greatest publick good which
<pb facs="tcp:53522:23"/>
we observe in God to prosecute, and such
Charity imports not only exact Iustice to all,
but that overflowing bounty, tenderness and
sympathy with others, beyond which humane
Nature cannot arrive; because these not only
harmoniously consent with the like Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in God, but also co-operate with him, to
the improvement of the finite parts of the
rational System, whereof he is the infinite,
yet Sympathizing head, who declares he takes
all that is done to the Members of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Society, as done to himself.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I profess my self to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this Sympathy, or compassion in God in
such a Sence only, as it is understood in Holy
Writ, for that infinite concern for the good
of his best Creatures, which is contained in
his infinite goodness, and is a real perfection
of his Nature, not implying any mistake of
others for himself, nor any capacity of being
lessened or hurt by the power of any mans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
but yet fully answers, (nay infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds)
that solicitous care, and concern for the
good of others, which Charity and Compassion
work in the best of men.</p>
            <p>In short, if the Reader will take the pains
to peruse the Three first Chapters of this
Discourse, he will find, that we have, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the terms of this Proposition, not only
given a bare interpretation of Words, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:53522:23"/>
have proposed the true Notions, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of those things, from whence they are
taken; as far as is necessary for our purpose,
and may observe that by one, and the same
labour we have directly, and immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
the Power, and necessity of those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions, which are required to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Happiness of all men, and also to the
private good, and necessity of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Altho' it seemed most convenient to use
such general words, which may in some Sence
be attributed to the Divine Majesty, and to
have done it with that Design, that by the
help of this Analogy thus supposed, not only
our obligation to Piety and Vertue, but also
the Nature of Divine Iustice, and Dominion
may be from hence better understood.</p>
            <p>But as for what concerns the form of this
Proposition it is evident, that it is wholly
practical, as that which determines concerning
the certain effects of humane Actions. But it
is also to be noted, that altho' the words, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi>
or <hi>renders,</hi> in either of these Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
are put in the present Tense; Yet it is
not limited to any time present, but abstracts
from it: And because its truth doth chiefly
depend upon the Identity of the whole, with
the parts; it is as plainly true of all future
time, and is as often used by us in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with respect to future, as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:53522:24"/>
Actions. And therefore this Proposition
is more fit for our purpose, because built upon
no particular Hypothesis; for it doth not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
men born in a Civil State, nor yet out
of it, neither see any Kindred or Relation to
be among men, as derived from the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Parents, as we are taught by the Holy
Scriptures; since the obligation of the Laws
of Nature is to be demonstrated to those who
do not yet acknowledge them: Neither on the
other side doth it suppose, (as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth
in his <hi>de Cive</hi>) a great many men already
grown, and sprung up out of the Earth like
Mushrooms; But our Proposition, and all those
things which we have deduced from it, might
have been understood, and acknowledged by
the first Parents of mankind, if they had only
considered themselves together with God, and
their Posterity which was to come into the
world. Neither may it less easily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
and admitted by those Nations, which
have not yet heard of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither may it be amiss to observe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Sence of this Proposition, that in the
same words in which the Cause of the greatest,
and best effect is laid down, there is also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in short the means to the chiefest
end, because the effect of a rational Agent,
after it is conceived in its mind, and that it
hath determined to bestow its endeavours
<pb facs="tcp:53522:24"/>
in producing it, is called the <hi>End,</hi> and the
Acts, or Causes by which it endeavours to
effect it, are called the <hi>means;</hi> and from this
observation, may be shown a true method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
all those things which Moral Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
have spoken about the means to the best
end, into natural Theorems concerning the
Power of humane Actions, in producing such
Effects; and in this form, they may more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be examined whether they are true, or not,
and may be more evidently demonstrated so to
be; and also we may hence learn by the like
Reason, how easily all true knowledge of the
force of those natural Causes, which we may
any way apply to our use, does suggest fit Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
for the attaining of the end intended, and
so may be applyed to Practice according to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
Lastly, from thence it appears, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these Propositions, which we have now
laid down, do so far approach to the nature
of a Law, as they respect an end truly worthy
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The common good of all rational
Beings; or else (if you please to word it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
the Honour, or Worship of God, conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the common Good, and Happiness of
mankind.</p>
            <p>And tho' it doth not yet appear, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is a Law, because the Lawgiver is not yet
mentioned, nevertheless I doubt not but you will
find in the Body of this Discourse, that it hath all
<pb facs="tcp:53522:25"/>
things necessary to render it so, <hi>viz.</hi> God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as a Legislator, and his Will or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
sufficiently declared to us, as a Law
from the very constitution of our Natures,
as also of other things without us; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
established by sufficient Rewards, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
both in this life, and the next; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we suppose it can be more evidently
proved, that God is the Author of all things,
than that he is also the Author of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
concerning the common good of rational
Beings, or concerning his own Honour, and
Worship conjoyned with the common Good of
mankind: And tho' I confess we have been
more exact, and have dwelt longer upon the
Rewards, that we may expect from the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Law, than upon the Punishments,
which are appointed for the breach of it; and
tho' I know the <hi>Civilians</hi> have rather placed
the Sanction of Civil Laws in Punishments,
than Rewards; yet I hope we have not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
tho' we a little deviate from their Sense,
and make it part of the Sanction of this Law,
that it is established by Rewards, as well as
Punishments; since it seems more agreeable to
the Nature of things, whose foot-steps are
strictly to be followed, to consider the positive
Idea's of Causes, and Effects in our minds, and
which do not receive either Negations, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
by our outward Senses; and our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb facs="tcp:53522:25"/>
ought rather to be moved by the Love,
or Hopes, of a present, or future Good; than
by the Fear, or hatred of the contrary Evil:
For as no man is said to Love, Life, Health, and
those grateful motions of the Nerves, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which are called corporeal Pleasures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he may avoid Death, Sickness, or Pain;
but rather from their own intrinsick Goodness,
or Agreeableness with our humane Natures;
so likewise no rational Man desires the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the mind, to wit, the more ample
and distinct knowledge of the most noble Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the most happy State of rational Beings,
can only give him; and all this, not only that he<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
may avoid the mischiefs of Ignorance, Envy, and
Malevolence; but because of that great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
which he finds by experience to spring
from such vertuous Actions, and Habits, and
which render it most ungrateful to us, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of them; and so the Causes also of such
Privations are judg'd highly grievous, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome:
From whence it also appears, that even
Civil Laws themselves, when they are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Punishments, <hi>(e. g.)</hi> by the fear of
Death, or loss of Goods, (if we consider the
thing truly) do indeed force men to yield o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to them from the love of Life, or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
which they find can only be preserved
by their observation. So that the avoiding of
Death, and Poverty is but in other words, love
<pb facs="tcp:53522:26"/>
of Life, and Riches; as he who by two Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
would say he would not want Life, means
no more, but that he desires to enjoy it: To
which we may likewise add, that Civil Laws
themselves ought to be considered from the
end which the Law-makers regard in making
them, as also which all good Subjects design in
observing them; to wit, the publick Good of
the Commonwealth (part of which is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to all of them in particular, and so brings
with it a natural Reward of their obedience,)
rather than from the Punishments they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
by whose fear some only are deterred from
violating them; and those of the worst, and
most wicked sort of Men.</p>
            <p>But tho' we have shewn, that the Sum of
all the Precepts or Laws of Nature, as also
of the Sanctions annexed to them, are briefly
contained in this Proposition; yet its Subject,
is still but an endeavour to the utmost of our
Power, of the common Good of the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem
of rational Beings, this limitation of the
utmost of our Power implies, that we do not
think our selves capable of adding any thing
to the Divine Perfections which we willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be beyond our Power. So that here
is at once exprest both our Love towards God,
and Good will to mankind, who are the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
parts of this System. But the Predicate of
this Proposition is, that which conduces to the
<pb facs="tcp:53522:26"/>
good of all its singular Parts, or Members, and in
which our own Happiness, is contained as one part
thereof. Since all those good things, which we
can do for others, are but the Effects of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour:
so that the Sum of all those Goods
(of which also our own Felicity consists) can
never be mist of either in this Life, or a better,
as the Reward of our obedience thereunto. So
to the contrary Actions, Misery in this Life,
or in that to come, are the Punishments natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
due. But the Connexion of the Predicate
with the Subject, is both the Foundation of the
truth of this Proposition; and also a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the natural Connexion, between this
obedience, and the Rewards, as also between
the Transgression, and the Punishments.</p>
            <p>From whence the Readers will easily observe,
the true Reason for which this practical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and all others which may be drawn
from thence, do oblige all rational Creatures to
know, and understand it; whilst other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
(suppose Geometrical ones) tho' found
out by right Reason, and so are Truths proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God himself, yet do not oblige men
to any Act, or Practice pursuant to them; but
may be safely neglected by most Men, to whom
the Science of Geometry may not be necessary;
whereas the Effects of the endeavour of the
common Good, do intimately concern the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of all mankind, (upon whose joynt or
<pb facs="tcp:53522:27"/>
concurrent Wills, and Endeavours, every single
mans Happiness doth after some sort depend)
so that this Endeavour, can by no means be
neglected without endangering the losing all
those hopes of Happiness, which God hath
made known to us, from our own Nature and the
Nature of things; and so hath sufficiently declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Connexion of Rewards and Punishments,
with all our Moral Actions, from whose Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well this general Proposition, as all others,
which are contained in it, must be understood
to become Laws.</p>
            <p>So that from the terms of this Proposition,
it is apparent, that the adequate, and immediate
effect of our thus acting, and concerning which
this Law is established; is whatever is grateful
to God, and beneficial to Men, that is, the natural
Good of all the parts of the whole System of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings; Nay further, is the greatest of all
Goods, which we can imagine, or perform for
them; since it is greater than the like good
of any particular part, or Member of the same
System. And farther, it is thereby sufficiently
declared, that the Felicity of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
is derived from this happy State of the
whole System; as the Nutrition of any one
Member of an Animal is produced by a due Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
of the whole Mass of Blood diffused
through all the parts of the Body. From
whence it appears, that this Effect must needs
<pb facs="tcp:53522:27"/>
be the best, since it shews us, that not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Felicity of any single Man is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
end of God the Legislator, or ought to be
so of any one, who will truly obey his Will;
and by a Parity of reason it also appears, that
those humane Actions, which from their own
natural force, and Efficacy are apt to promote
the common Good, are certainly better, than
those which do only serve the private Good of
any one Man, and that by the same proportion, as
a common Good is greater than a private: So
likewise those Actions, which take the nearest
way to attain this effect as an End, are called
Right, because of their natural Similitude with
a right or straight line, which is always the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
between the two Terms. But the same
Actions, when compared with a Natural, or
positive Law, as a rule of Life, or Manners,
and are found conformable to it, are called
morally good, and also right; that is, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Rule, but the Rule it self is called
right, or straight, as it shews the nearest way to
the End. But I shall referr you for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Explication of these things, to what we
have farther said concerning them in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
its self, especially in the Second part,
wherein we prove against Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Principle,
that there is a true Natural, and Moral Good
antecedent to Civil Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:28"/>But however, it may not be amiss to give
you in short the method which we take to
prove, that this Law of endeavouring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good, is really and indeed, and not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically
a Law. <hi>1.</hi> This general Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being premised, That all particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who can either promote or oppose this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good are parts of that whole Body of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which is either preserved, or prejudiced
by their endeavours. We shall not now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the particular Proofs as they are drawn
from the Causes of such Actions of which we
have partly treated in the Chapter of humane
Nature, and partly from their natural Effects
and Consequences, of which we have largely
discoursed, in the Chapter of the Obligation
of the Law of Nature; as also in the Second
part in our Observation on Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Principles;
all which may nevertheless be reduced to these
plain Propositions. <hi>1.</hi> As I have observed it
is manifest, that our Felicity, or highest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is essentially connected by God the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator,
with the most full, and constant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of our natural Powers employed about the
noblest Objects, and greatest Effects they can be
capable of as proportioned to them; from
whence it may be gathered, that all men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with these Faculties are naturally obliged
under the penalty of losing, or missing of this
their Happiness, to exercise those Powers about
<pb facs="tcp:53522:28"/>
the worthiest Objects, <hi>(viz.)</hi> God, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Nor can it be long doubted, whether our
Faculties may be more happily exercised in
maintaining Friendship, or Enmity with them;
for I, think it is certain, there can be no Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
State in which God and Men, can neither
be beloved, nor hated; or in which we can
stand so far Neuters, as neither to do things
gratefull, nor ungratefull to them. But if
it be granted, that there is a manifest Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
(if we will be truly happy) of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Amity both with God and Men,
here is thereby presently declared the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this general Law of Nature, which
we are now enquiring into, for this alone esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes
all Natural Religion, and also all those
things, which are necessary to the Happiness
and preservation of Mankind, which are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Piety towards God, <hi>1.</hi> A peaceable
Commerce and Agreement of divers Nations,
which are treated of by the Law of Nations,
which is but a Branch or subordinate Member
of this great Law of Nature. <hi>2.</hi> The Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and Conservation of a Civil Society, or
Common-wealth, which is the Scope of all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Laws. And, <hi>3.</hi> The Continuance of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
Relations, and private Friendships,
concerning which the general Rules of Ethicks,
as also the more particular ones of Oeconomies do
prescribe. And therefore, we have put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:53522:29"/>
many things in the Chapter of humane
Nature, by which all particular Persons of
sound Minds are some way rendred capable of
so large a Society, and are either more nearly,
or remotely disposed to it. And we do here
intreat the Reader, that he will not consider
those things, each of them singly, or apart, but
all together; since from all of them conjoyned,
he may raise a sufficient Argument to prove the
Existence, and evince the Sanction of this most
general Law of Nature, and that Men will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
fail of their Happiness, which chiefly
consists in the Adequate, or proper Exercise of
their rational Faculties, unless they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
them in cultivating this Amity, or Love
both with God, and Men; to which Ends they
are before all other Animals particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted.</p>
            <p>But from the Effects of such Actions condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the Common good of Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
we have also further shewn in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Obligation of the Laws of Nature,
that this Sanction by sufficient Rewards, and
Punishments, is most commonly connected with
such Actions. And it is manifest, that in the
first place God, as the best and wisest of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings is to be loved, and honoured by
such Actions or Endeavours, as that the Goods,
and Fortunes of all innocent Persons of what
Nation soever, are thereby secured as far as
<pb facs="tcp:53522:29"/>
lies in our Power, and all things profitable for
particular Persons, procured according to the
Proportion they bear to the good of the whole
Body of Mankind; so that this Law will not
permit any thing to be done, which the Care
of the whole doth not allow: Nor can any thing
be supposed more worthy a rational Creature, and
from whence greater Effects can proceed, than a
Will always propeuse towards the good of this
whole Body governed by the Conduct of a Right
Vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>Therefore, since it can certainly be foreknown,
that such Effects will follow from this Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
no Man can be ignorant that all the Ioys,
and present Comforts of true Piety, are therein
contained, together with the hopes of a blessed
Immortality, besides those many Conveniencies of
Peace, and commerce with those of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and all those Emoluments both of Civil,
and Domestick Government, and private
Friendships which are connected with this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
as the common Rewards thereof, and
which cannot by any Means within our
Power be otherwise obtained. So that, he who
neglects the Care of the Common good, doth
also reject the true Causes of his own Felicity,
and embraces those of his Misery, as a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to his Folly. In short, since it is
manifest from the Nature of things, that the
highest Happiness which we can procure for our
<pb facs="tcp:53522:30"/>
selves, proceeds from our Care both of Piety
to God, and Love and Peace with Men. And
that the Endeavour of these can only be found
in his Soul, who truly studieth the common
Good of all Rational Beings, it is also evident,
that the greatest Rewards, that any one can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
are necessarily connected with this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
and that the Loss, or Deprivation
of this Felicity, doth necessarily adhere as a
Punishment to the opposite Actions. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of these, which declares the true Causes of
all that Felicity, which particular Persons can
thereby obtain, we have proved from Natural
Effects found by Experience. The latter, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
that Piety to God, and Charity or Benevolence
towards all Men, are contained in the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the common Good; and we have also
proved in the fourth Chapter, that all Vertues,
both private and publick, are contained in this
Endeavour.</p>
            <p>But because the Connexion of Rewards and
Punishments, which follow those Acts which are
for the common Good, or opposite to it, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
obscured by those Evils which often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
good Men, and those good Things which
too frequently happen to Evil ones, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to our Purpose to shew, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all these the Connexion between them
is so sufficiently constant, and manifest in the
Nature of things, that from thence may be
<pb facs="tcp:53522:30"/>
certainly gathered the Sanction of the Law of
Nature, commanding the former, and prohibiting
the latter Actions. And we may suppose those
Punishments to suffice for its Sanction, which,
(all things rightly weighed) much exceed the
Gain that may arise from any Act done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this Law. But in comparing of the
Effects which do follow good Actions on one
hand, and Evil ones on the other those good,
or evil Things ought not to be reckoned in to
the Account, which either cannot be acquired, or
avoided by any humane Prudence, or Industry;
such as are those which proceeding from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Necessity of External Causes, may happen
to any one by mere Chance, which are wont to
fall out alike, both to good and bad. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we shall only take those into our Account,
which may be foreseen and prevented by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Foresight, as some way depending upon
our own Wills or Acts.</p>
            <p>But I must also acknowledge, that these Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
do not all depend upon our own particular
Powers, but many of them do also proceed from
the good Will and Endeavours of other Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals;
yet since it may be known from their
Natures, as they are, is agreeable to our own,
that the common Good is the best, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
End which they can propose to themselves,
and that their Natural Reason requires that
they should act for an End, and rather for this
<pb facs="tcp:53522:31"/>
than any other less good, or less perfect: And
that it is moreover known by Experience, that
such Effects of Vniversal Benevolence, may be
for the most part obtained from others, by our
own benevolent Actions; it is just that those
Effects should be numbred or esteemed among
those Consequences, which do for the most part
so fall out, because every Man is esteemed able
to do whatever he can perform, or obtain by
the Assistance of others. So that the whole
Reward which is connected to good Actions, by
the natural Constitution of Things, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like those Tributes of which the publick
Revenues consist, which do not only arise out of
constant Rents, but also out of divers contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Payments, such as Custom, or Excise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Commodities, whose value, although it be
very great, yet is not always certain, though
they are often farmed out, at a certain Rate.
Therefore in the reckoning up of these Rewards,
not only those parts thereof ought to come into
Account, which immutably adhere to good
Actions, such as are that Happiness, which
consists in the Knowledge and Love of God,
and good Men, the absolute Government of our
Passions, the sweet Harmony, and Agreement
betwixt the true Principles of our Actions, and
all the parts of our Lives, the Favour of the
Deity, and the Hopes of a blessed Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
proceeding from all these: But there ought
<pb facs="tcp:53522:31"/>
also to be taken into the Account, all those
Goods, which do, (though contingently) adhere
to them, and which may either happen to us
from the good Will of others, or flow from that
Concord, and Society, which is either main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
between divers Nations, or those of the
same Common-wealth; and which we do as far
as we are able, procure for our selves by such
benevolent Actions. And by the like Reason,
we may also understand of what particulars all
that Misery, or those Punishments may consist,
which is connected with those Acts, that are
hurtfull to the common Good.</p>
            <p>So that all of us may learn from the Necessity
of the Condition in which we are born, and
live, to esteem contingent Goods; and to be
drawn to act by the Hopes of them; for the
Air it self, which is so necessary for our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
and Preservation doth not always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
our Bloud, or Spirits, but is sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with deadly Steams, and Vapours: Nor
can our Meat, Drink or Exercise always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our Lives, but do often generate Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And Agriculture it self doth not always
pay the Husband-man's Toyl with the expected
Gain, but sometimes he even loses by it. And
sure we are not less naturally drawn to the
Endeavour of the common Good, than we are to
such natural Actions from the Hope of a Good,
that may but probably proceed from them. But
<pb facs="tcp:53522:32"/>
how justly we may hope for a considerable Return
from all others, joyntly considered, for all our
Labours bestowed upon the common Good; we
shall be able to make the best Account of, when
we consider what our own Experience, and the
History of all Nations for the time past, may
teach us to have befallen those who have either
regarded, or despised this great End.</p>
            <p>But because the whole Endeavour of this
common Good, contains no more but the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Deity, the Care of Fidelity, Peace,
and Commerce betwixt Nations, and the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting,
and maintaining Government both Civil
and Domestick, as also particular Friendships,
as the parts thereof taken together, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that the Endeavour thereof exprest by
a mutual Love and Assistance must in some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
be found among all Nations, as necessary to
their own Happiness and Preservation: Nay,
it seems farther manifest to me, that those who
attain but to the Age of Manhood do owe all
those past Years, much more to the Endeavour
of others bestowed upon the common Good, than
to their own Care, which in their tender Age
was almost none at all. For we then do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
depend upon, and owe our Preservation
to that Obedience, which others yield as well
to Oeconomical Precepts, as to all Laws both
Civil and Religious, which do wholly proceed
from this Care of the common Good. Whereas
<pb facs="tcp:53522:32"/>
it is certain, that if afterwards we expose our
Lives to danger, Yea, if we lose them for the
publick Good, we should lose far less for its
sake, than we did before receive from it; for
we do then only lose the uncertain Hopes of
future Enjoyments, whereas it is certain that
scarce so much as the Hope of them can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to particular Persons where the common
Good is destroyed, for we have thence received
the real Possession of all those Contentments of
Life, with which we are blest: And therefore
we are bound in Gratitude, as well as by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
to return those again whenever they are
lawfully required of us; though I grant (for
the Honour of the Gospel) that the firmest
Encouragements, and greatest Reward we Men
can have for exposing, nay, losing our Lives
for the Benefit, or Service of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
is that Happiness we may justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
in another Life after this.</p>
            <p>These things seem evident to us, as resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
that Method whereby we are naturally
taught, that the Health, and Strength of our
whole Body is preserved by the good Estate of
its particular Members, in its receiving Food,
and Breath: Although sometimes Diseases
may breed within the Body, or divers outward
Accidents (as Wounds, Bruises, and the like)
do happen to it from without, which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:53522:33"/>
the particular Members from receiving
that Nourishment, which is necessary for them:
And we are taught after the same Manner
by the Acts, immediately promoting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, that the Happiness of particular
Men, (which are the Members of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
System) may no less certainly be expected,
nor are less naturally derived from thence,
than the Strength of our Hands doth proceed
from the due State of the whole Mass of Bloud,
and nervous Iuice: Though we confess that
many things may happen, which may cause
this general Care of the whole Body of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
not always to meet with the good Effect
we desire; so that particular Persons may
certainly, infallibly enjoy all the Felicity they
can hope for, or expect: Yet this is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against it, any more than that the taking
in of Air, and Aliments, (however necessary
for the whole Body) should prevent all those
Accidents, and Distempers it is subject to,
since it may happen as well by the violent, and
unjust Actions of our fellow Subjects, (like the
diseased Constitution of some inward part) or
by the Invasion of a foreign Enemy (like a
Blow, or other outward Violence) that good
Men may be deprived in this Life of some
Rewards of their good Deeds, and may also
suffer divers outward Evils; Yet since these
<pb facs="tcp:53522:33"/>
are more often repelled by the Force of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and Civil Government, or are often
shook off after some short Disturbances, either
by our own private Power, or else by that of
the Civil Sword, as Diseases are thrown off by
a healthfull Crisis, or Effort of Nature. So
that notwithstanding all these Evils, Men are
more often recompenced with greater Goods,
partly from the Assistance of others, but chiefly
from that of Civil Government, or else of
Leagues made with Neighbouring States:
From whence it is that Mankind hath never
been yet destroyed; notwithstanding all the
Tyranny and Wars, that Men's unreasonable
Passions have exercised, and raised in the
World, and that Civil Governments, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
have been more lasting than the most
long lived Animals. From all which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that the deprived Appetites of divers
Men, or those Passions which do often produce
Motions so opposite to the common Good, ought
no more to hinder us from acknowledging the
Natural Propensions of all the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
(considered together) to be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
carried towards that which we every
Day see may be procured thereby, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The
Conservation and farther Perfection of the
whole Body of Mankind, than that divers
Diseases breeding in the parts of Animals, or
any outward Violence should hinder us from
<pb facs="tcp:53522:34"/>
acknowledging, that the Frame of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the Natural Function of their parts
are fitted, and intended by God, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Life, and the Propagation of
their Species.</p>
            <p>But that we may carry on this Similitude,
(between a living Body and its particular
Members, with the whole Body of Mankind,
and all the Individuals contained under it,)
a little farther, I will here give you <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Pascal</hi>'s Excellent Notion concerning this
common Good, as it is published in
those Fragments, <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Chap. des Pensees Morales.</hi>
               </note> Entituled, <hi>Les
Pensees de Monsieur Pascal,</hi> since
it both explains and confirms our
Method. <q>He there supposes, That God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made the Heavens, and the Earth, and
divers other Creatures, not at all sensible
of their common Happiness, would also make
some rational Beings which might know him,
and might make up one Body consisting of
rational Members; and that all Men are
Members of this Body, so that it is necessary
to their happiness, that all particular Men, as
Members of this Body, conform their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Wills to the Vniversal Will of God,
that governs the whole Body, as the Head or
Soul thereof. And though it often happens,
that one Man falsly supposes himself an
independent Being, and so will make himself
<pb facs="tcp:53522:34"/>
the only Centre of all his Actions; yet he will
at last find himself whilst in this State, (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Body of rational Beings,
and who not having any true Principle of
Life, or Motion, doth nothing but wander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout)
distracted in the uncertainty of his own
Being; but if ever he comes to a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of himself, he will find, that he is not
that whole Body, but only a small Member of
it, and hath no proper Life, and Motion,
but as he is a part thereof: So that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
our Self-love, every Man ought to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
himself, but one small part of this Body
of Mankind, composed of so many intelligent
Members, and to know what Proportion of
Love every Man oweth himself, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what Degree of Love the Body bears
to any one small single part, and so much
Love, that part (if it had sense) ought to
bestow upon it self, and no more: All Self-love
that exceeds this is unjust.</q> So far this
sagacious contemplative Gentleman thought
long since, though I confess he doth not proceed
to shew in what manner the Good of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Person depends upon the Happiness
of the whole Body of Mankind, as our Author
hath here done; though no doubt, he was
excellently well fitted to do it, if he had
lived to reduce those excellent Thoughts, into
a set Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:35"/>We have delivered in this Epitome the
Summ of that Method, by which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into the Sanction of the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in which we have considered all the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
naturally flowing from good Actions, as a
Reward annexed to them by God the Author of
Nature, and their Loss, or contrary Evils that
follow them, as a Punishment naturally flowing
from their Transgression: And indeed, our
Method seems very much confirmed from the
common Consent of Mankind, since all Men,
of however different Opinions concerning mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Principles, do yet agree in this, that
good Actions ought still to be encouraged by
Rewards, and evil ones to be restrained by
Punishments; in this all Sects of Philosophers,
however quarrelling among themselves, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
As also the Founders of all Religions,
and the Makers of all Civil Laws, have made
this their main Foundation; Nay, those, who
would seem most to neglect all Rewards, and
would deduce all Vertues from Gratitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
yet find it necessary to acknowledge this
Gratitude to proceed from the Memory of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
receiv'd: But sure it still argues as
much Love towards ourselves, when we are
persuaded to do our Duty by a Consideration
of Benefits already received, as when we do it
for the same things to be received hereafter;
<pb facs="tcp:53522:35"/>
yea, he seems to act more generously, who is
moved to act for a good only in expectation,
than he who doth as much for the like good
things, which he already enjoys.</p>
            <p>But this Method which we have here taken
to reduce all the Laws of Nature to this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Proposition of endeavouring the common
Good, seems the more convenient, because its
proof is more easie, and expedite than that
of so many Rules, which are wont to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by Philosophers, and the Memory will be
less burdened by the daily Remembrance of
this one Proposition, than of many; especially
when we are directed to it from the Nature
of this common Good, as a Measure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Iudgment of any considering Man,
may put Bounds to his own Actions, and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in the doing of which all Moral Virtue
consists. And this Work <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to the Iudgment of every rational
Man in his Definition of Vertue, though he
hath not indeed shewn us the Rule of making
this Iudgment; whereas our Proposition tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us, that the Rule is to be taken from the
Nature of the best, and greatest End; that is,
Respect being had to all the parts of the whole
System of rational Beings, or of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of which God is the Head, and all the
Members are his Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:36"/>And from this Principle is also to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that Order, or Preference among all the
particular Laws of Nature, according to
which, the former doth still retain, or limit
the latter, which Dr. <hi>Sharrock</hi> hath pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and solidly observed in his Book <hi>De
Officiis,</hi> Chap. 10. As for Example, that there
is a Prior Reason for abstaining from invading
that which is anothers, than of observing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
and likewise there is a greater Account
to be made of Faith once given, than of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
Benefits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the true Ground of
all these Rules is only to be found in our
Principle, because it more conduces to the
common Good, that a Prior Law of Nature
concerning making, and preserving Properties
should not be violated by the Invasion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Right, than that any one should observe
a Compact, or Promise, when it cannot be done
without such an Invasion; and there is the like
Reason in observing those other Laws, which we
have reckoned up in the following Discourse,
according to their due Order and Dignity:
so that indeed no Man ought to wonder, that
we have so positively asserted, that no Vertue
can be explained without a Respect to the
State of all rational Beings, or of the whole
intellectual World; for we see in Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
that the Accidents of Bodies daily
<pb facs="tcp:53522:36"/>
obvious to our Senses, such as are the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of Motion, Gravitation, and the Action
of Light and Heat, Firmness and Fluidity,
Rarefaction and Condensation, can never be
explained, without a Respect to the whole System
of the corporeal World, and the Motion therein
to be preserved: Lastly, from this order among
the Laws of Nature, whereby all the special ones
are still made subordinate to this general one
of the common Good, and the lowest of them
to the highest, it may easily be shewn that God
never dispenses with them, unless in those
Cases, in which the Obligation of a lower,
or less Law, may seem to be taken away, and
the nature of the Action so changed, as that
there may be only place left for the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the higher.</p>
            <p>To conclude, we have here likewise shewn,
that the Generation of all Commonwealths is
to be deduced from these two Principles, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this great End of the common Good of
Rationals, <hi>viz. first</hi>; from that which Commands
the Constitution of a distinct Property in
things, and in the labours, or endeavours
of Persons, whereby no such Property is yet
instituted, and where it is found to be so, to
preserve it inviolate, as the chief and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Medium to this common Good. <hi>2.</hi> From
that Law which Commands a peculiar Love,
<pb facs="tcp:53522:37"/>
or Benevolence of Parents towards their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
for this could never have exerted it
self, unless our first Parents had permitted
their Children when grown up, to enjoy a part
of those necessaries of Life, which were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for their future Subsistance, and so from
many such Fathers of Families joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by mutual Compacts for common Defence,
might arise the first Governments in the
World, of whatsoever kind you please to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>But in the following Discourse, we have
thought it best to confine our selves within the
bounds of Philosophy, and have wholly abstained
from Theological Questions: And therefore
we have not said any thing concerning Good,
or Evil Spirits, or Angels, or taken in their
Good or Happiness, into our <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> for
tho' I doubt not of the Existence of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Beings, yet it is certain, all we can
understand of them proceeds wholly from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, or humane Tradition, neither
of which are true means of obtaining Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical,
or natural Knowledge.</p>
            <p>As for the Second part of this Treatise, in
which is contained the Confutations of some of
Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Principles, or Arguments; since the
First part is entire without it, and that the
truth is a sufficient Proof to its self, I leave
<pb facs="tcp:53522:37"/>
it to the discretion of the Reader, whether
he will trouble himself to peruse it, or not,
since all Men's tempers, do not alike suit, with
the study of Controversies; but it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
not only to lay a Foundation of better
moral Principles, but also to shew the Falshood,
and Vanity of those he hath laid down; since
otherwise it might have been thought by some<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
that they were altogether unanswerable: Yet
I hope we have performed that unpleasant
Task, without reflecting upon the Memory of
the dead, and disturbing the Ashes of a Person,
who whilst he lived, was (as must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged)
even by his Enemies, considerably fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
both for Wit and Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have little more to add, but that I doubt
not, but our learned Author (whose work
I have now abridged) hath hit upon that true
method of proving the Law of Nature,
which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his
<hi>Advancement of Learning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Book <hi>8.</hi> chap. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note>
tells the Reader that he desired to see well
performed, and that his Design was to make
enquiry into the true Fountains of Iustice;
and publick Vtility, and so in every part of
the Law, to represent a kind of <hi>real Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
or Idea of that which is truly just;
by which general Mark, he that will bend
his study that way, and examine the Grounds,
<pb facs="tcp:53522:38"/>
or endeavour the Amendment of the Laws
of particular Kingdoms, or States, may be
truly guided in this noble Vndertaking;</q>
And he there proceeds to give some general
Aphorisms, which he calls the Idea's of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Iustice, and his Fifth Aphorism is
very home to our purpose, for he there tells
us, that <hi>the main End to which all Laws
should tend, and whereunto they should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their Decrees, and Sanctions, is only the
common Good, or Felicity of the People:</hi>
And sure this could have no Foundation, but as
the Felicity of any particular People, or Nation
is contained in general, or the common Good,
and Happiness of rational Beings.</p>
            <p>And tho' I grant that our Faculties are
not fitted to pierce into the internal Fabrick,
and real Essences of Bodies as the above-mentioned
Author of the Essay of <hi>humane
Understanding,</hi> hath very well observed:
<q>Yet in the same place he also grants, That
the Knowledge we have of them, is sufficient
to discover to us the Being of a God, and of
a Divine Providence, and that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our selves, and the Nature of other
things are sufficient to lead us into a full,
and clear Discovery of our Duty towards
him, as being the great Concernment of our
Lives, and that it becomes us as rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:53522:38"/>
to employ our Faculties about what
they are most adapted to, and follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Nature, where it seems to point
us out the way. So that it is highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to conclude, that our proper Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lies in moral, rather than natural
Truths: And therefore the same Author hath
in his Fourth Book, and Third Chapter, <hi>pag.
274.</hi> this Passage: The Idea of a supream
Being, infinite in Power; and Wisdom,
whose Workmanship we are, and on whom
we depend, and the Idea of our selves as
understanding, rational Creatures, being such
as are clear to us, these would, I suppose, if
duly considered, and pursued, afford such
Foundations of our Duty, and rules of
Action, as might place Morality amongst the
Sciences capable of Demonstration; wherein
I doubt not, but from Principles as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
as those of the Mathematicks, by
necessary Consequences, the measures of Right
and Wrong might be made out to any one
that will apply himself with the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
and attention to the one, as he
doth to the other of these Sciences:</q> And in
the Twelfth Chapter of the same Book, he saith,
<hi>p. 325.</hi> 
               <q>This gave me the Confidence to advance
that Conjecture, which I suggested Chap. 3.
<hi>viz.</hi> That Morality is capable of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:53522:39"/>
as well as Mathematicks; For the Idea's
that <hi>Ethicks</hi> are conversant about, being all
real Essences; and such as I imagine have
a discoverable Connexion, and Agreement
one with another: So far as we can find their
Habitudes, and Relations, so far we shall
be possessed of certain, real, and general
Truths; And I doubt not, but if a right
method were taken, a great part of Morality
might be made out with that clearness that
could leave to a considering Man, no more
reason to doubt, than he could have to doubt
of the Truth of any Propositions in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
which have been demonstrated to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And I am confident our Author hath found
out this only right method; and made use
of the fittest Demonstrations for the Proof of
this Principle of the common Good of rational
Beings, as the Sum of all natural Laws; so
that I hope you will have no cause to doubt,
but that he hath as fully demonstrated it to be
so, as if he had given us so many Mathematical
Demonstrations of it.</p>
            <p>But since as in the Mathematicks, there are
required certain Principles, or Postulatums,
which must be taken for granted, before its
professors are able to demonstrate any thing
from them; so we shall reduce all we have
to say on this Subject, into Six plain Postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;
<pb facs="tcp:53522:39"/>
the Three first of which having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made out by others both in Latin and
English; I shall wave the Proof of them,
and shall confine my self wholly to the Three
last: The Propositions are these,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That there is one Infinite, most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
intelligent Being, which we call God, who
is the Author, and Creator of the Vniverse, or
World.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That God as he hath created, so he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
governs, and preserves this World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Bodies and Spirits, by certain corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Motions, and Dictates of Reason, by which
Spirits act as the chief Instruments of his
Providence.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That God, thereby maintains, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
all his Creatures, and farther designs
the Happiness, and Preservation of such of
them as are sensible, as far as their frail, and
mortal Natures will admit, and that Power
which God hath given to mankind over them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> That of all Animate, or sensible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
God hath made Man alone to be consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of his own Existence; and also that it is
more particularly his Duty, to act as his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
Instrument; not only for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Good, and Happiness, but also for the
common Good of all rational Beings.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:53522:40"/>
               <hi>5.</hi> That this knowledge of God's Will, as
our Duty, is plainly discovered to us, from the
Being and Nature of God, as also of our selves,
and of those things without us, which he hath
made necessary for our use, and Preservation.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> That these Dictates, or Conclusions of
right reason, all tending to one great End,
<hi>viz.</hi> the common Good of rational Beings (in
which our own is contained) being given us
by God as a Legislator for the well governing,
or right ordering of our Actions to this End,
constitute the Law of Nature; as being esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by sufficient Rewards and Punishments,
both in this Life, and in that to come.</p>

            <p>THE Learned Authour of this Treatise
sent it to me (then being in a Private
Station) above a year ago, but then
concealed his Name from me, either through his
great Modesty, or because in his Prudence he
thought that if I knew him, I might be bias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in my judgment, by the Honour which I am
obliged to have to his Family, and especially to
his Grandfather by his Mother's side, the most
Learned Primate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Wherefore I read
the Book without any respect to the unknown
Writer, and considered only the Merits of the
Performance. Thus I found that he had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well translated and epitomized in some places
what I had written in Latin, but had fully, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the chief things of my Design in a well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
Method of his own, with great Perspicuity,
and had added some Illustrations of his own, or
from other Learned Authours, with a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Liberty, which I must needs allow. For
this Reason I judged that the then unknown Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
had give too low a Title to his Book; and
that I was to esteem him a good <hi>Hyperaspistes,</hi> or
able Second, in this Combat for Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
rather than a Translater or Epitomizer of
what I had written. This obliged me to enquire
<pb facs="tcp:53522:41"/>
diligently after the Authour's Name and Quality,
and then I soon obtained the Favour and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a more intimate Conversation with him.
Hereby I soon found that I might safely leave the
Maintenance of that good Cause in which I was
engaged, to his great Abilities and Diligence.
And I hope that since this Learned Gentleman
hath conquer'd the Difficulties of the Search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Rise of the Laws of Nature, now many
of our younger Gentry will be encouraged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him in the way which this his Treatise makes
plain before them. For from thence they may
receive assistance, not only to discern the Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of all Vertue and Morality, which is
their Duty and Ornament as they are Men, but
also they may here see the true Foundations of
Civil Government and Property, which they are
most obliged to understand, because, as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they are born to the greatest Interest in
them both. I need add no more to give you

               <p>Another Objection against our Method, That it
makes every man's obligation to endeavour this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good, to arise from its being chiefly good to
himself. Answer, That this, if it be considered, will
prove a mistake; though I grant our Obligation to
it as a Law cannot extend farther, than as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
our happiness or misery, Â§ <hi>6, 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Reply to the Objections of the <hi>Epicureans;</hi>
The first Objection, That it seems not suitable to
God's goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to permit this great End of the
Common Good to depend upon the unreasonable Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Lusts of mankind. Answ. That God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

moral Evil, as well as Good; and that God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

Power and Providence, Â§ <hi>8, 9.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second Objection, If this Law of Nature is so
easie to be known, how comes it to pass, that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations seem wholly ignorant of it, many living
without any knowledge of a God, or of a moral Good
or Evil? Â§ <hi>10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answer. This Objection is of no more weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Certainty of this Law, than it is against
that of Arithmetick and Geometry, but that if they
are guilty of this ignorance, it proceeds either from
the Loss of the Tradition of the Creation, or else from
want of time or opportunities to consider these things,

            <p>THE Learned Authour of this
Treatise sent it to me (then
being in a Private Station)
above a year ago, but then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his Name from me, either
through his great Modesty, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in his Prudence he thought
that if I knew him, I might be bias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in my judgment, by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which I am obliged to have
to his Family, and especially to his
Grandfather by his Mother's side, the
most Learned Primate of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
Wherefore I read the Book without
<pb facs="tcp:53522:49"/>
any respect to the unknown Writer,
and considered only the Merits of the
Performance. Thus I found that
he had not only well translated
and epitomized in some places
what I had written in Latin, but
had fully digested the chief things
of my Design in a well-chosen Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of his own, with great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity,
and had added some Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations
of his own, or from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Learned Authours, with a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Liberty, which I must
needs allow. For this Reason I
judged that the then unknown Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
had given too low a Title to
his Book, and that I was to esteem
him a good <hi>Hyperaspistes,</hi> or able
Second, in this Combat for Truth
and Justice, rather than a Translater
or Epitomizer of what I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
This obliged me to enquire
diligently after the Authour's Name
<pb facs="tcp:53522:49"/>
and Quality, and then I soon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Favour and Honour of
a more intimate Conversation with
him. Hereby I soon found that I
might safely leave the Maintenance
of that good Cause in which I was
engaged, to his great Abilities and
Diligence. And I hope that since
this Learned Gentleman hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
the Difficulties of the Search
into the Rise of the Laws of Nature,
now many of our younger Gentry
will be encouraged to follow him
in the way which this his Treatise
makes plain before them. For from
thence they may receive assistance,
not only to discern the Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of all Vertue and Morality,
which is their Duty and Ornament
as they are Men, but also they may
here see the true Foundations of
Civil Government and Property,
which they are most obliged to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<pb facs="tcp:53522:50"/>
because, as Gentlemen,
they are born to the greatest Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in them both. I need add no

               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§ 1. HAving, in the Introduction to
this Discourse, shewn you
those several Methods, by
which divers Authors have
endeavoured to prove a Law of Nature;
and having also given my Reasons, (tho'
in short) why I cannot acquiesce in any of
them, as laying too weak Foundations
whereon to raise so great and weighty a
Building; and having likewise given you
the only true Grounds, by which it can, as
I suppose, be made out, <hi>(viz.)</hi> from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53522:51"/>
Existence of a GOD declaring his Will to
us; from the Frame of the World, or by
the Nature of all Things without us; as
also from our own Natures, or that of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general, we, by the Power of our
natural Faculties, or Reasons, drawing true
Conclusions from all these. This being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
I shall now proceed particularly to
declare, in the first place, what I understand
by the Frame of the World, or Nature of
Things, in order to the proving the Existence
and Obligation of the Law of Nature, and
that it is really and truly a Law obliging all
Persons of Years of Discretion and sound
Minds, to its Observation: Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
I shall then proceed to our own
Nature, as included in that of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. But though the ancient, as well as
modern Scepticks and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> have of
old, and do still at this day, deny the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of any Law of Nature, properly so
called; yet, I suppose, that we are both suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
agreed what we understand by this
Term, since we both thereby mean certain
Principles of immutable Truth and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which direct our voluntary Actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the election of good, and the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of evil Things, and so lay an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to our external Actions, even in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53522:51"/>
state of Nature, and out of a Civil Society,
or Common-weal. That such eternal Truths
are necessarily and unavoidably presented to,
and perceived by Men's Minds, and retained
in their Memories, for the due ordering or
governing of their Actions, is what is here
by us affirmed, and by them as confidently
denied. And I farther conceive, That the
Actions so directed and chosen, are first
known to be naturally good, as productive
of the greatest publick Benefits; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
are called morally Good, because they
agree with those Dictates of Reason, which
are here proved to be the Laws, or Rules, of
our Manners, or voluntary Actions: So also
the Evil to be avoided, is first the greatest
natural Evil, which afterwards for the like
Reason is called Moral.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. Therefore that the Existence of such
Propositions may more plainly appear, and
be demonstrated to the Understandings of
all indifferent Readers, it is necessary that
we first carefully consider the Nature of
divers Things without us, as also that of
Mankind; and what we mean by Good and
Evil, whether Natural or Moral. Lastly,
we shall shew what those general Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are, which we affirm carry with them
the Force or Obligation of Natural Laws,
as declaring their Exercise or Performance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53522:52"/>
necessary to the compassing of an End,
that ought to be endeavoured or sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in order to our true and greatest Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. Nor let it seem strange, that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Nature of divers Things, about
which we are daily conversant, ought first
to be looked into, and considered: For I
will here suppose the Soul, or Mind of Man,
to be at first, <hi>rasa Tabula,</hi> like fair Paper,
that hath no connate Character or Idea's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
upon it (as that noble Theorist
Mr. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> his Essay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Humane Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> Book I.
Chap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Lock</hi> hath, I suppose,
fully proved) and that it is
not sensible of any thing at
its coming into the World,
but its own Existence and Action; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
all its Idea's afterwards, from such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as it hath received in by the Senses: So
that our Understandings being naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of all Notions or Idea's, we cannot
comprehend how they can operate, unless
they be first excited by outward Objects.
And indeed how can we understand what
may be helpful and agreeable, or else hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and destructive to Men's Minds and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
unless we first consider (as far as we
are able) all the Causes, as well near as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
which have made, constitute, and still
preserve Mankind, or else may tend to its
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53522:52"/>
destruction, either for the time present, or
to come? Nor indeed can it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what is the fittest and best Thing, or
Action, any Person can perform in a Case
proposed, unless first all those Effects which
may proceed from it, in all its various Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
be duly considered and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together. So that the Contemplation
both of the Causes on which Men's Safety
and Happiness depends, as also of the Effects
which may be produced by their joint or
concurring Forces and Endeavours, must
necessarily lead our Minds, first to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of all other Men, and next of
our selves, as a very small part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>And in the next place, that we proceed
to contemplate this System of Things, called
the <hi>Visible World,</hi> but more especially GOD,
as its Creator and Governour, according to
the Method laid down in the Introduction
to this Discourse; the Idea's of which being
duly considered and digested in our Minds,
we may draw from thence certain Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
by which we may judge or determine
what Humane Things and Actions are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and necessarily conducing to the
Common Good and Happiness of all Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings, and in which every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Person's Felicity or Well-being is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53522:53"/>
as a part thereof; and in which
Rational Dictates, or Conclusions, I shall
hereafter prove this Law of Nature to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. No body, I suppose, will think it
necessary to the matter in hand, that I should
here make Physical Disquisitions into the
Natures of all Things that are the Objects
of our Senses, that being the Business of
profess'd Naturalists: It is sufficient for us to
shew, That all the Rules of Moral Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and the Laws of Nature, may be at
last resolved into certain natural and easie
Observations, gathered from common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
or else into certain Conclusions,
established upon the known Principles of
Mathematicks and Physicks; by which, I
do not only mean all those natural Laws of
Matter and Motion in Bodies, but also the
Operations of our own Souls, as far as we
are able to know or enquire into them.
From all which, by the Order of Natural
Causes, we may be led to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of GOD their Creator and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer,
and so may acknowledge Him
as the only Cause of all these excellent Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
since this Nature of Things doth as
well suggest to our Minds the Idea of a
Creator, as of the Things created; and so
supplies us with sufficient matter from which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53522:53"/>
we may deduce all the Laws of Nature, as
so many true Practical Propositions, though
it is only the Knowledge of the First Cause,
or Creator, that can stamp any Authority
or Obligation upon them.</p>
               <p>Now although there may be many Things
collected from our Knowledge of several
Beings in the World, that may serve for our
Moral Instruction, and the cultivating of
our Manners; yet I shall, for Brevity's sake,
only select some of the most material of
them, and such as may serve to explain our
short account of the Law of Nature, which
(notwithstanding several Authors have so
much enlarged upon it) I think may very
well be reduced to this single Proposition,
<hi>viz.</hi> The most universal Love, or most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive
Benevolence of all Rational Beings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
each other, constitutes the happiest
State they can be capable of: So that their
Endeavour of the Common Good by this
Benevolence, is the sum of all the Laws of
Nature, and in which they are all contained.
Note, That by this Love or Benevolence, I
do not mean only a fruitless Desire, or Well-wishing,
but an active Affection, exerting
it self in all the Acts of Piety towards God,
Duty towards Parents, Kindness and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
towards our Country, Friends, and
Relations, and of Charity and Humanity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53522:54"/>
towards all the rest of Mankind, as often as
any opportunity offers it self.</p>
               <p n="6">Â§. 6. In the making out of which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Law of Nature, it is here
needless to inquire into the Nature of our
Souls, and the manner of our Knowledge
and Understanding; since the former hath
been so Learnedly perform'd by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and
the latter so exactly done already in <hi>English</hi>
by the above mentioned Author of the
<hi>Essay of Humane Vnderstanding.</hi> I shall
only briefly suppose upon his Principles, that
our Souls do, 1. From the very birth, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
receive Idea's drawn from outward
Objects by our Senses. 2. That it is their
faculty from divers single Notions, or Idea's
put together, to come to make complex
ones, that is, to make divers Propositions
or Conclusions; not only concerning their
own inward Actings, but also about all
those outward Objects, with which they are
daily conversant, and which may tend to the
finding out the readiest means of attaining
to, and preserving themselves in the happiest
State and Condition they are able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
These things being suppos'd, it were
needless to trouble you with any farther
descriptions of this Love, or Benevolence,
since every Person cannot but be sufficiently
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53522:54"/>
sensible of its Nature, Degrees, and various
Operations, that will but make any Self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon his own Inward Affections.</p>
               <p n="7">Â§. 7. But as for the due Connexion of
the Terms of this Proposition, in which its
Truth does chiefly consist, it seems to me
plain enough: It being no more than to
affirm, That our endeavour of procuring
all the good things in our Power, and
which are most conducing to our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and Happiness, and of all other
Rational Beings, is the best, or chiefest thing
that all Persons can do, to render both
themselves, and all others, as happy as their
Natures will permit or can require; and
that there is no surer, or more powerful
means to be discovered by us, whereby we
may obtain a full enjoyment of all the good
things of this Life, and the hopes of that
to come, than by endeavouring our own
Felicity in Conjunction with that of others
So that from what I have already advanced,
the Reader may Collect these two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
1. That the Foundation of all our
Natural Happiness consists in an habitual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Will to the utmost of
its Ability and Perfection, whereby we may
be always ready and prepared to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
this Common good of Rationals.
2. That the true Happiness of each Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53522:55"/>
Person, cannot be separated from
that of other Rationals, since the whole
doth not differ from all its parts taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
so that this Proposition, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this general or diffusive Benevolence,
is thus to be understood; <hi>viz.</hi> Not to mean,
or only intend, what any single, or a few
Persons may perform towards the procuring
of their own private Happiness, or that of
their own Party or Faction, distinct from
that of the rest of Mankind; but what all
particular Persons may jointly contribute
to render themselves and others happy; that
is, what each of them may rationally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
towards the obtaining this Common
Felicity. For it ought first to be known in
general what all Men are able to do, or
not to do, towards any common end,
(such as is the common happiness of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals)
and then what it is possible for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Person in this or that Case to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
for example, towards his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
happiness, as separate from that of all
others; though such cases being Indefinite,
cannot be certainly or distinctly known.</p>
               <p n="8">Â§. 8. But indeed the care of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Persons, or a few Men's happiness is
rendred useless for the present, nor can be
hoped for the future, if it is sought by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
or postponing the happiness of all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53522:55"/>
other Rationals; because the mind being
thus affected, a main, and essential part of
its own felicity must needs still be wanting;
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That inward Peace of Conscience
proceeding from a solid Reason, and true
Prudence, always constant and agreeable to
it self. For whilst such a Person resolves to
act by one rule towards himself, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
towards all others, who are of the
same Nature, and therefore need and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the same things with himself, he
must needs contradict his own Reason, and
so wants that true Joy and Satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
springing in the mind of a Just,
Benevolent, and Good-natur'd Person, from
the sense of another's good and happiness
when promoted, or procured by himself:
So that it is impossible for any Man to be
truly happy, who not only neglects the
necessary causes thereof; God, and all other
Men, (on whose Help and Assistance his
true Happiness, and Well-being wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends)
but also provokes them to his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ruine and destruction; so that there is
no surer way, which can bring any Man
to the attaining his own particular Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
but that which leads him also to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the Common Good of all other men,
as well as his own.</p>
               <p n="9">Â§. 9. But I here acknowledge, that this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53522:56"/>
Proposition concerning Universal Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
cannot be of sufficient efficacy for
the due ordering our Actions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
our Manners, until we have first
propos'd to our selves this Common Good
of Rational Beings; (<hi>viz.</hi>) Our own Felicity
(in conjunction with that of others) as our
main end, and that we are convinced that
the various Acts contain'd under this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Love, or Benevolence, are the only
true means to procure it: The truth of
which Proposition, is, in the first place, to
be made manifest to us; in the next all those
other Propositions that can be deduced from
thence; such as are those less general ones,
which determine concerning the Natural
Power of Fidelity, Gratitude, Paternal and
Filial Affection, as also of all other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Vertues, necessary for the obtaining
any part of this humane Felicity; for as well
the whole truth of this Proposition, as of
all those which follow from thence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Natural, and Necessary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of such Actions, as real Causes producing
such Effects.</p>
               <p n="10">Â§. 10. And though perhaps it may at first
sight seem to detract from their certainty,
that they depend upon such an uncertain
Cause as Man's Will. Yet however it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
for their truth and certainty, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53522:56"/>
whenever such voluntary Causes shall exert
themselves, such Effects will certainly be
produced. Thus in Arithmetick we freely
Add and Subtract; that is, we can choose
whether we will perform those Operations
or not; but if we reckon truly, we shall
always find the Total, equal to all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
either Added or Subtracted. And
there is a like certain, and true Connexion
between all the Causes and Effects, which
can be known in any other Science. And
this I have likewise imitated in this Treatise
of Moral Philosophy, by reducing all the
parts, of which it consists, to this one Head
or Summ, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Love or Benevolence;
which Idea I shall improve by enquiring
into its several Kinds, and shewing the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Connexion of this, or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Action, with the Common Good of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals,
which ought to be the great end
sought for by us.</p>
               <p n="11">Â§. 11. But since our voluntary Actions
alone can be govern'd by Reason, and those
only which concern intelligent Agents, are
to be considered in Morals; it is evident,
that from none of all these Actions we can
frame a higher, or more comprehensive
Idea, than this of Universal Benevolence,
which comprehends the willing, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
of all good things, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53522:57"/>
or hindring of all evil ones, from
those Objects about which it is conversant:
And this Benevolence extends its self to all
Moral Actions, as well those of considering,
and comparing divers goods with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as of inquiring into the means by
which they may be produced; nor is it
more certainly true, that the Addition of
several numbers makes a Summ Total, than
that this Benevolence produces a general
good effect to all those towards whom we
exert it. Thus it is as certain, that Piety,
Fidelity, Gratitude, paternal and conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Affection, together with filial Duty,
make up the chief and constituent parts
of this Benevolence, as that Addition, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction,
Multiplication and Division, are
several parts of Arithmetick; so that it is
no material Objection, That this Universal
Benevolence may be prejudiced or lessened
by the wickedness or ill-nature of Men.
So that the great end, or Summ of the Law
of Nature, cannot be thereby generally
obtain'd as it ought, any more than it is an
Objection against the certainty or usefulness
of Arithmetick, or Geometry, that some
Men should through Lazyness and Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
altogether neglect their Rules, or
make false Conclusions from those Sciences,
or should through Ignorance or prejudice,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53522:57"/>
deny their certainty. So likewise it is in
the Science of Morality, as contain'd in the
Law of Nature, which is chiefly imploy'd
in weighing, and taking a true account of
those humane Powers, that contribute to
the Common Good of Rational Beings;
which since they may vary somewhat in so
great a variety of possible Cases, he may be
said, (and that deservedly) to have well
performed this task, who first affirms in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that all those Powers are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under the most general and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Benevolence; though he may be able
afterwards more particularly to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
that a just division of things, Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Gratitude, and all the other vertues
are contain'd under it, and also shew in
what Cases they become useful to this end;
by which means Religion, and humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
with all other things which may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Men's lives happy and safe, will be
certainly improved and advanced. And
herein consists the Solution of that most
useful Problem concerning the Common
good of Rationals, procur'd by the most
diffusive Benevolence, which Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
teaches us to search after. Nor is the
truth or authority of such Precepts at all
prejudic'd or diminisht, though very many
Persons will not obey them, or will set
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53522:58"/>
themselves to oppose them; since this only
can be the consequence of it, That they will
thereby lose their own happiness, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may draw others by their false reasons
into the same misery: and so I doubt not
on the other side, but that Men would
think themselves oblig'd to perform all the
Acts that constitute this Benevolence, if
they were but once convinced that so great
and noble an end, as the Common Good of
Rational Beings, (and in which their own
happiness is likewise contained) will be
certainly procured thereby, and cannot be
had by any other or contrary means.</p>
               <p n="12">Â§. 12. I come now to consider, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the knowledge of this visible
World, (of which our selves make but a
small part) there is likewise convey'd into
our minds by our Senses a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
1. Of divers natural outward goods.
2. And those not only peculiar to our
selves alone, but common to all those of
our own kind. 3. Of which goods some are
greater than others, and that good which
hath none that we know excels it, we may
call the greatest or highest. 4. Also of those,
some are commonly in our Power, others
we understand to exceed the narrow limits
of our humane forces; but since the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of these things is by two several ways
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53522:58"/>
discovered to us, either more confusedly by
common experience and daily Observation,
or else more distinctly from experimental
Philosophy, and the Mathematicks; the
former of these methods being easie, and
obvious to every one, I shall rather make
use of that; whereas the other would be
only proper for Philosophers and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians,
since the Grounds or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Law of Nature, ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
evident to the Illiterate as well as to
the Learned, for all are under the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to observe them; and therefore I
shall only put you in mind of such vulgar
and easie Observations, which no Rational
Man can dispute, or deny: and such, as
from which I undertake to prove, that the
Knowledge and Coherence of the Terms
of this Proposition may evidently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p n="13">Â§. 13. Our first Natural Observation
therefore is, that by our free use, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of those products of the Earth,
that come under the general Titles of Food,
Clothing, Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and also by that
help or assistance, which one or more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
can afford each other; Men may be
preserved, and live as happily and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
for several years, as their frail Nature will permit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53522:59"/>And in the next place, that these effects
being not only agreeable, but necessary to
our Natures, are naturally good, as tending
to their Preservation or Perfection;
and therefore by the same reason, Men's
affections, from whence these outward
things and acts do proceed, and which
produce all these good effects, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
under the notion of good Will, or
Benevolence, which must be also good;
since whatever goodness is contain'd in the
effects, must be likewise in the cause. And we
are also sensible, that by this Benevolence,
we are not only able to help our selves, or
some few Persons, but many others, as well
by our advice, as by our strength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;
especially when we see divers others
of our own kind who are able, and seem
also willing to requite us in the like
manner. So that each of us in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
may be provided with a sufficient
stock of all the necessaries of Life, by our
mutual help and assistance, all which would
not only be wanting to us, but we should
be expos'd to innumerable mischiefs and
hazards, as also to a great want even of
necessaries, if all Persons looking only to
themselves, should always shew themselves
ill-natur'd, malevolent, and enemies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
other Rational Beings; whereas the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53522:59"/>
contrary endeavours being thus helpful,
and necessary to so many others, may easily
and naturally produce in our minds a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Common good of Rationals,
which from the obvious Similitude of Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Beings to each other, must equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
all those, which we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or occasion of knowing, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with, as also those with whom we
have not.</p>
               <p n="14">Â§. 14. And I may add farther from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
experience, that we are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
more to the good, and assistance of
those of our own kind, than any other
Creatures, because their Nature (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
what is good, or destructive to
it) is more evident to us from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we have of our selves, than of other
Creatures. For as our Nature is capable
of more, and greater goods than they, and
in the attaining of which we can better assist
each other; so we must also confess it to
be liable to greater Dangers and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for the declining and removing of
which, God hath appointed our mutual
Benevolence expressed by our endeavours,
and assistance of each other, as the most
suitable and necessary means thereunto.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53522:60"/>Â§. 15. And we may also observe, that by
our Advice and Counsel, communicated by
apt Signs or Words, we are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
many helps and conveniencies of
Life to those of our own kind, of which
other Animals are altogether uncapable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of acting or receiving. And farther,
because of the Similitude of those of our
own kind with our selves, we cannot but
think it agreeable to our Rational Natures
to do, or to procure the like things for
them, as for our selves, and can also be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of greater Motives to benefit Men,
than other Creatures; since we have all
the reason to hope, that those we have thus
done good to, or obliged, being moved by
our benefits, will make us a suitable return
whenever it lies in their power, and that
they may one time or other, in the like, or
some other way oblige us. So that it is
evident from Common Experience, that
there can be no larger Possession, nor any
surer defence for Mankind, than the most
sincere Piety towards God, the Head of
Rational beings, and the most diffusive
Love, and sincere Benevolence of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
towards each other; since if they prove
malevolent, or ill-natur'd, they may easily
bereave us of all things we enjoy, together
with our Life it self: nor can the Love or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53522:60"/>
Good-will of others, be obtained by any
more certain or powerful means, than that
every one should shew himself so affected
in his Actions towards others, as he desires
they should be towards himself; That is,
Loving and Benevolent upon all occasions,
though more particularly to those to whom
we are obliged by Friendship or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="16">Â§. 16. Last of all, the same Experience
that demonstrates the mutual Benevolence of
particular Persons to be the most powerful
Cause of their Felicity, does as necessarily
teach us from a like parity of Reason, that
the Love, or Good-will of any greater
number of Men, towards any the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
hath a-like proportionable effect; so
on the other side, the constant Malice or
Ill-will of all Men towards all, express'd by
suitable Actions, would soon bring destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the whole Race of Mankind, since
it would soon destroy all the Causes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to their Happiness, and Well-being,
and introduce a perpetual Enmity and War,
which are the certain Causes of the greatest
Miseries and Calamities, which can befall
Mankind: all which, though Mr. <hi>H.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
acknowledges, yet he will not own
the necessity of Men's mutual Love and
Concord, to be also as necessary to their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53522:61"/>
Preservation. But why the Causes of Men's
Preservation and Happiness, as being Prior
in Nature, should not be more evident
than those of their Destruction; since the
one is altogether as evident and necessary,
and may be as easily foreseen and prevented,
as the other, I can see no reason; and I
should be glad if any of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Disciples
could shew us any sufficient Reason for that
Opinion.</p>
               <p n="17">Â§. 17. So that these things which I have
now laid down concerning the Natural
means of Men's happiness, do appear so
evident from our common Reason, and
daily Experience, that they are of like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
with the Principles of Arithmetick
and Geometry, in all whose Operations,
there are still supposed certain Acts depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon our free, humane, Faculties; and
yet neither of these Sciences are rendred
the more uncertain, from the supposition of
Men's Free-will, whether they will draw
Lines, or cast up Sums, or not; since it
suffices for their truth and certainty, that
there is an inseparable Connexion between
such Acts, which are supposed to be in our
Power to exert, and all the effects sought
for; To the finding of which, both the
pleasure annexed to their Contemplation,
and the various uses of Humane Life do at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53522:61"/>
once invite us. And in the like manner, the
truth of all Moral Knowledge is founded in
the Immutable Coherence between the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Felicity, which Humane Power can attain
to, with those Acts of universal Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that is of Love towards God and
Men, and which exerts it self in all the
particular moral Vertues; yet in the mean
time, these two things are still supposed,
That Men desire, and seek the highest Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
they are capable of; and also, That
they are able to exercise this Benevolence,
not only towards themselves, but God and
Men, as partakers with them of the same
Rational, or Intelligent Nature. This I
have thought fit to add, to prevent all
those Cavils which Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Disciples are
used to make against Morality, from the
necessity of our Wills.</p>
               <p n="18">Â§. 18. But before I proceed farther to
inquire into the Nature of things, I desire
you to remember what I have already
hinted in the Introduction to this Discourse,
That this truth concerning the efficacy of
Universal Benevolence, for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Happiness of Rational Beings, as
also all other Propositions alike evident,
and contained under it, do all proceed from
God, as the first Cause, and Ordainer of
all things; and consequently of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53522:62"/>
Understanding, and of all truths
therein contained. And since these Rules
drawn from the Natures of things, tend
to the procuring God's End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Preservation, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mankind; and also that it hath
pleased Him to annex certain natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to the Observation of these Dictates
of Reason, and Punishments to their Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;
so that they thereby becoming
apt, and sufficient for the due ordering of
our Thoughts, and governing our Actions
towards God, our selves, and all others,
(as I shall farther make out in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
I see nothing wanting to give it
the Essence, and Vigour of a Law. And
I shall farther shew before I have done,
that under this general Rule of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Common Good of Rational Beings,
or Universal Benevolence, is contained
Piety towards God, and the highest Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
or Charity towards Men, and is the
Summ both of the Moral Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
and of the Gospel of our Saviour <hi>Iesus
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">Â§. 19. These Things being thus propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in general, I come now more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to shew, that a due Observation and
Knowledge of these natural Things without
us, will truly and clearly teach us what
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53522:62"/>
Operations or Motions of them are good,
or evil, for all other Men, as well as our
selves; and also shew us how necessarily and
unalterably all these Things are produced;
for Natural Knowledge searches into the
true Causes of that Generation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
which daily happens to all Natural
Bodies, and especially to Men, and so can
demonstrate the necessary coherence of
these Effects, with their Causes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those Causes that help to generate or
preserve Men, and that make them live
happily in this Life, are Natural Goods, as
the Causes of their Misery and Dissolution
are Natural Evils: And it then as plainly
follows, That by this Knowledge we can as
certainly demonstrate and foretell what
Things are naturally Good, or Evil, for all
Mankind, as for any single Person.</p>
               <p n="20">Â§. 20. Therefore we may truly conclude,
That the Knowledge of all these Effects,
which either Nature or Humane Industry
can produce for Men's Food, Clothing,
Habitation, and Medicine, is part of this
Natural Knowledge: To which we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
add the understanding of all other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Operations, and of the Effects procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from thence, for the Uses of Humane
Life. For although the voluntary Actions
of Men, as they exert themselves towards
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53522:63"/>
Things without them, do not work exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the same manner as meer Mechanick
Motions, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Pulsion or Motion
of other Bodies, but either from their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or Wills; yet since all the outward
Motions we exert, receive their Measure
and Force from the Natural Powers of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies, which are of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with others, and so must perform
their Natural Functions, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by the necessary Laws of Matter
and Motion, much after the same manner
as other Natural Motions, it is evident, that
these voluntary Actions, whenever they are
thus exerted, are regulated by the same
Natural Laws: And it is commonly known
how much Men's Industry, by the various
Motions of their Bodies (which a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
can easily resolve into mechanick ones),
does contribute to their own and other
Men's Preservation, by providing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
Victuals, Cloths, Physick, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In performing which Effects, Men's
Strength, and Skill in Husbandry, Building,
Navigation, and other manual Trades, are
chiefly employ'd. Nor are the Liberal Arts
absolutely free from these Laws of Motion,
since by the help of certain sensible Signs,
and articulate Notes, or Marks, as Words,
Letters, or Cyphers, the Minds of Men come
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53522:63"/>
to be endued with Knowledge, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in most of their Civil and Moral
Duties. I have only thought fit to hint
thus much concerning Humane Actions,
considered as meer Natural Things existing
without us; but I shall treat more fully of
them in the next Chapter, when I come to
treat of the Nature of Man, considered as a
voluntary Agent.</p>
               <p n="21">Â§. 21. Hence it plainly appears, That all
these Natural Things, and the mutual Helps
by which they are procured, may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known, and foreseen by us, to be
naturally and unalterably Good; that is,
tending to the Preservation and Happiness
of Mankind. And for the same Reason all
those contrary Causes, or Motions, by which
Men's Bodies are weakened or destroyed, by
lessening or taking away the Necessaries and
Conveniences of Life, such as Food, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Liberty, Quiet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And also those
Actions by which Vertue and Knowledge
may be rooted out of Men's Minds; and
Errours, and unbridled Passions, destructive
to the Common Good of Mankind, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into their Rooms, are necessarily and
in their own Nature Evil. Therefore
when we determine of Natural Goods, or
Evils, according to the Law of Nature,
we are not only to consider the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53522:64"/>
of a few particular Persons, since the
Punishment; nay, Death of these, may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
conduce to the Common Good; but
rather that of the aggregate Body of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
subordinate to GOD, as the Head of
Rational Beings, in this Natural System or
Commonweal, establish'd by Natural Laws:
For the good of an aggregate Body, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Chiefest Good that can
accrue to all its Parts, or the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.</p>
               <p n="22">Â§. 22. Having now found out from the
Nature of Things, by what means our
Minds can receive the Idea's of a Common
Natural Good, and Evil, and these no
less certain and stable, than those by which
the Causes of Generation and Corruption
are exhibited to them; I come next to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
That that Matter and Motion, in
which the Powers of Humane Bodies (as
well as other Parts of this <hi>Visible World</hi>)
consist, and exert themselves after a limitted
manner, and have a finite Quantity, and
certain Bounds, beyond which, they cannot
act; from which Principles, flow those
known Laws of Natural Bodies, as that
they cannot be at once in divers Places,
and therefore cannot be moved towards
contrary Points, at the same time; or so
as to be subservient to the contrary Wills
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53522:64"/>
of divers Persons, at once; but are so
bounded and determined in their Natures,
as to be only ordered or disposed of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Will of one Person alone,
or else of divers consenting or conspiring
to the same End, or Design. For if Men
should think thus to make use of them,
they would be so far from conducing to
their Benefit, or Preservation, that they
would only tend to their Hurt, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
since if the Stronger had a Right
to take from the Weaker by Strength, and
the Weaker from the Stronger by Cunning
and Surprize, any of these Necessaries of
Life, which he was once possessed of; yet
when he had them, he could be no more
assured that he should keep them, than he
was that last possessed them, since one
Stronger, or more Cunning than himself,
may yet come, and serve him as he had
done the other before; and so on, 'till
all Men that enjoy'd them should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd,
and the Things contended for, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
without use: So that there could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
neither any Owner, nor Thing to
be owned.</p>
               <p n="23">Â§. 23. From all which that hath been
now laid down, I shall draw some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of great moment to our Subject;
as, (1.) From this Knowledge of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53522:65"/>
of Things, (and especially of our own
Humane Nature) we may learn that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
celebrated Distinction of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
between the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) those Things
which are in our own Power and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
such as are the voluntary Motions and
Inclinations of our Bodies and Minds; and
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the Things out of our
Power, such as are those Corporeal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so violent and irresistible, which we
daily observe to proceed from the Nature
and Frame of the World, which we weak
Creatures are not able to resist, and from
whose irresistible Force, all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
are in a perpetual flux; whence also
there happens to us Men, a perpetual vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitude
of Things, as well Adverse as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous,
as also of Maturation, Decay, and
Dissolution: So that this Distinction (if
duly observed) will be of singular use, as
well in forming our Manners, as governing
our Affections: For from hence we are
taught not to expect any other or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Happiness, as a Reward of all our
Labours and Endeavours, than what may
proceed from a prudent Management of our
Rational Faculties, and from those Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Helps which we may expect Divine
Providence will afford us, in its governing
the World; by which means we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53522:65"/>
from those fruitless Labours and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
to which Men's vain Fears, and
groundless Hopes, so often transport them:
Nor shall we too much afflict our selves for
those Evils, which either do now, or may
hereafter, without our own Faults, inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
befal us, whence the greatest part of
those Troubles and Molestations, which are
wont to proceed from Grief, Anger, and
Discontent at our present Fortunes, or
Conditions, may, by our Prudence, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
be prevented: Neither are we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
only directed to the avoiding of Evils,
but here is also chalked out to us, a more
short and compendious method, by which
we may, by degrees, attain to those two
greatest Blessings which can be enjoyed by
us in this Life; the Culture of our own
Minds, and the Government of our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p n="24">Â§. 24. I need not prosecute this Subject
any farther, but shall proceed to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of those obvious Observations to our
Purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is evident from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Experience, That the natural Forces,
or Powers, of any one Person, are too
weak, scanty, and inconsiderable, towards
the obtaining all that Happiness he desires
and is capable of; to procure which, he still
wants the Help and Assistance of many
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53522:66"/>
other Persons and Things, to render his
Life safe, pleasant, or contented: And, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is in the Power of any one of
us, to contribute many Things towards the
use of others of our own kind, which we
do not need our selves; and which though
of no use to us, yet may be of singular use
to their Happiness, or Preservation. But
since we are certain, from those known
Bounds of our Power, that we are not
able to compel all those by force, whose
Assistance we stand in need of, to co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with us, towards this our main End
and Design, <hi>viz.</hi> Happiness; there can be
no surer Means, or safer Defence left us,
than that by a constant offering and affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
those Necessaries of Life, together
with our Assistance to others, as often as
it lies in our Power; we may thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
render them likewise Benevolent and
Helpful to us in the like Necessities, or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions:
So that this Benevolence, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is only a constant Will and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of acting thus sincerely and diffusively,
whenever any Opportunity offers it self;
and that even in those Cases, in which it
may oftentimes be probably foreseen, that
no return can be immediately expected from
the Person to whom the Benefit is done;
since, however, it still contributes to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53522:66"/>
general Good of Mankind, of which that
Person we so benefit is a Member: Which
general Benevolence doth not yet hinder,
but that we may bestow and exercise a
larger share, and higher degrees thereof,
towards those from whom our own long Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and nearer Relation, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
us to hope for larger Returns of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p n="25">Â§. 25. Whence we may, in the next place,
observe, That if our Assistance, and other
Things in our Power, certainly contribute
to the Use, or Benefit of others, they can
only perform this, as they are assign'd, or
appropriated, to the particular Persons, that
are to make use of them, according to some
certain time and place. So that if Right
Reason prescribe a Use of Things, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Helps, as necessary for the Happiness
and Preservation of Mankind, it, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily,
prescribes, that this Use of these
Things, should be appropriated to them,
that are thus to use them, for the time they
stand in need of them, and according to the
place in which they are to be used. The
Consequence is evident, because Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can only prescribe that to be done, which
will consist with the nature of the Things
that are to be used, and the Persons that are
to use them. So that it is evident, a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53522:67"/>
or Appropriation of Things, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Assistances and Labours, is absolutely
necessary for the Subsistence and Happiness
of all Men; whence it also follows, That this
necessary Limitation, or Appropriation of
any of these Things to particular Persons,
for the time they stand in need of them, is
a natural Separation of them, from the use
of all others, during the time they are so
made use of. By <hi>One Thing,</hi> I mean such
single Things as are uncapable of division;
and to make use of which, it is absolutely
necessary that it be possessed whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
such as are Food, Cloths, and the like;
for there are other Things which are likewise
called <hi>One,</hi> as one Island, one Field, and the
like, which may very well serve for the
Use of divers Persons at once, and whose
Division arising from the positive Consent
of Men already entred into Civil Societies,
or Commonweals, I need not now treat
of.</p>
               <p n="26">Â§. 26. But from this natural Division, or
Appropriation of Things, and its Necessity
for the Preservation of Mankind, arises
that Natural and Primitive right proceeding
from Occupancy, which both Philosophers
and Civilians grant to have place in the state
of Nature, supposing a Community of most
Things: For Right is but a certain Faculty,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53522:67"/>
or Power of Acting, or enjoying any thing
granted us by a Law; but in this state, there
is no other Law but that of Right Reason,
given by GOD, concerning such Actions
as are necessary for the Common Good of
Rational Beings. Therefore since Right
Reason requires a separate use of particular
Things, and Humane Assistances, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and conducing to this End, there must
needs follow from thence, a Right to the
Use and Enjoyment of any particular Thing,
during the time the Possessor so makes use
of it; for a Man hath the same Right to
live tomorrow, as he hath to day; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
hath the same Right to all the
Means which are necessary for his Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Therefore if this House, Servant, or
any thing else that I am now possessed of, be
necessary for my Happiness or Preservation
to day, I shall have also a like Right to it for
the future as long as it continues thus neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
And in this state, there being no other
Judge of the Means of my own Preservation
but my self, I shall have a Right to it as
long as I live, for the same Reason for
which I had a Right to it at first. So that
unless, the Use or Necessity ceasing, I alter
my Mind concerning it, or assign my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in it to another, I have a perpetual
Right in it, excluding that of any other, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53522:68"/>
the time that I am thus possessed of it:
Not that I hereby grant every Man a
Right, in the state of Nature, to all Things
which his unreasonable Passions, or Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
shall fansie to be necessary for his own
Preservation, or Happiness, but only to so
much of the Means conducing thereunto, as
any Man, whilst he judges according to
Right Reason, or Equity, and the natural
Necessities of himself and Family, shall
rightly so determine, without arrogating,
or assuming to himself more than is really
necessary for those Ends, and without rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
others of what is also necessary for
them, which is down-right Violence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</p>
               <p n="27">Â§. 27. Whence it plainly appears, That
this natural Division, or Property in Things,
first proceeding from Occupancy and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
as it is necessary for the Preservation
of all particular Persons, so it must be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for that of Mankind, considered as an
aggregate Body, consisting of divers Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,
the same Means being necessary for
the preservation of the whole, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to all its constituent Parts or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
though this kind of Property may
very well consist with Community, as at
Ord'naries and Theatres, every one that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53522:68"/>
pays his Money hath a Right to his Dinner,
or Place; yet none can tell which it is, or
where it shall be, 'till he hath it on his Plate,
or is actually seated in it.</p>
               <p n="28">Â§. 28. Whence it may appear, That these
Principles being truly drawn from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Things, will, without any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
destroy Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s wild Hypothesis, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Natural Right of all Men to all
Things, that he may thereby prove a Right,
in the state of Nature, in all Men<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whatsoever they please towards others,
necessary to their Preservation; so that
thence may arise a natural state of War of
all Men against all. And hence it likewise
appears upon what grounds every Man hath
a Right to his own Life, Limbs, and Liberty,
<hi>viz.</hi> because they are the natural Means by
which we are enabled to serve GOD, and
assist Mankind; in doing which, we prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Common Good of Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
And from these Principles here laid
down, it clearly appears, That Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
concerning the Law of Nature, and
Dominion, are not only precarious, but
manifestly false; which, first, suppose (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sufficient Proof) an unlimitted
Right of all Men to all Things, to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to their Preservation, as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Natural Laws, and Civil Societies.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53522:69"/>
For the proving of which, he only makes
use of some false and specious Arguments,
as I hope I have sufficiently made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Second Part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
               <p n="29">Â§. 29. Having now established a Natural
Property in such Things, and Humane
Helps, or Assistances, as are necessary for
Men's Happiness and Preservation, in order
to the Common Good, I shall not concern
my self to prove the Convenience of Civil
Property, as now established in most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweals;
nor shall now trouble you with
those Mischiefs, which <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
hath very well proved, would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from a Community of Things, from
those unavoidable Strifes and Contentions,
which would daily arise from our using the
Fruits of the Earth in common: Only I
think I may say thus much, That since Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is so multiplied in well-inhabited Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that there is not Land sufficient to be
divided amongst all the Inhabitants, so as to
serve for each Person's comfortable Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
without foreign Trade, or mechanick
Employments, there must necessarily follow
a more full and exact Division and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation
of the Necessaries of Life, such as
are Land, or the Use and Products thereof;
as, Corn, Cattel, and the like, in order to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53522:69"/>
Preservation and Happiness of that Nation, or
Civil Society, by whose Consent such a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Appropriation of these Things were
at first introduced; which being once set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Civil Laws, there is the like Reason
for its continuance; and Men have as much
Right to those Things they thus enjoy, by
the particular Laws of the Countries where
they live, as they had before in the state of
Nature, to whatever they could possess
by the Right of Occupancy, or Possession;
since it is evident, That this more exact
Property, or Dominion, consisting in a
stricter and more limitted use of these
Things, hath a greater efficacy in order to
the Happiness and Preservation of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or part of Mankind, which have thus
agreed to it, than the bare Occupancy, or
Possession of these Things had before such
a Division made, or agreed upon; nor
can it now be altered, however, perhaps,
hard and unequal it may prove to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Persons, since it will always conduce
to the Happiness and Tranquility of each
particular Civil Society, or Commonweal,
that it should continue as it doth, than it
should be still altered, according to every
Man's particular Fancy, or Interest, since
such a Change can never be made, without
inconceivable Discontents, and Civil Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53522:70"/>
which would quickly end in open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Hostility.</p>
               <p n="30">Â§. 30. So that from these Principles here
laid down, there is no Right conferred
upon any Man, of doing whatever his own
wild Fancy, or unbounded Appetite may
prompt him to, but only, what he shall,
according to right Reason, truly judge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to his own, or Family's Happiness
and Preservation, in order to the Common
Good of Mankind. Therefore I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to take notice, that whatever
Right we enjoy, even to the things most
necessary for our Preservation, it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if not in the Precept, yet at least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of this great Law of Nature, of
endeavouring the Common Good of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings, when we truly judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Nature of things, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the means necessary, and conducing to
this great End; so that it can never be
proved, that any one hath a right of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
himself, unless it be first made out,
how this Right of Self-preservation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
to, or at least consists with this
Common Good. Since no Rational Man
can ever believe, that God intended the
Preservation, much less the Sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of any one Man, as the Sole End of
His Creation. Which Principle being once
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53522:70"/>
established, as the Foundation and Original
of all the Natural, or Civil Rights we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;
our own natural Powers and Rights,
will appear so limitted thereby, that we
cannot without injury, and injustice, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
or invade the Rights of others, much
less break out into open War against them
without just Cause; nay all those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by which any one Man can assume
a Right to Preserve himself by the Law
of Nature, will likewise be of the same
force to prove, that he ought to Preserve
others also; and that it can never become
lawful for us in any State, to rob Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Persons of what is necessary for their
Well-being and Preservation; but rather
on the contrary, that all Men's natural
Rights, should be secured from the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of unreasonable Violence, and War,
and Contention; which natural Security
in a Civil State or Commonweal, is highly
improved and encreased by the Assistance of
Humane Skill and Industry, according to the
established Laws of Property or Dominion.</p>
               <p n="31">Â§. 31. I have spoken thus much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the necessary Connexion between the
particular Actions above mentioned, and
the Common Good of Mankind, that by
considering their relation to this Great
End, the Nature of all Humane Actions
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53522:71"/>
may more certainly be known and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
Since the Dependance of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Effects on their Causes, are absolutely
necessary and immutable; for as well in
the state of Nature or Community, as of
Civil Society, or separate Property, those
Humane Actions which cause, or procure,
that the minds of all other Persons should
not be prejudiced by Errors, Lyes, or
Perfidiousness; nor their Bodies hurt, nor
their Lives, Goods, Fames and Chastities
violated, or taken away, and also by which
a grateful return is rendred to those that
have done us good; or in short, all those
Actions by which the true happiness of
any one Man, or more is procured, without
injury to others, as they always were, so
they ever will be the certain Causes of
the Common Good, and Happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and are therefore distinguished by
the Titles of moral Vertues, as I shall
more at large demonstrate in this Discourse,
when I come to shew how all moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are derived from, and at last resolved
into this Principle of the Common Good of
Rational Beings.</p>
               <p>But least the variousness of the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
treated of in this Chapter, and
their Independance upon each other, should
render them perplext, and consequently
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53522:71"/>
unconvincing to Common Readers, who
may not be able to carry so long a train of
consequences in their minds; I shall contract
what hath been now said into these few plain
Propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though all particular men are
mortal, and but of a short duration, yet
that God hath still preserved mankind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sensible failure or decay.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in Order to this, God hath made
man to be propagated by Generation,
and also to be preserved by divers out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means, which we call necessaries of Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That these Natural means can no way
answer this End, but as they are allowed,
or appropriated to the uses and occasions
of particular Persons, during the time they
stand in need of them, and so cannot at the
same time answer the different or contrary
desires, and necessities of divers men, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to use these things after contrary or
different manner.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the taking away those necessaries
of Life, which another is rightly possessed
of, doth not only cause the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of that Person and his Family,
who were thus possessed of them; but by
causing a perpetual strife among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
will render these things uncapable of
being made use of at all for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53522:72"/>
Good and Preservation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That such a Strife, if prosecuted
to the utmost, will certainly end in the
destruction, not only of particular Persons
and Nations, but of all mankind contrary
to God's design.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From all which we may Rationally
collect, that God designs the Preservation
and Happiness of Mankind, as also of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Persons as parts of it, as far as their
frail and mortal Natures will permit, and in
subordination to the good of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thereof.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That therefore there are no surer
means to procure this great End of the
Common Good of Mankind, than an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Benevolence towards Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
consisting, First, in Divine Love or
Piety towards God, and in Respect of Men,
not only in permitting each other quietly to
enjoy all the necessaries of Life, but also
in making a settled division of them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
so as to be appropriated to several
mens uses or occasions; which dictates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given us by God as a rule of all our
moral Actions, (in the exercise of which
is contained our truest Happiness, as in its
violation, our greatest Misery) is therefore
truly and properly a Law, and indeed the
Summ of all the Laws of Nature.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Observations and Conclusions, drawn from
the consideration of Humane Nature
and Right Reason, as also from the
Nature of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§. 1. HAving in the former Chapter
drawn such easie and obvious
Observations, from the Nature
of those things without us, which we daily
stand in need and make use of, as may serve
to prove, after what manner we ought to
make use of them, and whence that Right
arises we have to them. I come now to
make the like Observations from the Nature
of Mankind, in order to the proving, that
we are designed by God for the Good and
Preservation of others besides our selves,
and that in the doing of this, we procure
(as far as lies in our Power) the Good and
Happiness of all Rational Beings, in which
our own is likewise included. To perform
this task, I shall first take notice of those
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53522:73"/>
Qualities or Properties that belong to man
(1) as a meer Natural Body, (2) such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to him as an Animal, (3) such as are
peculiar to him as a Rational Creature, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with a higher and nobler Principle
than Brutes, <hi>viz.</hi> an Immortal Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. To begin with the first of these, it
is evident, that as a Natural Body, he is
endued with these Properties common to
all other Natural Bodies. First, that all his
motions, in which his Life, Strength, and
Health consist, do all proceed from God,
the first and Original, or Cause of them,
and are necessarily complicated with, and
depend upon the motions of innumerable
other Bodies, among which the Corporeal
motions of others, (which do often limit
and restrain our own) are first and chiefly
to be considered. (2) That from them, as
from other Bodies, motion may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
Indefinitely, and which does not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but concur with other motions to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
the Succession of things, that is,
contribute to the conservation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
and as the former teaches us, that a
particular end, <hi>viz.</hi> our own Preservation,
depends upon our Common or joynt
Forces, or Natural Powers; so this latter
instructs us, that such Powers and motions of
particular Persons, are often most Beneficial,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53522:73"/>
and conducing to the Common Good of
all men. The first of these Conclusions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us to hope for, or endeavour our own
private Good or Happiness, as separate and
distinct from that of all others, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
us to seek the Common Good of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals,
as the Original of our own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Happiness. The other Conclusion
shews, that this endeavour of the Common
Good can never prove in vain, or to no
purpose, since it concurrs with the Will of
God, and conduces to the Preservation of
the Universe, and of all Humane Creatures
therein contain'd; and farther, that in each
complicated motion, as well in that, towards
which divers Causes concurr for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of any Body for a certain time,
as also in that, whereby each particular Body
concurrs to the Conservation of the whole
System. There is a certain order still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
whereby some motions are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
determined by others in a continual
Series, or Succession, all which are yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
or over-ruled, by the motion of the
whole System of Natural Bodies. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this sort of Contemplation, may
seem remote from common use, yet is it not
to be contemned as altogether unprofitable
in Humane Affairs; for it makes us more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
perceive from some certain general
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53522:74"/>
Principles, how necessary a constant and
certain order is amongst those Causes, that
Act from Corporeal forces; so that many
of them, may each in their order Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
concurr to an effect foreseen, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by us; and farther shews us a rule
how we may certainly judge, what Cause
does more or less contribute to the Effect
sought for, or desired; so that from the
Natural Power of these Causes, their Order,
Dignity or Power, in respect to each Effect,
are to be determined and judged of; and we
are taught from the Nature of things, as
well what Causes are to be most esteemed
for those good Effects they have, or may
produce, as also which are most diligently
to be sought, for the obtaining those ends
which we desire, and by which means it
may be also known; that those Causes
which Philosophers call Universal, <hi>viz.</hi> God
the first Cause, and the motion of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Bodies as proceeding from Him, are
the Original Causes of the Common Good
or Happiness of Mankind, a part of which
we either always do actually, or can hope
to enjoy.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. But omitting those Motions which
are not in our Power to influence or alter,
it is certain, that among the things which
are in either our Power to do or forbear;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53522:74"/>
those voluntary Humane motions proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from an Universal Benevolence of all Men
towards all others, are the principal Causes
of their Common Happiness, and in which
every one's private Good is included.
Since from this source proceed all those
Actions, by which Men's Innocence and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
towards each other are preserved;
as also by which Humanity, Gratitude, and
almost all the other Vertues are exerted and
performed, after as certain a manner, as the
Natural motions of the Spirits, Bowels,
Nerves, and Joynts in an Animal, do wholly
proceed from the motion of the Heart, and
Circulation of the Blood: which judgment
or determination, being taken from the
Nature of things duly considered, should,
without doubt, cause us to yield Obedience
to all the Laws of Nature, as contributing
to this Common Good of Rational Agents,
and may make us also diligently to take care,
that the same be observed by others, so that
there may be nothing wanting that can be
done by us, whereby we may not be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as happy as our frail Natures in this
will allow; since right reason can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
no higher or nobler End, than this of all
our moral Actions.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. Yet whilst we compare the Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Body of mankind, (as far as we can
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53522:75"/>
Act by Corporeal force) with the Natural
Systems of other Bodies. I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful
of the manifest difference there is
between them, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Effects of
meer Corporeal Systems, are produced by
the Contiguity, and immediate Operation of
Bodies, moving upon others that are to be
moved by them; without any Sense, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
or Liberty, which are only to be
found in Humane Actions, in whose Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Operations on each other, though
a great difference often intervenes; yet for
all that, it is evident, that the Corporeal
Powers of Men when exerted, are subject
to the same Laws of motion with other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and that divers Men may often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
to one certain Effect, relating to
the Good or Hurt of others, so that there
is the same necessity of a Subordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Humane motions, as there is between
those of other Bodies. And I must here far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take notice, that Men have frequent
opportunities of meeting together, and also
many other means by which they may hurt
or help each other, by Words, Writing, or
other Actions. So that, if we consider the
Nature of Mankind, in the whole course of
their Lives, it ought to be considered as
one entire System of Bodies, consisting of
several particular parts; So that nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53522:75"/>
can be done in Relation to any Man's
Life, Family, or Fortune, which doth not
some way or other, either benefit or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
those things which are most dear to
others also: as the motion of any one Body
in the System of the World, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
it self to many others. For that great
Prerogative of Knowledge and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with which Man is endued, supplies the
Contiguity required for motion in other
Bodies. Men being often excited to Action,
by certain Arbitrary signs or words, by
which they understand, what hath been
done by others in places far distant. So
also our Intellect apprehending a likeness of
Desires and Aversions, between those of the
same Species with it self, as to things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
or hurtful to Life, as also being able to
remember other Men's Actions towards
themselves, or those they love, are from
thence excited to hope for, or expect the
like things from them, and are also provoked
to a requital when occasion is offered. Such
Properties being plainly Natural, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in Humane Nature, are no less effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to excite Men to such Actions or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
than a mutual contact between Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
is to Communicate motion between all
the parts of any Corporeal System.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53522:76"/>Â§. 5. From which Natural Observations
it is plainly manifest, that particular Men
may hence Learn, that both their greatest
Security from Evil, and all their hopes of
obtaining any Good or Assistance from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
towards making themselves Happy,
doth truly and necessarily depend upon
voluntary Actions, proceeding from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
of others, who do likewise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
stand in need of the like means for
their Happiness and Safety. From whence
we easily perceive, that these mutual Helps
and Assistances of Men towards each other,
are highly beneficial to all of them, and
answer that Concourse of Natural Bodies,
and that Cession or giving place to each
other, which is so necessary for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their motions. So that from this
necessity of these mutual helps, it as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follows, that he who would consult
his own Happiness and Preservation, should
procure (as far as he is able) the Good will
and Assistance of others, since he cannot
but be sensible, that he is able to afford and
perform to others, divers like Offices of
kindness, and so is able to conspire with
the whole System of Rational Beings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the same End, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Common
Good of Rational Beings: and that on the
contrary, the weak and inconsiderable forces
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53522:76"/>
of any one Man, are not sufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
so many others, each of them equal (if
not Superiour) to himself, both in Wit and
Power, to yield him their help and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
to their own prejudice, whether they
will or no; which would prove as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
as that a hundred pound weight placed
in one Scale of a Balance, should bear down
several other hundred weights, put on the
opposite Scale: So likewise the force and
cunning, of any single Person, is of no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Power or Force, against the several
Necessities, Counsels, and Endeavours, of
innumerable others towards their own, and
the Common Good, without any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his particular Happiness alone.
Therefore it is manifest from this natural
Balance of Humane Powers, that men may
be more certainly induced by our Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or Endeavour of the Common Good,
to yield us those things and assistances we
stand in need of, than by using force or
deceit, which <hi>Mr. H.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide,</hi> The Preface to <hi>De Cive.</hi>
                  </note> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
even the Good and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
may lawfully exercise in
the State of Nature, as the
only natural means of Self-preservation, in
his Imaginary State of Nature.</p>
               <p n="6">Â§. 6. So that from these Natural Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
concerning all the means necessary
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53522:77"/>
to the Conservation of the Corporeal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and of the several sorts of Beings
therein contained, we may draw these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.
1. That all things are so disposed,
that not the least quantity of matter and
motion, can ever be lost; but the same Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Animals, are still continued, and
are rather encreased than lessened, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the opposition of the cruel Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and unruly Appetites of some other
Animals, so that in this perpetuity of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and motion, by a continual succession
of things, the Natural Good, or Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Corporeal Universe consists,
and towards which it is carried according
to the immutable Laws of motion; nor
can there be any sufficient reason given,
why the Conservation of Mankind may not
be looked upon as established by as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and natural a Power of Causes, as the
Successive Generations of any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
since they depend alike upon the
lasting Nature of the Corporeal Universe;
and agree in all the Essentials of Animals.
And certainly the Addition of a Rational
Soul to our Bodies, does very often put
us in a better Condition than that of Brutes,
but can never make us in a worse; which
will be evident to any Man that considers
the benefits, which accrew to our Bodies
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53522:77"/>
from the Government of our Reason, and
which do abundantly recompense some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
which may happen to them
from the errours of our minds. Nay, it is
most certain, that its errours concerning
Food, Pleasure, and other things which
concern the Preservation of our Bodies,
proceed from the Soul's yielding, against
the Admonitions of Reason, to Carnal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
and Corporeal or Animal Passions.
2. That the matter and motion of all Bodies,
as also of Men (considered only as such)
do Mechanically, or whether they will or
no, promote the motion of that of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Universe, since the motion of all
particular Bodies is determined, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
motion of the whole System. In
short, our Judgments concerning the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
means of the Happiness of Mankind,
may be convinced from these Natural causes
operating after the same manner, and by
the same Natural Laws, by which the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Universe is preserved, since they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in these two Rules: 1. That the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of particular Persons towards their
own Preservation, are as plainly necessary
for the Conservation of the whole Species
of Mankind, as the mechanick motions of
particular Bodies, are to the general motion
of the whole Corporeal System. 2. That
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53522:78"/>
the Powers of particular Persons, by which
they defend themselves against the force of
others, should be so equally Balanced, as
that (like the motion of other Bodies)
none of them should be destroyed or lost,
to the Prejudice or Detriment of the whole.
Somewhat like which, is seen in all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Corporeal System of the
World, which proceed from its Plenitude,
and the mutual Contact of Bodies, and so
extend themselves through the whole mass
of matter; but it is the proper Talent of
Humane Reason and Understanding, to
observe that each Man's particular Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
does depend upon the voluntary
Actions of other Rationals, after a much
nobler manner, even when they are far
distant, and can therefore take care that all
Humane Actions may in like manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the Common Good of Rational
Agents, as the motions of all Bodies, do to the
Conservation of the whole Corporeal Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem;
which will be truly performed, if
in all voluntary Actions which respect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
those two Rules aforegoing be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
So that we are taught from the
real Natures of things, as well as that of
Inanimate Bodies, after what manner, and
to what Degree we ought to pursue our
own particular Happiness, that is, only as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53522:78"/>
it conduces to, and is included in that of
the Common Good of Rational Agents.
So we are hence also instructed, what
Actions are prescribed, or forbid by the
Laws of Nature; since such Actions only
are thereby commended, as promote this
great End, and the contrary Actions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
which disturb or hinder it; which
is also supposed by all Princes and States
in their Deliberations and Treaties of Peace,
it being that, in which they all agree, as
contributing to their Common Safety and
Preservation, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Powers of all
the several states concerned, should be so justly
moderated and equally balanced, that none
may destroy or oppress each other. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
neighbouring Nations, not Subject to
the same Common Power; it is chiefly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in all their Leagues and Treaties, that
the Forces of each particular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
should be so equally balanced by the
Assistance, and Support of their Consede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
and Allies, that it should be impossible
for any one of them to swallow up, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
another; but that there should be
still left to each of them Power, and means
sufficient to preserve themselves, and their
Subjects in Peace and Safety, as being the
main ends, for which they were at first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by God, and Instituted by Men.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53522:79"/>Â§. 7. And as it is proper to all Natural
Bodies, that whilst they persevere in their
own motion, there is likewise a necessity
they should also contribute, and be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to the motions of innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bodies, from the general Laws of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for the Conservation of the Universe,
and which Rule being also found true in
Animals; it seems to admonish us, not
only as meer Animals, but rational Agents,
that we contribute our particular endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
towards the general Good, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of all those of their own Kind,
since it is not only a possible effect, but
also such a one, as depending upon Causes
so perfect and certain, we may with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
believe, that it will endure to the
end of the World. But if we farther add
to these Observations, those things that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
Animate from Inanimate Bodies,
they will yet more strongly convince us, and
make us see more sufficient reasons, wherefore
(not so much concerning our selves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Corporeal Beings) we should be chiefly
sollicitous in giving our assistance to those
of our own Kind: First, then the Nature
of Animate is distinguished from that of
Inanimate Bodies, by such a fit disposition
of parts, and an apt conformation of their
Natural Organs, as suffices for their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53522:79"/>
Sensation, Imagination, Affections,
Nourishment, and also all spontaneous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And it is by these Actions, that all
sorts of Animals endeavour their Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and Happiness for the time that is
appointed them, and thereby procure the
Preservation of the whole Species.</p>
               <p n="8">Â§. 8. But I shall not dwell too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these common obvious things, which
are so evident in themselves, but shall from
hence deduce something more material to
our purpose, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that from the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck
Constitution of all Animals, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are determined to this Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Preserving themselves, there are
besides given manifest Declarations, that
Loving and Benevolent Actions towards
those of their own Kind, are also necessary
for their own defence, and constitute the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
State of Life they can enjoy. And
likewise that it is farther ordained from
the same concourse of External and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Causes, that all Rational Agents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be sensible, or mindful of these
Indications. The first of these Conclusions
contains the Sense, and Sanction of the Law
of Nature, as the latter regards its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation,
or the manner whereby it comes
to be made known to us. I shall explain each
of them in their order.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:53522:80"/>Â§. 9. It is therefore first to be observed,
That the corporeal Bulk, even of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
Animals, is contained within a small and
narrow compass; as also that the space of
Time wherein they can live, or be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is not long: From whence it follows,
That but a few Things, and a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of them, are really necessary for their
Nourishment and Preservation; or where
there is need of a Concurrence of more
of them, they are only such as may be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
communicated to many at once; whence
they are naturally led to desire but a few
particular Things, but daily stand in need
of divers others in common, whose use may
yet be well communicated to many at once,
without exhausting their store; such as are
the free Enjoyment of Air, Light, Fire,
Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And farther, if we consider
the Structure of their Bodies, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That the same superficies of the Skin
which hinders the effusion, governs also the
Circulation of the Blood, and does at the
same time fix bounds to those Appetites and
Necessities by which they are urged to seek
their own Preservation: So that those few
Things that suffice to repair the vital Flame
which daily consumes, are likewise suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
not only for the Conservation of their
life, and natural strength, but also for inabling
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53522:80"/>
them to contribute their Help and Assistance
to others of the same kind. And, lastly,
the Structure and Capacity of the Vessels,
in which their Aliment is digested, and of
those that convey the Chyle, as also of the
Veins and Arteries that receive it, being but
narrow, require but a small quantity to fill
them. So that I think no Brute can be
guilty of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Errour, of judging or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
all Things whatever, as necessary for
its own Preservation; since from the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seck
and constituent Parts of all Animals,
it plainly appears, That but a few Things
suffice to allay their Hunger and Thirst, and
to prevent the Injuries of the Weather.
And if, so few Things are necessary for their
Happiness and Preservation, they may very
well leave the rest of those Products which
the Earth so plentifully brings forth, to be
enjoyed by others of their own kind, since
the finite quantity of their Bodies limitting
their Appetites to the desiring, and their
Powers only to the using a few necessary
Things: From this Use and Necessity, there
arises a natural Division or Appropriation
of Things, amongst divers Animals of the
same kind (as I shewed before in the last
Chapter.) The allowance or permission of
which Distribution, is the Foundation of
all that mutual Concord and Benevolence
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53522:81"/>
amongst them, and which their Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
for their Preservation: So that if this
innate Love, or Desire of Self-preservation
in Animals, be limited after the manner we
have now described, this once satisfied, there
can be no Reason why they should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
or obstruct the Conservation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the same kind, either by hindring
their Enjoyment of those Things which they
themselves do not need, or in refusing to lend
them their Help and Assistance, when there is
occasion, and that it is not needful for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="10">Â§. 10. The next Observation we make, is
from the Effects of the Senses, as also the
Imagination and Memory in Animals when
they are taken up, and employed about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the same kind: For since from the
Impressions made on their Organs of Sense,
they cannot but perceive, that such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are of the same Nature with themselves;
such Notions must, from the Constitution of
their Nature, move them to somewhat a like
affection towards them as towards themselves.
But I shall here avoid all Controversies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Knowledge of Brutes, or which
way their Affections are moved by their
Imaginations; and shall only suppose, That
their Imagination excites their Passions, and
that these Passions do likewise often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53522:81"/>
the like Motions, or Inclinations, in
their fellow Animals: From whence I
collect, That this Similitude of Nature does
highly conduce to the procuring of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,
or Concord, amongst those of the
same kind, unless there be some unaccountable
Antipathy, or Dissimilitude of Disposition,
which may happen to excite Enmity, or
Discord between them; which yet not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happens: Whence it follows, That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
as long as they are in their Right
Senses, and are mindful of themselves, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forget others of the same kind, since
under the same Idea's by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their own Nature, and the Necessities
thereof, they cannot but have an Idea of
that of others of the same Species with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and must also be sensible, that such
Animals, being urged by the like Appetites
of Hunger and Thirst as themselves, are
thereby moved to seek Food when hungry
or thirsty; and cannot but be also sensible,
that it is highly grateful to them, when the
use of these Necessaries is left free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed,
or else is administred to them by
others, or that they are any ways assisted by
them in the obtaining them.</p>
               <p n="11">Â§. 11. But since Idea's of this sort do constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spring in the Minds of Animals, as also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
perpetual motions to love or Good-will,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53522:82"/>
arising necessarily from this similitude of
Nature; it also follows, that they never so
far deviate from their natural state, as when,
through Madness, or any other violent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
or Passion, they act contrary to
these first and most natural Dictates; as all
Men grant it to be a preternatural Disease in
a Dog, when seized with Madness, he bites
all other Dogs he meets with; or when a
Sow, through a depraved Appetite, eats her
own Pigs. Nor indeed can I see any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why all other kinds of inordinate Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which disturb the natural Disposition
of an Animal, so as to make it do extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Actions, and hurtful to its own Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
without any just Cause, (such as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and vehement Envy often times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce)
may not be justly esteemed as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
Distempers of the Blood, or Brain,
very like to that of a mad Dog; for there
often appears in those that are transported
with these Passions, all the Symptoms of
those Diseases that proceed from an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of Choler, or a violent efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
of the Blood, such as an icterial black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Face, paralytick Tremblings, and
other Signs well enough known to Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Nor is an immoderate needless Fear
of Animals of the same kind, to be less recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
among such Diseases, since it is not only
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53522:82"/>
preternatural, or besides their Constitution
when in Health, but doth likewise, as
well as other Diseases, destroy the Body,
by driving them into an immoderate Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
unseasonable Solitude and Watchings,
with other Symptoms of predominant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
whence an untimely Death is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
accelerated. Neither can there be any
Mean, or End, put to this unreasonable
Fear, when once the Mind is touch'd and
infected with a false Imagination, that all
other Men design to kill and destroy them;
which Madness is very like that of those,
who being bitten by a mad Dog, are afraid
of Water, and all Liquids, though they
cannot live without them, of which I have
met with a famous Example
in the <hi>French</hi> Chronicles of
King <hi>Charles</hi> VI. <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Mezeray</hi>'s Hist. in the Life of this Prince.</note> who being
seized with a violent apprehension, that all
his Servants were bribed, by his Son the
Dauphin, to poison him, did quite abstain
from all Food, 'till at last he died, as truly
of Hunger, as Fear.</p>
               <p n="12">Â§. 12. And it is evident (and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
confesses it) that Men, as well as other
sociable Animals, do more or less delight in
the society of each other of the same kind,
as may be observed from those signs of Joy
and Satisfaction which they express when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53522:83"/>
they meet after any long absence: But since
it is as plain, that the Causes of this Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
and Agreement, proceed from the
intrinseck Nature of the Creatures, and are
no other than those by which the Blood,
Spirits, and Nerves are continued and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
in a due and healthy state; it as
evidently follows, That the Safety and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of each of them, cannot be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from a Propension, at least, to a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Association with those of their own kind;
so that though they sometimes quarrel about
the same Meat, or Female, yet this does
not any ways cross or contradict this great
End of Nature, of procuring the Common
Good of the Universe; but is rather in
order to it, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Desire of Food, in
order to their own Preservation, or Lust, to
propagate their Species, prompts them to
fight, and sometimes to destroy each other;
the time of which Contention, is yet but
small, in comparison of the greater part of
their Lives, in which they are observed to
live in peace: And that all Animals are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
by Nature, to prosecute and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the Common Good of their own
Species, by the same Causes that preserve
the Lives of each of them in particular, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the great Love and Kindness,
which Creatures of the same Species, but of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53522:83"/>
different Sexes, express towards each other,
and by virtue of which, they perform the
Act of Generation, so highly grateful and
pleasing to each other, and thereby propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
their Off-spring; which when brought
forth, they love and defend, as part of
themselves, unless some unusual Distemper
intervene, which may sometimes disturb or
change these natural Propensions; as when
Sows or Rabbets eat or destroy their young
ones; which happening but seldom, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be accounted among the Diseases
of the Brain, or Distempers of the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
than to be ascribed to their natural
State, or Constitution; and does no more
contradict this general Law of Nature, than
the ascent of Water in a Pump, does op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that general Rule of the constant
descent of heavy Bodies. So that we may,
for all that, affirm, That the Procreation
of their young, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> or natural
Affection they have for them, and desire of
breeding them up, 'till they are able to
shift for themselves, are seldom or never
separated; for Preservation is but, as it
were, the Generation of the same Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
still continued. So that the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causes excite Animals to the one, as
well as the other. But it is evident, That
their Off-spring can neither be generated,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53522:84"/>
or preserved, unless those of different Sexes
do, for some time, maintain Peace, and a
Co-habitation with each other, which in
many others of them, continues much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the bare time of Generation,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> for the whole season of Coupling
and Breeding up of their young ones; and in
divers others, as Doves, Pigeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This
Affection continues (like Marriage) as long
as their Lives. And that Creatures are
excited to generate their like, from the
same natural Causes for which their own
Preservation is procured, appears from this
anatomical Observation, that part of the
same nutritious Juice passes into the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of the Body, and the rest to the
Propagation of Seed; and the whole
Circulation of the Blood, with the Causes
that produce and promote it, as the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scular
force of the Heart, and that strange
and wonderful Artifice of the Valves in the
Veins, do by one and the same Action,
serve for the particular Nutrition of the
Animal, and also perform the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Duty of Propagation of the Species,
whilst it does, at the same time, send down
part of that matter to the Spermatick Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
out of which the Seed is produced.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53522:84"/>Â§. 13. But leaving the nicer Disquisition
of these anatomical Observations to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists
and Physicians, I shall only add
this one Observation, That it is evident
that all Animals are, by these means, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to the Love of those of a different
Sex, and also of their own Off-spring, and
so are brought to impart some of that
Self-love, with which they are first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
to others of their own kind, from
an irresistible instinct of Nature: And hence
it is truly observed of Men, That after they
are married, and have got Children, they
are more prone to, and sollicitous after
Peace than before; but that this desire of
Propagation, disposes Men to a greater
Affection towards those of the Female Sex,
is so evident, that it needs no proof. But
since Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and others of his Opinion, do
grant these Observations, concerning the
natural Propensions of Creatures to be
true, but are wont to evade them, by
affirming, That they only proceed from
the sole Love of their own Pleasure and
Satisfaction; and that all the Actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from thence, tend to no higher
end than the Love and Preservation of
themselves; as I do not in this part of the
Discourse, intend to dispute, so have I not
omitted to answer this Objection in the last
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53522:85"/>
Chapter, which is designed on purpose for
answering all those Objections that can
well be made against our Definition of the
Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="14">Â§. 14. The last general Observation to
be drawn from the Nature of Living
Creatures, may be taken from that Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Pleasure they take and enjoy in
those Actions and Passions that tend to the
Common Good of their own Kind, since it
is very well known to Naturalists, that in
those sweeter Passions of Love, Desire,
Hope, Joy, (especially when employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
any great Good towards others) the
vital Motions of the Blood and Heart are
then highly helped and promoted. So
that the Veins and Arteries are filled with
a milder and nobler Juice, whilst brisker
and more active Spirits are thereby genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Circulation of the Blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
all the other animal Functions, are
more easily and nimbly performed. So that by
those very Affections by which they do
good to Animals of their own Kind, they
themselves are also satisfied and delighted,
and as far as they feel this naturally rooted
in their very Natures, they must needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to these Affections so highly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to their own Happiness and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whereas, on the contrary, in Hatred,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53522:85"/>
Envy, Fear, and that Sadness and Ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
which necessarily springs from those
sour and immoderate Passions; the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Blood is obstructed, and the
Heart rendred more heavy, and unapt to
motion. So that it thereby expels the Blood
with greater difficulty in its Systole, from
whence proceeds meagerness and paleness
of the Countenance, with innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
to the whole Oeconomy of
the Body, but chiefly in the Functions of
the Brain and Nerves, such as are those
Diseases which are attributed to the Spleen,
deep Melancholy, and Discontent. But
these things being rather of a medicinal
Consideration, I shall but only just mention
them, though the Writings of Physicians may
yield us divers Examples of such who have
hastened their own Fate, through immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Envy and Regret, that they could
not satisfie their Malice or Revenge; of
which I may chance to give you a taste
when I come to consider the Sanction
of the Law of Nature by Punishments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the undue and immoderate
exercise of those Passions.</p>
               <p n="15">Â§. 15. But as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and his Disciples
cannot deny these Natural Propensions in
Brute Creatures towards mutual Concord,
so they have no other way to evade these
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53522:86"/>
Instances, but by supposing some things
in Man's Nature, that render him worse
Natur'd, and more unmanageable than
Bears, Wolves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That so being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in a perpetual state of War, they can
no way be kept from destroying each other,
but by some Common Supreme Power set
over them to keep them all in awe; which
Arguments, and the Answers to them, since
by their length they would too much
perplex the Connexion of this Discourse,
I shall refer you to the Second part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I hope I have made it appear, that there
is nothing in Man's Nature considered as
an Animal, that ought to be governed by
right Reason, (and in which alone he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
other Creatures) that can lay any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon him of being more fierce, and
unsociable than Brutes.</p>
               <p n="16">Â§. 16. Having now dispatched these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and easie Observations concerning
Man, considered as a meer Body, and also
such as concern his Nature as an Animal,
tending to prove, that the endeavour of
the Common Good of his own Species,
was one great End and Design of God in
His Creation. I come in the next place to
consider those particulars, in which the
Nature of Man excels that of Brutes, and
whereby he is rendred much more capable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53522:86"/>
than they of promoting, and performing this
great End, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common Good of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Agents: which I shall divide into
two Heads, either those belonging to the
Body, or else to the Soul or Mind; as to
the former, though there are divers Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical
Observations, made by curious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomists
and Learned Physicians, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the differences between the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the inward parts, or vessels in Men
and Brutes; yet I shall take notice of no
more, than what are absolutely necessary
to our purpose, and which may serve to
shew, what are the natural Causes of that
Excellency and Superiority, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
found in Humane Intellects, above
those of Brutes. The first of which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
may be drawn from the large
quantity of brains which is found in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies, and which bears a much
greater proportion in respect of their bulk,
than in any other Creatures; for though
the weight of an ordinary Humane Body,
does seldom exceed above a fourth part of
that of a Horse or Bull; yet for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and government of so much a smaller
Body, Nature hath allowed him near dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the quantity of brains, <hi>viz.</hi> about the
weight of four or five pounds, so that there
is eight times as much brains, appointed for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53522:87"/>
the government of the like bulk in a Man,
as in an Ox or Horse. And though the
Carcases of the largest Sheep and Hogs, do
often weigh near as much as a Humane
Body: yet their brain is not above an
eighth part of the weight in proportion to
ours; which seems to be thus ordain'd by
Nature, that by reason of the greater large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Vessels, the Animal Spirits should
be prepared in greater plenty, and also have
more room to work, and so should become
more lively and vigorous in Man, than in
other Creatures; since all the Nerves do
either spring from the brain, or else from
the Spinal Marrow which is continuous, and
of the same substance with it; whence it
may follow that this larger quantity, and
consequently greater strength of brain in
a Man above other Creatures, was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to serve him to direct, and govern that
greater variety of Motions and Actions
depending thereupon, with a more exact care
and deliberation.</p>
               <p n="17">Â§. 17. A second Observation to prove,
that Man is a Creature ordained by God
for a fuller and more constant Association
with those of his own Kind, (which also
tends to the promoting of the Common
Good of his Species) than other Creatures,
may be taken from the natural Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53522:87"/>
of his Blood, and Spermatick Vessels,
by which his Appetite to Copulation is not
confined (as in most other Creatures) to
some certain times, but are equally the
same at all seasons of the Year; from whence
proceeds a desire of Marriage, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Cohabitation with one, or more Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
from whence must likewise follow a
more constant generation of their Off-spring,
and a more lasting care of them when ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
and brought forth. For whereas
Brutes quit the care of their Young, and
drive them away from them as soon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they are able to shift for themselves;
Man alone loves and cherishes his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
and continues his love and care of
them as long as they Live, and still loves
them the more the longer they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with them, and the more care and
pains they have bestowed on their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and so likewise Man is the only Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we know of, that makes any returns
for this care, by Acts of Duty and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
towards his Parents; for as for the
Gratitude of Storks to their Sires or
Dams when old, I look upon it as an old
Fable.</p>
               <p n="18">Â§. 18. Lastly, I shall consider the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Frame and Structure of the Hand in
Man, which though I grant it not peculiar
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53522:88"/>
to him alone; all Creatures of the Ape or
Monky kind, having their fore-paws very
like it, and in many Actions using them to
the same ends, both in feeding themselves,
and carrying their Young ones; yet since
we see our Hands were not given us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Feet to go upon, (as in them) we
may justly conclude, that they were Fram'd
for some Higher and Nobler Use, than
our bare Preservation, or the hurting
or destroying of others. Since if God had
ordained them only for this end, sharp
Teeth, Claws and Horns, would have done
much better, and would have saved us the
trouble of making Swords, Spears, and
such like Instruments, not only of self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
but destruction; whereas we find
that by the help of our Hands, directed
by our reason, we are able to do much
more than any of those weak silly Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
can do with their Paws, since they
cannot serve them to make any of those
ordinary Instruments, or Utensils of Life,
which even the most Barbarous Nations
cannot be without; or so much as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
to each other, many of those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
helps and assistances, which Men
by means of their Hands do daily afford
each other. So that if we consider the
Ordinary use of these Members, especially
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53522:88"/>
in labouring Men and Mechanicks, we shall
find, that they do not only serve for their
own Sustenance and Preservation, but also
for the benefit and maintenance of many
others of their own kind, who cannot well
Subsist without the manual Labour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And though I grant this noble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
the Hand, is often abused by
wicked and violent Men, to make unjust
Wars, and commits Murders and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and by lesser Thieves to pick Pockets,
Pilfer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that without this they
could never commit such Villainies; yet
doth it not follow, that their Hands were
bestowed upon them by God for that end.
Since if He intended the Common Good
and Happiness of Mankind, as His great
end, He never could intend that these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
should be made use of to a quite
contrary design, <hi>viz.</hi> their Ruine and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
So that whoever will but strictly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all this, cannot but confess, that we are
made and ordained to depend upon each
others assistance, and that Man was Created
for a higher purpose than his own single
Self-preservation.</p>
               <p n="19">Â§. 19. Which may be farther made out
from the natural Constitution of Humane
Nature, as that no Man is born Self-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
or able to procure all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53522:89"/>
for his bare Subsistence, much less for
a quiet or pleasant Life, but needs the
Assistance of others to breed him up whilst
an Infant, or to tend him when he is sick,
old, or unable to help himself; or if it be
sometimes possible for a time, yet it must
be with great hardship and scantiness, that
any Man's own single Labour, unassisted
with the Help of others, can provide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
all the Necessaries of Life. Whence
first arises another necessity of Marriage
in the state of Nature, which is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of a Man and a Woman to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the propagation of their Species,
and breeding up of their Off-springs, and
also for mutual Help, and a joint Provision
of the Necessaries of Life for themselves
and them. And, secondly, a necessity of a
Man's living in concord, or society, with
all other Men, especially those of his own
Nation, or Commonwealth. So that it is
evident, the chief Happiness and Well-being
of Mankind, depends upon their mutual
administration of these Things, as often as
need shall require; that is, upon Acts
of the highest Love and Benevolence, in
order to the Common Good.</p>
               <p>To all which may be added another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
of the great difference in the
Frame of Men's Bodies from those of Brutes,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53522:89"/>
in the upright posture of their progressive
motion; Man alone going upon two Legs,
whereas most other terrestrial Animals go
upon all four, whereby Men have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
use of their Hands, both to help and
assist themselves and others, to a much
greater degree, and in a much more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
manner than what Brutes are able to
perform. But whereas some Atheists have
alledged, That this Posture proceeds rather
from Custom and Example than Nature;
I desire them to shew me any Nation in
the World so barbarous, that doth not go
upon two Legs as well as we: And though
Children, 'tis true, before they can go,
must crawl; yet it is not upon their Hands
and Feet, but Knees: For a Man's Legs
(as is notorious to Anatomists) are so much
longer than his Arms, and are likewise
so set on, that they cannot be brought
to move in Right-Angles with the Arms,
or Fore-legs, as in Brutes: And though I
grant that some Beasts, as Apes, Monkeys,
and Bears, can sometimes go upon their
Hind-feet, yet is not this constant; but as
soon as the present Necessity is over, they
soon return to their natural posture. To
conclude, I think I may leave it to any
indifferent Reader to judge, whether from
all these natural Observations from the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53522:90"/>
Frame of Humane Bodies, and the Nature of
their Passions, it doth not evidently appear,
That Man's Happiness and Subsistence in this
Life, was not designed by GOD to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon his own particular sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or the meer satisfaction of his present
Appetites and Passions, restrained to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
without any Consideration of others
of his own Kind, but was rather intended
for the Common Good and Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole Species of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="20">Â§. 20. Having now dispatched those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Observations that may be drawn from
the Constitution or Frame of Man's Body,
in order to the rendring him capable of
serving the Common Good in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of his Species, I shall proceed to the
next Head before laid down, (<hi>viz.</hi>) those
Excellencies, or Prerogatives, of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Soul, or Mind; and in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
all other Creatures: <q>And, in the first place,
Mr.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leviath.</hi> Part I. Chap. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>H.</hi> very well observes,
That it is peculiar to the
Nature of Man, to be inquisitive into the
Causes of the Events they see; and that
upon the sight of any thing that hath a
beginning, to judge also that it had a
Cause which determined the same to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
when it did: And also whereas there
is no other Felicity amongst Beasts, but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53522:90"/>
the enjoying their daily Food, Ease, and
Lust, as having little or no foresight of
the time to come for want of Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Memory of the Order, Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and Dependance of the Things
they see. Man alone observes how one
Event hath been produced by another;
and therein remembers <hi>the Antecedence and
Consequence.</hi>
                  </q> Whence he certainly must
be endued with a larger Capacity, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the natures of Things without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and is also able to make more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and exact Searches into their Causes
and Effects, than the most sagacious Brutes;
who though they are endued with some
few Appetites, or Inclinations, towards
those Things that are necessary for their
Preservation, and an Aversion for others
that are hurtful to them; yet this seems
to proceed from some natural instinct, or
impression, stampt by GOD on their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Natures, and not from Reason or
Deliberation: As, young Wild-Ducks (they
say) will run away from a Man, as soon
as they are hatch'd; and Chickens know
the Kite, though they never saw her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and this not from any Experience or
Rational Deduction. But as for Man, it
is his Faculty alone, to proceed from some
known Principles, to draw Rational De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53522:91"/>
or Conclusions, which were not
known before: The exercise of which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
we call Right Reason, or Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
which though I grant is not born
with him, and so is not a Property belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him as a meer Animal (since we see
Children, 'till they come to some Years,
and Fools, and mad Folks act without it
so long as they live) yet is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Artificial, (as some would have it)
since all Persons of Years of Discretion,
and who will give themselves leisure to
think, may attain to a sufficient degree of
it, for the well-Government of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in order to their own Preservation,
and the discovering that Duty they owe to
GOD and the rest of Mankind: Which
Notions being peculiar to Man, and also
common to the greater part of Mankind,
either from Men's own particular Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
or Rational Deductions; or else
from the Instructions of others, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
first found out such Rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
and taught them to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or Scholars, with their first Elements
of Speech, come, in process of time (having
forgot when those early Notions were first
instill'd into them) to be taken for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Idea's: So that I doubt they have
been, by too many, (who have not well
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53522:91"/>
considered their Original) mistaken for
Idea's, or Notions impressed by GOD up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Souls.</p>
               <p>But leaving this, of which others have
said enough, it cannot be denied but that
from this Faculty of deducing Effects from
their Causes, Man hath been always able to
find out sufficient Remedies for his own
natural Weakness, by the Invention of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Arts, such as Physick and Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
for his Preservation and Cure, when
sick or hurt: And also those of a more
publick Nature, such are the Knowledge of
Policies, or the well-Government of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weals,
of Navigation, Warfare, or the
Art Military, for his Happiness and defence,
as a Sociable Creature. So that, though
Man is born naked, and without those
natural defences and Weapons, with which
divers Brutes are furnished by Nature;
yet by the power of this Faculty, he is
able, not only much better to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the violence and injury of the
Weather, by providing himself with Cloths,
Houses, and Victuals before-hand, since Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath not made him to live like Beasts
upon those Fruits of the Earth, which it
spontaneously produces, but can also tame,
subdue, and kill the strongest, fiercest, and
cunningest Brutes, and make them subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53522:92"/>
to those Ends and Designs for which
he pleases to employ them: So likewise from
this Faculty of Judging of Consequences
from their Antecedents, and foreseeing the
Probability or Improbability of future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
he thereby distinguishes between
real and apparent Goods; that is, between
such Things that may please for the present,
and do afterwards hurt him; and those
which though they may seem displeasing
for a time, yet may after do him a greater
Benefit; which Principles, since they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Foundations of all Morality, and the
Laws of Nature, which we now treat of,
it will not be amiss here particularly to set
down, as the Grounds of what I have to
say on this Subject.</p>
               <p n="21">Â§. 21. First, It hath been already proved,
That every Animal is endued with a Natural
Principle, whereby it is necessarily inclined
to promote his own Preservation and Well-being
(yet not excluding that of others of
their own Kind) that therefore which most
conduces to this end, is called a natural
Good; and, on the contrary, that which
is apt to obstruct and hinder it, is evil.
Among which Goods and Evils, there are
several kinds or degrees, according as Things
are endued with more or less fitness or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to promote or hinder this End. All
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53522:92"/>
which, may be reduced to these plain
<hi>Maxims,</hi> or <hi>Propositions,</hi> as I have taken
them out of Dr. <hi>Moor</hi>'s <hi>Enchiridion Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>;
so that I have collected these <hi>Axioms,</hi>
and put them together in this method, as
they are represented by those excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
above-mentioned, that you may see
them all at one view; though I grant there
are many other natural Truths, which are also
useful to prove what Actions are productive
of the Common Good, divers of which we
have given you dispersedly in these two Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters.</p>
               <p>Principle I.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>THe lessening or escaping of an Evil, is
to be reckoned under the Notion
of Good.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle II.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The lessening or loss of Good, is to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
under the Notion of Evil.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle III.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That which is Good, is to be chosen; that
which is Evil, to be avoided.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>The greater Good is to be preferred before
the less; and a less Evil to be endured,
rather than a greater.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Such Things, or Events, whether Good or
Evil, as will certainly come to pass, may
fall under Computation, and be estimated
according to their several Degrees as well
as Things present: And the same likewise is
for such Things as may probably come to pass,
though this Probability may be somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
as it is counted a valuable Thing, and
may be estimated at a certain rate; for a Man
to be one amongst four or five equal Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
for an Office, or to be the fourth or
fifth Expectant of an Inheritance; and though
in such Cases there may be the odds of three
or four to one, yet the Price that is set upon this,
may be so proportioned, as either to reduce
the Purchase to an equality, or make it at
least a very advantageous Bargain.</p>

               <p>Principle VI.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>A present Good may reasonably be parted
with, upon a probable Expectation of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53522:93"/>
Good, which is much greater, and more
excellent.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle VII.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>A present Evil is to be endured, for the
avoiding of a probable future Evil which is far
greater.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle VIII.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The greater the Evil, the more reason there
is to venture the loss of a greater Good, or
the suffering of a less Evil for the escaping
it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle IX.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is better to be without any Good, than
by the enjoyment of it to endure an Evil, as
great or greater than that Good comes to.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And these last Principles respecting our
selves, may serve to produce Prudence,
Temperance, and Fortitude in our Minds;
the rest that follow, respect our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, and are the Foundation of all
Right and Wrong among Men.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>We ought to pursue the Chiefest, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good, with the highest; and all less
or subordinate Goods, with a less Affection,
or Desire: Neither ought we to make the
Highest, or Common Good, subordinate to the
Meaner, or middle Goods, or the middle
Goods to the least.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle XI.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whatsoever Good you would have done to
your self, in such and such Circumstances, you

than that another should thereby live mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle XVI.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If it is a Publick, as well as a Private Good,
for any one to have enough wherewith to live
happy; it follows from the same Rule, That it
is doubly better, when there is sufficient for
two Men; and by the same Rule of Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a thousand times better if there be sufficient
for a thousand to live happy: So that at last,
from the same Principle, it must be confessed,
That if all the Men in the World, or all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
could live happily, it were the greatest
Good we could suppose them capable of.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>It is necessary to the Publick Good, That
every Man's Right and Property be allowed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53522:95"/>
him, and its free Vse or Possession be likewise
permitted him, without any Injury or Molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from others, though it must be granted,
that a Man may so behave himself, as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is his, whether by Possession, Gift, or
Purchase; may lawfully cease to be so, as a
Punishment for his Crimes, in transgressing
this great Law of Nature, of endeavouring the
Common Good.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Principle XVIII.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is better to Obey God, declaring His Will
to us by the true Principles of Natural Reason,
than our own unreasonable Lusts and Passions,
or the wicked desires or Commands of Men.</p>
               </q>
               <p>These and the like Principles may fitly
be called Natural, as well as Moral Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms,
as being the true results of Natural
Reason, and are so clear and manifest of
themselves, that if any one will consider
them without prejudice, or being byass'd
by Passion, or too much Self-love, they
will not need a long train of Arguments
to prove them; since they appear true and
evident at the first Proposal. So also these
Moral Principles, considered as Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
declaring the Connexion of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions, with the Natural effects that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53522:95"/>
depend upon them; as for example, when
they shew us any Action which will most
certainly conduce to our own, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
happiness, and that it appears to be
not only our Duty but Interest to perform
them. These Principles thus considered,
with relation to our future Actions, may
be called Practical Dictates, since they do
not only shew us the highest End we can
propose to our selves, in order to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and future happiness; but do also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us to the choice of the fittest means to
attain it.</p>
               <p>But I think it doth sufficiently appear,
that we are not only able to form a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
Idea of this Common Good of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings; but also from the faculty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the likeness of our own Nature with
that of all other Men, can also frame an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
or complex Idea of a Species, or
kind of Creatures agreeing in the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Properties, and requiring the same
things for their Happiness and Subsistence
as himself. Note that I do not mean by
this, any adequate Idea of the true Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Nature of Mankind, since of this (as
of all other substances) we have no other
knowledge but by their sensible qualities,
therefore I mean only here an <hi>Idea fori,</hi> or
such a common and inadequate Idea of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53522:96"/>
Nature of Man, as serves us for all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rules of Life, which Idea he can give
a name to, and call mankind, and so comes
to consider, and understand all the Causes
and means, not only of his own Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Happiness, but that of all other
men's, considered as an aggregate Body.
And from thence is able to draw divers
Conclusions concerning the proportion, and
degrees of men's natural Good or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
according to the Principles before laid
down; till he at last arrive at this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Idea of the Common Good of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings, as the highest and noblest
that he can attain unto, and which is most
inseparably conjoyned with his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Conservation and Happiness. But
whereas God hath Created other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to act for their own present Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Preservation, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of that of others: He hath made
man alone, not only able to contribute to
the good and Preservation of his own kind,
but hath also made him sensible of this
Ability: and I shall farther shew in this
Discourse, that he hath laid a sufficient Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
on him to exert it.</p>
               <p n="22">Â§. 22. Another faculty of the Rational
Soul, and only proper to Man as a sociable
Creature, is, That of Speech, or expressing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53522:96"/>
our Notions by significant Words or Sounds;
which though it be not born with us, yet
however may be reckoned amongst the
Natural faculties of Mankind, as well as
going with two legs; since we find no
Brute Creatures capable of it, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them are endued with Tongues
like ours, and that divers Birds can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
whole Sentences, yet have they no
notion of what they say: whereas there is
no Nation, though never so Barbarous, but
hath the use of Speech. And to shew you
farther, how natural some sort of Speech
is to Mankind, I have heard of two young
Gentlemen that were Brothers, (and I
knew one of them my self) who though
born deaf, and consequently dumb; yet
by often and long Conversation with each
other, came to frame a certain Language
between themselves, which though it seemed
perfect Gibberish to the standers by, yet
by the sole motion of their Lips and other
signs, they perfectly understood each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which was likewise evident from this,
that in the dark they were not able to
converse at all. So that this faculty seems
to have been bestowed by God on Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
not for his Preservation as a meer
Animal, Since divers Brutes are able to
subsist for more years without it; and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53522:97"/>
therefore seems to be intended to render
Man a Sociable Creature, and who was by
this Faculty to benefit others of his own
kind, as well as himself; for we are not
only hereby able to impose certain Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
names to particular things; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
first framed Universal Idea's, can like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
give names to them, as to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Idea applicable to all particular Men in
the World, we can give the name of Man;
and herein consists the main difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Men and Brutes, and not in Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination
alone. Since I suppose even
Brutes have right Idea's of those Objects
they have received by their Senses; and
can likewise inferr, or reason right about
them: As when a Dog by often seeing his
Master take down his stick before he goes
abroad, does thence argue when ever he
does so, that his going abroad will follow,
expressing his Joy by barking and leaping:
yet we cannot find that Brutes have any
general or complex Idea's, much less names
for them, having no more but a few Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
signs, whereby to express their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Appetites and Passions; but the main
benefit of Speech seems to respect others
more than our selves, since we are hereby
able to instruct them in many Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
necessary for their Happiness and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53522:97"/>
Preservation, and also to advise and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
them in all Civil and Moral Duties;
and there is scarce any one so Brutish, who
is not sensible that in the exercise of this
Faculty, consists one of the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Humane Life, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Conversation:
and supposing Men in a state of War, I
do not see how they could ever well get
out of it again, were it not for Treaties
and Articles of Peace; but must (like game
Cocks and Bulls) fight it out, till one side
were either quite destroyed, or forced to
run away, and quit that Territory or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where they Liv'd.</p>
               <p n="23">Â§. 23. Nor can we omit another great
benefit we receive from Speech, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
the Invention of Letters, by which we are not
only able to Register our present Thoughts
for our own remembrance; but can like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Profit and Instruct, not only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but also all future Generations; by
Books or Writings, as we do now make
use of the Knowledge and Experience of
those who dyed, some Thousands of Years
before we were born. But since Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
and others, have made some Objections
against the benefit of Speech and Letters,
as that they tend oftentimes to promote
false Opinions, and War amongst Mankind.
Granting it to be so, it is no more an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53522:98"/>
against the benefits we receive by
them, than it were to say, that the Air,
Water, or Food, (the only means of Life)
are hurtful to Mankind; since by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
course of Nature, or else our own
Intemperance, they often become the causes
of Plagues, Surfeits, and divers other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
whereby Mankind is destroyed. Yet
since that Author hath made the use of
Speech, one great Reason why Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live so peaceably as Brutes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fansies they must be in a Natural state
of War: I shall therefore referr the Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to the Second Part, since my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is not here to Argue, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct.</p>
               <p n="24">Â§. 24. Men do also far exceed Brutes in
their Rational or discoursive Faculty, as
appears in the Knowledge of Numbers, or
Collecting divers single things into one
Total Summ, which we call Arithmetick;
so necessary for all Affairs of a Civil Life,
and the Duties of distributive Justice.
And though I grant it is an Art, and
that divers Barbarous Nations want that
exact knowledge of it which we have;
yet by reckoning upon their fingers they
have a sufficient use of it, as much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for their purpose or business; and
if they did but apply their Minds to it, I
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53522:98"/>
doubt not but that they would arrive to
the same perfection in Arithmetick as we
do. But I look upon this Faculty as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Mankind, since we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Brutes to have any knowledge of it.
Thus if from Bitches or Sows, you take
away never so many of their Young ones;
yet if you leave them but one or two, they
do not miss the rest; which shews that they
have no Idea's of Numbers, whatever they
may have of Quantity.</p>
               <p n="26">Â§. 26. To this Observation may likewise
be added as a Consequence thereof, that
Faculty so proper to Mankind, of measuring
the quantities of Bodies, the distances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and the Proportions they bear
to each other, which Science we call Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
or Mathematicks; which Arts were
certainly invented by Man, as a Creature
intended for a Sociable Life; since on some
of these depend most Trades, all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
Architecture, Navigation, and most
of the Rules of distributive Justice, with
other Arts needless here to be set down.
So that whoever will but seriously reflect
upon the excellency of these Sciences, as
well in the certainty of their Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as in the vast and Stupendious effects
they produce; cannot but acknowledge
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53522:99"/>
that our Rational Faculty, exceeds that of
Brutes by many degrees.</p>
               <p n="27">Â§. 27. But there yet remain behind two
of the greatest Prerogatives of Man's Soul,
and in respect of which alone he is made
a sit Subject of the Law of Nature. The
first is freedom in Actions, or the power
of doing or forbearing any Action; which
does not only consist in indifferent things,
as when a Man of two different Objects,
chuses which of them he pleases; but is
also able to chuse a greater Good, before
a less, and does likewise often preferr
(though unjustly) a present less Good
grateful to his Senses, before a greater
Good approved of by his Reason; yet
however it cannot be denyed, but that
Man by the power of his Reason, is able
to move and excite his Passions of Love
and Pity, when he sees Objects that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his help and assistance: Nay, can
also by deliberation, command and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
those domineering Passions of Lust,
Anger, and Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they
happen to prompt him to Actions that
are contrary to his own true Good, and
that of the rest of Mankind. And lastly,
Man being capable to comprehend all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
goods, and to add them together
into one Sum, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53522:99"/>
Good of Rationals, as the best and
most noble End he can imploy himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
is also able to divert his thoughts
from his own private pleasure and profit
alone; and fix them upon the care of his
Relations and Friends, or the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good of his Country. And though
I grant it is difficult, exactly to explain
after what manner we exert this Faculty,
since the Nature and Actings of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Soul, are very abstruse; yet I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to every Man's own Heart, whether
he does not find in himself, not only a
Liberty to do or forbear indifferent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
such as going abroad or staying at home;
but likewise such as are certainly better by
a Rational estimate, if he will but give
himself time to consider, and weigh the
Nature and Consequence of them, or else
to what purpose is he sorry? Or why does
he repent the having done any foolish,
wicked, or rash Action? Since if all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were absolutely necessary, it were as
idle and insignificant as if he should be
sorry, that he were not made a Prince,
rather than a private Person; or instead
of a Prince that he was not an Angel.
So that certainly, God would not then
have endued Man with these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
peculiar to him, <hi>viz.</hi> That of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53522:100"/>
or a Reflection upon the Good
or Evil of his own Actions, and that of
Repentance or Sorrow, for having done
amiss, altogether in vain, since both were
needless, if all Actions were a-like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated.</p>
               <p n="28">Â§. 28. But the last and highest Faculty,
and whereby Man's Nature is chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from that of Brutes, is, when
by the force of his Reason, (acting by the
method and means here describ'd) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
sensible of the existence, Providence,
and other Perfections of the Deity; from
whence we may inferr, that it is highly
improbable, if not impossible, that this
most Wise and Powerful Being, which we
call God, should have Ordained any Power
or Faculty in Man's Soul to no purpose.
If therefore He hath Endued Man alone
of all his Creatures, with the Knowledge
of his own Existence and Attributes, as far
as is necessary for us Finite Creatures to
conceive of them; since I grant we are
not able to comprehend Infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is not likely, that God should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Man alone with this so excellent a
Knowledge, for so useless an End as bare
Speculation; which alone is of no great
Use or Benefit, either to himself, or the
rest of Mankind, whose Good and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53522:100"/>
God chiefly intended in their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So that indeed we cannot apprehend
any End more worthy his Divine Wisdom
and Goodness, in Creating us capable of
these Idea's, than what is Practical, that is,
as it some way serves to direct our Actions,
as free and voluntary Agents towards the
obtaining our own Good and Happiness,
Conjoyn'd with that of other Rational
Beings. Nor can any Actions render us
more Happy, than those that testifie our
high Veneration of God's Infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and a deep Sense of his Goodness
towards us, and whereby we may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to an entire Obedience to his Laws,
whether Natural or Reveal'd, whenever
they are made known to us; so that if it
can be prov'd, that these Dictates of right
reason, called the Laws of Nature, derive
their Authority from God as a Law-giver,
and were intended by Him for the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
and Preservation of Mankind, and
as Rules whereby he would have us direct
all our Actions to this great End; there
can be no doubt but we lie under a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Obligation to observe them; and to
prove this, will be the next and greatest
part of our task.</p>
               <p n="29">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53522:101"/>Â§ 29. But before I undertake this, it will
not be amiss to Treat a little, concerning
those Attributes of the Deity, as far as we
can have any Idea's of them; since from the
consideration of the Nature of things, and
also of our own Humane Nature, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be carry'd on to consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God Himself; and if from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Universe, we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Him of Infinite Power; so from His
Acting and Ordaining all things, for the
best and Worthiest End, we may likewise
affirm Him to be also Infinitely Wise and
Good; so that His Infinite Power always
Acting for the best and wisest Ends, is still
so limitted by His Infinite Wisdom and
Goodness, that it cannot Act any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the Common Good of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings, of which Himself is the chief;
and from hence proceeds the certainty of
the Law of Nature, as also our perpetual
Obligation to it. For as I will not affirm
that God could not have made the World,
and the Things therein, after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than He hath done; so since He hath
made it in the Order we now find it, this
great Law of Nature, of endeavouring and
procuring the Common Good of Rational
Beings, is of the same Duration with that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53522:101"/>
of the Universe it self; and so consequently
of constant and perpetual Obligation in
respect of Himself, and all those whom He
hath Ordained to be His Subordinate means,
or Instruments to procure it, especially as
Men, whom He hath made Conscious of
our Duty, and able to Co-operate with
Him for this Great and Excellent End.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§ 1. HAving already in the Two former
Chapters from the Great Book of
Nature, (that is, as well that of
things without us, as of our selves in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and of Mankind in general) made
several Observations for the proving of this
Proposition, That Man was Ordain'd by
God for a Sociable Creature, whose Being,
Preservation and Happiness, was to depend
upon the Assistance and Good-will of God
his Creator, as also those of his own kind;
I come in the next place to shew, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one is oblig'd to a return of the like
Benevolence to others; for we can by no
means be better assured of the like Good-will
from them, than by doing them the
same good Offices, as often as it lies in our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53522:102"/>
Power, which we desire they should do for
us, and that this constitutes the happiest
state Men are capable of in this Life, <hi>viz.</hi>
Peace and Concord, not only among par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Men, but also between all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
and Nations, of which the whole
body of Mankind consists, so that it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appears, that the true and Natural
state of Mankind, is, That of Peace, Love,
or mutual Benevolence, and which indeed
would require no other Rewards, than what
proceeds from it self, (were Man a Creature
always governed by right reason and his
own true Good) Rewards and Punishments
being Ordained for Men, as too often go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by their Passions and Sensual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
and not according to the perfection
of their Rational Nature. Yet since it pleased
God, to Create Man a mixt Creature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of a Body and a Soul, and being too
often drawn aside by Passions, not directed
by right reason, and to stand in need of
Punishments as well as Rewards, to keep
him to his duty; thence arises a necessity of
His dealing with Man as a Legislator, and
of giving him certain natural Laws or Rules,
whereby to govern his Actions, with certain
Penalties and Rewards annext to them; which
Laws may be very well contracted into one
single Proposition, or practical Conclusion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53522:103"/>
drawn from the Nature of God, our own
Nature, and that of things without us, by
the Observations already laid down, <hi>viz.
That God wills or commands, that all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Persons should endeavour the Common
Good of Rational Beings, as the great End
for which they were Created, and in pursuance
of which, consists their own true Good or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
as in its neglect or violation, their
greatest Misery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. Having given you this summary descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Laws of Nature, as coming from
its first Cause, God, I shall now explain the
terms therein contain'd, to avoid all Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
and Exception. (1) <hi>By Wills and
Commands,</hi> I do not mean any Commands by
Words, that being the method of God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and not Natural Will, and so
is not the Subject of this Discourse; and
therefore I do here only understand that
Will or Command of God, which is to be
learned from the Consideration of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, our own, and that of all other
things, consisting not in Words, but in Idea's;
that is true Conclusions drawn from right
Reason; but that words are not always Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to a Law, or that it cannot be made
known to the Subjects, without some set
form of Speech, may appear by Persons
born Deaf and Dumb, whom we often find
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53522:103"/>
to have Notions of a God, and a Law of
Nature, though they were not convey'd in
their Minds by Words or Writing, for it is
sufficient if the Will of the Legislator may
be discovered by any other sit means or
signs, especially when (as in this Law we
now treat of) there are such certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments, annexed to their
Observation or Transgression, as may make
it their Interest, rather to observe than trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
them; which is not only visible in
Men but Brutes. Since we see, that by
certain Signs imprinted in their Minds,
by the means of fit Rewards and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;
Elephants, Horses, Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
made Susceptible of Humane Commands,
(and as far as their Natures permit) are
governable by Laws of our Prescribing;
For we can shew them by such signs,
what Actions are to be done or omitted by
them; and certainly God hath not left us
less plain demonstrations of his Will, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to our Duty towards him, from that
Knowledge he hath given us of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,
as also of our own Nature, as I shall
farther prove in this Discourse. <hi>By Rational
Persons,</hi> I mean, all those, though of never
so mean a Capacity, who are able to make
such easie and natural Observations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
as I have already laid down: And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53522:104"/>
therefore Children, under the Years of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
Idiots and Mad-folks, are still to be
excepted from this Law, who not having the
actual use of right reason, are not able to
draw those Observations and Consequences
from the Nature of things, as are already
laid down, and which are necessary for the
right understanding thereof. <hi>By Endeavour,</hi>
I mean all such voluntary Actions, which
Persons of sound Minds can knowingly, and
deliberately perform towards the good of
others, without destroying or hurting their
own true Happiness; which endeavours,
though (by many unforeseen accidents in
the Course of Nature) they may be often
frustrated, and so fail of their intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
yet when we have done the utmost
we are able, we have sufficiently perform'd
our Duty, since no Laws require the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of more, than is in our Power to
perform. <hi>By the Common Good of Rational
Beings,</hi> I understand the collective Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Deity, as the head of them, and
that of all the individual Persons of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
existing together with us, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent
parts or members; and in which
each Man's particular Good and Happiness
is included; since it is impossible to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Happiness of others, as voluntary
Agents, unless each particular Person whose
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53522:104"/>
duty it is so to do, have first a right to
preserve, and make himself happy, jointly
with others in his Proportion, to the whole
Body of Mankind. <hi>By true Good or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
I mean, all those Goods whether of
Body or Mind, by which Men may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
truly Happy, and contented in this
Life, and in that to come; but in which,
whenever the former stand in Competition
with the latter; the Goods of the Soul are
to be preferred; that is, the good of our
better or Eternal part, before that of our
Body, which is less valuable and temporal.
But I need add nothing here to prove, That
God is the Head of all Rational Beings, and
in what Sence we may be said to procure
or endeavour his Good and Happiness,
since I have spoken so largely of that in the
Preface to this Discourse; and as for the
difference between Natural and Moral good,
I have said so much concerning it in the
Second Part, in the Confutation of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s
Sixth Principle, <hi>that by Nature nothing is
Good or Evil</hi>; that it would be impertinent
to repeat it here. I shall now prove, that this
Proposition, containing this Description of
the Law of Nature is true, that is, agreeable
to the Will of God, as far as it is declared to
us; by what we are able to know of His
Divine Nature, or can collect from our own,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53522:105"/>
and the Natures of all things without us, and
that all the Moral Duties we owe, either to
God, ourselves, or others, are contained in, or
may be reduced to this one Proposition, Of
our endeavouring the Common Good of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals;
in order to which, I shall lay down
these Propositions.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. 1. That God in the first place Wills
and Intends His own Glory and Service, and
in the next, the Good and Preservation
of all Mankind, and of all particular Persons
therein contain'd, as far as consists with that
frail and Mortal state wherein He hath Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. This Proposition hath already
been made out in the First Part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
wherein I have proved, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and continuance of all the Species
of Creatures, (and consequently of Mankind
as one of them) does wholly depend upon
God's Providence. And as for the Individuals,
or particular Persons, since God's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is Infinite, and extends even to the
least things; and also that of these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
each Species of Creatures is made up,
and consists. It is likewise as evident, that
God designs their Good and Preservation,
as well as that of the whole kind; though I
grant He prefers the Good of the whole Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
before that of the Individuals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the Will of God that all Men of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53522:105"/>
sound Minds, should be made conscious of
this His intention of the Good and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind, and that they should ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
as His Subordinate means, or Instruments
towards this great End. Which I shall prove
thus: 1. It is evident that all Men of sound
Minds, have a notion of the Good and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of others as well as of themselves. 2dly.
That this Notion or Idea, when truly pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will at last extend it self to all Mankind;
for it can never stop short of it, as long as it
may still proceed farther, and find new and
fit Objects to work on; every Individual
Member of Mankind making a part of this
Universal Idea.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Notion of endeavouring the
Common Good of Rational Beings, is not
only possible to be performed, but is also
highly Rational, and the greatest and noblest
End we can imagine or propose to our selves,
as comprehending the Good and Happiness
of the whole System of Rational Beings, and
is also true, <hi>i. e.</hi> agreeable with the Divine
Intellect: which I thus make out, these grounds
being supposed.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. First, It is certain, that all the truths
our Minds are endued with, or capable of,
are from God, since whatever perfection is
found in the effect, must needs have been
first more eminently in its Cause. Therefore
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53522:106"/>
if the Knowledge of Truth be a perfection,
(as doubtless it is) it must be much more so
in God, the Original Cause thereof, so that
if this Idea of the Common Good of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings, as the highest Good we Men are
capable of knowing, it being a clear and
perfect (though complext) Idea, drawn from
the Nature of God and all other things; and
being a Collection of the Good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Deity, and of all other Rational
Agents; it must be true, and consequently
from God. And the Divine Intellect, doth as
certainly agree with our Idea's concerning
it, as it doth when we judge, that the Base of
an Equilateral Triangle, is equal to either of
the <hi>Crura</hi> or Legs. Therefore this Idea of
the Common Good is true, and that it is also
certain, that all Truth is from God, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that He hath made us truly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that he Wills the Good and Happiness
of Mankind; it is likewise as certain, that he
would have us act as Rational Agents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
of this His great design.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. The Second Part of this Proposition
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That God would have us Operate as
his Instruments to this End; will be likewise
as clear when you consider what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said, That God who hath made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in vain, would not have endued us with
an Idea of this Common Good, as the greatest
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53522:106"/>
End we can propose our selves, for mere
Speculation, but rather for some practical
End, in order to our own Good and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
with that of others; especially since
God hath placed it so much in our Power to
promote and procure this Common Good,
since as far as we endeavour the Good and
Happiness of particular Persons, we do so
far contribute our share to that of Mankind,
considered as one aggregate Body. Thus
whatsoever does good to any one Member,
does so far benefit the whole Body; and the
Good and Happiness of an aggregate Body
consisting of divers distinct Members, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in that of each of its parts. So then, if
God intends the End, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Common
Good of Mankind, (as I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
he designs likewise the means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it: Nor can there be any better means,
or fitter Instruments for this End, than the
joint Endeavours of all Men, expressed by
all the Acts of Benevolence and Kindness
towards each other; since it is certain (as
I said before) that Men can contribute more
to the Hurt, or Benefit, of each other, than
all the rest of the Creatures put together.
Therefore as God hath designed the End,
and ordained sufficient means to produce it,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Men's kind and benevolent Actions;
so it is as evident, That he will make use of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53522:107"/>
Men, as the necessary means for this End. Tho'
I grant he hath ordained us to operate, not
only as mechanick Causes, but rather as free
and voluntary Agents to produce it; that
is, as true Subjects to this Law of Nature. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>Parker</hi>'s Demonstration of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> pag. 24.</note> Thus by the same steps
that we arrive at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God the Supreme
Being, we are likewise
brought to an acknowledgment of this his
great Design, of the Common Good of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings. And if from all the wonderful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
and curious Contrivances (obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this last Chapter) drawn from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Things, and Mankind, we cannot
but conclude, That they were so disposed
by a most Wise, Intelligent Being, towards
this great End: And the very same appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
that discover these Things, must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
declare his Intention of making use of
us men, as necessary means thereunto.</p>
               <p n="7">Â§. 7. The last Proposition for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Description of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>
to be true, is this: That GOD having made
this Discovery of his Will unto us, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
lie under a sufficient Obligation, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this great Law of endeavouring this
Common Good: To prove which, I first
suppose that Obligation to an Action enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the natural Law, is the necessary and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53522:107"/>
constant effect thereof, upon every Person
subject to it; and that this immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
from its own Nature, this Law being
always just and right as the Will of GOD,
the Legislator is, from whence it proceeds: So
that I understand Obligation to Active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to be the immediate effect of this
Law, yet that it primarily flows from that
Will of GOD, which ordained this Law,
and made Man a Creature subject to it; as
Heat in us is the immediate Effect or Action
of Fire upon us, but originally both the
Fire and Heat is from the first Cause. Now
there is no legal Liberty left us in the case
of natural Laws, to chuse whether we will
be obliged to the Actions therein comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or rather will submit to the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
attending the Violation thereof; and
although our natural Liberty of Will be not
destroyed thereby, yet we have no Right
left us to determine our selves otherwise
than natural Law directs, because all Moral
Truth, or Rectitude, is comprehended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that Law. But in Humane Laws, because
they may enjoyn something amiss, there a
Right is often left to us to chuse rather to
bear the Penalty, than to obey them, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are obliged rather to obey GOD
than Man) in case they command any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53522:108"/>
contrary to the Divine Law, whether
Natural or Revealed.</p>
               <p n="8">Â§. 8. For the further clearing of this, I
shall premise somewhat to explain this Word
<hi>Obligation,</hi> which the Civilians thus define:
<hi>Obligatio est vinculum Iuris, quo quis astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur
debitum persolvere.</hi> That is, an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is that Bond of Law, whereby every
one is obliged to pay his Debt, or Due:
Which Definition doth well include all sorts
of Obligations, if by the Word <hi>Ius,</hi> or
Law, we understand that Law whose Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
we propose to define. So that by
<hi>vinculum Iuris</hi> in this Definition, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that Bond, or Tye, of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by which every one is obliged to pay
this natural Debt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to perform that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which he owes to GOD his Creator,
by reason of his own Rational Nature, or
else to undergo those Punishments which are
ordained for his Disobedience or Neglect.
So that there is a twofold Tye, or Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in all Laws; the one active in the Debt,
or Duty; the other passive, in a patient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Punishment, in case of any
wilful neglect, or omission thereof: Of both
which, we shall speak in their order.</p>
               <p n="9">Â§. 9. But you are first to take notice, That
none can oblige us to do, or forbear any
Action, but such who have a right to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53522:108"/>
us: So that this Obligation proceeds
from that just Right of Dominion, which a
superiour Power hath over us and our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and as far as we are subject to others,
we are so far under an Obligation to their
lawful Commands, which obliges us to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of that Debt, or Duty, we owe them;
that is, when we are obliged to do, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
any Action from the Will, or Command
of a Supreme Power, or Legislator, to
whom, when sufficiently made known to us,
we are bound to yield Obedience to the
utmost of our Power: And herein consists
the Obligation, or Duty, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of our Actions to a Rule, such as is
declared by the Will of the Legislator. So
that all our Obligation to the Laws of Nature,
is at last resolved into that absolute Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which GOD, as he is the Great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Preserver of Mankind, hath over
us: For I cannot understand a Right (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of Dominion) to be invested or seated
in any Supreme Power, but by virtue of
something which may be called (at least ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically)
a Law. 2. That every Dictate
of the Divine Wisdom, concerning Matter
fit to be established by a Law, is such a Law:
And so <hi>Cicero</hi> (the best Master of Language)
speaks, towards the end of his First Book
<hi>de Legibus.</hi> 3. That the Eternal Wisdom of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53522:109"/>
GOD, contains eminently, or analogically,
in it, all that we can know to be Natural
Law. 4. But to know that it is Natural
Law, or the Dictate of true Reason, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the fittest means to the best End, or
greatest Good, it is necessary to this purpose,
That the Supreme Government of all Things
(and especially of Rational Creatures) should
be in him, who is most able and willing to
pursue and attain that greatest End; that is,
it must be setled in GOD. 5. So that by this
Dictate of Eternal Wisdom, or of performing
all Things for the best End, the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
becomes his Right; and our Knowledge
that this Dictate of Eternal Wisdom is in
him, assures us, That this Right is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fix'd and vested in him. 6. Although
in the method of investigating the Laws of
Nature, as they subsist in our Minds, the
first Law respects the End, and this concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Means, comes in the second place:
Yet in our Thoughts concerning GOD, we
know that infinite Wisdom comprehends all
these Dictates together; and therefore that
the Dictate, or Law, setling Universal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
in GOD, is co-eternal with him;
and so is as early in his Nature, as the first
Natural Law; the Obligation of which, we
are establishing in this Chapter. And here
arises the difference between a Moral Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53522:109"/>
(which is that we now treat of) and
a Civil one, or that by which we are obliged
to Laws in Civil Governments, the former
being in respect to GOD's immediate Will,
as the Supreme Legislator; whereas all the
Duty we owe to our Civil Magistrates, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and Masters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is only in subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to GGD's Will so declared unto us,
and who hath ordained this Obedience for
his own Worship and Glory, and in order
to the Common Good of all Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
and Commonwealths, that is, of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general.</p>
               <p n="10">Â§. 10. Yet I think notwithstanding all we
have said of the Force and Nature of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation,
it may well enough consist with
the natural Freedom of Man's Will, since all
these Considerations do still but excite, not
necessitate Him to act one way or other: For
it is still left in his Power either to chuse that
which is absolutely the best in obeying this
Will of God, or else to preferr a less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Good before it, in the satisfaction of his
Appetites, or Passions: And herein likewise
consists the difference between an Animal
Good, or Evil, and a Moral one; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
being those natural Means conducing to
each Man's preservation, or destruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as a mere Animal, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to God as their Author, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53522:110"/>
Good of Rationals as their Rule. The
latter, that is of all Humane Moral Actions,
or Habits, considered as agreeable, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
unto the Laws of Nature, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by God as a Legislator, and made known
to Man, in order to the Common Good of
Rational Beings; so that they are thus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Good, or Evil, only in respect of their
Conformity, or Disagreement with the Will
of God; and as their Observance, or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect,
brings either Good, or Evil (that is,
Happiness, or Misery) upon us in this Life,
or in that to come. From whence you may
observe the necessity of putting God, in all
our descriptions, or definitions of the Law
of Nature, as the Author thereof: For were
it not for his existence, in whose divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
the Idea's of Moral Good, and Evil,
are eternally established, and into whose will
so ordaining them, they are ultimately to be
resolved. Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s (or rather <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion)
would certainly be true, That there
is nothing morally Good, or Evil, in its own
Nature. And it may here be also observed,
That the great omission of divers Writers on
this Subject, in not placing God as the Cause,
or Author of the Law of Nature, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
hath been perhaps the main, if not
only Reason of that false Assertion, That
the Laws of Nature are not properly so,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53522:110"/>
'till they are established by the Authority of
the Supreme Civil Power; so on the other
side, if it be made evident, That God Wills,
or Commands, all Men should endeavour
the Common Good of Rationals, as the
greatest they are capable of; it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follow, That we lie under a sufficient
Obligation, by all the Tyes of Duty and
Gratitude, to concurr with God's Will and
Design, in pursuing and endeavouring this
great End.</p>
               <p n="11">Â§. 11. But since God hath thought fit to
make Man a Creature consisting of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
and distinct Parts, or Principles, a
Soul and a Body, both capable of Good and
Evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Rewards and Punishments; I
come now to the other part of this Duty, or
Obligation, by which we are bound, by all
the Rational Motives, or Rewards, that
Man's Nature is capable of, to observe this
great Law; and deterred by all the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Evils, or Punishments, from neglecting
or transgressing it: In order to which, I
shall lay down these plain Axioms, drawn
from the Nature of Moral Good and Evil,
which you may find in the Learned Bishop
<hi>Wilkin</hi>'s excellent Discourse of <hi>Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axiom</hi> 1. That which is morally good,
<hi>(i.e.)</hi> agreeable to the Will of God, is to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53522:111"/>
be desired and prosecuted; and that which
is evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> contrary to his Will, is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. The greater congruity there is in
any thing to the Reason of Mankind, and
the greater tendency it hath to promote or
hinder the Perfection of Man's Nature, in
the endeavour of the Common Good; so
much greater degrees it hath of moral Good,
or Evil; and according to which, we ought
to proportion our Inclinations, or Aversions
thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. So that it is suitable both to the
Reason and Interest of Mankind, that all
Persons should submit themselves to God's
Will, upon whom they depend for their
Happiness and Well-being, by doing such
Things as may render them acceptable to
Him, and avoiding those contrary Actions
which may provoke his Displeasure, that is,
in short, in prosecuting the Common Good
of Rational Beings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. Hence the Rational Nature, and
the Perfections belonging to it, being more
Noble than the Sensitive, a moral Good is
to be preferred before an animal Pleasure;
and that which is morally evil, is more to be
avoided, than that which is merely animal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. A present animal Good may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, upon a probable Expectation of a
greater future moral Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53522:111"/>
                  <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. A present Evil is to be endured,
for the probable avoiding of a greater, though
future Evil.</p>
               <p>But since all the Rewards which God can
bestow upon us, for our observing this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Law, of endeavouring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good of Rationals, does only amount
to the truest and highest Happiness that
Man's Nature is capable of; it is fit that we
sufficiently state that Happiness, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it consists: For the clearing of which, I
shall lay down these two plain Propositions.</p>
               <p n="12">Â§. 12. <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. That which gives, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
the Essence of any thing, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
it from all other things, is called the
essential form of that thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. That State, or Condition, by
which the Nature of any thing is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the utmost perfection which it is
capable of, according to its kind, is called
the Chief End, Good, or Happiness of such
a Being: Thus, for Example, (to give you
a Scale, drawn from the Nature of those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
we know to be endued with Life or
Motion) 1. The Nature of Plants consists in
having a vegetative Life, by which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Nourishment and Growth, and are
enabled to multiply their kind. The utmost
Perfection which this kind of Being is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, is to grow up to a state of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53522:112"/>
to continue unto its natural Period,
and to propagate its kind. 2. The Nature
of Brutes (besides what is common to them
with Plants, consists in their being endued
with Faculties, whereby they are capable
of apprehending external Objects, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Pain or Pleasure from them, in order
to their own Preservation, and the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of their Species. The utmost Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of these, consists in mere sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Pleasures; <hi>i. e.</hi> of doing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
such Things as are grateful to their
Appetites and Senses. But the Nature of
Man, (besides what is common to him with
Plants and Brutes, both in the vegetative
and sensitive Life) consists in the Faculty of
Right Reason, whereby he is made capable
of understanding the Law of Nature, and of
its Rewards and Punishments, either in this
Life, or that to come, to induce him to their
Observation, and deterr him from the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of them: Which Sentiments, as no
Creature in this visible World, except Man,
does partake of; so his Chief Good, or
Happiness, consists in the improvement and
perfection of this Faculty; that is, in such
Actions as are most agreeable to Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and as may best entitle him to the
Divine Favour, and afford him the greatest
Assurance of a lasting Happiness, both in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53522:112"/>
this Life, and after it is ended. So that
all the Actions of Man, considered as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and subject to the Law of Nature,
and thereby capable of Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are called Moral, as being directed
by God the Supreme Legislator, to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and most excellent End, <hi>viz.</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good of Rational Beings.</p>
               <p n="13">Â§. 13. Having laid down these Principles
of moral Good and Evil, in order to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and clearing the Nature of this Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and wherein it consists; I shall, in the
next place, particularly declare the Sanction
of this Law, <hi>(viz.)</hi> those Rewards which
God hath ordained for the Observation of
this Law of Nature, of endeavouring the
Common Good, and those Punishments he
hath appointed for its Breach, or Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
But I have already laid down,
That all Obligation upon the Soul of Man,
arises properly from the Commands of some
rightful Superior Power; that is, such a
one who hath not only force sufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
what Evils he pleases upon the Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient;
but, who hath also given us just
Grounds, or Reasons, wherefore he requires
us to determine the natural Liberties of our
Wills, according to his Pleasure; both which,
whenever they meet in any Supreme Power;
and that he hath once signified his Will to us,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53522:113"/>
ought to produce in our Minds not only fear
to offend, but also a love of, and obedience to
his Commands. The former, from the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of his irresistible Power: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from their own intrinseck Goodness, as
also from all those Motives which ought to
persuade us to perform his Will. For as
one who hath no other Reason than down-right
force, why he will have me perform
and submit to his Commands, whether I will
or no, may indeed so far terrifie me, that to
avoid a greater Evil, I may think it best to
obey him; yet that fear once removed, there
will then remain nothing that can hinder me
from acting according to my own, rather
than his Will, or Humour: So on the other
side, he who can give me never so good
Reasons why I ought to obey him; yet if
destitute of Power, to inflict any Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon me for my Disobedience, such
his Commands may, without any outward
inconvenience, be neglected by me, if I
think fit, unless he is endued with sufficient
Power to vindicate the Neglect, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
of his Authority. Therefore the
strictest Sanction which any Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
can give unto its Laws, is, when it is not
only able, but hath also sufficiently declared,
That it will conferr a sufficient share of good
Things, or Rewards, for so doing; and of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53522:113"/>
Evils, or Punishments, upon any breach, or
neglect of its Commands: So though I grant
the whole force of this Obligation is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolved into the Will of the Legislator,
or those to whom the Custody of these
Laws are committed; all which, are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this Law of Nature, since we find
God commanding it, to whom we ought to
yield absolute Obedience; though not in
Right of his irresistible Power alone, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as he hath, by his Eternal Wisdom and
Goodness, in his Creation and Preservation
of us, an absolute Dominion over, and an
undoubted Right to Command us; and
consequently we are obliged to yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Laws, as they are not only
highly reasonable, (being ordained for the
Common Good of Rationals) but are also
established by sufficient Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But since the former seem more
plainly declared to Mankind, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
more agreeable to our Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which should rather delight to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
by Rewards, than terrified by Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
I shall first begin with the natural
Rewards annexed to the Observation of this
great Law of Nature, of endeavouring the
Common Good: Which may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Internal, or External; that is, either in
relation to the Soul alone, or to the Body
and the Soul joyntly considered.</p>

               <p n="18">Â§. 18. And as for that other sort of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
called Chastity, or Continence, I
need not farther to declare how much the
Common Good and Happiness of Mankind
depend upon it, having already shewn di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of those Evils, and Inconveniencies,
that do necessarily follow the contrary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
I shall only add, That it is sufficient
that the commission of this Offence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence,
makes a Man guilty of another's
Sin, as well as his own: Therefore I define
Chastity to be the abstaining from all inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,
or forbidden Lusts, in order to the
Common Good, or for the propagation of
Mankind; and therefore is not only confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the bare forbidding of Fornication,
but also extends it self to that moral Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Contract, which we call Marriage:
So that out of a consideration of this great
End, those promiscuous Copulations between
Brothers and Sisters, and divers other near
Relations, which upon the first Peopling of
the World were lawful because then neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53522:139"/>
for the propagation of Mankind, are
now, for the same Reason, become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;
since without an abhorrence of this
Copulation between Brothers and Sisters, it
were hard, if not impossible, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
of such young Persons, conversing so
constantly and intimately together from
their youth, should be otherwise preserved,
without an early prepossession of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of such promiscuous Copulations. And
hence also I suppose, That Natural Reason
taught most Nations, after Mankind began
to be multiplied upon the Earth; and the
memory of their first original Relation they
had to each other, to be forgotten, to prohibit
Marriage between near Relations, that by
this means new Friendships, and stricter
Bonds of Amity, should be contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Families and Persons not nearly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Blood; from whence a larger diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Friendship and Kindness, proceeding
from this Relation, might be spread amongst
Persons not only of the same Commonweal,
but of divers Nations; and also that those
Factions, and Enmities, which would often
happen between particular Men, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
were they only to marry into their
own Clan, or Tribe, may be prevented;
or if begun, may, by fresh Alliances, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
and taken away. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53522:140"/>
That the Reason of this Vertue of
Chastity, or Continence, can no way be
truly explained, or understood, without a
true knowledge of the End for which it
was ordained, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common Peace, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and Preservation of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="19">Â§. 19. I shall only add somewhat more
concerning that other sort of Temperance,
relating to our seeking after, and acquiring
those outward Goods often conducing,
though not absolutely necessary, to our
Well being, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Riches and Honour;
and therefore the same general Law which
limits our Love towards our selves, in order
to the Common Good, ought also, from the
same Consideration, to limit and regulate
our Desires, both in acquiring and keeping
these Advantages; and therefore they are
to be sought for to no other End, than as
they may render us more capable of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the great End above-mentioned, and to
which they ought always to be subordinate.
The former of these Vertues relating to
Riches, is called Moderation, which is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Care in acquiring and keeping Riches;
of which I need speak no farther, having
sufficiently shewn the Measure and Reason
of it, when I defined Liberality and Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
with their opposite Vices: The other
sort of Temperance relating to Honours, is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53522:140"/>
called Modesty, and may be defined a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
towards our selves, in a reasonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Honours, in order to the Common
Good; and therefore consists in a due Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity,
as well in desiring Honours, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
Infamy; and this Vertue, as it curbs
the Desire from seeking higher Things than
the Person really deserves, or may well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, in order to this great End, is called
Humility; which is a low or true esteem of
a Man's self, or personal Merits. But as this
Desire of the Common Good, often elevates
the Mind to the performing of great and
noble Actions, whereby he may acquire the
highest Honours, it is then called Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
and therefore the Magnanimous is
still supposed to be endued with perfect Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and a most large Desire of the Common
Good of Mankind, as believing he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to judge himself worthy of any Honour
that he can justly pretend to: And I suppose
every Man is sensible, That it is a part of the
same Vertue, not only to seek for true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but also to take care to preserve it,
when it is obtained: And from the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of these Vertues, the contrary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are more easily understood; for Pride is
directly opposite both to Magnanimity, and
Humility shewing it self in a preposterous Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
foolish Arrogance, or Vain-glory; and so
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53522:141"/>
Pusillanimity, or meanness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is directly contrary to Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="20">Â§. 20. Thus we have run through al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the particular Vertues, and do
still find in each of them a constant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
or Tendency, to the Common Good
of Mankind: So that whether they regard
our selves or others, the same great End
is still intended by God, the most Wife
Legislator: And this Law being thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
there is therein contained the
largest and most diffusive Society between
divers Nations, or Commonweals, and the
truest Love and Benevolence between all
the Members of the same Commonweal,
as also between particular Families: So that
there may be hence demonstrated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the certain Rules and Measures
of true Piety towards God, as distinguish'd
from Impiety and Superstition; and also
of all other Vertues towards Men, which
must be first truly known, and applied to
their right Objects, that the Names of these
Vertues, when falsly imposed on Actions
contrary to the Laws of God and Nature,
may not deceive us: For it is hence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That all the parts of universal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Benevolence, (<hi>viz.</hi>) all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Vertues contained under them, are
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53522:141"/>
only commanded in order to this Common
Good; because it is manifest by Experience,
That such Just and Benevolent Actions, are
always endued with a natural Power of
procuring and promoting the Common
Peace and Happiness of divers Nations and
Commonweals, as also of lesser Societies and
particular Persons; of all which, considered
in their due order and subordination to each
other, this Common Good of Mankind is
made up, and consists.</p>
               <p n="21">Â§. 21. And, farther, it may be hence clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewn what is that Right Reason, by
which every prudent Man ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to himself a just Mediocrity in all
his moral Actions; for it only consists
in practical Propositions, proposing or
declaring to us this great End; and
also shewing us all the means in our
Power whereby we may attain it; which
are those that, in the first place, prescribe
the Rules of Piety, and Divine Worship,
both private and publick. (2.) Those that
concern the Society and Commerce of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Nations and Commonweals. (3.) All
positive Laws, whether Civil or Domestick,
tending to the Good of the Civil Society
wherein we live. (4.) True and rational
Conclusions, drawn from Knowledge, or
Experience, either of our selves, or others,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53522:142"/>
concerning the natural Efficacy of Things
and Actions, all which are at last resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the natural Power of such Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions, as may either benefit, or
hurt Mankind, considered apart, or in an
aggregate Body, as in a Family, or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
since Experience doth not with less
certainty teach us, what kind of Actions are
beneficial, or hurtful to Mankind; then it
shews what sort of Diet will either nourish,
or destroy us: Nor is it more difficult to
understand the Truth of this Proposition,
That a right, or equal Distribution of
all Things necessary for Life, is requisite to
the Common Good and Happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
than it is to know in Physick, That
it is necessary for the Life and Health of an
Animal, that a due proportion of Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be equally distributed to all its Parts,
or Members; both which Truths, are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the same natural Principles, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
That the same Things which preserve the
whole, do also preserve all its parts; and,
<hi>vice versa,</hi> the same Things which preserve
all the Parts, or Members, do likewise serve
to the Conservation of the whole; which
being evident from true Principles, is a
Science taught by Experience, drawn from
the Nature of Things.</p>
               <p n="22">
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:53522:142"/>Â§. 22. And th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                  </gap> from the immutable Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Corporeal Causes of this sort; for
the production of their Effects on all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> depends all the Certainty and
Knowledge of Natural Philosophy and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick:
So likewise from their immutable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
or Powers on Humane Actions, for
the Conservation of particular Persons, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and Commonweals, proceeds all the
Certainty of those practical Propositions, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Natural Laws, which constitute Moral
Philosophy, shewing and determining the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all Vertues and Vices: Nor is that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Actions, which may be prescribed to
Persons in distinct Families, or Commonweals,
and under various Circumstances of Life,
more repugnant to the constant Care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
all the Parts, or Members, which
contribute to this great End, than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Diety, and ways of living peculiar
to divers, Climates, Ages, or Constitutions
of Men's Bodies, are to the constant Care
that all Men have of preserving their own
Lives and Healths, according to the several
Necessities of their Natures: For as in these
we cannot, by doing whatever we will,
promote this End; but Nature hath put
some limits thereunto, although our weak
Understandings cannot attain to a nice, or
mathematical exactness in assigning them, as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53522:143"/>
we may live long and healthfully enough,
without weighing our Meat and Drink, like
<hi>Lessius</hi>; so we may likewise procure the
Common Good, as far as lies in our Power,
although we do not always perform that
which is absolutely or simply best in all Cases;
it is as much as God the Legislator requires,
if we truly endeavour it, and contribute as
far as we are able unto this great End.</p>
               <p n="23">Â§. 23. In the last place, I shall here repeat
what I have before laid down, That this
Common Good of Rationals, as it is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of all natural Goods (and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of all others) so it is the true Standard
of all other Goods, either natural, or moral:
So that by our comparing them with this, we
may truly determine whether they are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or less than each other; and so whether
they are principally to be desired and sought
after, or to be postponed to other greater
Goods. Likewise the same measure where
the proportion of these Goods is taken, gives
us a true estimate of all the contrary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and so shews us what is more, or less
to be avoided, or repented of.</p>
               <p n="24">Â§. 24. We may also hence learn what
degrees of Passions, or Affections are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
for it is certain, That only such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Affections are required, as are
congruous to our Rational Nature, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53522:143"/>
exactly answering the true Estimate of
those good, or evil Things by which they
are excited; but since the Government of
our Appetites and Passions, is a thing of
so great moment, as that on which all
our Vertue and Happiness (as far as it is
in our Power) depends; which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
proceeds from our knowledge of a
true measure of all Goods, and Evils, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which they are to be judged;
therefore I shall be the larger in explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what I have a little before laid down,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That the Common Good ought to
be the Standard of all our Affections and
Passions, as being so ordained by God,
and determined by the Nature of Things;
which is evident, in that we have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
this Common Good, to be that
great End, to whose prosecution all Men
are naturally obliged, by the Will of God,
as a Legislator, who must have given us
the knowledge of any thing as Good, or
Evil, to little purpose, unless he had also
given us a Rule by which we might judge
of the several measures, or degrees of this
Goodness: So that this Common Good
being once established as a certain Measure,
or Standard for this End, the Good of
each particular Person will bear such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to that of the whole Body of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53522:144"/>
Rationals, as the Soundness of any one
Member, does to the Health of the whole
Body. So from the knowledge of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of divers subordinate Goods, and the
proportion which any one of them bears
to the Common, or Greatest Good, may
easily be deduced how much the Well-being,
or Happiness of every single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
may contribute to that of the whole
Family; the Felicity of a Family, to that
of a Commonwealth; that of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal,
to the Happiness of all Nations;
and of all these considered together, what
proportion they may bear to the Common
Felicity of Mankind. So that hence you
may be easily satisfied how much the
knowledge of this one Truth, conduces
to our right prosecution of this great End,
and, indeed, Sum of all the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="25">Â§. 25. Lastly, (which yet ought rather
to have been put in the first place of all)
let us consider the chief and principal of
all the moral Vertues, Love, or Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, expressed in all the Acts of
Divine Worship, as Prayer, Praise, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> This must needs be a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
since it does that which is highly grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and pleasing to God the Head of all Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings, and speaking after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53522:144"/>
of us Men, performing somewhat Good,
and agreeable to his Divine Nature; and
which also in respect of our selves, makes us
most happy, not only by rendring the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
propitious to us, but also by a nearer spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
approach and conversation with it, in
those holy Exercises, it puts us in the happiest
state we can be capable of in this mortal
Life, and so makes us more able to perform
the great End of our Creation, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Our
contributing to the Common Good of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings.</p>
               <p n="26">Â§. 26. I have been the larger in laying
down, and explaining this Law, as a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or Standard of all good Actions, to
the end that we should esteem all Good, or
Evil, not as it more or less profits or hurts
our own particular Bodies alone, but as it
may more or less add to, or detract from
this Common Good: So that in comparing
of all Goods together, whether Natural or
Moral, we ought still to look upon that
as the greatest Good which conferrs most;
and that to be the least, which contributes
least to this great End, which is therefore
to be desired, or prosecuted by us with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
Affections and Endeavours: From
whence also may be drawn a general and
powerful Remedy, against all those inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Passions proceeding from excessive Self-Love,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53522:145"/>
by which Men are most commonly
drawn to hurt or injure others: For a Man
who thus governs himself, will not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly
desire any of these outward Things,
nor suffer his Soul to be disturbed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness
of any Crime, who judges nothing
truly Good, but what really conduces to the
common Good of Rationals.</p>
               <p n="27">Â§. 27. Thus I hope I have demonstrated
the true Reasons and Grounds of Moral
Good and Evil, or of Vertue and Vice; and
have endeavoured to render Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
(or the true Knowledge of the Laws
of Nature) a practical Science, and not
merely Speculative, or Notional, like that
of the Stoicks; who whilst they allowed
nothing to be really good, but Vertue;
or Evil; except Vice; and kept such a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to extol the real Good of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and declaim against the certain Evil
of the latter; yet by not giving us the true
Reasons, or Grounds, why Vertue should be
embraced, and Vice avoided, they rendred
their Philosophy merely speculative, and
only fit for those idle Porches in which they
declaimed, scarce having any farther influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the Actions of Life, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their own Affections, or any power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
outward Temptation, did at any time
prompt them to act contrary thereunto:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53522:145"/>
For Vertue is only to be esteemed as the
highest or most perfect Good; not as it is
a well-sounding Word, or that fills our Minds
with some vain empty Notions, but as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
our Actions to their utmost influe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the Common Good of Rational
Beings, which is the only true Piety, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in the Performance of the Commands
and Will of God, by the imitation of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness and Beneficence.</p>
               <p n="28">Â§. 28. So that I shall conclude this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
with Dr. <hi>Parker</hi>'s excellent Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on this Subject; and which being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any thing that I can now think
of, I shall make bold to give
it you almost in his own
Words,<note place="margin">Demonstration of the Law, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 23.</note> with a little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that it is now demonstratively cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by induction of Particulars (according
to the method we have now taken) that
every Vertue hath some natural Efficacy to
promote the Common Good of Rationals;
and is no otherwise a Vertue, but as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to this great End, and that each
Man's true private Interest and Happiness,
is therein contained, and inseparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with it, by the necessary order
of Nature, <hi>i. e</hi> by the Contrivance and
Wisdom of Divine Providence: So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more evident, than that its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53522:146"/>
commands all his Rational Creatures,
that are capable of any knowledge of his
Will, and sence of their Duty, to act sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to that Order of Things which he
hath established in the World, and to that
Declaration of his Will, which he hath
made by that Establishment, in order to the
bringing about this great End of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§. 1. SInce there are two sorts of men, who
according to their several Principles,
and Inclinations, may make different Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
against this our Method of proving,
and deducing the Law of Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting

put the whole stress of their belief of the Laws
of Nature upon innate Ideas, or Principles of
Moral Good and Evil imprest by God upon
mens Souls; and who, I doubt not, may have
a true zeal (though without knowledge) for
this Common Good; which is more than I
can promise for those, who fal<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing into the
other extream, will not acknowledge that we
can have any true or certain notion, or idea, of
this Common Good, so as to make it the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53522:147"/>
main end of all our Actions. I shall therefore
in the first place consider those Objections that
may be made by the former sort of Men;
whose first Objection may be this, That it is
most suitable to the goodness of God to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
upon the minds of men certain Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Notions of himself, and also of those
Moral Duties which he requires of them;
and not to leave them in the dark, and in
doubt about things of so great a Concernment
to them; since by that means he would not
only have secured himself of that Worship
and Veneration which is due from so Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
a Creature as Man, but would also with
great ease and certainty have taught him his
duty towards himself, and others, without
puting him to the trouble and pains of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
his Existence, and all those Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that depend upon it, by so tedious a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
as I have here proposed; which every
man hath not time to inquire into, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Faculties strong enough to make such
rational Conclusions or Deductions from the
Nature of God, and other things, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the Laws of Nature, as we
have here laid down: and therefore, that God
(who doth all things by the best and easiest
means) hath imprest all the Notions or Ideas
of Good and Evil upon mens Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:53522:147"/>Â§. 2. To which Objection I need return no
other Answer than what is already made by
the Author of the Essay concerning <hi>Human
Vnderstanding</hi> (so often cited by me); I shall
therefore give it to you in his own words,
Book I. chap. 4. Â§. 12. <hi>This Argument, if it
be of any force, will prove much more than those
who use it in this case expect from it; for if we
may conclude, That God hath done for men, all
that men shall judge is best for them, because it is
suitable for his Goodness so to do; it will prove
not only, that God hath imprinted on the minds of
men an Idea of himself; but that he hath plainly
stamped there, in fair Characters, all that men
ought to know or believe of him, and all that they
ought to do in obedience to his Will; and that he
hath given them a Will and Affections conformable
to it. This no doubt every one will think is better
for men, than that they should in the dark grope
after Knowledge, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us,</hi> all Nations
did after God, <hi>Acts</hi> VIII. 27, <hi>or than that
their Wills should clash with their Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and their Appetites cross their Duty. The</hi>
Romanists <hi>say, 'Tis best for men, and so suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Goodness of God, that there should be
an Infallible Iudge of Controversies on Earth,
and therefore there is one: And I by the same
reason say, 'Tis better for men that every man
himself should be infallible. I leave them to
consider, whether by the force of this Argument
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53522:148"/>
they shall think that every man is so. I think it
a very good Argument to say, the infinitely Wise
God hath made it so, and therefore it is best. But
it seems to me a little too much confidence of our
Wisdom, to say, I think it best, and therefore God
hath made it so; and in the matter in hand, it will
be in vain to argue from such a Topick, that God
hath done so, when certain Experience shews us
that he hath not. But the Goodness of God hath
not been wanting to men, without such original im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Knowledge, or Ideas stamped on the
mind, since he hath furnished man with those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
which will serve for the sufficient discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of all things requisite to the end of such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And I doubt not but to shew, that a man by
the right use of his natual Abilities may, without
any innate Principles, attain to the knowledge of
a God, and other things that concern him: God
having endued man with those faculties of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which he hath, was no more obliged by his
Goodness to implant these innate Notions in his
Mind, than that having given him Reason,
Hands and Materials, he should also build him
Bridges, or Houses; which some People in the
World, however of good natural parts, do either
totally want, or are but ill provided of as well as
others are, (perhaps) wholly without Ideas of God,
and Principles of Morality, or at least have but
very ill ones. The reason in both Cases being this,
That they never employed their Parts, Faculties
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53522:148"/>
and Powers industriously that way, but contented
themselves with the Opinions, Fashions, and
things of their Countrey, as they found them,
without looking any farther.</hi> So far this
Learned Author.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. And as for what is farther urged, the
difficulties of the coming to the knowledge of
the Being of a God, by the method we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if this were not plainly to be read from
the great Book of the World, St. <hi>Paul</hi> had in
vain accused the general corruption of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their loss of the knowledge of
the true God, as he doth in the 1st of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> v. 19, 20. <hi>Because that which may be
known of God is manifest in them, for God hath
shewed it unto them: For the invisible things of
him from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made,
even his eternal power, and Godhead: so that
they are without exaus.</hi> Where you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
the Apostle here appeals to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reason of Mankind, guided by things
without us, for the proof of the Existence of
a Delty, that they may be left without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse

of the Method we have here proposed,

such rational Conclusions from the Nature
of Things; I think that will signifie much
less than the former, if those that make this
Objection will please to consider how obvious
such Conclusions are, and how easily made
out, in the Third Chapter of this Discourse;
where I particularly treat of the Natural
Power of mens Minds, in making Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Nature of Things, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them into certain practical Propositions,
in order to their own future happiness, in
conjunction with that of others: So that I
think I may safely affirm, that those who are
not of Natural Parts sufficient to discover the
Being of a God, and a Providence; as also to
understand the Laws of Nature, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon that Knowledge: If they did but
duly apply their Minds to think upon their
own Original, and that of the World, by true
Principles of Reason, must be either Fools or
Madmen, and so not capable Subjects of the
Laws of Nature, as not being to be reckoned
amongst rational Creatures; or else, which
is worse, are down-right Atheists; who, to
indulge their own unreasonable Lusts and
Passions, do absolutely deny all those clear
Demonstrations from Natural Things, which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53522:149"/>
are brought for the proof of a Deity, and of
their Duty towards it.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. And tho I grant that all men do not
ordinarily reduce all the Laws of Nature into
this one single Proposition, of endeavouring
this common good of Rational Beings, or
may not have an explicite Notion of it; Yet
this will not hinder, but that they may for all
that really pursue it, tho' they may not have
so large and perfect a knowledge of the
grounds of their Duty, as they would have
if they were sensible of this Idea: For if a
man be but throughly convinced that he is
not made for himself alone, but that he ought
to mind the good and preservation of others
besides himself; and that he doth truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Laws of Nature, towards himself,
by a temperate and a rational Life: As also,
towards his Neighbour, by observing that
great Rule, of doing as he would be done by,
in all cases towards others. I say, such a
man, tho' never so simple and ignorant in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, doth really contribute his share
of endeavour towards procuring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good: And tho' he may not distinctly
know all the true reasons and grounds of his
own Actions; yet if he thus lead his Life,
and observe all these Rules tending to this
End, I doubt not but that he will meet with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53522:150"/>
all those Rewards intended by God for Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions; provided he have never heard
of, or at least wilfully refused the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Law of the Gospel, delivered by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jesus Christ, when duly proposed to
him. Thus a Countrey Carpenter may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
sufficient Wages, and Commendation,
if he can build a House, and honestly perform
his Work, according to those few practical
Rules he hath learnt, tho' he doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all the Principles of Geometry, or
Architecture, according to which, all that
he hath wrought may easily be demonstrated
to him, if he will but take the pains to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them.</p>
               <p n="6">Â§. 6. There is another Objection which this
sort of men may make against our Method of
finding out, and demonstrating this great
Law of Nature, in that I make every man's
obligation to endeavour it, to arise from its
being good or evil to himself alone; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may seem, as if we supposed the honour
of God, and the common good of mankind
were to be postponed<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and made subservient
to the happiness of any particular person.
To satisfie which Scruple, I do in the first place
affirm, that we do not intend any such thing,
since we have all along endeavoured to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the quite contrary Doctrine; For I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53522:150"/>
that no man hath any Right, properly so
called, to his own Life or Being, but in order,
and as it conduces to the honour and service
of God, and the common good of mankind.
I shall therefore now more distinctly declare
how these (tho' some may think them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to each other) do very well consist. In
the first place therefore I desire you to take
notice, that our Natural Obligation to this
Law is not discovered by us in the same order
and method, as it is constituted by God in the
nature of Things; for our weak finite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
when acting without the assistance
of Divine Revelation, do slowly enough at
first, attain to the knowledge of Individual,
or Single Things; and thence taking rise
from such common effects as are most obvious
to our Senses, proceed to their more obstruse
Causes, until at length discovering one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Being, called God, to be the first Cause
and Creator of all things. We from thence
collect not only what is his Nature, but also
what is his Will; whereby we do not only
find that he is the best, and most perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
But that as such, he willeth and procures
the good and preservation, not of some few
Singulars alone, but of the whole Species of
Mankind. And lastly, that he would have
us men cooperate, as subordinate, (tho free
Agents) to this End, as the greatest and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53522:151"/>
we can undertake: Which tho' it be the
last thing we come to the knowledge of, yet
is that which is first and chiefly intended by
God, as the principal object of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and the main End of all our Moral
Actions. So that it seems evident, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our selves, and of things thus learnt
from experience and observation, was intended
by God, only to serve as steps to raise us to
that larger knowledge, and nobler desire of
pursuing the common good of Rationals, as
the sum of all our Moral Duties. And that
our Wills and Affections towards this end, are
not to be regulated or directed in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by which this common good comes to be
discovered; <hi>i. e.</hi> (with a respect to our selves
alone); but from a true judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the measures of that natural good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
therein contained. So that tho' we
are at first indeed excited to the procuring our
own happiness, as the prime and most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
motive of all our Actions; yet we come
at last upon better consideration to discover,
that this happiness of ours is contained in our
endeavours of the Common good of Rational
Beings, and is inseparable from it, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of any of our particular Members
is contained in the health and preservation of
the whole Body.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:53522:151"/>Â§. 7. And this Proposition, that every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
man's good is contained in the common-good,
proves indeed, that the sanction of this
general Law, is by rewards and punishments
to <hi>Every</hi> single man: But that <hi>Every</hi> is not to
be restrained to my self, or any one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but extends alike to each other man, or
all men: Since it is evident, that these words
(<hi>Every man</hi>) collectively taken, amount to
all men; as every part collectively taken sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the whole. And tho' the main end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by God, the <hi>Legislator,</hi> from such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments, are obedience to his
Laws, and the preservation of Mankind, as
his Subjects (which are indeed of much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
value to him, than the happiness of any
one single person); Yet will it not detract
from the perfection or sincerity of this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
if from the consideration of a man's own
particular happiness or misery, he thereby
comes to consider and understand, that God
hath commanded him to pursue an higher and
nobler end than that alone; yet to which his
own happiness or misery are inseparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected.</p>
               <p n="8">Â§. 8. I come in the last place to these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
that may be made by men of quite
contrary Principles; and who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that we either can, or ought to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53522:152"/>
propose this common good, as the Sum of all
the Laws of Nature, and the main end of all
our Moral Actions. Their first objection may
be this; That it seems not suitable to God's
Infinite Goodness, and Power, and Wisdom,
in the Government of Mankind, if he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
intend its good and happiness (as we here
suppose) to permit so great a Design to be
so often disturbed, if not quite frustrated, in
divers parts of the World, by the various
Passions, and unreasonable Appetites, of so
many violent, wicked and unjust men; which,
if Mankind is well considered, do make up the
greatest part of this Aggregate Body.</p>
               <p>In answer to this objection, I might tell
those that make it, that the true original of
that depraved State of Mankind, and from
which all that Disorder, which we now find
in Humane Nature is derived, was the Fall
of <hi>Adam,</hi> the first Father of Mankind; who
thereby conveyed a weakness of Reason, and
that prevailing Power which we feel in our
sensual Appetites and Passions to all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
whereby man is become very prone to
Evil, and too apt to transgress the Laws of
Nature. But I shall not insist upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Gentlemen with whom I have to
do, may laugh at all Divine Revelation, not
accept of any Proofs as sufficient, but what
can be brought from meer Natural Reason,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53522:152"/>
I shall therefore answer them in their own
way; and shall first of all grant; That God
might, if he had thought fit, have created
Man without any possibility of sinning, and
have determined him only to that which is
morally good. But then God hath not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Man, but quite another Creature: For
he having made Man to consist of two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Principles, a Body and a Soul; the one
to be driven on by Sensual Appetites and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
the other to be governed by Reason:
It was necessary that he should be carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Good or Evil, as one or other of these
should prevail. So that considering what
sort of Creature God hath made us, he hath
done all he needed to do towards the good
and happiness of Mankind; Supposing that
he hath created us, and deals with us as free,
voluntary Agents, endued with a freedom of
choice, either to deliberate upon the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and nature of all our Moral Actions
before we do them; and either to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rules of Right Reason, or else
clean contrary thereunto, that is, wholly at
random, or by chance, which is unworthy
our Rational Nature.</p>
               <p n="9">Â§. 9. So that God having thus left the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of man's happiness in his own power,
either to be obtained by endeavouring this
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53522:153"/>
common good; or else missed of, or lost by
his own neglect of it. It is not to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if mens unreasonable Appetites and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
looking no farther than their present
Pleasures, or outward Advantages, do often
carry them away without any consideration
of those future, but as certain and greater
evils which may follow them in the whole
course of their lives. By which abuse of
mens natural Freedom, I grant the good and
happiness of Mankind is very much disturbed
and diminished: Therefore it is no wonder,
that (tho' God's will be sufficiently declared
against such Actions,) it is not more often
observed and followed; nor could God have
ordered things better or otherwise than they
are; unless he should have made man with
out all freedom of choice, and have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his Will only to one sort of Actions;
which had rendered him quite another Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and incapable of those rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
which are absolutely necessary
for the government of man, as he is made by
God, a free, voluntary Agent. Secondly,
Tho' God hath thus made us free Agents, but
that by the ill use of our Faculties, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more prone to evil Actions than good
ones; Yet it must still be acknowledged,
God's Infinite Power and Providence hath
set such limits to the unruly Appetites and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53522:153"/>
Passions of wicked men, that tho' it must be
confessed, that by private Violence, Wars
and Persecutions for Religion, they do more
mischief to Mankind than all the Savage
Beasts, Earthquakes or Plagues in the World
ever did: Yet this is but in some few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Places or Countries at a time; and God
hath so restrained these Passions and Lusts, not
only by Natural, Divine and Civil Laws;
but also by necessary ill consequences that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
such Actions; that it is not often that
such men can accomplish their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
with that success and pleasure they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to themselves. And in those Countries
where these Violences are acted, the Scene
often alters: And in those Countries where
Civil-Wars and Persecution for Religion,
have not only very much disturbed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Peace and Happiness, but also diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the number of the Inhabitants, God
doth often think fit, either through mens wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness
of Wars, or by the sudden death of a
Cruel and Ambitious Prince (who was the
chief cause of it) again to restore peace and
happiness to these Kingdoms or Countries
where Civil-Wars and Persecutions had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so cruelly raged, and so long prevailed.
So that notwithstanding all that can be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
against God's intending the good and
happiness of Mankind; it is certain, that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53522:154"/>
from the beginning of the World to this day,
he hath preserved it in the same State; as
he hath also done all other Species of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
So that we may boldly affirm, the
number of men in the world rather increases
than diminishes; tho' it may please God, for
the correction or extirpation of some extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wicked, and incorrigible Nations, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to be oppressed, diminished, or
quite destoyed by Forreign Force, Civil Wars,
or Domestick Tyranny.</p>
               <p n="10">Â§. 10. A Second Objection that may be
brought by those of <hi>Epicurean</hi> Principles, is,
That if the Being of a God, and the certainty of
the Laws of Nature be so easy to be found out,
and discovered by mens Natural Reasons and
Observations; how it comes to pass that there
are some whole Nations in the World, who
have (as we know of) no Notions at all of
a God, or a Moral Good or Evil; as Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
report of those <hi>Negroes,</hi> who inhabit near
the Bay of <hi>Soldania,</hi> not far from the Cape
of <hi>Good-Hope</hi>; who also fell their Children
for Slaves, to those that will give most for
them: As also others in the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>;
that make War upon, and devour
all Strangers they can take Prisoners O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as in the Isle of <hi>Formosa,</hi> rendring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive
all Children that the Mothers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53522:154"/>
before they are thirty years old. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and in <hi>Africa,</hi> steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Strangers whatsoever they can lay
their hands on. It were tedious to relate all
the particular Instances of this kind. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
desires to see more of them. may consult
the Learned Author of the above-mentioned
Essay of Human Understanding, <hi>Book</hi> the I.
<hi>Chap.</hi> III. Â§. 9. besides what he may himself
collect from his own reading, or observation.
So that it may be urged, that if these People
are part of Mankind, and therefore Rational
Creatures, how it comes to pass that they
should not be able, as well as we, to come to
the knowledge of a God, and of those Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Laws, which we suppose to be given to
Mankind?</p>
               <p n="11">Â§. 11. To all which I shall reply, not by
denying, as some do, the matters of Fact
themselves, which is an easy, but too positive
a way of confutation; but shall take them at
present for granted, since they are delivered
to us by many Authors of sufficient credit.
And therefore, first of all, I think I may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm, That tho' these Instances may be of
considerable weight, against those who
found all our Knowledge of the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon certain Innate Principles, or the
common consent of Mankind: Yet they will
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53522:155"/>
prove nothing against us, who have, I hope,
made out the certainty and obligation of
this Law, from more evident Principles: So
that the contrary belief or practice of divers
Nations in the World, is no more an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Being of a God, or of the
Laws of Nature, than their ignorance in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick
and Geometry, is against the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
or usefulness of those Sciences; these
people, being most of them not able to reckon
beyond their ten Fingers. Now setting aside
Innate Ideas, and Consent of Nations, as
proofs of the Laws of Nature; what other
means do there remain; but the uncertain
Tradition of a God, and these Moral Laws
from their Parents, or Ancestors; or else to
discover them by Reason, and taking observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Nature of things, according to
the method here laid down. The former of
these (if they had ever any such thing) it is
certain that they have now quite lost so
that no Footsteps of it now remains among
them. And as for the latter, these ignorant
and barbarous Nations, being wholly taken
up, through the whole course of their lives,
either in procuring for themselves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
necessaries for life, or else in brutish and
sensual Lusts and Pleasures; it is no wonder
that they give themselves no time or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to think of these things, nor yet employ
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53522:155"/>
their thoughts, in considering the cause of
their Being, or for what end they came into the
World. So that it is not strange that they
should be so little sensible of the Being of a
God, and what Worship or Duties he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them: Nor can I give a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this ignorance, than what you may
find in the Author last mentioned, who thus
concludes his Paragraph against the necessity
of Innate Principles (already cited in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Chapter.) <q>Had you or I been born
(says he) at the Bay of <hi>Soldania,</hi> possibly our
Thoughts and Notions had not exceeded these
brutish ones of the <hi>Hoteutots</hi> that inhabit
there: And had the <hi>Virginian</hi> King, <hi>Apochan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana,</hi>
been educated in <hi>England,</hi> he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
been as knowing a Divine, and as
good a Mathematician as any in it. The
difference between him, and a more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>English-man,</hi> lying barely in this, That
the exercise of his Faculties was bounded
within the Ways, Modes and Notions of his
own Countrey, and was never directed to
any other, or farther Enquiries: And if he
had not any Idea of a God, as we have, it
was only because he pursued not those
Thoughts that would certainly have led him
to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:53522:156"/>Â§. 12. Which account, tho' it were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
alone to take off this difficulty, yet I shall
farther add; That altho it is true the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of a God, and the Laws of Nature are
to be discovered by Natural Reason; yet this
must be exerted, and made use of according
to a right Method, and is like the Talent in
the Gospel, either to be infinitely increased,
or else may be buried, without ever being
made use of as it ought. So that mens not
making use of their Reason, and those Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which God hath given them, is no more
an Argument against God's not having given
men sufficient Means and Faculties to attain
to the knowledge of these things, than if a
man, who by perpetual sitting still, should
have lost the use of his Legs, had reason to
find fault with God, for not giving him suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
means of going, and helping himself.
So that it seems evident to me, that it is left in
most mens power, whether they will by a
due use of their Reason, raise themselves to
the highest perfection and happiness that thei
human nature is capable of; or else by em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ploying
their minds about meer sensual objects
and carnal enjoyments, debase themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the state of Brutes: For I am satisfied, that
it is not reasoning about common and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, that constitutes the only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between us and them; since they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53522:156"/>
right about those things that are the objects
of their Senses; but that it rather consists in
the more excellent Faculties of framing Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Ideas, and by a due enquiry into the
causes and nature of things, of coming to the
knowledge of God, and of his Will, either
naturally declared, according to the method
here laid down; or else supernaturally reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Holy Scripture. And indeed, I
think, a Dog or a Horse, to be a much better
Creature than a Man, who hath never had,
or else hath totally extinguished the belief of
a God, and of his Duty towards him; for
the one lives according to its nature, and those
Faculties God hath given it: But a Man, who
wants the knowledge of God, and of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
towards him, by neglecting the chief end
of his Creation, and by giving himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
up to the government of his Passions, and
unreasonable Appetites, debases his nature,
and so becomes, by his own fault, like a
Brute.</p>
               <p n="13">Â§. 13. The last Objection that I can think
of, and which may be also made by Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s
Disciples, is; That they look upon this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of the Common Good of Mankind,
as a meer <hi>Platonick</hi> Idea, or Term of Art,
without any reality in nature to support it.
Of which opinion Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> seems to be, when
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53522:157"/>
he tells us, in his <hi>Leviath.</hi> Book I. chap. 4.
<hi>That of Names, some are proper and singular to
ore only thing, as</hi> Peter, John, <hi>This Man, this
Tree; and some are common to many things, as
Man, Horse, Tree, every of which, though but
one name, is nevertheless the name of divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
things, in respect of all which together it
is called an universal, there being nothing in the
World universal, but Names. For the things
named are every one of them individual and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</hi>
So that on these Principles we can
have no knowledge of any common good out
of a Commonwealth, where it arises merely
from Compacts; every man being naturally
determined to seek his own particular preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and satisfaction, without the least consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of any thing else.</p>
               <p n="14">Â§. 14. In answer to which Objection, I
desire you to take notice, That if in our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Law of Nature,</hi> or Explication
of it, we had any where supposed, that in
this endeavour of the common Good, a Man
either could, or ought to neglect his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and true happiness, there might
have been some reason for this Objection; But
since I have proved, that the true good and
happiness of every particular person is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Common Good of Rationals, and
depends inseparably upon it; though I grant
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53522:157"/>
every man's own happiness and misery is a
main motive of his acting to this end, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
consists in a right endeavour of it; which
if it be so, this part of the Objection falls of it
self, unless they will affirm, That a Man's self-preservation
and happiness only consists in the
present satisfaction of his own sensual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
and Passions, let what will be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
which how false and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a thing it is, any rational Man may judge.
<hi>2dly,</hi> We have also sufficiently made out,
that there is an unalterable Common Good
and Evil established by God in the nature of things, necessary for the preservation, or
tending to the destruction, not only of this, or
that particular man, but for all the men in
the World, conceived under the collective
Idea of Mankind, and that in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and out of a Civil State or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
Since by comparing our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Natures with those of all other men, and
finding them to agree in the same Wants,
general Properties, and desires of like things
necessary for life, and an aversion to others
destructive to it, we can thereby certainly
determine what Things or Actions will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
not only to our own happiness and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
but to all others of our own Kind.
From whence there arises a clear Idea of the
Common Good of Mankind, since (as I have
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53522:158"/>
already proved) one peculiar Faculty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature different from that of Beasts, is,
to abstract universal Ideas from particular
things, and then to give general Names to
those Ideas, which though they are but Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of our own understanding, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting
out of our own Brains; yet are for all
that true Ideas of the general Natures of those
things from whence they are taken; and as
for the general Names of them, if there were
not real notions in our minds, agreeable to
the nature of those things from whence they
were taken, and that before any Names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon them, they would indeed be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
or meer empty Sounds, without any
Ideas to support them: But the before-cited
Author of the <hi>Essay of Humane Vnderstanding,
Book</hi> II. <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. grants, <hi>That the Mind hath
a power to make complex, collective Ideas of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
which he so calls, because such Ideas are
made up of many particular Substances, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together as united into one Idea, and which so
joined, are looked on as one</hi>; v. g. <hi>the Idea of such
a collection of men as make an Army, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of a great number of distinct Substances,
is as much one Idea as the Idea of a Man. And
the great collective Idea of all Bodies whatsoever,
signified by the name World, is as much one Idea,
as the Idea of any the least particle of matter in
it; it sufficing to the unity of any Idea, that it be
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53522:158"/>
considered as one Representation, or Picture, tho
made up of never so many particulars. And he
likewise farther grants, That it is not harder to
conceive how an Army of Ten thousand men
should make one Idea, than how a Man should
make one Idea; it being as easie to the mind to
unite into one the Idea of a great number of men,
to consider it as one, as it is to unite into one
particular all the distinct Ideas that make up the
composition of a Man, and consider them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I can see no reason, why any
man by considering the nature of all the Men
in the World, may not only have a true Idea
of all Mankind, but also of the things or means
that may produce their common good, or
happiness, as well as a General of an Army of
100000 men can have a true Idea of that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
Body of Men, and order all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for their common safety and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And if Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Assertion be true,
<hi>That there is nothing universal but Names,</hi> his
beloved Sciences of Arithmetick and Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
would also be false and uncertain; since
they only considering Numbers, Lines and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in general, and collecting universal
Ideas from thence, do raise true Rules or
Axioms in those Sciences from those universal
Ideas, though there be nothing really existing
in Nature out of our own Brains, but Units
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53522:159"/>
and single bodies. And therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is
mistaken, when he will have nothing to have
any real Existence in nature but single things,
as if our abstract Idea's of Universals were
Nothing, because they are not Bodies: But
if these general Idea's are true, as agreeing
with the things from whence they are taken,
it will also follow, that they have a real exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
and consequently may have Names
given them, whereby to signifie and represent
them to our own minds, and those of others
we converse with. So that whatsoever we
find to contribute to the Preservation, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Perfection of all the men we know,
or have heard of, we may as certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
to be naturally good for all Mankind,
and so a much greater good than that of any
one particular Person; which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself
acknowledges in his Treatise <hi>De homine,</hi>
Chap. 11. Â§. 14. where treating of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Good, which of them are greater or
less he plainly declares, <hi>that to be a greater
good</hi> (coeteris paribus) <hi>which is so to more
men, than that which is so to fewer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if the Rational and free use of a
man's Will consists in its consent with that true
judgment the Understanding makes, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those things that agree in one Common
Nature; and if we can thereby truly judge or
determine what things are necessary, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53522:159"/>
for the Natures of all other men, as
well as our own; I see no reason why we
may not desire, that they should also enjoy
the like good things with our selves, and
likewise endeavour (as far as lies in our
power) to procure it for them; since it is
also a Duty imposed upon us by God; and
that we lie under sufficient obligations to do
it, we have already proved.</p>
               <p>In short, This Common Good of Rationals,
being thus made known to us, may very well
be proposed as the end of all our Moral Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and being the greatest we can desire or
imagine, the Understanding judging aright,
cannot but determine, that this Knowledge
and Desire will more conduce to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Perfection of our Human Nature,
than that of any lesser Good: So that if this
be greater than any other Good we can come
to the knowledge of, it will likewise prove to
be the greatest and noblest end men can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to themselves. And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself is
also sometimes sensible of this Common
Good, when in the 31 Chap. of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
in the last Page, he hath made in his <hi>Latin</hi>
Translation, this Addition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he doth not despair that this Doctrine of
his being become more acceptable by custom, will
at length be received</hi> bono publico, <hi>for the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:53522:160"/>So that it seems he presages his Doctrine
will come one day to be beneficial not only to
one particular State, or Commonwealth,
but for the <hi>Common Good of all men,</hi> who are
with him yet in the State of Nature: And if
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath so perfect a Notion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good of all Nations, I think there will
be no great difference but in Words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that and the Common Good which
we maintain.</p>
               <p n="15">Â§. 15. But to come to a conclusion; I hope,
notwithstanding all that hath been objected
to the contrary, it hath been sufficiently
made out, that not only all the Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are contained in, and may be reduced to
this one Principle, <hi>Of endeavouring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good of Rational Beings</hi>; But that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all the Laws of Nature, (which are but
the Exercise or Practice of these particular
Vertues upon their due Objects, may be also
reduced into this single Proposition; since
they all of them respect either a man's Duty
towards God, by a duÃ© worship of him, or
else towards himself, in the exercise of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or else by the due observation of
Justice and Charity, or the most diffusive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
towards others of our own Kind;
according to the Order we have already laid
down in the former Chapter. All which is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53522:160"/>
but our endeavouring to procure (as far as
we are able) this Common Good of Rational
Agents.</p>
               <p>'Tis true Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his <hi>Lev.</hi> Chap. 13. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
all the Laws of Nature into this short
and easy Rule which he says is intelligible even
by the meanest capacities (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Do not that to
another, thou wouldest not have done to thy self.</hi>
Which Rule, tho' very true, and the same
in effect, which was given by our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
himself; yet without the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Common Good of Mankind, would
too often fail. For if this Rule were strictly
and literally to be understood, no Prince,
Judge, or other Magistrate, could condemn
a Malefactor to death; for in so doing, he did
that to another, which he would not have
done to himself, in the like State: Since he
himself, as well as the Criminal he condemns,
would then desire to be pardoned if he could.
But indeed the reason why all Judges, and
other inferior Officers of Justice, are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the observation of this Rule, in their
publick Capacities, is, Because they do not
then act as private persons, but as publick
Representatives, or Trustees, with whom
the Common Good and Peace of the whole
Kingdom or Commonwealth is intrusted;
which (as I have already shewn) makes but
a small part of the Common Good of all Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Agents.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:53522:161"/>Â§. 16. There are likewise others who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Laws of Nature into this single Rule
or Precept, <hi>Preserve or do good to thy self, and
any</hi> other innocent persons as to thy self:
Which tho' I grant to be a true Rule, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
our Saviour's Epitome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of the Second Table, <hi>Love thy
Neighbour as thy self</hi>: Yet doth it not express
the Reason or Principle on which it is founded;
for we have no reason to love our Neighbour,
but as they partake of the same Common Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Nature with our selves; and that our
doing them good, doth conduce to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and happiness of the whole Body of
Mankind; of which that person, as well as
our selves, are but small parts, or Members:
Nor have we any particular obligation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
our own particular Good, but as it
conduces to, and is part of the Common
Good of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="17">Â§. 17. And as the whole Law of Nature,
so likewise the Revealed Law, given from
God by <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and intended in
due time to be made known to all Mankind;
tends to no other end, than this great Law of
endeavouring the Common Good of Rational
Agents. For all the Precepts of the First
Table of the Decalogue, which prescribe
our Duty towards God, and which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53522:161"/>
hath so excellently well contracted into
this single Precept, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy strength,</hi> &amp;c. contain nothing
more than this great Rule. For as God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thought fit to create the World, and
whilst there was yet no Creature to worship
or serve him, was not then less happy or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
so neither now he hath created them
is he the happier, if we worship him, or the
more unhappy, if we omit it. For man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
created as an Object for the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to exert it self upon, it must necessarily
follow, that all the Precepts of the First Table, as well as of the Second, are in some sort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for Man's Good and Happiness, as
well as God's Honour and Service. So that
even that Great Commandment of keeping
holy the Seventh day, which most chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
God's own Glory and Service, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
promote the Good and Happiness not only
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> God's particular Subjects, but
also of all Mankind, whensoever this Law
should be discovered to them. So that tho' it
commands the dedicating of that day to the
Worship and Service of God, and is observed
in obedience to his Commands; Yet even in
this, he does not design his own Glory
and Honour alone; (nay, according to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53522:162"/>
Saint <hi>Austin, Our Good only</hi>) but
also our Good and Happiness;<note place="margin">âCredendum est totum qd; colitur Deus, homini prodes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, non Deo. <hi>De Civit. Dei Lib.</hi> X. Cap. 5.</note>
which is then most perfect and
compleat, when we bestow our time in the contemplation of his
Infinite Perfections and Goodness
towards us, and in rendring
him thanks for his unspeakable
Benefits. So that though I grant he
hath made and ordained us for his Service;
yet he hath so constituted our Nature, as to
make our highest happiness inseparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with all the particular Acts of his
Worship. And therefore our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they found fault with
him, for suffering his Disciples to pluck the
Ears of Corn on the Sabbath day, expresly
telling them, <hi>That if they h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>d
known what this means,<note place="margin">Matt. 12.7, 8.</note> I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice, they would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the guiltless; for the Son of Man</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi>
not Christ alone, but every Christian] <hi>is Lord
even of the Sabbath-day</hi>: And in St.
<hi>Mark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 2.27.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Sabbath was made
for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
teaching us, that the Sabbath it self was
also instituted for Man's sake; and that in
cases of necessity, he is Master of it. And
so likewise our Saviour himself, by chusing
to do his greatest Miracles of healing on the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53522:162"/>
Sabbath-day, hath taught us, that the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of acts of Charity and Mercy on that
Day, is a great and necessary part of God's
Service.</p>
               <p n="18">Â§. 18. But as for the Precepts of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table, I need not insist upon them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our Saviour himself hath contracted
them all, (even that of honouring our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents)
into this short Precept, <hi>Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thy self</hi>: Which is no more
than to bid us endeavour the common good of
Mankind, to the utmost of our power. So
that as this Law of the most diffusive Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Rational Agents, contains the Sum
of all the Laws of Nature, as also of the Moral
Law, contained in the Ten Commandments;
so likewise is it the Sum of the whole Gospel
delivered by our Saviour Christ, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
For as one great design of our Saviour's
coming into the World, was by his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Precepts and Examples, to exalt the
Law of Nature to a higher perfection, than
what Men, by the common use of Reason,
could generally attain to; so likewise was it
one of the main designs of his coming, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to its Primitive Purity
and Perfection; and to free it from those false
Interpretations and Traditions, with which
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had corrupted it. For whereas
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53522:163"/>
they had confined the observation of that
Command of loving our Neighbours, only to
outward Acts, or at least, restrained it only
to those of their own Nation or Religion;
our Saviour Christ commands a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and forbids even so much as the
thoughts or desires of Murder, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> did suppose, that they
were not obliged to shew Acts of Charity or
Mercy, to those of a different Religion from
themselves,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.30.</note> our Saviour teacheth
them by that excellent Parable of
the Traveller that fell amongst Thieves,
and was taken up and cured by the merciful
<hi>Samaritan,</hi> when the ill-natured <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi>
had passed him by, saying to the Lawyer
who had ask'd, Who is my Neighbour, <hi>Go
thy ways, and do thou likewise.</hi> By which he
plainly intimates; That we ought to do all
Acts of Charity and Benevolence, to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that stand in need of them, let their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Religion be never so different from our
own. So that whosoever will but seriously
consider the great end of our Saviour Christ's
coming into the World, and also the whole
scope and design of his Doctrine; will find,
that it was only to procure, as well by his
Example as Precepts, the good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all Mankind. For to what end else
did he take upon him the Form of a Servant,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53522:163"/>
and endured a poor and miserable life, with
an ignominious Death, but to procure ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
happiness for all those that should tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe in him? Or to what other end were
all those excellent Precepts, so often given by
Christ and his Apostles, <hi>of loving one another</hi>?
And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Romans,</hi>
Chap. 13. v. 8. <hi>that he that loveth another,
hath fulfilled the Law</hi>: And more fully in the
last Chapter to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> v. 14. <hi>For the
Law is fulfilled in this one word, even</hi> in this,
<hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> And
in his First Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Cap. 13.
he is very large and particular in setting forth
the necessity, and exalting the excellency of
Charity, above all the other Spiritual Graces;
without which, he tells them, <hi>If he had Faith
so as to remove Mountains; yet, if he had not
Charity, he were nothing.</hi> Now what is this
Charity, but an unfeigned love and good-will
to all Mankind? Ch. 2.17. And St. <hi>Iames</hi> tells us,
<hi>That Faith without Works is dead, being alone.</hi> And
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his First Epistle, makes the love
<hi>of our Brethren,</hi> (that is of all men) <hi>the great
sign and demonstration of our love to God, when
he tells them, that if a man says, I love God,
and hateth his Brother, he is a lyar; for he that
loveth not his Brother, whom he hath seen, how
can he love God, whom he hath not seen. And
this Commandment we have from him, That he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53522:164"/>
who loveth God, love his Brother also.</hi> So that
whoever will but consider what hath here
been said, cannot but acknowledge, that this
excellent Doctrine of the Gospel, concerning
the most intense love towards God, and the
most diffusive Charity towards Men, doth
not only far exceed all the Precepts of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
but also the Revealed Law of <hi>Moses</hi> it
self. Now what can be the design of all
these excellent Precepts? but by all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Perswasions imaginable, and by
all the Promises of the most glorious Rewards
and Threatnings of the most terrible and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Punishments, to advance the Glory of
God, and to procure the Welfare and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of the whole Race of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="19">Â§. 19. To conclude; Though I suppose
the Law of Nature, if duly observed, where
it hath pleased God to give men no other
knowledge or discovery of his Will, may yet
give them a rational share of happiness, not
only in this Life, but in that to come; yet I
hope no indifferent or rational Man, but upon
due consideration of the lapsed and depraved
state of Humane Nature, and how prone it
is to be carried away by exorbitant Lusts and
Passions, contrary to the Dictates of right
Reason, and his own Conscience, but must
also acknowledge, that it was a great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53522:164"/>
of God's Goodness and Mercy, to
give us the most Glorious Light of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
and to send his Blessed Son, not only to
instruct us, but also to die for us. Which
great Mystery, that in God's due time, and
according to his Promise, may be speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to all Mankind, we ought daily to
make it our hearty Prayers to his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
<hi>That every Heart may know, and every
Tongue confess, That Iesus is both Lord and Christ;
who hath brought Life and Immortality to light,
through the Gospel.</hi>

yet that the major part of men are
not so modest, but will arrogate to themselves
honour above others, or else will assault other
mens Goods, or Persons, out of a false esteem
of their own Power; from thence arises a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of others defending their Persons and

can have a desire to hurt those that have done
them no injury; so that this does not reach all
men, nor yet that even these have a will to
hurt all men alike, but only those that stand

                  </gap>gs; more particularly to
confute the Principles of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and his
Follower Mr. <hi>H.</hi> it being a true Maxim in
other Sciences, as well as Geometry, <hi>Rectum
est Index sui, &amp; obliqui:</hi> Yet since those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have not only poisoned the World with
their pernicious Tenets, but have also endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to support them with the specious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of Reason and Argument; it may
be expected, that we should say somewhat in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53522:176"/>
answer to these Reasons and Arguments
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> the Reviver of those Principles in this
Age, hath brought in his Book <hi>De Cive &amp;
Leviathan,</hi> to maintain and support them.
And therefore I have thought fit to add some
Considerations, and Confutations of them, as
far as they contradict the Principles we have
here laid down; and rather to put them here
all together at the end, than in the Body of our
Treatise of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>; since there
they would not only have interrupted the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
of the Discourse it self, but would
have also disturbed, and taken off the minds of
the ordinary Readers (for whom I chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it) from a due consideration of the truth
and connexion of the things therein contained.
And therefore I have thought fit rather to cast
them all together into a distinct part by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
since if you are Master of that former
Part of this Discourse, you will easily perceive,
not only the Falshood and Absurdity of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s
Principles, but that it was from his Ignorance,
or Inconsideration of this great Principle of
the Common Good of Rational Beings, that
he first fell into those Errors, and made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Self-preservation not only the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
(which had been true enough) but also
the sole end of all Moral Actions, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
false, and below the dignity, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a Philosopher, but a Man. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53522:176"/>
gone through all his Moral Principles in
order; and as for his Politick ones, if these
are false, they will need no other Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and I have reduced them into certain
Heads, or Propositions, and have truly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you this Sum of Arguments, that no man
may find fault with me for misrepresenting
his Opinions.</p>

                  <p>Man is not a Creature born apt for Society.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§. 1. MR. <hi>H.</hi> in his Philosophical Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or Treatise <hi>De Cive,</hi>
Chap. 1. Â§. 2. lays down, and maintains this
Principle, and gives certain specious Reasons
for it; which because they are somewhat te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and divers of them very trivial, I shall
rather chuse to contract them, than be at the
trouble of transcribing all that he hath loosely
enough laid down for the maintenance of this
Assertion; referring you, if you doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I rightly represent his meaning, to the
Author himself in the place above-cited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He there in the first place supposes, that Man
is not a Sociable Creature, because it could not be
otherwise in Nature, but only by accident; for if
Man loved Man naturally, there could be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53522:177"/>
given why every one should not love every
one alike, as being alike Man; or why he should
rather frequent those in whose Society Honour and
Profit is conferred, rather on himself, than others.
Therefore we do not by nature seek Companions,
but to be either honoured, or profited by them.</hi>
These in the first place; but those in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
And this he thinks he hath sufficiently
proved, <hi>by shewing us for what end men herd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and what they do when they are met; for
if they come together for Commerce-sake, every
one minds not his Companion's, but his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
If for Publick Affairs, there arises a
certain Court-friendship, having more of mutual
fear than love; from whence often Faction, but
never Good-will is produced. If for the sake of
Mirth and Pleasure, every one is wont to please
himself in those things which raise laughter; from
whence he may (as it is the nature of what is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous)
by the comparison of another's weakness or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
become more acceptable to himself:</hi> And he
there proceeds to shew from several Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he had made in the Companies he had
kept, <hi>That all men that converse together either
for the sake, or the instruction of others, do only
seek Company for their own profit, or glory, and not
the good of others; that is, for the love of himself,
not of his Companions: And therefore since Man
can never seek Civil Society, only out of a desire
of glory; and although the Profits and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53522:177"/>
of life may be encreased by mens mutual assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
yet since that may be much better procured by
a dominion over others, than by their Society, no
body can doubt, but that men are more vehemently
carried by their Nature, when fear is removed, to
dominion, than Society; therefore it is to be laid
down for a Principle, That the original of all
great and lasting Societies did not proceed from
the mutual Benevolence of Men, but their mutual
Fear; And by Fear, as he tells us in the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this Paragraph, he doth not mean only to
be frightned, but under that word</hi> Fear, <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
any prospect of a future Evil, as to
distrust, suspect, beware, and to provide that they
may not fear, to be also the part of those who
are afraid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. Having given you the Author's Sense,
and in great part his own words; I shall now
proceed to make some Observations upon
them; and in the first place must observe, That
the main strength of his Arguments consists in
the ill, or false use of these words, <hi>unapt for
Society.</hi> For if he only understands by them,
that Men are born actually unapt for Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
because they are Infants, or else unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
of the Evils proceeding from the
Wants thereof; this is indeed a great disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and worthy a Philosopher, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or People without experience, are not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53522:178"/>
able to understand the meaning or force of
Compacts; or are unable immediately to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a Civil State. Nor is his Reason any
better; That though Infants and persons of
full Age, though unexperienced, partake of
Human Nature; yet being thus unapt for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
Man is not made fit for it by Nature,
but Discipline.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. From whence I observe, That he only
takes the measure of Humane Nature, from
those Passions which precede the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Experience, and Discipline. And as
they first and chiefly shew themselves in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Fools; or persons unexperienced.
Whereas, according to the Opinion of the
best Philosophers, we suppose the truer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man, ought rather to be taken from
his utmost Perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> his Reason, or the
power of deducing Effects from their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
by which alone, he is distinguished from
Brutes: And so the Will may incline us to
those things, which Reason shall judge most
fit and convenient for our Natures. And
therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth very absurdly, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Experience, and Discipline, to Nature;
since whatever men learn by either of these,
they must still attain to it by the force of their
Rational Natures, and those Faculties of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Speech, which Brutes are not capable
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53522:178"/>
of: And therefore the nature of a Creature is
best judged of from the utmost Perfection it
attains to: As the Nature of a Plant is not to
be taken from its first appearance, or as soon
as ever it peeps out of the Earth, but from its
utmost state of perfection, when it comes to bear
Flowers, Seed, or Fruit. And even that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
to which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> attributes all our
Reason, he himself grants to be a natural, and
not acquired Power: See his <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
Chap. 8. where treating of Intellectual Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
he hath these Words; <hi>The Intellectual
Vertues are of two sorts, Natural, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
By Natural, I mean not that which a man
hath from his Birth, for that is nothing else but
sense, wherein men differ so little from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from brute Beasts, as it is not to be
reckoned amongst the Virtues. But I mean that
Wit, which is gotten by use only, and experience,
without method, culture, or Instruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. To conclude this Head, I desire those
Gentlemen of his Opinion, to take notice,
That all Philosophers, and Writers of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
as well as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> were not ignorant
how unfit Infants, and Grown Persons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
experience, or labouring under any unruly
Passion, were to enter into Leagues, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts;
or to perform any of the Duties of a
Civil Society: But yet for all that, they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53522:179"/>
man to be born for those ends; which
by the force of his Rational Nature, he may
at last attain to, unless something preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
(such as are those disorderly Passions, or
Diseases of the Mind) intervene: And <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi>'s
Saying is as old as true; <hi>Non aliud
Natura, aliud Sapientia dictat.</hi> And sure it is
a childish Inference, and favours more of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,
than true Philosophy, to say, <hi>Men are
born Infants, and therefore unapt for Civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</hi>
Since any Country Fellow could have
taught him better, who thinks his Son born apt
to be a Plough-man, or a Grasier, though he
knows he will not be able to hold the Plough,
until he is twelve or thirteen years of age<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
Nor yet to understand Grazing, until he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ride and go to Market.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. But let us now more particularly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Reasons this Author there gives us,
why Man is a Creature naturally unapt for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
which he will have to be only by accident;
<hi>Because if one man loved another naturally as man,
there could be no reason why every man should not
love every man alike; or wherefore he should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
frequent those in whose company he is most
likely to get Honour and Profit. Therefore we
do not naturally seek Companions,</hi> i. e. <hi>for their
own sakes; but either to gain Honour or Prosit
by them: These in the first place; but those in the
Second,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:53522:179"/>In answer to which, I grant indeed, that
particular persons, when they joyn with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in any Society or Company, do usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider some peculiar end, either of Profit
or Pleasure; which may thence redound to
themselves. Yet doth it not therefore follow
that Man is not a Creature designed by God
for Society; or that he is not obliged by the
Laws of Nature, or right Reason to be friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sociable even to those from whom no
present advantage can be expected. For tho'
it be granted, that men either from a peculiar
agreement of dispositions, or that they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they can sooner obtain some particular
end or advantage, in some mens Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than others; and do therefore prefer such
mens Company before others; yet does not
this prove, That man is not naturally a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creature: Since he himself grants, That
men can neither live comfortably, nor be so
much as bred up, or preserved, without the
help and society of others.</p>
               <p>Therefore if he is determined to the end,
<hi>viz.</hi> happiness, and self-preservation, he is
likewise as necessarily determined to the means,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Society. And his inclination to this
or that man's company more than others, is
no more an Argument against our Natures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Society, than if I should argue<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
That because I love Mutton better than Veal<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:53522:180"/>
therefore it is not from my nature, but only
by accident, that I am ordained to preserve
my life by eating. And as for the instances
which he gives, to let us see with what intent
men meet together, from what men do when
they are met. It is plain that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> here
confounds that natural Society, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary for man's preservation, with
these particular Clubs or Companies, which
men keep for their greater pleasure or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
And though I have already granted,
that some mens particular profit or pleasure
may be promoted or increased, by frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some mens Companies, rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
as suppose there be a greater agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Dispositions; or that we have been
more used to this or that man's Company by
Education, or long acquaintance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
though it be likewise granted, that a man
does more frequent their Company, among
whom he finds most honour and profit. Since
every man may lawfully pursue his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and advantages (if he knows rightly
how to judge of it.) Yet this doth not at all
contradict man's sociable nature, provided
the Common Bonds of Society be not broken
and disturbed, by any mans more particular
Interests or Inclinations; and God has not so
designed us to good for others, as that we
should neglect all care of our selves; but that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53522:180"/>
this sociableness is therefore to be observed by
mankind, that by a mutual communication of
humane assistances, and other natural goods,
between divers persons, we may more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
promote our own pleasure or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
jointly with that of others; Since a
mutual love and benevolence, is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among men, though not otherwise rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to each other, than by the common relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Humanity, and with whom we may
preserve a sufficient concord, by doing them
good, rather than hurt, whenever it lies in
our power. And though a man, when he
joyns himself with some particular Company,
will in the first place consider his own pleasure
or profit, before that of his Companions:
Yet ought he not so to consult his private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as that the good of the Civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
or of Mankind in general, be thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced,
by injuring any of its particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
And a man as well in Natural, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Civil Actions, may propose his own
pleasure or profit, in the first place, though
he may also intend some higher or nobler end
of his thus acting. Thus a man who intends
to marry, may lawfully propose to himself
his own pleasure and satisfaction; though the
great end of Marriage, (and which he may
also chiefly intend) be the propagation of
Mankind. So likewise a Master or Tutor that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53522:181"/>
instructs others, may lawfully propose to
himself his own profit or advantage thereby;
though he may also ultimately intend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of his Scholars, or Pupils (that is,
the Common Good of Mankind) as the great
end of his taking that Profession. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in Civil Societies or Commonwealths,
a man may propose to himself his own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Profit, or Honour, as a reason why he
bestows his time and labour, or ventures his
life in the service of the Publick: And yet
he may farther propose to himself the love of
his Countrey, or the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as the great End of his Actions.</p>
               <p n="6">Â§. 6. So that it is to little purpose, which
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> alledges, That the original of the
greatest and most lasting Societies, to wit,
Commonwealths, did not proceed from
mutual Good-will, but mutual Fear; (the
Word Fear being used for any fore-sight, or
precaution of a future Evil.) For we are
not here considering the original of Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
but of that natural sociableness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, which we look upon as most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and agreeable to the nature of man;
though some particular men being also sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
how obnoxious they were to the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of those who sought their own pleasure
or profit, without any consideration of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53522:181"/>
interest or good of others, did, to prevent
them, unite themselves together in that
stricter League of Amity, called Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
So that this Common Amity or Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
cannot be omitted to be first supposed,
even in the very constitution of Common
wealths: Since those who founded them,
must have been before united, either by some
natural relation; and a mutual confidence in,
or benevolence towards each other; although
perhaps, others might afterwards, out of
fear of their Power, or a liking of their
Government, be compelled or allured, to
joyn or associate themseves with them.</p>
               <p n="7">Â§. 7. But as for those Instances Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives
us of those that seek Society only to censure
the Lives and Actions of other men; thereby
to gain Glory to themselves, from the Follies
or Infirmities of those they converse with;
Such sort of Conversation, consisting for the
most part of some idle ill-natured men, who
count themselves Wits, and have little else
to do, but to speak ill of, and censure others,
does not concern the major part of Mankind;
who needing each others Society, for more
necessary occasions, have commonly other
Business to discourse of, when they meet.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:53522:182"/>Â§. 8. As for the rest of those things he says,
That the Necessaries of life may be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
procured by dominion over, than by the
Society of others, that is altogether false, and
precarious; since no man by his own single
strength, and without the voluntary help or
society of others, could ever yet subdue, and
make Slaves of all other men he met with:
And therefore if any man ever increased his
natural power or advantage over others, it
was not by vertue of his own sole power or
strength, but by mens deference to his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or Vertue, when they chose him for
their Head, or Leader; or else that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, and obeyed his Commands as
their Father, or Grandfather, out of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to his Wisdom, or Gratitude for his
Benefits.</p>
               <p n="9">Â§. 9. To conclude, He himself there objects,
that men cannot grow up, or live contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without the society and assistance of others:
And therefore cannot deny, but men desire
the society of each other, their Nature compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them thereunto. But to come off from
this Objection, he will have nothing called
Society, but Commonwealths; which, says
he, are not meer Meetings, but Leagues, for
making of which Compacts are necessary.
And therefore still argues, that Infants, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53522:182"/>
those that are unexperienced, are uncapable
of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which I shall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That Mr. <hi>H.</hi> imposes upon himself, and
others, by confounding that first, and most
natural amity, and sociableness of Persons of
one and the same Family, as of Husband and
Wife, Parents and Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> towards
each other, with that artificial Society, which
proceeding wholly from Compacts, we call a
Commonwealth: So likewise he imposes on
his Readers in the use of the words <hi>Nature,
and Natural</hi> (as I have partly shewn already)
for by these words is commonly understood,
either something that is by Nature insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
proper to its subject, as to a Fish to swim;
and other things are natural and proper to a
Creature, not as a meer Animal, but as of
such a Species, and at such an Age; as for a
Man to go upon two Legs, and speak. Lastly,
It sometimes signifies an aptness in a Subject
to receive some farther perfection by culture
and discipline, with which Nature intended
it should be endued. So the Earth is intended
by Nature for the production of Vegetables;
yet it doth not naturally bring forth all Plants
in all places alike, without Plowing, or Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
yet are not these Plants so sown, or set,
less natural for all that: So likewise I have
already proved, that whatever perfection we
attain to by the power of our Reason or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53522:183"/>
it is not less natural notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>

<hi>The cause of mutual Fear consists partly in mens
natural equality, partly in their mutual Will of
hurting; from whence it happens, that we are
neither able to expect security from others, nor
yet afford it to our selves; For if we consider
Men grown up, and take notice how frail the
Frame of a Man's Body is (which failing, all his
force, strength and wisdom fails together with it)
and how easie it is for any the most weak, to kill
the strongest Man; there is no reason, that
any man trusting in his own strength, should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himself superior by Nature to others. For
those are equal, who are able to do the like things
against each other; but those who can do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thing, that is, take away life, are able to do
like, or equal things to each other; therefore all
men are by nature equal, that unequality which
now is, being introduced by Civil Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:53522:183"/>Â§. 2. Before I answer which, I shall first
make these Concessions and Limitations:
<hi>First,</hi> I grant, That all Civil unequality of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
is introduced by Civil Laws. 2<hi>dly,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                  </gap>at
there is also such a natural equality among
Men, that there is nothing which one man
can arrogate to himself as a Man, but by the
same reason which he judges it fit or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for himself, he must also judge it alike fit
and necessary for another man, who stands in
like need of it. Thus if Victuals, Cloaths,
and Liberty, are things necessary for his own
being, and preservation, they are likewise
equally necessary for the well-being and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of all other men, and consequently
that they have a like right to them; from
which natural equality proceeds that great Rule
of the Law of Nature, <hi>To do to others, as we would
have others do to us:</hi> And in this sense I agree
with him, that all men are equal; so that in
this sense it is so far from being a cause of war,
or dissention among men, that it rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
to amity and concord: Yet doth not
this equality hinder, but that there is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
a natural unequality of strength
or power amongst men, both in body and
mind; since any man, that doth but observe
the great difference there is in both the
strength and understanding of some persons
above others, but will grant, that there is as
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53522:184"/>
great, or greater difference between some
men and others, than there is between some
Brutes (supposing Apes, or Elephants) and
men, in understanding: Yet does there not any
natural equality follow from the Reason
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> here gives us, <hi>That those are equal, that
are able to do the like things to each other, to wit,
take away their lives:</hi> For besides that, there
are some born maimed, and cripled, or else so
void of understanding, as not to have either
the will or ability to hurt or kill others;
and if a Coward and a stout man are to fight,
or a very weak man and a strong, will any
man say that they are an equal match? And
this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tells us, <hi>That it is easie for the
weakest to kill the strongest man; he grants it
must either be by chance, cunning, or surprize.</hi>
I grant indeed it may happen by chance, and
yet this will not make the match to be equal;
any more than it is in Cockfighting, where
the Gamesters will lay five to one on such a
Cock's side against another set down to fight
with him; and though perhaps the weaker
Cock may happen to kill the stronger by a
chance stroke, yet no man will therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that both these Cocks were equal by
nature; the same may be said of Men. But it
may be replied, That there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Men and Beasts, since though
Brutes cannot, yet a Man weaker in body or
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53522:184"/>
mind than another he would be revenged of,
may join, or combine with one as wise and
strong as his Adversary, and then they will
be an equal Match in point of strength. If
this were a good Argument, it would prove
more, or rather contrary to that for which it
is designed; for this weaker man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
with one as strong and wise as the other,
and then the odds will be apparently on
the weaker man's side: But if I should grant
the utmost that can be asked, that both these
mens wit and strength taken together, are
still but an equal match to the other, may not
this wiser and stronger man as well also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
with others as wise and strong as himself,
and then will not the unequality be much
greater than it was before? And as for cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or surprize, it signifies as little, since
the stronger man may be as cunning as the
other, and may have also as good luck in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
him at unawares; but it is indeed a
very trivial Argument to prove this natural
equality, because those are equal that are able
to do the like things to each other; since this
were to level Man with the most despicable
Creatures; For there is scarce any Beast, nay
Insect, so weak, but may sometime or other
destroy a man by force, or surprize; and we
read of a Pope who was choaked by swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Fly in his Drink, which if it could be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53522:185"/>
supposed to be done by the Fly on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
would make the Fly and the Pope to
be equal by Nature.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§. 1. WHich Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thus endeavours to
prove in the same Chapter of his
<hi>De Cive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a will</hi> (says he) <hi>indeed in all men of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurt in the state of Nature, but not from the
same cause, nor alike culpable. For one man, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a natural equality, allows to others all the
same things as to himself, which is the part of
a modest man, and of one that rightly measures
his own strength; another esteeming himself su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to others, will have all things to be lawful
for himself only, and arrogates an honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
above others, which is the part of a proud
disposition; therefore the will of hurting is in this
man from a vain glory; and a false esteem of his
own power, as it is in the other from a necessity of
defending his own Goods and Liberty against the
other's violence. Besides, since the strife of wit
is the greatest amongst men, it is necessary that
very great discord should arise from that Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53522:185"/>
for it is not only odious to contradict, but
also not to consent; for not to consent to another
in a thing, is tacitly to accuse him of error in that
matter; so likewise to dissent in very many things,
is as much as to count him a Fool; which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from hence, that no Wars are more sharply
prosecuted, than between different Sects of the
same Religion, and the Factions of the same
Commonwealth, where there is a strife concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doctrine, or Civil Prudence. But since
all pleasure and satisfaction of mind consists
in this, That a man may have somewhat, by
which, comparing himself with others, he may
think highly well of himself; it is impossible
but that they should shew their mutual hatred
and contempt sometimes, either by laughter,
words or gestures, or by some outward sign,
than which there is indeed no greater vexation of,
mind, neither from which a greater desire of
hurting can arise. But the most frequent cause
why men desire to hurt each other, arises from
hence, that many desire the same thing at once;
yet (which very often happens) they neither
may, nor can enjoy it in common, nor will yet
divide it; from whence it follows, that it must
be given to the stronger; but who is the stronger,
can only be known by fighting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. From which, I shall first observe,
That it is not true, that in the state of Nature,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53522:186"/>
there is in all men a like will of hurting each
other: For in this State, the first, and most
natural condition to be considered is, when
men have not as yet at all provoked each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor done them either good or harm.
And in this condition, none but a Fool, a
Wicked man, or a Mad-man can have any
desire to hurt another, who hath given him
no provocation for it: Though I grant, that
there are too many men (such as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
describes) who will arrogate more things to
themselves, than they either deserve, or real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
need; yet even in these men, there is not
a will to hurt every man alike, but only those
who stand in their way; and whose Goods,
or other things, they may think may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for themselves. Nor yet are these all
Mankind, since he grants there are some, and
perhaps as many, or more; who, according
to natural equality, will allow to others all
the same things, as to themselves, which he
grants is the part of a modest man, and who
makes a true estimate of his own strength.
And certainly, if this modest man judges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to right reason, who allows to others
the same things, as to himself; this violent or
proud man (he here describes) cannot acquire
any right to the liberty or goods of others,
from his own unreasonable judgment, and
false estimation of his own strength or merit:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53522:186"/>
Nor is this self-defence, of the modest or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, properly a desire to hurt the other,
but only a necessity to defend himself against
his assaults, since he had no intention to hurt
him, before this violent man gave him a just
provocation.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. As for that strife of Wit, which (as he
says) is the greatest among men; though
there may be some difference in Opinions, and
Contentions arise from thence; Yet doth it
not therefore follow, that there must from
thence necessarily arise a desire in all men, of
hurting or destroying others: For there are
many of so equal and reasonable a disposition,
that they can find no cause of hating, much
less of hurting others; though they often dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from them in opinion; or that they must
take all others for fools, if they prefer their
own Judgment before another Man's.</p>
               <p>And as for Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Instances, that there
are no Wars more sharp than those between
the different Sects of the same Religion, or
the Factions of the same Commonwealth,
these Examples will not make out that for
which he produces them; Since he grants,
Wars about Religion do seldom happen, but
amongst those of different Sects in the same
Religion; which shews it doth not proceed
from the Natural State of Mankind, which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53522:187"/>
ought to be governed by Reason, not Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;
much less from natural Religion,
but from an unreasonable Superstition, or
blind Zeal, too often inflamed by the Priests
of either Party; making it not their own,
but God's Cause, or Glory, (as they call it)
for which they would have them fight, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute,
and destroy each other. And as for
the Wars and Contentions between the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Factions of the same Commonwealth;
it is apparent they have no place in the meer
state of Nature; since they are produced by
mens entring into Civil Society; aud there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are not fairly urged by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as an
Instance of their desire to hurt each other in
the state of Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. In answer to his Assertion, <hi>That all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the mind is placed in something, by
which a man comparing himself with others, may
thereby think highly well of himself: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is impossible but they must declare their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and contempt of each other, sometimes either
by laughter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>than which there can be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vexation, neither from which a greater desire
of revenge doth usually arise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thus reply: First, Neither does this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
reach, so that they must needs take
pleasure in puting a higher value upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
than they deserve; or that right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53522:187"/>
or Prudence, should perswade them to
affront others, either by Words or Actions:
Neither yet to take for Affronts, and mortal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
all those things, which any silly, ill-bred
Fellow may happen to do: Since such quarrels
do not proceed either from Nature, or Reason,
but from foolish Customs, and bad Education;
as appears in making, <hi>giving the lie,</hi> an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
which was not so, till about an Age a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone;
neither is among other Nations, but
us <hi>Europeans,</hi> any occasion of a Quarrel: Nor
yet is there any necessity, but that men may,
and often do differ from each other, in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and words too, without giving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the lie, or any just occasion of offence:
And therefore these are no sufficient grounds
to raise a general Rule of the Natural state of
all Mankind, from the indiscretion, or ill
manners of some, nay many men.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. As for his last Reason, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of divers men at once to the same
thing, which cannot be decided without
fighting.</p>
               <p>In answer to this, I grant this may be true
amongst Brutes; as also amongst brutish
and unreasonable men: But since God hath
endued men with Reason, either to divide
the thing, if it be capable of division; or
else to use it by turns, where it is not, where
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53522:188"/>
divers have an equal right in it; or else to
leave it wholly to the first occupant; since e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man hath a natural right to what he thus
acquires, as is fully proved in the precedent
discourse. Therefore granting mens Lusts
and Passions do often encline them to War
and contention, yet are not they therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
or necessitated thereunto; seeing
God hath given Man Reason to foresee, as
also to prevent the evils of War; and has
likewise endued them with as strong Passions
(as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> acknowledges) to incline them
to peace; as hath been more fully made out,
when we speak of the Natural State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
Neither in the state of Nature, hath
God made so niggardly a distribution of
things, that no man can desire; or make use
of any thing necessary for life, but presently
another must start up to be his competitor
for it: Since if men lived according to right
Reason, and the necessities of Nature, and
still used the Fruits of the whole Earth in
Common, there would be yet left a sufficient
stock to supply the Necessities of them all,
without coveting the Goods of others, or tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away that they are already possessed of.</p>

               <p n="1">Â§. 1. <hi>THAT is (as he explains it) in a

was lawful for every one to do all things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

things any one would have, they either seemed

either conduce to his own preservation, or at least
may seem to conduce to it: But whether those

hath in the former Article proved the Person him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be sole judge. So that those must be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as necessary means, which he judges as such:
And by the 7th Article aforegoing, those things
are done and enjoyed by the right of Nature,
which do necessarily conduce to the preservation of
his own life and members: Whence it follows, to
have and do all things in the state of Nature, is
lawful for all men; and this is what is commonly said, That Nature hath given all things to all men:
From whence also it is understood, that in the
state of nature, Profit or</hi> utility, is the measure
of Right.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is so to be understood, that that which
anyone may do, in a meer natural state, is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to no man: Not that in such a state it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to sin against God, or to violate the Laws
of Nature; but injustice towards men supposes
Human Laws, which are not in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
But the truth of the proposition so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
is demonstrated to the mindful Reader, in
the foregoing Paragraphs: But because in some
cases, the hardness of the Conclusion drives out
the memory of the Premises, he contracts the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and lays it thus to be seen at once; By Art,
the 7th it is proved, that every one hath a right
of preserving himself; and by Art. the 8th.
Therefore the same person hath a right to use all
means necessary thereunto. But by Art. the 9th,
Those means are necessary, which he shall judge to
be so. Therefore the same person hath a right to
have, and possess all things which he shall judge
necessary for his own preservation: Therefore in
the judgment of the doer, that which is done, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by Right, because in the state of Nature nothing
is injurious.</hi>

as also for the answering the Arguments
which he brings to support it, I shall in the
first place observe, That the Author's Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
which he makes from his Premises in his
Annotations, <hi>viz. That every man hath a right
to do, and possess all things which himself shall

the same which he draws from the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
in the Text, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>That every man hath
a right to have, and do all things in the state of
Nature.</hi> For indeed from his own Principles
no other Conclusion can follow, than what he
hath now drawn from thence in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for no man in his right Senses ever yet
judged, that to have, and do all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
was absolutely necessary for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;
only that he had a right indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
to as many of them as he should judge
necessary for this End. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Neither ought
a man in the state of Nature to propose the
bare preservation of his own Life, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as the only end of living, since that may
be enjoyed by those who are really very mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as may be observed in such as labour
under tedious and constant Infirmities, or are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53522:190"/>
condemned to the Mines, or Gallies, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to be carried away by any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering,
or irrational Appetite or Passion<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>And if the preservation of a man's Life and
Members, were the only ends of life; then if
another in the state of Nature should threaten
to kill or maim him, unless he would deny, or
blaspheme God, or murther his Father, it
were upon this Principle lawful, nay necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for him so to do; it being the only means
by which he could preserve his life and
Limbs. 3<hi>dly,</hi> Neither doth any man's rash or
false judgment, that such a thing is necessary
for his own preservation, confer on him a right
to that thing; for then God had given him a
right to all things they should in any passion, or
rash and inconsiderate humour fancy necessary
for that end, tho it really tended to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
or that of other innocent men; So that
if a man should think the blood of his dearest
Friend would cure him of some Distemper he
lay under, he might lawfully upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
murther him (if he could do it safely);
And then God should have given men a
right of destroying themselves and others,
whenever they thought (though falsly) that
it conduced to their preservation, the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their unreasonable Appetites or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:
since such an unlimited Right, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
License, can be so far from conducing to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53522:190"/>
any man's preservation, that if any men should
ever have gone about to put it in practice, it
would have long since produced not only
their own destruction, but that of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

<hi>That it is a liberty of using a man's Faculties
according to right Reason</hi>; then certainly right
Reason can never judge contradictory Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
to be true, as that I should in the state
of Nature have a right to all things my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
was possessed of, and his life into the
bargain, if I thought it might conduce to my
self-preservation; and that this should be
likewise as true, and rational a conclusion, that
he should have the like <hi>right</hi> against me;
since the word <hi>right</hi> is never used by any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this Subject, but with respect to some
Law, either Natural, or Civil, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
acknowledges in the next Chapter, <hi>Art.</hi> 1st,
in these words. <hi>But since all do grant that to
be done by Right, which is not done contrary to
right Reason, we ought to suppose that done by
Injury, which is repugnant to right reason; or
which contradicts some truth collected from true
Principles by right Reason; but that is done by
Injury, which is done against some Law, therefore
right Reason is a certain Law, which is called na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53522:191"/>
since it is not less a part of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than any other Faculty or Affection of the
Mind:</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself confesses in this 2d
Chapter of this Treatise <hi>De Cive,</hi> Â§. 1. tho
he strives to avoid the force of it in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to this Article; where, by right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the state of Nature, he tells us, <hi>He
does not thereby understand (as many do) any
infallible Faculty in men, but the Act of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination;
that is, every man's own true reason
concerning his own Actions, as they may redound
to the profit or hurt of himself, or other men;
and the reason why he calls it a mans own Reason,
is, that though in a Commonwealth the reason
thereof, that is, the Civil Law, is to be taken as
right by all the Subjects; yet out of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
where no man can distinguish right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from false, but by comparing it with his own,
every man's own Reason is not only to be taken for
the Rule of his own Actions, but also in his own
Affairs, for the measure of all other mens Reason:</hi>
But how this will agree with what follows,
I cannot tell; <hi>When he calls right Reason that
which concludes from true Principles; because that
in false ratiocination, or in the folly of men not
observing those duties towards others which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to their own preservation, consists all the
violation of natural Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how false ratiocination, or folly, should
give them a right to all they have a mind to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53522:191"/>
act thus towards others, I cannot apprehend;
but from these words of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I shall only
observe, That though I do not suppose Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be any infallible Faculty, any more
than the casting up of an Account into a
Sum total, though false, to be right Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,
or true Counting; yet by right
Reason, when it is not erroneous, is to be
understood the true exercise of that Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
not erroneous in its judgments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not consist in the bare act of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination,
but in its true effects; that is,
when true Propositions, or Premises, being
laid up in the memory, those Conclusions are
drawn from thence, which when they are
practical, and contain true moral Rules of
life, are called Laws of Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. And therefore it is not true, that in
a Commonwealth the publick Reason, or
Law thereof, are to be always taken for
Right; for then if the Laws of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
should enact Parricide, Ingratitude, and
breach of Faith, to be exercised as Vertues,
and to conduce to the good and preservation
of Mankind, they would presently become
so; which, I suppose, neither this Author,
nor any rational Man would affirm. Nor is
his other Proposition any truer, that out of a
Commonwealth, no man can distinguish
right Reason from false, but by comparing it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53522:192"/>
with his own; and therefore that must be the
measure of all his Actions, from whence he
deduces the right of all men to all things;
which Argument I shall reduce into the form
of a Syllogism, that you may the better judge
of its truth. <hi>It is lawful in the state of Nature
for every one to possess all things, and to do all
things towards all men, which some Iudge shall
judge necessary for the preservation of his own
life and Members: But those things that every
man himself shall judge to be necessary to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
those the only Iudge in this case judges
to be necessary for this end</hi>; (for he had proved
before, that himself is the only Judge in the
state of Nature, what things are necessary for
his preservation;) <hi>therefore to have, and do all
things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is necessary for a man's own preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
In which Syllogism the major is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly false, because though a man's self be the
sole Judge in the state of Nature, yet he may
give a false Sentence, and suppose those
things to be necessary for his preservation
which really are not; neither is there any
reason that in the state of Nature, any more
than in a Civil State, the bare Sentence of a
Judge should confer a true and equitable
Right on any man to an Estate, if the Judge
determines contrary to all the Rules of Law
and Equity. So likewise in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a man's own judgment can confer no
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53522:192"/>
Right upon him, when he quits the only true
Rules of his Judgment, which in this State
can only be the Laws of Nature, or right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the nature of things, and Mankind,
from whence only they are drawn. Nor can
there be any State supposed, either Natural,
or Civil, in which there is no Rule of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Judgment, or that whatsoever a man's
mind shall rashly suppose things to be, that
they must presently become such as he hath
fancied them: Since the utility of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the preservation of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
depend not upon mens rash judgments,
but upon the force of their natural Causes;
and a man by thus falsly judging, that he had
a right to all things that he hath a mind to,
and that they are absolutely necessary for his
preservation, can no more make them become
so, than if he should judge that Ratsbane
were Sugar-candy, it would be thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
turned into wholsome Food: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
those general, and universal Causes,
which procure the preservation, or mischief
of Mankind, do depend upon such fixt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in Nature, as are not to be altered by the
judgment of any Judge, whether he be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
man in the state of Nature, or the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Powers in a Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:53522:193"/>Â§. 5. But this Error of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the force of his Sentence, which thus fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounces an absolute Dominion over all
men, and all things, to be necessary for his
preservation, and thereby to confer a Right
thereunto; seems to proceed from hence,
That he having observed in a Civil State the
Sentence of the Supream Magistrate, or
Judge, had that force with the Subjects, that
whether his Sentence were according to the
Rules of Law, or natural Equity, or not, it
was nevertheless to be obeyed, and submitted
to: Whereas this Submission proceeds whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from their Consents who instituted the
Commonwealth, in order to the publick
Good, and for the putting some end to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies;
since all the Subjects must submit
to the Judgment of the Supream Power, or
Magistrate, whether it be right or wrong;
because they are all satisfied, that it conduces
more to their common quiet and safety, that
some few should sometimes suffer through an
unjust Judgment, than that Controversies
should be endless, or at least not without Civil
Wars, or Disturbances. So that it is evident,
That it is only from a greater care of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good, than of the Lives or Estates of any
particular person that lays a foundation for
this Prerogative, which though I grant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to all Supream Powers, yet if this once
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53522:193"/>
come to be generally and notoriously abused
by constant course of wilful Violence, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and Injustice, so that the Subjects
cannot longer bear it, they will quickly
make their appeal somewhere else, unless they
are hindred by some predominant Power, or
Force over them.</p>
               <p n="6">Â§. 6. But on the other side it is certain,
That men in the state of Nature cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any final Judgment, or determination
of a doubt or difference, besides an evidence
either from the things themselves, or from
that trust or credit they place in some mens
either Judgment or Testimony, whereby all
manner of doubt or scruple is clearly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of the minds of the Parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that it appears evident to them, that
they are not imposed upon; neither can there
be any end of debates amongst divers Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
unless one Party being convinced by
the strength of the other's Reasons, come over
to his, or their Opinion; or else being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of the Knowledge and Integrity of some
third Person, as an Arbitrator, do willingly
submit to his Sentence.</p>
               <p n="7">Â§. 7. For Humane Nature will ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a difference between right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and false; and between a just, and an
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53522:194"/>
unjust Judgment; and 'tis only Truth and
right Reason that have this Prerogative, that
they can confer a right on us of doing those
things which they prescribe. For even
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his definition of <hi>Right,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that it is only a liberty of using our
Faculties according to right Reason; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all Error, or false Judgment, whether it
be concerning Necessaries for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Life, or in any other practical matter,
can give no man a right of doing that which
he then falsly judges necessary for his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And therefore Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Conclusion,
where he acknowledges at last, <hi>That right
Reason is that which concludes from true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
and likewise that in the false reasoning, and
folly of men, in not understanding their Duties
towards other men, consists all the violation of the
Laws of Nature</hi>; grants as much as I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
but how this will agree with that loose
definition of Reason, where he supposes every
man's reason to be alike right, I desire any of
his Disciples to shew me. Therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
I can only allow that to be practical
right Reason, which gives us leave to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
things reasonable and possible, and that
forbids a man to arrogate to himself alone a
dominion over all men, and all things, which
is needless and impossible, indeed wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to his preservation.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:53522:194"/>Â§. 8. But to avoid this difficulty, Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
and his Followers fly to the Subterfuge of a
natural necessity in men, that so judge thus
falsly, and act contrary to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Reason: And therefore in his Preface
to this Treatise, he supposes <hi>all men to be evil
by Nature, and makes them necessarily determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by their Appetites and Passions (before they
are endued with Reason and Discipline) to act mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievously,
and unreasonably; and therefore tells
us, that Children, unless you give them every
thing they desire, cry, and are angry, and will
strike their very Fathers and Mothers; and it
is by nature they do so, and yet are blameless; as
well because they cannot hurt, as also that wanting
the use of Reason, they are yet free from all its
Duties: But the same persons, when grown up,
and having got strength enough to hurt, if they
hold on to do the same things, they then begin both
to be, and to be called evil. So that a wicked man
is almost the same thing, as an overgrown Child,
or a man of a childish disposition, because there is
the same defect of Reason at that age, in which
by Nature, improved by Discipline, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of its inconveniencies, it commonly happens
to be amended.</hi> So likewise the Author of
<hi>Tractatus Theologico Politicus,</hi> who more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than Mr. <hi>H.</hi> (but upon the same Principles)
endeavours to destroy all Religion, both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and Revealed; argues to this purpose,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53522:195"/>
in the 16th Chap. of the said Treatise. First,
<hi>By the Law of Nature, He understands nothing
but the Nature of every Individual; according to
which, we conceive each of them naturally determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to exist after a certain manner. Thus Fishes
are ordained to swim, and the great ones to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the less: Therefore Fishes live in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and devour each other by the highest Right:
For Nature considered simply, hath a right to all
things it can do, or its right extends it self, as
far as its power; Since the power of Nature is
but the power of God, who hath the highest right
to all things. But because the power of Vniversal
Nature, is nothing but the power of all the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Creatures together, it follows that every
Individual hath the highest right to all things it
can do; that is, it extends it self as far as its
power. And since it is the first Law of Nature,
that every thing should endeavour, as far as it is
able, to preserve it self in its Natural State: and
that, without any consideration of other Creatures,
but only of it self: Therefore it follows, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Individual hath the highest right to exist, and
operate, as it is thus naturally determined: Nor
will he allow any difference, by Nature, between
men and other Creatures; neither between men
endued with Reason, and those that have not yet
attained the use of it; neither between Fools and
Madmen, and others that are of sound Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
and his Reason is this, For whatever
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53522:195"/>
any Creature doth by the force of its Nature, it
doth it by the highest Right,</hi> viz. <hi>because it acts
as it is by Nature determined, neither is it able to
act otherwise: Therefore among men, whilst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as living under the meer Empire of Nature,
as well he that doth not yet understand Reason,
or hath not acquired a habit of Virtue, lives by
the highest Right, according to the Laws of his
own Appetite, as well as he that directs his Life
according to the Rules of Reason. So that as a
Wise-man hath a Right to all things that Reason
dictates, or of living according to its Rules: So
likewise the ignorant and foolish hath a like right
to all things which their Appetites desire. So that
every man's Natural Right, is not determined
by Right Reason, but by Power and Appetite.
For all men are not naturally ordained to operate
according to the Laws of Reason, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
are born ignorant of all things; and before
they come to know the true Rules of life, or acquire
a habit of Vertue, a great part of their life slips
away, tho' they are never so well educated: And
therefore he concludes, that whatever any one does
in order as he thinks to his own preservation, or
the satisfaction of Sensual Appetites, whilst he is
in this meer state of Nature, it is lawful, because
the only Rule he hath to act by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">Â§. 9. Having given you all that can be said
for this wicked, as well as foolish Opinion,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53522:196"/>
in their own words; I shall now endeavour
to confute it. In the first place therefore I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that this which they call the right of
Nature, and which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> defines to be a state
of perfect Liberty, is in their sense no other
than that of absolute necessity: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall leave it to the Reader to judge how
properly this word <hi>Right</hi> belongs to Brutes,
Infants, and Fools. For the Word <hi>Right</hi> is
used by those that treat of Ethicks, only in
respect of reasonable men, as capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
and judgment, and endued with
freedom of Action, and so subject to Laws.
For to call that necessity, by which Fishes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
each other, and Mad-men beat their
Keepers, a <hi>Right,</hi> were as proper to talk of a
Right of Stones to fall downwards: no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
but these, ever using the word <hi>Right</hi>
for necessity, but a liberty left by the Law of
Nature, of acting according to Reason:
2ly, The last Author confounds the nature of
Beasts, Fools and Mad-men, who have no
knowledge of a God, or sense of a Moral
Good and Evil, with that of rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who are ordained for greater ends, and
to be governed by a higher Law, than that
of meer Appetite or Passion: And I desire
these Gentlemen to shew us, that such unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Appetites and Passions do necessarily
and unevitably carry men to act constantly
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53522:196"/>
according to them; so that the men had then
no power left, to oppose, resist or restrain them:
and tho' we grant that Children are not yet
sensible; and Fools and Mad-men are never
perhaps capable of the Laws of Reason or
Nature, and so cannot be subject to them, nor
are to be esteemed amongst voluntary Agents:
Yet doth it not follow, that those that are of
Mature Age, and sound Minds, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
plead invincible ignorance of the Laws
of Nature, but out of their own wilful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
or unreasonable Appetites, neglect to
know or learn, or through wilful ignorance
transgress it, should claim the like exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For though we are not angry with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or natural Fools, if they cry for, or take
away any thing they see, and pity mad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
even while they are outragious with
those that tend them: Yet have we not the
same forbearance and pity for men of sound
Minds, and mature Age, if they do the like
unreasonable things, and govern themselves
by no other Law, but their own unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Appetites and Passions; Since it was in
their power both to have known and acted
otherwise; and to have deliberated and
judged, whether it were not better for
them to forbear such evil Acts, than to do
them.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:53522:197"/>Â§. 10. Neither can invincible ignorance be
any excuse as to them; for though perhaps
they may not have Brains fit for the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
or are not able to deduce all the
Laws of Nature from their true Principles;
yet by the Precepts of others, as well as their
own Reason, and the observation of their own
Natures, as well as other mens, they might
easily have learnt all the Duties of an honest
man; that is, their Duty towards their
Neighbour, by that Golden Rule, of doing
as they would be done by: And their Duty
towards themselves, by endeavouring their
own true happiness and preservation, by the
only means tending thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> Without
injuring others; and doing their Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, in reverencing him, and obeying
his Will, when discovered to them; also in
endeavouring, to the utmost of their power,
the Common Good of Mankind; and all
which Principles have been ever so natural to
men, that they have in all Ages acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
them to have still remained the same.
Therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as also the Author of the
Treatise last mentioned, are very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
so directly to oppose our knowledge
of the Laws of Nature, to the Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man; as if he were so much beholden
to Art for them, that he could never have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
them himself, without teaching;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53522:197"/>
which were all one as to say, That because
most men learn Arithmetick., therefore
it is so absolutely besides, or above Nature,
that no man ever attained it of himself, which
is contrary both to Reason and Experience,
since both Arithmetick and Geometry, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Ethicks, must have been natural to those
that first taught them.</p>
               <p>But I have already sufficiently proved by
Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s own Concession, That Reason and
Experience are as natural to Humane Nature,
as Hunting is to Dog's, tho in both of them
there is required both Exercise and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to learn it.</p>
               <p n="11">Â§. 11. Nor doth Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Excuse, which
he gives us in the 13th Chapter of his <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
signify any thing; (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>That mens
Passions in the state of Nature are no Sins, nor
the Actions which proceed from them, as long as
they see no Power which can prohibit them; For
neither can a Law be known before it be made,
neither can it be made, till they have agreed
upon a Legislator.</hi> To which may be easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> all along proceeds upon
this False Supposition, That God is not a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator
without Divine Revelation; nor that
the Laws of Nature are properly his Laws;
both which Assertions, if they have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
false in the preceding Discourse, it will
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53522:198"/>
certainly follow, that the Laws of Nature
or Reason proceeding from God himself<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
are truly Laws; and the Actions prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by them are Sins, although men will
not through wilful Ignorance discover this
Legislator, nor will consent to his Laws.
And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself acknowledges in his
Chapter of Laws, that the Subjects lie under
an obligation to obey them, if it can be made
appear to them that the Legislator is endued
with a Supream Power over them, and hath
both sufficiently established, and promulgated
his Laws; both which may be truly affirmed
of the Laws of Nature.</p>
               <p n="12">Â§. 12. But indeed Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and his Followers
have done very cunningly in taking away all
freedom from Mankind, and to suppose an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity of all moral Actions; since
they could not otherwise destroy the Laws of
Nature, and equal Men with Brutes, but by
pulling up all the Foundations of moral Good
and Evil.</p>
               <p>But I need say no more on this Subject to
shew the folly and unreasonableness of this
Opinion, than to put down Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s words on
this Subject in Art. 11. of this Chapter,
<hi>Where he confesses that this Right of all men to
all things, is absolutely unprofitable for Mankind,
because the effect of this Right is all one, as if
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53522:198"/>
there were no such Right at all. For although any
man might say of every thing, This is mine;
yet could he not use it, because of his Neighbour,
who might by an equal Right pretend that it was
his.</hi> Which is as good as to own, that this
right is none at all: For he himself in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
before-going, makes Utility to be the
measure of all Right; but here is a Right
without any Utility at all; therefore these
words <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Vnprofitable,</hi> are contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for <hi>Right</hi> refers in this definition to some
use or profit that a man may make of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Liberty; but to be <hi>unprofitable,</hi> owns
that there is no use or need of this natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in that matter.</p>

hath told us in the Account he gives of his

between those Animals which cannot be joined by
any Compact or Bargain, that they should not hurt
each other; there is no Right, or Injury: So it
is likewise amongst Nations, which either will not,
or cannot enter into Compact; that they do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hurt, nor are hurt; For Injustice is nothing
in it self; although in some places such a Bargain
is made by mutual Compacts that they should not
hurt each other. So that Injury is no evil in it

(they are) the natural Laws of God, a perfect
Right is given to every man to his Life, and
all those necessary means thereunto, without
which he cannot subsist. For whatever a man
enjoys by the right of Nature, it must needs
be injury and injustice to take it away: for
every invasion or violation of another's Right
or Property, is Injury, by whatever Law he
enjoys it: And much more if that Right be
conferred upon him by the Law of Nature,
given by God as a Legislator, than if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from meer Humane Compacts. And
though Mr. <hi>H.</hi> here asserts, That no injury
can be done to any man, with whom we have
made no Compact; yet Chap. 2. Art. 1. of
his <hi>De Cive,</hi> he says, <hi>That since all men will
grant that to be done by Right, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to right Reason; we ought to believe that
to be done by Injury, which is repugnant to right
Reason; that is, which contradicts any Truth
collected by right Reason from true Principles:
But what is done by Injury, we acknowledge to be
done contrary to some Law.</hi> So that here he
grants, that an Injury may be done contrary to
the Laws of Nature, before any Compact,
or translation of our Right to another; and
since he there acknowledges those Dictates of
Reason to be Laws, I would fain see how
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53522:200"/>
those can give any man such a right to invade,
or violate the Rights of another: For Right
(as he himself well defines it) being a Liberty
granted by right Reason, requires that men,
who pretend to act or speak according to its
Dictates, cannot act contradictorily to its
other Principles, or Conclusions. And 'twere
to no purpose for him to say, that the Injury
is done to God alone, when his Laws are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
unless he can shew that those Laws of
God do not confer a right on men to their
Lives, and all the necessaries thereof; and do
not likewise prohibit others from violating
this Right so granted.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. But yet this Author, when he is prest
hard, does acknowledge, that there may be
injury done to another out of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For it being objected, whether if a
Son should kill his Father in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he should not do him an injury; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
<hi>That a Son cannot be understood to be in
a natural State in respect of his Parents, he being
as soon as ever he is born<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> under their power and
command, to whom he owes his being and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet sure a man's Parents, by begetting and
breeding him up, do not thereby acquire a
property or dominion over him as long as he
lives; though I grant Children, when they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53522:200"/>
either marry, or otherwise, become lawfully
discharged from the government of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
still owe a filial piety and gratitude to
them; and that it is a great impiety and injury
in Children towards them, to hurt or destroy
them, though they are no longer under their
power and command. So likewise the same
Law of Nature, which prescribes gratitude
to these our natural Benefactors, doth
make it injurious for any man to hurt or kill
any other Person, who had educated, or
maintained him, or otherwise highly obliged
him; since the same Laws of Gratitude that
make it injurious to hurt, or murther his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the state of Nature, do also command
the like duty towards any other Benefactor.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. But his Argument in his <hi>Leviathan</hi> is
much more false and precarious; when he
argues, <hi>That where there is no common Power,
there is no Law; and where there is no Law, there
is no Injustice.</hi> All which he brings to prove
the necessity of his natural state of War. For,
first, though I grant, where there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Power, (that is, no Legislator) there is
no Law, yet that is not true of the Laws of
Nature; since if they proceed from God as a
Legislator (as I hope we have proved in the
precedent Discourse) they are truly Laws,
before any Civil Power was instituted to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53522:201"/>
make Laws, or to see them observed; and
consequently that it is the highest injury and
injustice to take away any thing from others
being innocent, and doing us no hurt, that
is necessary for their Life, or preservation,
which they are already possest of; and though
it is true, that Justice and Injustice are no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Faculties of the Mind, yet right Reason
is; from whence all Justice is deduced, and
which a man is always bound to exercise as
soon as he becomes capable of being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Humane Society: (I do not mean a
Civil one) and if there be a natural Equity
(as this Author acknowledges, <hi>De Cive,</hi>
cap. 14. Â§. 14.) there is likewise a natural
Justice, and Injustice too: but I shall say more
of this in the next Principle.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>That in the state of Nature there is nothing Good,
or Evil.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§. 1. I Shall here give you Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Opinion,
and his Reasons for it, in his own
words, as they are in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> cap. 6.
<hi>Whatsoever is the object of any man's Appetite, or
Desire, that is it which he for his part calls Good;
and the object of his Hate, and Aversion, Evil:
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53522:201"/>
and of his Contempt, Vile and Inconsiderable.
For these words of Good, Evil, and Contemptible,
are ever used with relation to the Person that
useth them, there being nothing simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
so; Nor any common Rule of Good and
Evil to be taken from the nature of the Objects
themselves, but from the person of the Man
(where there is no Commonwealth) or, (in a
Commonwealth) from the Person that represents
it; or from an Arbitrator, or Iudge, whom
men by disagreeing shall by consent set up, and
make his Sentence the Rule thereof.</hi> He speaks
to the same effect in all his other Works; as
in <hi>De Cive,</hi> cap. 4. Â§. 17. in his <hi>De Homine,</hi>
cap. 11. which it were tedious here to repeat;
and therefore I refer you to the places I have
here cited.</p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. But this he endeavours Physically to
explain in his little Treatise of <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
cap. 7. Â§ 1. compared with Chap. 3.
where he supposes, <hi>That the motion, in which
consists the conception of things without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the Iudgment, passes from the Brain
to the Heart; and as it there hinders, or helps
its vital motion,</hi> it is said to please or displease;
<hi>But that which so pleases any one, he calls
Good: And that which displeases him, Evil:
and hence from the diversity of Constitutions, or
Temperaments, there are divers Opinions of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53522:202"/>
Good that is naturally and necessarily so. And
in the state of Nature unblameably, from his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that judges it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. There is nothing that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
more loosely, and unlike a Philosopher,
than these unstable Opinions both of natural
and moral Good and Evil. And therefore it is
a matter of great moment to have a fixed and
constant notion of Good; because as long as
this is fluctuating and uncertain, all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our true Felicity (which is the
greatest Good of every man) as also of the
Laws of Nature, and of all particular Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
(which are nothing but the means and
causes of obtaining this Good) will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
various, wandring and uncertain.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. Therefore, although it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that because of some peculiarity in the
divers Temperaments of men, it sometimes
happens that one sort of Diet, or Medicines,
may be hurtful to one, which may not prove
so to another; yea, which Experience hath
approved, not only to be innocent, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for others: Something like which may
be observed in the Genius and Manners of
Nations quite different from others, in some
particular Customs and Constitutions; yet
this doth not any more take away the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53522:202"/>
Consent of Mankind concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Good,
and its constituent parts and
degrees, than the small difference of mens
Faces takes away the agreement between
them in their common Natures as Men, or
that general likeness that is between them,
in the conformation and use of their principal
Parts. For sure there is no Nation so barbauros
which will not own, that there are greater
hopes and satisfaction in loving, and obeying
God, than in blaspheming and disobeying of
him. There is scarce any Nation that is not
sensible, that filial duty towards Parents,
gratitude to their Benefactors, love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to their Friends and Neighbours, fidelity
in their Promises and Agreements, are good
and necessary for their own welfare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and consequently of Mankind. No
difference of Temper makes any man in his
Senses not perceive it to be good for all men,
that the Lives, Liberties Estates and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of all innocent Persons, should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
And therefore that the killing, or
robbing of them should be every-where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
under the most severe Penalties. Or
lastly, What peculiar humour in men can
make them not think it good and beneficial
for particular Families and Nations, that the
Conjugal Fidelity of the Marriage-bed, the
Chastity should be preserved inviolated. The
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53522:203"/>
same may be said concerning the right of using
and enjoying all those outward things, that are
necessary for life, or conduce to our health,
fame, honour, the education of our Children,
and the preservation of Friendship, since in
their Judgment concerning the goodness of
these things about which the whole business
of the Laws of Nature, and of most Civil
Laws is taken up, all rational men do as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree in their Opinions as concerning
the whiteness of Snow, or the brightness of
the Sun; Though I do not lay the main stress
of their obligation to these Actions on this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Agreement, since I have laid down
contrary Principles in the foregoing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. But I shall now proceed to give you
a more true and setled Notion of Good and
Evil, both natural and moral: I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
Good in general to be, that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
encreases, or perfects the Faculties and
Powers of one or more things; for by these
effects that peculiar agreeableness of one
thing with another declares it self to us, and
which is requisite to make any thing to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called good for the nature of this Being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others. Which effects likewise discover to
us the hidden powers, and intrinsick natures of
things. These strike upon our Senses, and beget
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53522:203"/>
a knowledge in us of those things from whence
they flow; which Goods I grant may be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
according to the divers natures of those
Beings which they respect. Thus a suitable
Soyl, Air, and Moisture are naturally good
for Plants, because they are agreeable to their
nature, and are necessary for their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
growth and perfection: So likewise
convenient Food, Health and Liberty, are
naturally good for an Animal; since they
serve for their preservation and happiness as
long as they continue to live. So likewise,
That is also good for man, which preserves
and encreases the powers of his Mind and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
without doing hurt to, or prejudicing
any others of his own kind; nor doth the
mind of Man make these Rules concerning
the nature of one, or a few Creatures of a
sort, but is able from the knowledge it hath
of singulars, to make certain general Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
or Conclusions, concerning what is
good, or evil, for the whole Species, or Kind,
whose nature he hath enquired into; because,
since there is the same general nature in every
one of the Individuals of this or that Kind,
the true happiness of one or more of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once known, it is easie likewise to know
what share and kind of happiness is to be
desired by all of them: For it is apparent,
That the improvement of the Understanding
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53522:204"/>
in knowledge, and the government of the
Will by sedate and regular Affections; as also
the health and vigour of the Body, in which
the true happiness of any particular man does
chiefly consist, do also comprehend (if uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
considered) the common happiness of
all men, that ever have been, or shall be born,
which also may be affirmed concerning the
means to these natural Goods, and which are
required as necessary to all Mankind; such as
Food, Exercise, Sleep, and the like; And
this, because of the identity between the
parts and the whole; that is, between the
nature of any one, or more men, with that
whole Systeme of Rational Agents, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under the general Name and Idea of
Mankind. From whence it also follows, that
whatsoever doth good to one member, or
part of this aggregate Body, all the rest being
unhurt, or unprejudiced, thereby may be
truly said to do good to the whole aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Body of Mankind; which Consideration
may excite us to a due care of our selves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it be not prejudicial to others from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the common Good of Mankind.
Analogically unto this we may also judge,
that to promote the efficacy of God's Natural
Right to rule our selves, and all other rational
Creatures, is to perform a thing good, or
grateful to God, as Supream Governour of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53522:204"/>
the World; and this we do by a due care to
promote obedience to his own Laws, either
in our selves, or others.</p>
               <p>And therefore, though we so far agree
with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that that may be called good
which is agreeable to any other Being, and
so must be meant relatively; yet doth not
this always refer to the Appetite of him that
desires it, nor yet to the irrational Opinions of
any one or more men, if they judge contrary
to the Rules and Principles of Nature or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And therefore, though a Wench that
hath the Green-Sickness, by reason of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Appetite, may fancy Tobacco-pipes,
or Charcoal to have an excellent relish, and
so to be good for her; yet will not her
thinking so, make them become a wholsome
nourishment. The like may be said of any
Actions, or Vices, which a Vicious or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
man may take pleasure in; such as
Drunkenness, Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they may please him at the present,
yet will certainly in time destroy him in this
life, or in that to come. And therefore it is
not true, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> here lays down,
That all Good and Evil is only to be taken in
respect of him whom at that time it pleases or
displeases: Whereas every rational Man
ought first rightly to judge what things are
good, and then to desire them, because they
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53522:205"/>
are really so; that is, because their natural
powers or effects are really helpful, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our Nature: And to consider a private
Good, as that which profits one person; and
a common Good, as it profits many. And
that not because it is at that instant desired,
and approved of out of a depraved Appetite,
or wanton humour: it being only the part
of Brutes, Mad-men and Fools, to measure
the goodness of Things, or Actions, by their
present Lusts, without any government of
Reason, or thoughts of the future.</p>
               <p n="6">Â§. 6. But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself doth sometimes
talk more soberly; and though he doth here,
as also elsewhere, inculcate, That every thing
is either good, or evil, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Person that so judges it (in the
state of Nature) or else (in a Civil State) of
the Person that represents the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
yet in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Chap. 30.
when he reckons up the Offices of the Civil
Soveraign, he makes one of the chiefest to be
the making of good Laws. Now he there
tells us, <hi>A good Law is that which is needful
for the good of the People, and withal perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>;
and a little farther he thus goes on; <hi>And
therefore a Law that is not needful, having not
the true end of a Law, is not good. A Law may
be conceived to be good, when it is for the benefit of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53522:205"/>
the Sovereign, though it be not necessary for the
People; but it is not so:</hi> where you see, <hi>the
good of the People</hi> (which is certainly that
which is common to many) is here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by him, and proposed as the main end
of the Legislator's Duty: But this end being
thus proposed, the true nature of it is first to
be known, and determined, before the Law
can prescribe what is good or evil for the
People. So likewise Chap. 14. Â§. 4. of his
<hi>De Cive,</hi> speaking concerning the Rules of
right Judgment in a Civil State, he tells us;
<hi>That since it is impossible to prescribe any Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Rules whereby all Controversies (which will be
infinite, may be judged) it is still understood in
every case pretermitted by the written Laws, that
the Law of natural Equity is to be followed.</hi>
Where you see he grants that the Laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Equity may be known, and followed;
And that divers more Cases may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
from thence, than can be by the Civil
Laws themselves: but we do only so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with him, that some Rules of Equity
may be so evidently and naturally known,
that all honest and sincere men cannot at all
differ about them; though in the mean time
we freely grant, That there are divers things
so indifferent, that no human Reason can
universally determine, that it is more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for the common Good, that a thing be
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53522:206"/>
done, or a Case judged this way, rather
than the other.</p>
               <p n="7">Â§. 7. Having stated what we mean by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Good, and Evil; I shall now give a
right notion of a moral Good, and how it
differs from the former. A moral Good is
those voluntary Actions and Habits which are
conformable to the Law of Nature, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
considered as given by God, as a Law-giver,
for a Rule of all our Humane, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Actions: For there are many natural
Goods that conduce to a man's happiness,
which are not morally good, nor are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by any Law. Such as are quickness
of Wit, Learning, Strength of Mind and
Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the other side, I suppose,
that no Action of the Will can be commanded
by God, (and so morally good) which doth
not by is own nature, as well as from the Will
of God (the <hi>Legislator</hi>) conduce to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Mankind: The not taking notice of
which distinction, between natural and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Goods, hath been the occasion of another
great Error in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> when he makes that
which seems good <hi>to every man's own self, to be
the only object of his desires,</hi> as he doth in his
<hi>De Cive,</hi> Cap. 1. Art. 2. which he likewise
more fully expresses in Cap. 3. Artic. 21.
<hi>Every one is presumed to seek that which is good
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53522:206"/>
for himself; but that which is just only by accident,
and for peace sake</hi>; viz. That which is just, he
will only have to regard another's good;
which he supposes no man will seek, unless it
were for fear of those Evils which proceed
from a state of War: But all he says only
tends to prove, that men are so framed, that
it is repugnant to their Nature, and so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impossible for them to mind, or desire
any thing, unless for their own particular
worldly profit, and glory, as he hath laid
down in those Principles we have already
considered.</p>
               <p n="8">Â§. 8. But I cannot but take notice, that
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself in his Treatise <hi>De Homine,</hi>
(published after his <hi>De Cive</hi>) Cap. 12. Â§. 1.
seems not at all to approve of this ill humour
in men, by these words. <hi>We confess that it
may so fall out through the ill use of his free will,
that a man of a narrow Soul may consider nothing
but himself, and so may desire nothing but what
he judges for his own private advantage.</hi> And
in the same Treatise, Cap. 11. Â§. 14. where
he doth purposely consider which is the
greater, or lesser amongst Goods; he plainly
confesses, That it is a greater good which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
more persons, than that which doth
good to fewer.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:53522:207"/>Â§. 9. But giving him leave to contradict
himself as much as he will, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that he hath said to the contrary, I
doubt not but all rational and good men are
of a more generous Spirit; who do not only
esteem that to be good, which is good for
themselves alone, but also whatsoever tends
to the conservation, happiness and perfection
of Mankind. And whatsover they thus
esteem to be good, that they will also desire,
wish for, and contribute their utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to procure for others, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Nor do I see any reason to hinder, but
that whatsoever I find agreeable to any mans
Nature, I may do my endeavour, as far as
lies in my power, that he may obtain it; But
this much I must freely confess, That if men
do not propose to themselves one common
End, or Effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the common good of
Rational Agents, whose Causes (whether ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
or perfective) should be before-hand
agreed on to be Good; and those that hinder
its production, Evil; the words Good and
Evil will always be equivocal, various, and
uncertain; being still to be taken in as many
different Senses, as there are particular Men.
So that whatsoever Action, or thing, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
good by any one man, because it serves
his turn; that other men, if it crosses their
desires, will be sure to call evil, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53522:207"/>
to Reason, and to the Communication
of knowledge among men, which is the main
end of Speech; Whereas, if the words Good
and Evil are applied to those things which
concern the nature of Rational Beings in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
they will have a certain and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sense and signification, which will not
only be constantly true, and intelligible, but
prove most useful and profitable to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and that we are not only capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
but also of contributing our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for the procuring of this Common
Good, and are also under a sufficient obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereunto, is, I hope, fully made out in
the Fourth Chapter of the precedent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
where we expresly treat of the <hi>Law
of Nature, and its obligation.</hi>

               </q>
               <p n="1">Â§. 1. ALL the Principles that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath
hitherto laid down, have been only
in order to the establishing this Darling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the natural state of War. But since
we have already in our Answer to his former
Principles, shewn their falshood and absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
If those Foundations be ill laid, the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53522:208"/>
Superstructure must needs be infirm, and
therefore I shall omit all that he hath in his
<hi>De Cive</hi> inferred from those false Principles;
and shall only apply my self to what he hath
in his 13th Chapter of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> given
us a-new for the proof of this Principle, and
which doth not depend upon the former; For
here he derives this natural State of War
from Three Principal Causes in the nature of
Man. First, <hi>Competition.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Diffidence.</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>Glory. The first makes man invade
for Gain. The second for Safety, and the third
for Reputation. The first use Violence to make
themselves Masters of other Mens persons,
Wives, Children and Cattel. The second to
defend them. The third for Trifles; as a word,
a smile, a different Opinion, and any other sign
of undervaluing, either directly in their persons,
or by reflection on their Kindred, their Friends,
their Nation, their Profession, or their Name.
Hereby it is manifest, That during the time men
live without a Common Power to keep them all in
awe, they are in that condition which is called
War, as is of every man against every man. For
War consists not in Battel only, or the Act of
Fighting; but in a tract of time wherein the will
to contend by Battel is sufficiently known. And
therefore the notion of time is to be considered in
the nature of War, as it is in the nature of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For as the nature of Foul-weather lies
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53522:208"/>
not in a shower or two of Rain, but in an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereto of many days together. So the nature
of War consists not in actual fighting, but in the
known disposition thereto during all the time
there is no assurance to the contrary. All other
is Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. In answer to which, I must first take
notice, That Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan</hi> deduces
this Right of War of all men against all, from
other Principles than he doth in his <hi>De Cive,</hi>
Chap. 1. Â§. 12. where from the supposed
right of all men to all things, he deduces a
war of all men against all, and which renders
it both lawful and necessary: But in his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi>
in the Chapter here cited, he first
asserts the state of Nature to be a state of War,
and from thence argues all things therein to be
lawful; as you may see in the Conclusion of
that Chapter, where he tells us, <hi>That by the same
right that one man invades, the other resists;
from whence arises a War on both sides just.</hi> So
that being not at all sollicitous about the Right
of making War, he only supposes this War
must needs arise from the nature of mens Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Desires; and this War being once
supposed, he positively asserts, That it must
follow (though without any proof) that
there is in this State nothing just, or unjust:
Indeed his way of arguing in his <hi>Leviathan</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:53522:209"/>
is more plausible, but less close than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
in his <hi>De Cive</hi>; For all Persons of sense
must agree, that a War ought first to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
just, before it can be thence deduced what
things are lawful therein, even towards Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
Neither doth himself suppose that all
things are lawful, even in the justest War;
for in his <hi>De Cive, Annot. ad Art.</hi> 37. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.
he grants that <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> are
not to be practised even in War; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is necessary that some natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
or Laws, be first acknowledged, by
whose command or permission we may be
able to judge of any War, whether it be just,
or not, or before we can thence infer those
things to be lawful which are acted therein;
for otherwise even contradictory Propositions
may be alike true; and <hi>Titius,</hi> for example,
might have a right to the Life and Goods of
<hi>Sempronius,</hi> if he thought them necessary for
his own Preservation; and so likewise <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi>
would have the same Right against
<hi>Titius:</hi> which would be contrary to all the
Rules of right Reason, and Equity; and this
is so evident, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself, although
in the latter part of this first Chapter, <hi>De
Cive,</hi> he affirms, That in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there is no difference between just and
unjust; yet in the former part he endeavours
to prove, that this power of making War
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53522:209"/>
ought to be allowed to every man in that state
as necessary to his own preservation; which
is all one, as if he had affirmed this War to
be just and lawful on both sides; which is
contrary to Reason. But whatsoever proves
any thing to be just, and lawful in any State,
must likewise suppose, that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between lawful and unlawful in the
same State, and must suppose some Law in
force, by whose command or permission at
least, that Act becomes lawful: which, as
we endeavour to establish, so doth Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as
plainly destroy it, whilst he asserts no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between just and unjust: but with
what reason I shall leave it to the indifferent
Reader to judge.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. But since I have already answered
those Preliminary Principles which he hath
laid down in his <hi>De Cive,</hi> to prove the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of this state of War, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else for us to do, but to examine those
new Reasons Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath here given us in
this Chapter of his <hi>Leviathan</hi> to prove this
state of War to be both natural, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which he here deduces from three Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in the nature of man. 1. Competition
for the same thing. 2. Diffidence of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
3. Glory to himself. The first is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest;
That during the time men live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53522:210"/>
out a Common Power to keep them in awe,
they are in that Condition which is called
War.</p>
               <p>Whence I cannot but again observe, That
this Author takes the natural state of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
only from their Passions, without any
consideration of Reason, or Experience; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hath already supposed both of
these to be natural Faculties of the Mind:
and the true nature of a thing is to be taken
not from its imperfections, or weaknesses, but
from the utmost perfection that it is by its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
capable of; and therefore this Author
hath dealt very preposterously to treat of the
natural State of Man, as of a meer Animal,
only governed by the force of his Passions;
whereas, the principal part of Man, and
which ought to have the government over all
the other Faculties, is Reason; or that Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the rational Soul, whose due use and
exercise ought not to be excluded, but rather
conjoined with the operations of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
natural Faculties, by any Writer who
will truly describe the Nature of Man; nor
yet are men necessarily impelled by these Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
as meer Machines are driven or
moved by the Wind, or Weights; but that
they may be governed, and restrained by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or fear of future evil: so that they do
not hurry men into War by any natural, or
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53522:210"/>
inevitable necessity. Indeed those Ideas of the
Mind, which are necessarily generated therein
from the impulse of outward Objects, are not
prohibited by the Law of Nature, because we
are design'd by God to govern those Actions
only which are in our powers: Whereas these
Passions and Ideas, from whence Mr. <hi>H.</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
this state of War to be necessary, are of
this sort, since being concerning things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and at a distance, and depending upon
mens reason, and foresight, they may be also
governed thereby; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
in his <hi>De Cive,</hi> Chap. 3. Â§. 31.
That though men, because of their different
Appetites, cannot agree of the present, yet
they may of the future, and from thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
that Peace is to be sought as the
foundation of all natural Law.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. And therefore I think I shall be able
easily to shew, that every one of these three
Master-Passions, which he hath here described
as the Causes of War, ought (if governed
by Reason) to persuade the contrary. And
in the first place, for his Passion of Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That when two men desire the same thing, which they cannot both enjoy, they
become Enemies; and in the way to their end,
endeavour to destroy, or subdue one another.
Now certainly Reason in this Case will never
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53522:211"/>
incite a rational man to enter into a state of
War with another, for the obtaining of that
which he hath a mind to as well as he. For if
it be a thing the other is already possessed of,
he ought by the Rules of Reason, and Equity,
to let him enjoy it by right of Occupancy or
Possession; it being then necessary for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
or happiness; and he himself, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the like thing, would think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
that he should be likewise permitted
quietly to enjoy it: So that if he act by one
Rule in relation to himself, and by another in
respect of all other men, in the same Case, or
Circumstances, this must be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable:
And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself doth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
shew the grievous mischeifs of such an
unreasonable way of proceeding, when he
tells us, <hi>That from hence it comes to pass; That
where an Invader hath no more to fear than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man's single Power, If one plant, sow, build
or possess a convenient Seat, others may probably
be expected to come prepared with Forces united to
dispossess and deprive him, not only of the Fruit
of his Labour, but also of his Life, or Liberty;
and the Invader again is in the like danger of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
To which I may also add, and he again
of a third; till at last all the Owners of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
successively destroyed, the House or
Seat will become void, and no man left to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
it; which Condition Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53522:211"/>
confesses to be so sad, and deplorable, that he
will have Mankind from the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to do all they can to get out of it, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into a Civil Society. But I suppose
that right Reason will rather hinder all ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
men from ever falling into this State at
all, if they can by any means avoid, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it; since Peace is to be valued from its
own Conveniences without trying, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with the Evils of War, as Health is
valuable for its own agreeableness to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
without trying by woful experience<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
what sickness is.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. And as for his next Passion, <hi>Diffidence</hi>
of each other; <hi>That there is no way for any
man to secure himself, so reasonable as Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that is, by force, or wiles, to master the
persons of all men he can, so long, till he see no
other Power great enough to endanger him. And
that this is no more than his own conservation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and is generally allowed.</hi> Now can all
this reasonably persuade a man to put himself
in so hazardous a condition, as by force, or
fraud, as to go about to master and subdue all
those he will be afraid of; or to think he is
able to do this by his own single strength till he
sees no other Power great enough to endanger
him? Since for any man to be able to do this,
he must have more cunning, natural Strength
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53522:212"/>
and Courage and Cunning, than ever <hi>Homer</hi>
supposed <hi>Vlisses,</hi> or <hi>Achilles,</hi> to have been masters
of; or our Modern Romance-makers can feign
in their Heroes; Since upon these Terms of
Self-preservation, a man (like a Game-Cock)
would be forced to fight a Battel, or two, every
day whilst he lived, and how long this would
last, supposing other men of equal strength,
and as well prepared as himself, I refer him
to the experiment of fighting-Cocks, who
seldom survive the twelfth or thirteenth Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;
and though it is true, that there are some
that taking pleasure in contemplating their
own Power in Acts of Conquests, which
they may pursue farther than their own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
requires; yet this was never known to
be performed by any man's single strength,
but by a Combination with divers others,
who through the esteem they had of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
or Courage, chose such a man to be
their Leader, or Prince, before another:
And this Account, both the Ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
and Poets, give us of the Original of
the first Monarchs, and Ancient Kings, in the
Heroical Times; and admitting the first
Kingdoms to have begun by Fathers, or Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
of Families, as some Divines suppose, yet
they could never have raised a sufficient Force
to have conquered others, without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of the Heads or Fathers of other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53522:212"/>
Nor could <hi>Nimrod</hi> himself, (who is
supposed the first Tyrant, or Conqueror,)
ever have enlarged the Bounds of his Empire
by his own single strength, or that of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Family, without such a Combination
which requires Compacts between the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that make it; and when they once do
this, they are then no longer in the meer state
of Nature, having set up and acknowledged
a common Power over them to keep them in
awe: from whence it appears, that it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
nay absolutely impossible, for any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
man to take pleasure in contemplating
his own Power in Acts of Conquest by his
own personal Valour, or Cunning, as
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> supposes a man may do in the state of
Nature.</p>
               <p n="6">Â§. 6. And as for his appeal to Experience,
<hi>That when a man taking a Iourney, arms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
when going to Bed, he locks his Doors;
when even in his House, he locks his Chests:
And asks what opinion he hath of his Fellow-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
when he rides armed, and shuts his Doors;
or of his Children and Servants, when he locks
his Chests; And whether he doth not thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
Mankind as much by his Actions, as he
doth by his Words?</hi> To all which I answer,
No, he doth not. For though I grant it is
no fault to distrust, and secure himself as well
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53522:213"/>
as he can against violent and unjust Persons,
either upon the Road, or in his own House;
yet doth not this Diffidence accuse all his
Fellow-subjects, or all his Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
much less all Mankind, of a design to
murther, or rob him; or give him any Right
to make War upon them by way of anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for when he goes armed, or locks his
Doors, or Chests, 'tis true, he grants there
are some violent and wicked Persons, whom
he would secure himself against: yet doth not
this accuse all Mankind of this wicked Design,
since a man will do all this, if he be satisfied
that there are but two or three Thieves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his own House and <hi>London</hi>; or but one
thievish Person in his Family, which is but a
small proportion to a whole Countrey, or
Kingdom, or even to his own particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
much less doth he thereby pass a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon all Mankind: though it is true, he
thereby acknowledges, that there is, and ever
will be, amongst men, divers who are
more governed by their present Appetites and
Passions, than by Reason, or the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Much less doth such a diffidence give
a man a right in the state of Nature of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon, mastering, and killing all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whatsoever, that he fancies have power
sufficient to endanger him in his Life, or
Goods, before they have given some suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53522:213"/>
signs that they intend so to do; for
then it might be lawful (were it not for the
Laws) for a man, when he is thus armed,
to set upon, not only Thieves, but every
man he meets, for fear he should set upon
him first; nay, might likewise kill, or
knock in the Head, (if he were in the meer
state of Nature) any of his Children, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
or even his Wife her self, if he did
but fancy they went about to murther, or
rob him; which how wicked and unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
a thing it would be, I leave to any
man's Reason and Conscience to judge.
<hi>Nor does his comparing</hi> the state of War to
the nature of Foul-weather, at all help him,
which he saith, <hi>doth not lie in a shower or
two of Rain, but in an inclination thereto of
many days together: So the nature of War
consists not in actual fighting, but in the known
disposition thereto:</hi> all which I easily grant,
but he must likewise own that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
called a Rainy, or foul Season, till
it hath actually rained; till then we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
say it is foul weather, though it be
never so cloudy; so neither is this bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to hurt, an actual War, till there
hath been some signs or tokens of hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
expressed.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:53522:214"/>Â§. 7. Yet he grants there was never such a
condition of War as this that he describes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all over the World: But that there
are many places where men live so now, and
Instances in many savage People of <hi>America</hi>;
where, except the Government of small Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
(the concord whereof depends on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Lust) they have no Government at all,
and live at this day in that brutish manner he
hath before described: But were it so as he
affirms that brutish way of living, which is
in too many Particulars practised by these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
People, both in <hi>Affrica,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi>
where they have almost lost all knowledge of
a God, or of a Moral Good and Evil; Ought
the Practice of such Barbarous People to be of
sufficient Authority to prove, that they live
according to the true state of Human Nature,
or that they have a right to live and act thus in
all things they thus unreasonably practice?
But had this Author read any true or exact
relations of those Places in <hi>America</hi> he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he might have found that in
many of those Nations,<note place="margin">

                  </note> even,
where there is no Civil Power to
keep them in awe, and tho' they
have no other Government in time
of Peace, but that of the Fathers,
or Heads of Families: Yet doth not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
wholly depend upon Natural Lust: For
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53522:214"/>
besides the Government of Husbands over
their Wives, and those conjugal Duties and
Services which their Wives yield them in
these Places; Parents are more fond of their
Children, and Children again are more duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and kind to their Parents, and take more
care of them when they are sick or old, than
they commonly do with us: And though there
be no Common Power to keep them in awe,
yet having no Riches, but the meer necessary U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensils
of Living, nor any Honours, except Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
to contend for, and which are not obtained
without great hardships and sufferings; and
having also few Words of contempt, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
among them; whole Towns, nay Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
have lived together for many Ages in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Amity and Concord, without ever fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
together by the ears. And if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Murthers and Adulteries committed among
them, every particular person injured, or
else the Relations of the Party slain, are
their own Judges and Executioners; the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
fear of which, joyned with the Natural
Peaceable Temper of the People, causes fewer
of those Crimes to be committed among them,
than with us, where there are Laws and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Officers appointed to punish all such Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
And for the Truth of this, I refer you to
two Authors of undoubted Credit, <hi>(viz.) Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
in his History of his Navigation to <hi>Brazil,</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:53522:215"/>
Chap. 18. and the <hi>French</hi> Author of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
History of the <hi>CaribbÃ¨</hi> Islands, Part. 2d.
Chap. 11. and Â§. 19. besides other Authors
on this Subject, whom you may consult in
<hi>Purchas</hi>'s Pilgrimes, in his Volume of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
And though these People have often
Wars with their Neighbours, yet is it not
with all, but only some particular Nations,
with whom they have constant Wars, and
eat them when they can take them Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Yet do they at the same time maintain
Peace with all others. So remote is it from
Truth, that any Nation in the World can live
and subsist, by maintaining a constant War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all others. Nor did I ever hear of any
more than one People or Nation in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi>
near <hi>Carolina,</hi> called the <hi>Westoes,</hi> that
made this Fatal Experiment, by making war
upon all their Neighbours, one after another,
till they were in a short time reduced from
7000 Fighting Men, to 700, and were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
quite extirpated by those Nations they
had injured: Which Relation I receiv'd from a
Gentleman of Quality, who hath a considerable
Interest in those parts. So impossible a thing it
is, for Mankind to subsist, or be preserved a year
together in Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s imaginary State of War.</p>
               <p n="8">Â§.8. Nor is his other Instance from the Actions
of Kings, and Persons of a Soveraign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
any better, whom he makes like Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53522:215"/>
                  <hi>Having their Weapons pointing, and their
eyes fixed on each other; That is, their Forts,
Garrisons and Guns, upon the Frontieres of their
Kingdoms, and continual Spies upon their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
which is a posture of War.</hi> Where I may
first observe, that he doth not directly affirm,
That all Princes are in a State, but only in a
Posture of War, which I grant is both lawful
and necessary: Since no Prince or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
can be secure, that his Neighbours will
constantly observe the Laws of Nature, and
not invade his Territories, without any just
cause given. Yet I think no Prince, or other
Supreme Power (whom he makes the only
Judges of Good and Evil) will be so wicked
or unreasonable to affirm, that they have a
natural right to invade the Territories, Lives
and Estates of all Neighbouring Princes, and
their Subjects; much less, when they have
made Leagues or Compacts of Peace with
each other, that they are not obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, only for prevention that they
may not do the like to them, and break their
Compacts first: For that he himself confesses
to be absolutely contrary to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of Right Reason. But that upon Mr.
<hi>H</hi>'s Principles such Compacts being made in
the meer State of Nature, and without any
Common Power to see them observed, do not
at all oblige, I shall shew you more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by and by.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53522:216"/>Â§. 9. I come now to his last Passion, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
Glory, for which he would have all men to
be naturally in a State of War. <hi>But admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that divers men look that their Companions
should value them at the same rate as they do
themselves; and upon the least signs of Contempt,
or undervaluing, naturally endeavour as far as
they dare, to extort a greater value from their
Contemners, which amongst them that have no
Common Power to keep them quiet, may be enough
to make them destroy each other.</hi> Yet doth not
this hold true in every man; for even among
those that labour under this Passion of Vain-glory,
there are many in whom fear of others
is a much more predominate passion, and such
will rather take an affront, than venture to
beat or kill another to revenge it: Since the
hazard is certain, but the Victory (supposing
the person every way his equal) uncertain.
And if this Vain-glory may be so far mastered
by another stronger Passion; why may it not
also be overpowered by Reason? For a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
man will consider, that he cannot force
men to have a better esteem of his Words or
Actions by fighting every one that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their dislike of them, or else knows that
he is not at all the worse for the foolish cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of unreasonable men; or that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to take for an affront, whatsoever every
scurrilous impertinent Fellow shall intend so:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53522:216"/>
And he himself doth here likewise suppose, that
there are other as strong Passions that incline
men to Peace, as fear of Death, desire of such
things as are necessary; commodious living;
and a hope by their Industry to obtain them;
from whence I observe, that the greatest part
of these Passions which now incline men to
Peace, are but the same in other words, which
before inclined them to War: For what is
this Diffidence of another, and this Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he makes so reasonable, but a
fear of Death, or other mischief, from those
whom he thus goeth about to prevent? And
what is this desire of things necessary for life,
but a Branch of that Right which he supposes
all men have to all things? But granting that
the same Passions may in some men produce
different effects; yet if these Passions that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
men to peace are more strong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
than those that excite them to War, then
certainly Peace will be their more constant
and Natural State: Since as Mariners relate
the violent blowing of two contrary winds,
doth often in the Center of their Motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Calm. And therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
very rashly, to lay such a great stress on
those Passions, which provoke men to War,
without also considering, and putting into the
contrary Scale all those that incline men to
the contrary, which certainly are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53522:217"/>
in most men: For what can more
strongly influence mens Actions, than fear of
Death, and all those other miseries which he
himself so lively describes to be the necessary
Consequences of the State of War: And
whereas he tells us, that reason suggesteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Articles of peace; I think I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved, that Reason is so far from
needing Articles of peace, that it can never
prompt considering men to believe themselves
naturally in so dangerous and miserable a
State, as this which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> supposes; much
less to fall into it on purpose, without any
just cause given. But since this Author un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to give us many Reasons why mens
Passions will not permit them to live in peace
as well as divers other Creatures, whom he
confesses can do so without Laws; We will
a little examine those Reasons he brings, Why
mens Nature will not naturally permit them
to live in peace, as well as those brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and therefore I shall put them down
in his own Words, as you may find them in
his <hi>Lev.</hi> Chap. 17.</p>
               <p n="10">Â§. 10. <hi>It is true, that certain living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as Bees and Ants, live sociably one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi>
(<hi>which are therefore by</hi> Aristotle, <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongst Political Creatures</hi>) <hi>and yet have
no other Direction than their particular Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53522:217"/>
and Appetites, not Speech, whereby
one of them can signifie to another, what he thinks
expedient for the Common Benefit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some men may perhaps desire to know why
mankind cannot do the same? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>That men are continually in competition
for Honour and Dignity, which these Creatures
are not; and consequently amongst men, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
from that ground, Envy and Hatred, and
finally War; but amongst these not so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I reply, That these Civil Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
about which he supposes these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
do so often arise amongst men, have
no place in the State of Nature, being not
known amongst men, before the Institution
of Commonwealths; and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in this State, which he now treats of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for them more than Brutes. So that the
only true Glory and Honour which can be
found, out of a Civil Government, is as <hi>Cicero</hi>
very well defines it in his <hi>Tusc. Quest.</hi> the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
praise of good men, and the uncorrupted
Suffrages of those that rightly judge of excellent
Vertue.</hi> But all the Vertues being contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the study of the Common Good
of Rational Beings, from thence alone can
spring the praise of good men: And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of such Honour, is so far from causing a
War against all men, that as from a contrary
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53522:218"/>
Principle, men may by this be excited to the
exercise of all those Virtues, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
himself allows, <hi>Lev.</hi> Chap. 15. to be
the necessary means of Common Peace and
Safety.</p>
               <p n="11">Â§. 11. <hi>His Second Reason is, that amongst
these Creatures, the Common Good differeth not
from the Private; and being by nature inclined to their Private, they procure thereby the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Benefit. But Man, whose joy consisteth in
comparing himself with other men, can relish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what is eminent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we may reply, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> has
done us a Courtesie, in acknowledging before
he is aware; that even out of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is some common and publick
Good, which may be indeed procured even
by Brutes themselves: And he has elsewhere
also told us (as in his Treatise <hi>De Homine,</hi>
Chap. 10. the very last Words) <hi>But we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the knowledge of the Common Good, to be a
fit means to bring men both to Peace, and Vertue;
because it is both amiable in its own Nature, and
the surest defence of each man's private Good.</hi> And
sure its difference in some cases from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
good of some men, is no sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why men should rather fall out and fight
among themselves, than Bees or Ants, whose
Common Good is likewise distinguished from
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53522:218"/>
the private. But as for what he affirms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Nature of men, if it be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
understood of all men (as his words
seem to intend) 'tis false, and spoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all manner of proof, unless we must be
sent back to his general Demonstration of
these things in his Introduction to his <hi>Lev.</hi>
when he advises every man to this Rule, <hi>Nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
teipsum; and therefore would teach us from the
Similitude of the thoughts any passions of one man
to those of another, thereby to know what are the
thoughts of all other men, upon the like occasion.</hi>
Perhaps Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> knew himself very well,
and was sensible there was nothing more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to him, than comparing himself with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, and so could relish nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
either as his own Natural Endowments,
or acquired Improvements, but what was
more eminent, and greater than other mens;
and from thence gathered the same thoughts
to be in all others: But he ought to have
shewn something in the nature of man, from
whence it is necessary that all men should so
judge; for certainly all that are truly rational,
can know from the true use of things, and
from the necessity of their own Natures, how
to judge concerning their own things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are pleasant or not, and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
they do delight them, without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them with those of other men: So that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53522:219"/>
none but the foolish or envious can only
be pleased, as far as their own things exceed
those of others. But if he would have this
censure, only to concern such men, it will not
then afford a sufficient cause of an Universal
War of all men against all; And though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Strife and Contention may be begun
amongst such envious, foolish People, yet
the strength or reason of the more prudent
and peaceable may easily restrain it, that it
shall never hurt, or destroy all men, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them enter into a state of War against
all.</p>
               <p n="12">Â§. 12. His Third Reason is, <hi>That these
Creatures having not (as man) the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
do not see (or at least think they see) any
fault in the administration of their Common bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness:
Whereas amongst men, there are very
many that think themselves. Wiser, and Abler to
govern the Publick, better than the rest; and
those strive to Reform, and Innovate, one this
way, another that way, and thereby bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Distraction, and Civil War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we may thus Reply, That this
Reason offers nothing whereby men may live
less peaceably among themselves, if they
were in the state of Nature, and Subjects to
no Civil Government, than Brutes: But in
this state, mens Natural Propensions to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53522:219"/>
Benevolence, and to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
would have some place, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he hath here alledged to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
as I have sufficiently proved in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Discourse. Nor doth he here offer
any thing whereby men could less agree
among themselves to institute a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
for this is the thing whose causes
we are now seeking for. But he only objects
something, which will hinder them from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it, when it is instituted; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this will also shake all the foundations of
Peace, even in a Commonwealth, when it
is made never so firm according to his own
model. But we do well to consider, whether
mens Reason does not more powerfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Peace and Concord, by detecting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
errors of the Imaginations and Passions,
than it doth Discord, by its fallibility about
those things which are necessary, being
but few, and those plain enough. Besides,
men do not presently make War, as soon as
they suppose they spy out somewhat they
may blame in the Administration of publick
Affairs; for the same reason which discovers
the fault, does also tell them, that many things
are to be born with for Peace sake, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ggests
divers means whereby an emendation of
that fault, or miscarriage, may be peaceably
procured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:53522:220"/>So that I dare appeal to the Judgment of
the indifferent Reader, whether the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind is worse than that of Brutes,
because it is Rational; and whether Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
doth not judge very hardly of all men, by
making their Reason guilty of all these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, which in other places he imputes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Passions; and from this cause would
prove that men must live less peaceably with
each other than Brute Creatures. In short,
Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Answer is nothing to the purpose, for
our inquiry is concerning the obligation of
the precepts of Reason in the state of Nature;
and his Answer is, That most mens Reason
is so false, as that it would dissolve all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths already constituted.</p>
               <p n="13">Â§. 13. His fourth Reason is, <hi>That these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, tho they have some use of voice in making
known to one another their desires, and other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet they want that art of words by which
some men can represent to others, that which is
Good in the likeness of Evil, and Evil in the
likeness of Good; and augment or diminish the
apparent greatness of Good and Evil, discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting men, and troubling their peace at their
pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The force of which Answer is no more
than this; That because it sometimes falls
out, that the common People are moved to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53522:220"/>
Mutiny and Sedition by a specious, or sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Sermon, or Oration, that therefore
men, as having the use of Speech, cannot
maintain peace among themselves: which
consequence is certainly very loose; for he
ought to prove, that all men do necessarily
and constantly make such Speeches, tending
to Civil War, and Sedition; and also that
such Speeches, when heard, do constantly
prevail on their Auditors, or the most part of
them, that they should presently take up
Arms: For it may be, that even the Vulgar
may see through such false and specious
Speeches, and may not suffer themselves to
be deluded by them. It may also happen,
that they may rather give credit to the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Speeches of the more wise, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as founded upon more solid Reasons:
And it may be, that they will rather consider
the true weight of the Arguments, than the
empty sound of the Words; and certainly
mens rational Nature leads them to do this;
for they know they cannot be fed, or defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Words, but by Actions proceeding
from mutual Benevolence: What then doth
hinder, but that the Eloquence and Reason
of the Good and Peaceable may not often
prevail, with which both the Reason of the
Speaker, the true interest of the Auditors,
and the nature of things do all agree; But I
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53522:221"/>
shall speak no more of this Subject now, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the precedent Discourse sufficiently
proved, That men receive much greater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
from the use of Speech (though it may
sometimes be the cause of Civil Discords, and
Wars) than they do Evils and Mischiefs
thereby. And I suppose Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself
(were he alive) would confess that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
would not be rendered more peaceable,
or easie to be governed, had they been all
created dumb, or else had all their Tongues
been cut out by the irresistible power of his
great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the Civil Soveraign.</p>
               <p n="14">Â§. 14. His fifth Reason is, <hi>That irrational
Creatures cannot distinguish between Injury, and
Damage; and therefore as long as they be at
ease, they are not offended at their Fellows:
Whereas man is then most troublesome, when
he is most at ease; for then it is that he loves to
shew his wisdom, and controul the Actions of them
that govern the Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which Antithesis, he would infer, That
men live together less peaceably than Brutes,
because they distinguish between Injury and
Damage: But we think much otherwise;
and that most men would more willingly
suffer some damage, even done by other men,
so it be not done injuriously. And I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that all the distinction between these
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53522:221"/>
two, is founded in the knowledge of Right,
and Law, which indeed is only proper to
men. But that this Knowledge should make
them more prone to violate the publick
Peace, and to trample upon the Laws and
Rights of their Superiors, I can by no means
admit; much less, that Subjects that abound
in peace, and riches, are more apt to envy
their Superiors, and to shew their wisdom in
finding fault with their Rulers; or that the
Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> for example, who (God
be thanked enjoy both sufficient peace, and
plenty) are more apt to find fault with their
Governors, than those in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi>
where they are poor and miserable by Taxes,
and other Severities; or that they can even
there forbear repining at the cruel Treatment
of their Rulers, though perhaps their Spirits
may be so debased, and their Powers so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by this oppression, that they may not be
so able to shew it by publick discourse, much
less by resistance; and so free themselves from
this Tyranny, as perhaps they would do if
they had sufficient Riches and Courage. And
that I conceive is the true reason why this
Author is such an Enemy in all his Books to
the happiness and wealth of the People, whom
he would all along make Slaves instead of
Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:53522:222"/>But suppose that the lawful Rights of
Princes are sometimes violated by the unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled Lusts of some evil men, yet I do not
see how this knowledge of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those things which are done by right,
and those which are done by wrong, do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more apt to do Injuries to others.
But he tells us, <hi>That man is then most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, when he is at ease.</hi> But sure, it is not
without Injustice, that he imputes the Faults
of some men to all Mankind, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any proof; unless, perhaps, finding such
Passions in himself, he thence concluded that
they must likewise be natural to all others,
according to the method he makes use of in
his Introduction to this Book; which I have
before taken notice of, when he bids us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
this similitude of Passions, and so whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not agree with his own
Thoughts. But I must freely confess they
do not agree with mine; let me be but
happy, and want nothing, and though others
may be richer, or happier, I shall not envy
them, nor am I at all the worse for it: But
indeed Mr. <hi>H.</hi> does very preposterously to
alledge this fault of mens love to shew their
wisdom, and controul the Actions of them that
govern the Commonwealth, against all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
whilst he yet supposes men in the state
of Nature, which sure (according to his
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53522:222"/>
own Hypothesis) precedes all Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But we are now come to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s last Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and let us see if he can thereby prove any
better, That Mankind is less prone to Peace
than Brute Creatures.</p>
               <p n="15">Â§. 15. Lastly, <hi>The agreement of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is natural, that of Men is by Covenant only,
which is artificial; and therefore it is no wonder
if there be somewhat else required, besides Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to make their Agreement constant, and
lasting; which is a Common Power to keep them
in awe, and to direct their Actions to the common
benefit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I reply, That the true natural
Causes intrinsical to Men as they are Animals,
and which can bring them to consent to the
exercise of Peace, and mutual Benevolence
amongst themselves, are alike with those that
are found in other Animals, even the fiercest,
and cruellest, suppose Lions, or Bears, (if you
will) as I hope I have sufficiently proved in
the former part of this Treatise. Nor can
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> shew any thing which is wanting to
man, but yet is found in Brutes as a cause of
their peaceable agreement; for that which
he urges, That the Agreement of these
Creatures is natural, that of men is by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
only, and therefore artificial, may
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53522:223"/>
perhaps impose upon the Vulgar, but may
easily be confuted by any one that will but
consider to the next Consequence: For those
very Compacts or Covenants he mentions,
are made by the power, as well of mens Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, as Animal Natures: And certainly if
there had been no Covenants made among
men, and that they had not the use of Reason,
yet the common Nature of Animals of the
same kind, would have had as much force
with them, as with other Creatures, that
they should agree to maintain a mutual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, as well as Brutes of the same kind,
without destroying each other, whose agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by him acknowledged to be natural:
What then hinders, but after there is besides
added to Mankind Reason, and the use of
Speech, but that the same natural agreement
may still remain? Reason sure doth not take
away the natural endeavours, and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to Concord in Man, more than other
Animals; neither is this agreement less natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or constant, because it is expressed by
words: As our Appetite, and taking in of
Food, do not cease to be natural Actions in
us, although we may express this Appetite
by words, or signs; and may also appoint
the time, place, and what sort of Meat we
will eat. And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself (as well as
others) does sometimes acknowledge Reason
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53522:223"/>
to be a natural Faculty, as he does in his <hi>De
Cive,</hi> in the place already quoted: From
whence it follows; That this stricter Society
or Agreement which Reason dictates should
be established by Compacts, wholly proceeds
from the rational Nature of Mankind. But
it will farther appear, That this Agreement
proceeding from the use of Speech, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more fitly called natural, if we consider
our practical Reason to be altogether deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined from the nature of the best End we can
foresee or propose; and the best means we
can use thereunto. And farther, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more can be effected by the utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of our Reason, than that those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensions to concord, with others of our own
kind, (which are so natural to all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals) should be directed to their fit object
(<hi>viz.</hi>) all other rational Creatures, and that
all our particular actions should be thence
exerted according to their due place, time,
and other circumstances. So that the very
taking in of Meat, and Drink, is most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and proceeds from the natural constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an Animal. Yet this in all particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is best governed, and directed by a man's
Reason, taking care of his own <hi>Health</hi>
without any irregularities in his Diet;
whilst those precepts of thus regulating his
Diet, whose force and certainty he observes
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53522:224"/>
from the Nature of things, and his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Constitution, may very well deserve
in some cases, the name of an Art.</p>
               <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath done very ill in
making that agreement among men, which
is expressed by Compacts, to be so artificial,
as it must be quite opposed to what is natural.</p>
               <p>I shall not indeed deny, those words by
which Compacts are expressed, to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the Arbitrary agreements of
men: Yet that consent of their minds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the mutual offices of Benevolence,
of which words are only the signs, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Natural: For in that consent of minds
concerning the mutual commutation of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
consists the whole Nature of Compacts;
as all its obligation proceeds from thence:
But the knowledge and will of constituting
some signs, either by words or Actions,
whereby this sort of consent may be declared,
is so natural, and easy to men, without
any Teaching, that it may be observed in
persons born Deaf and Dumb, as I have
given some instances in the foregoing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.
In short, this consent express'd by
Compacts, concerning, these most general
acts of Benevolence, which may be considered
in any disquition concerning the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is either not to be called Artificial, or
if it be so termed, that Term is so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53522:224"/>
as it agrees with all mens natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
and not as it may be opposed to them;
that so it may become thereby less firm and
durable, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> supposes it; for the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of a natural Consent, constituted by
words, tho with some kind of Art, doth
not at all diminish its firmness or duration;
and therefore I think it doth sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is very much mistaken,
when he supposes that the agreement of
Brutes of the same kind is more constant and
natural than that among men; and that mens
natural propensions to a Benevolence towards
others, are not so strong in men, as in other
Animals: So that I shall leave it to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Reader, whether upon a due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Answers, and our Replies, he
will conclude, as this Author doth in his
Treatise <hi>de homine,</hi> chap. 10. <hi>That men do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Wolves, Bears, and Serpents, in Cruelty
and Rapacity, who are not rapacious beyond hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>;
which if he had affirmed of some men
who are degenerated from all sentiments of
humanity, had not been much amiss; but to
affirm it of all mankind in general, is too
severe and false a censure to be let pass:
Whereas it must be at the worst, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
That no general Propositions can be
made, concerning the particular Passions and
Humours of all men; since there is not only
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53522:225"/>
a greater difference of Wit, but also a greater
variety of Passions and Inclinations amongst
men, than brutes; and that not only among
whole Nations, but particular persons: For
all the kinds of brutes have almost the like
Inclinations, and are governed by the like
passions and appetites; so that if you know
one of them, you almost know them all;
but in mankind, so many men, so many
Minds, and so many almost several Humours
and Dispositions: And which is more, the
same man doth not only differ from others,
but also oftentimes from himself; and that
which at one time he mightily loves and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of, at another he abhors and condemns.</p>
               <p n="16">Â§. 16. Yet so much I shall grant Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
That men are tormented with many Passions
unknown to Brutes, such as are Coveteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Ambition, Vain-glory, Envy, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or Strife of Wit, with the Sense of
which Brutes are not at all concerned; all
which I confess, do extremely hinder mens
natural Peace and Concord: So on the other
side, he hath not only several other Passions,
that as strongly persuade him to seek and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, yet God hath also endued him
with reason whereby from the consideration
of his own Nature, and of other things, he may
attain a knowledge of his Deity, and be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53522:225"/>
led to discover, that all the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are not only bare dictates of Reason,
but are also Laws truly established by the
Will of God the Legislator, for his own
Honour, and the Happiness and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind; but so far I shall agree with
Mr. <hi>H.,</hi> that in any Country, where men live
without any knowledg of a Law, either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or reveal'd, that in all those places they are
in as bad or worse state than Brutes can be
imagined to be.</p>
               <p n="17">Â§. 17. To conclude, I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Hypothesis labours under
these great Absurdities. <hi>First,</hi> He supposes
that in the State of Nature a man's Reason
tells him, that his Self-preservation cannot
be obtained without this War against all
men; but afterwards finding by experience
the fatal Evils and Mischiefs proceeding from
this kind of Life, to have also by his reason
found out, and then proposed those Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace, called Laws of Nature, in
order to his own Happiness and Self-preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; as if right Reason could ever dictate
contradictory or opposite means to this same
end, such as are a State of War, and a State
of Peace; a neglect and violation of all the
Laws of Nature, as lawful and necessary for
a man's safety in the State of Nature, and a
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53522:226"/>
strict observation of them when once enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a Civil State, for the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Hypothesis is highly dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to the Goodness and Providence of
God; for if he were the Author and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Mankind (as certainly he was) then
whoever believes this <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Dr.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> Chap. 4. p. 126, 127.</note> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
must also believe that God contrived things so ill, that unless his Creatures had
been more cunning and provident than
himself, they must of necessity (like the
Earth-born Brethren in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi>
have perished by each others hands as soon
as they were made. So that the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and well-being of Mankind would be
entirely attributed to their own Wit and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and not to God's Goodness or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
who must have sent his Creatures
into the World in such an evil state as should
oblige them first to seek their own mutual
Ruin and Destruction, as the way to their
Preservation. So that Mankind must owe all
the happiness and comfort of their Lives, not
to their Creator, but themselves: since with
him the Laws of Nature, whereby they are
preserved, were not given or established by
God their Legislator, but are only so many
Rules of Art or humane Wit, like other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53522:226"/>
of mens contriving, and still suppose
man to be departed from that natural state of
War in which God put him, into an Artificial
one of Peace of his own making: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Deity that made us (if we suppose
him Good and Wise) made us not to be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
(as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself confesses we must
have been) had we continued in this state of
War. So that to suppose God made us, and
left us in that condition, it is directly to deny
our Creator's Goodness. And then if we
suppose him wise, we cannot imagine that
he would frame a sort of Creatures only to
destroy themselves, unless we can believe his
only design was to sport himself in their
folly and madness, in beholding them by all
the ways and arts of Force and Fraud contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own mutual Destruction. And
therefore if the Creation of Man were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Divine Wisdom and Goodness,
his Natural State must have been that of
Peace, and not such a Condition as that which
this Author supposes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth himself ingenious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confess, that he believes there was never
actually such a state of War, as he supposes
and describes: And therefore, tho I grant
it is both lawful and usual for natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who not being able through the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of our humane Faculties, to discover
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53522:227"/>
the true nature and essences of Bodies, or other
Substances, do therefore take a liberty to
seign or suppose such an Hypothesis, as
they think will best suit with the nature of
the things themselves, of which they intend
to treat; and from thence to frame a body of
natural Philosophy, or Physicks, as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
of old, and Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> in our age
have performed: Yet can we not allow the
same liberty in moral or practical Philosophy,
as in speculative. And therefore such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Hypothesis, as this of a natural state
of War, is by no means to be admitted as
the necessary consequence of that natural
Right, which every man hath to preserve
himself: For whether we consider Mankind
to have been together with the world, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all eternity, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the
more modern Platonists did believe; or else
to have sprung out of the earth like Mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> of old, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his
<hi>De Cive</hi> suppose; or else as we (according to
the Divine Revelation of the holy Scriptures)
do believe, That Mankind was at first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated from one Man, and one Woman,
created for that purpose by God: Now let us
at present suppose which of these we please
to be the true Original of Mankind, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from thence with any reason conclude,
that it was at any time such a state of War of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53522:227"/>
all men against all; for if, according to the
first Hypothesis, we suppose Mankind to be
Eternal, they were likewise from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty propagated by distinct Families, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into several Nations, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, as they are at this day: But if it be
objected, that those distinct Nations or
Commonwealths, were always such from
all Eternity; Then it will likewise follow,
that they were also from all Eternity in
the same state they now are; that is, not
of War, but Peace. But we shall further
shew the absurdity of that Supposition, before
we have concluded our Considerations upon
this Head. So on the other side, if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Hypothesis, of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind's
springing out of the Earth; if we do
not likewise suppose them to have been made
like Game-Cocks, or those Earth-born men
I have already mentioned, who presently fell
a fighting, and destroying each other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Cause; it will not do the business:
And therefore let us now with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
these men, being all made of equal
strength, both of body and mind; it is plain,
that they must be at first in a state of Peace,
before they could ever fall together by the
Ears; so then the state of Peace was Prior in
Nature to that of War, and also more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Human Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:53522:228"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> Supposing these Earth-born men to
have been all rational Creatures, and equal in
strength and cunning, they would never have
entered into a state of War, and have fallen
a cutting each others Throats without some
just Cause, or Provocation first given. For
if they were all equal, every man would
consider each of his Fellows as of a like ability
with himself; and that if he struck him first
without any cause, he would be as well able
to resist, and make his party good with him,
as he could be to hurt him; the fear of which
would have rather caused Peace than War:
Since whoever struck first, could not be sure of
the Victory; And if any two should have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to Cuffs, this could be no reason for all
the rest to have also fallen together by the
Ears, since there was no cause why they
should suppose a Will or Inclination in each
other to War, till they had expressed it by
some outward signs; so that this natural
Equality among men, and mutual fear of
each other, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> supposes to be the
chief causes of War, would certainly have
rather inclined these men to Peace.</p>
               <p>But if we follow the Divine Authority of
the Holy Scriptures, it is then certain, That
all Mankind being derived from one Man,
and one Woman, their Children could never
be in this state of war towards their Parents,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53522:228"/>
by Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s own confession; much less could
the Parents ever be so unnatural towards their
Children, who were made out of their own
Substance; nor yet could the Brothers, or
Sisters, who partake of the same Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
derived from their Common Parents, and
who were bred up together from their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in a state of Peace and Amity, be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supposed presently to have fallen together
by the ears without any other cause, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation given, than Mr. <hi>H</hi>s Passions of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual distrust, and desire of glory: Therefore
when after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> man's Nature was
degenerated into that state we now find it,
wherein mens Passions, I own, do too often
domineer over their Reason; and that <hi>Cain,</hi>
through Malice and Envy, slew his Brother,
as we read in <hi>Genesis.</hi> Of this state of War, as it
is the first Example of man's Degeneracy, so it
is also of God's dislike, and punishment of this
cruel Sin of Murther, which is indeed but
the effect of this Author's state of War.</p>
               <p>But I beg the Reader's pardon if I have
been too prolix in the confutation of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; this being the main foundation of all
those Evil and False Opinions contained in
this Author's Moral and Political Works: if
therefore this is throughly destroyed, all that
is built upon it will fall of it self. But since
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath by his Supposition of certain
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53522:229"/>
Compacts, or Covenants, undertaken to shew
a Method how men got out of this wretched
state of War; in which let us see whether his
next Principle answers the Designs he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>PRINCIPLE VIII.</head>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">Â§. <hi>1.</hi> That mutual Compacts of Fidelity in the
State of Nature, are void, but not so in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               </q>
               <p>WHich Principle he expresses and
proves at large, in his <hi>de Cive, cap.</hi>
in these words: <hi>But those Covenants that are
made by Contract, where there is a mutual Trust,
neither party performing any thing presently in
the state of Nature, if any just Fear shall arise
on either side, are void. For he who first performs,
because of the evil disposition of the greatest part
of men, only studying their own profit, no matter
whether by right or wrong, betrays himself to
the lust of him with whom he contracts: For
there is no reason that any man should perform
first, if it is not likely that the other will perform
afterwards; which whether it be likely or not, he
who fears, must judge, as it is shewn in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter,</hi> Art. 9. <hi>I say things are thus in
the state of nature; but in a Civil state, where
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53522:229"/>
there is one who can compel them both, he who by
Contract is first to perform, ought first to do it.
For since the other may be compelled, the reason
ceases, for which he feared the other would not
perform.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Principle is somewhat otherwise
expressed in his <hi>Lev.</hi> chap. 14. which since
it differs something from the other, in the
manner of expression, I shall likewise give in
you his own words. <hi>If a Covenant be made
wherein neither of the Parties perform presently,
but trust one another, in the condition of mere
nature (which is a condition of War of every
man against every man) upon any reasonable
supposition, it is void; but if there be a common
Power set over them both, with right and force
sufficient to compel performance, it is not void;
for he that performeth first, hath no assurance the
other will perform afterwards, because the mere
bonds of words are too weak to bridle mens Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Avarice, Anger, and other Passions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fear of some coercive Power, (which in the
condition of mere Nature, where all men are
equal, and judges of the justness of their own
fears, cannot possibly be supposed); and he which
performs first, doth but betray himself to his
enemy, contrary to the Right (he can never
abandon) of defending his life, and means of
living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:53522:230"/>Â§. 2. You may now more plainly see the
reason why he supposes in the foregoing
Chapter, That all Kings and persons of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority, are always in a posture,
or state of War; which he more plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses in his <hi>de Cive,</hi> chap. 10. Â§. 17. in these
words; <hi>But what are divers Commonwealths,
but so many Garisons fortified against each other
with Arms and Ammunition? Whose State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are kept in awe by no common Power,
(altho an uncertain Peace, or short Truces may
intervene) is yet to be accounted for the state of
Nature, that is, for a state of War.</hi> From all
which it is easie to deduce the grievous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that would thereby happen to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For in the first place these Civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns he mentions, can never be obliged by
any Covenants from making War upon, and
ruining each other, nor can be accused for
breach of Faith, or Infidelity, when they do
so; for being still in the state of Nature, that
will necessarily follow, which he lays down
at the end of his former Chapter, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of this state: <hi>To this War of every
man against every man, this also is consequent,
that nothing can be unjust. The notions of Right
and Wrong, Iustice and Injustice, have there no
place; where there is no common Power, there
is no Law; where no Law, no Injustice. Force
and Fraud are in War the two Cardinal Vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:53522:230"/>Â§. 3. So that you see upon these Principles
it is altogether in vain for Princes to make
any Articles or Covenants of Peace with
each other; no, not if they swear to them
never so solemnly; for in the last words of
this Chapter he tells us, <hi>That the Oath adds
nothing to the obligation; for a Covenant, if
lawful, binds in the sight of God, without the
Oath, as much as with it; if unlawful, binds
not at all, tho it be confirmed with an Oath</hi>: So
that if the Covenant could not oblige, the
Oath will serve to as little purpose: What
Princes will thank him for this Doctrine, I
know not; but I hope it is not an Apology
for the late actions of any Princes but the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Emperor, and our Christian <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> on the other side the water; but if
the state of Princes towards each other is so
bad, that of the Subjects is much worse; for
from these Principles the safety of all Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, Merchants, and Travellers in the
Territories of any Prince or State with
whom we are at Peace, is thereby utterly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; nor can the Subjects be in a better
condition than their Masters; for by this
Author's determination, they are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enemies as soon as they come under a
Foreign Power: For such Princes being
always in the state of Nature towards each
other, it is a part of their Natural Right or
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53522:231"/>
Prerogative, <hi>to force all those that are weaker
to give a Caution of their future Obedience</hi> (and
good behaviour) unless they will rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Death. <hi>For nothing can be imagined more
absurd, than that he who being weak you have
in your power, by letting him go, you may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both strong, and your Enemy.</hi> All which
are his own words, in his <hi>De Cive, Cap.</hi> 1.
Â§. 14. Nor can I understand what he means
by a future Caution of Obedience, but the
Submission of those who are thus seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their coming into the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and subjecting themselves wholly
to their Empire, who thus lay hold on them:
For he tells us presently after, <hi>That a certain
and irresistible Power confers a Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Ruling those, who cannot resist it.</hi> So
that if this Doctrine be true, in what an
ill condition are Ambassadors, and other
Strangers in foreign Countries now at League
with us, any one may easily perceive. Well,
but suppose such Strangers could or would
submit themselves absolutely to these Foreign
Powers, they may yet chuse whether they
will accept it, since no Law of Nature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Principles, can oblige Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
to any outward Acts of Kindness or
Mercy towards others, who are not of the same
Commonwealth, since they may either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of this their Submission, or else refuse it,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53522:231"/>
and put them to Death, tho otherwise never
so innocent.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. But if Compacts with those of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Commonwealths, whether Princes or
Subjects, are of so little force, let us see
whether they will signify any more among
those, who having agreed to renounce this
State of Nature, are willing to transfer all
their Power upon one, or more Persons, and
so enter into his Commonwealth. Where,
<hi>first,</hi> I desire you to observe, that these Pacts
or Covenants, by which every Man renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
his Natural Right, are still made in the
State of Nature, in which State, it is lawful
for any Man to doubt of another's Fidelity;
but whether a Man justly fears that another
will not perform his part, he that fears, is
the only Judge; and therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that every man hath cause to fear,
whenever he is afraid. Which reason, if it
were of any force, would infer, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those Compacts are invalid in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is performed on either part; but also
those in which any thing of any moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
yet to be done by either Party, for he
who will not keep Faith any longer, may
when he pleases pretend to be afraid, lest
the other should break his Faith with him,
and that very justly, whilst he himself is the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53522:232"/>
only Judge of it; and therefore his Reason
(which is always supposed to be right) may
not only tell him, that he need not perform
his part of the Covenant, but also that it is
absolutely void, if he thinks fit to make it so.
But if any one will say, that he himself hath
prevented this Objection by his Annotation to
this Article; as also in his <hi>Lev.</hi> in this Chap.
<hi>That the Cause of fear, which makes such a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
invalid, must be always something ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
after the Covenant made, as some new fact,
or other sign of the Will not to perform, else
it cannot make the Covenant void. For that
which could not hinder a Man from promising,
ought not to be admitted as an hindrance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming.</hi>
All which, tho it be very true,
yet if what he hath already alledged in his
foregoing Section be also true, it will not
signify any thing; because he there tells us,
that whether it is likely that he will perform,
or not, he who is afraid, is the only Judge,
(right or wrong, it is all one) and therefore
this fear of another mans failing in his trust,
may either arise from his calling to mind the
false and evil Disposition of all men, which
before the Compact he had not well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
or else he may suppose any Act of
the other Parties (tho never so innocent) to
be a sufficient sign of his Will not to perform
his part. Nor is there any thing in the State
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53522:232"/>
of Nature, which can make such a timerous
man secure of the Fidelity of others, for
the performance of their Compact; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tells us in his <hi>De Cive, Cap.</hi> 5.
Â§. 1, 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. Â§. 27. <hi>All the hope of security
is placed, in that a man may prevent all others,
either openly, or by surprise.</hi> So, that altho it
appears that the Utility of observing of
Compacts be never so manifest, yet cannot
it by this Principle lay any firm Obligation
upon mens minds, but that they may depart
from them, whenever they will neglect or
oversee this Utility, or that they think they
may better secure their own interest by any
other means; since the Will and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of man can never be so obliged by their
naked Compacts, that they may not depart
from, or act contrary to them, whensoever
they think they may safely, and for their
own private advantage do it. For the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
will not only cease, if it shall please
all those who have so covenanted to depart
from their Covenants at once, as when men
discharge themselves of them by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
But supposing also this consent still to
continue, the force of an Obligation will yet
be wanting; for since that dictate of Reason
of keeping Compacts, has not as yet attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the force of a Law, as being made (as I
have already observed) in the meer state of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53522:233"/>
Nature; any single Person, according to
his particular Humour, or predominant Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Fear, or Suspicion, or Self-interest,
may depart from this dictate of Reason, tho
the rest do not agree so to do; because no
man according to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
can ever be tied by any Compact to quit
the doing of that which he judges necessary
for his own Interest, or Self-defence. For in
the very beginning of this 14th Chapter in
his <hi>Lev.</hi> he defines a Law of Nature to be
<hi>a Precept, or general Rule found out by Reason,
by which a man is forbidden to do that which is
destructive of his Life, or takes away the means
of preserving the same, and to omit that by
which he thinketh it may be best preserved.</hi>
So that for the preservation of a man's life,
or whenever he thinks those Compacts may
take away the means of preserving it, he
may without crime fail in keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts
either for Publick Peace, or the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Justice with his Fellow-subjects, or
of Fidelity, or of Obedience to his Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign;
who upon these Principles, is in no
better a condition, nor so good, as any of his
Subjects: Because Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth not allow in
his <hi>Leviathan, Cap.</hi> 18. of any compacts to be
made between the Sovereign, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
who only Covenant one with the
other, and not with him, to give up their
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53522:233"/>
right of governing themselves to this man, or
Assembly of men, and that they do thereby
authorize all his Actions. So that since this
Compact is made in the state Nature, and
that this Law of keeping of Compacts, is
only a dictate of Reason, and no Law; it can
lay no higher obligation upon mens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in the state of Nature, than any other
Law of Nature, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> plainly tells
us <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>In the state of Nature do not oblige,</hi>
nor can the Common Power set over men,
lay any obligation in Conscience upon them,
why they should not break these Compacts
towards each other, when ever they think it
convenient: For since the Civil Sovereign can
only oblige them to its outward observation
by those Punishments as he pleases to appoint
for such offences as are destructive to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, every man that will venture the
fear of discovery, or being taken, or whenever
he thinks he can make a Party strong enough
to defend himself from those that would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him for the breach of them; may safely,
nay lawfully, transgress them, when-ever
the awe, or fear of the Civil Sovereign
ceases. So that it is evident there doth still
need some higher Law, or Principle than this
of meer Fear of the Civil Power to make
men honest, or to keep their Compacts
when they have made them.</p>

his Master <hi>Epicurus</hi> in this rare inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

conclusions understood by reason concerning the
doing of things; (whereas a Law properly and
accurately speaking, is the word of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
something to be done, or not done by
others); they are not Laws, properly speaking, as
they proceed from Nature: Yet as far as they are
given by God in the Holy Scripture, they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called by the name of Laws</hi>; Which likewise
he hath more briefly contracted in his <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
Cap. 15. in these words: <hi>These dictates
of Reason, men use to call by the Name of Laws,
but improperly, for they are but Conclusions, or
Theorems concerning what conduceth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and defence of themselves; whereas
Law properly is the word of him, that by right
hath a command over others. But yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the same Theorems as delivered in the word
of God, that by right commands all things, then
are they properly called Laws.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:53522:235"/>Â§. 2. The Reason for which opinion he
gives us in his <hi>De Cive Cap.</hi> 5 Â§. 1, 2, 3. in these
words; <hi>It is self-manifest, that the actions of
men do proceed from their Will, and their Will
from Hope and Fear: So that as often as it
seems, that a greater Good, or lesser Evil is like
to happen to them, from the violation of
Laws, men willingly violate them; therefore
every man's hope of security and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is placed in this, that he may be able to
prevent his Neighbour either by his own force or
art, openly or at unawares. From whence it is
plain, that the Laws of Nature do not presently,
as soon as they are known, give sufficient security
to every one of observing them; and therefore
as long as no caution can be obtained from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
of others, that Primitive Right must still
remain to every one, of taking Care of himself
by all the ways that he will, or can; which is the
Right of all men, to all things, or the Right of
War; and it suffices for the fulfilling of
the Law of Nature, that any one should be
ready or willing to have Peace when it may be had
with security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. <hi>So likewise in his</hi> Leviathan, Chap.
14. <hi>tho he grants that the Laws of Nature ought
to be observed, yet because they are contrary to our
Natural Passions, that carry us to Partiality,
Pride, Revenge, and the like; and their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53522:235"/>
without the Sword, are but Words, and
have no strength to secure a man at all; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
notwithstanding the Laws of Nature, if
there be no Power erected, or not great enough
for our security, every man will, and may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
rely on his Strength and Art, for caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all other men. And in his</hi> 15th. Chap.
of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> he farther tells us, <hi>The Laws
of Nature oblige in</hi> foro interno, <hi>that is to say,
they bind to a desire that they should take place: But
in</hi> foro externo, <hi>that is, to the putting them in
Act, not always. For he that should be modest
and tractable, and perform all he promises in such
time, and place, where no man else would do so,
should but make himself a Prey to others, and
procure his own certain Ruin, contrary to the
ground of all the Laws of Nature, which tend
to Nature's Preservation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. I have been the larger in giving you
his own words in this place, because I could
not well contract them without spoiling his
sense; and also that you may the better see
whether he be clearly answered, or not. In
the First place therefore, if it be already
made out in the precedent Discourse, that
in this Proposition <hi>of endeavouring the Common
Good of Rational Beings,</hi> are contained all
the Laws of Nature, and that it doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
appear to proceed from God, from the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53522:236"/>
Nature of things, and those Rewards and
Punishments he hath annexed to its observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and transgression: Then notwithstanding
what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath here said, this Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is properly a Law; as having all the
conditions necessary thereunto: But that
which might lead Mr. <hi>H.</hi> into this Error,
was, That all Writers upon this Subject,
thought it sufficient to define the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be only a Dictate of right Reason,
without deducing its Authority from God,
as a Legislator: Or if they have supposed
God the Author of it, as <hi>Suarez</hi> in his Book
<hi>de Legibus</hi>; and <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>de Iure Belli &amp;
pacis</hi> have done: Yet they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with supposing, that God had impress'd
these Idea's upon mens Souls, as so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Notions, which they call the Light of
Nature, without shewing us by some more
plain or certain means (as our Author hath
done in the preceding Discourse) how we
may attain to the knowledge of this Law.
The weakness, or precariousness of which
Hypothesis being discovered by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gave
him occasion to suppose that the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was not properly a Law, for want of a
Legislator; and farther, they having defined
this Law of Nature to be a dictate of right
reason, which seems only proper to revealed
or Civil Laws, delivered in some set form of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53522:236"/>
words, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath here also defined a
Law, <hi>To be the Word, or Speech of him who
hath a Right to Command a thing to be done, or
not to be done</hi>: And so the Laws of Nature
not being delivered in any set form of words,
cannot be upon these grounds properly
Laws.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. But I think we have already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved, that the Law of Nature, being
to be collected from our own Natures, and
that of other things without us, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in any set form of words, but in those
true Notions or Idea's taken from the things
themselves: And we have already shown,
that Persons born deaf or dumb; are capable
of understanding this Law, though they
have not the use of words. And Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
himself before he is aware, doth sufficiently
confess this Truth in more places than one
of his <hi>de Cive.</hi> For after he hath in the last
Art. of his Third Chap. denied the Laws of
Nature to be properly Laws, he begins his
4<hi>th. Chap.</hi> with these Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which is called the Natural, and Moral,
the same is wont to be also called the Divine Law,
nor undeservedly; because Reason, which is the
very Law of Nature, is immediately given by
God to every man, as the Rule of his Actions,
as also because the Precepts of Life which are
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53522:237"/>
thence derived, are the same which are given by
the Divine Majesty for the Laws of his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom by our Lord Iesus Christ, and his
Holy Apostles. Those things therefore which
may be before understood by Reason concerning the
Law of Nature, the same we shall endeavour to
confirm from the Holy Scripture.</hi> So likewise
in his 15<hi>th.</hi> Chap. Article 3. he tells us, <hi>That
the Laws of God are declared after a Threefold
manner. The First of which is by the Tacit
Dictates of Right Reason: From both which
places we may plainly collect, That if the Laws
of Nature are Dictates of right Reason, and if
the Laws of God and Nature, or Reason, are all
one and the same, and that Right Reason is the
very Law of Nature, and is immediately given
by God to every Man as a Rule of his Actions, it
will likewise as necessarily follow, that those Laws
or Dictates of Reason are also Divine, since
they proceed from God as a Legislator.</hi> Nor will
it serve his turn to alledge, as he doth in his
<hi>Leviathan</hi> 15. Chap. That the same Laws
(<hi>viz.</hi>) of Nature, because they oblige only
to a desire, and endeavour (I mean an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
and constant endeavour) are easy to
be observed. For in that he requireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but endeavour; he that endeavoureth
their performance, as far as he can fulfilleth
them, and he that fulfilleth the Laws, is just.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:53522:237"/>Â§. 6. This will prove a meer Evasion, if
you please to consider, That unless the Laws
of Nature regard the outward Actions of
men, they cannot partake of the nature of
Laws, nor do they carry any obligations along
with them, because it is impossible to seek
Peace with others, or to depart from our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Rights by any internal Act of the Mind
alone, without outward Actions, and most of
those Actions do in their own nature necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
regard, and concern others besides our
selves. But if he should reply, that such
Actions are improperly called Laws, for want
of Rewards and Punishments: To this we
may likewise return, That we have already
fully proved in this Discourse, that they carry
with them the true force of Laws, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
all the Conditions necessary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And he himself in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> chap. 21.
doth expresly acknowledge, and set down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of those natural Punishments which are
appointed by God as natural effects of the
Transgression or breach of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Which Passage, because I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
transcribed it in the Discourse it self,
Chap. 3. I shall therefore refer you thither.
But in short, If there be no Laws of Nature
properly so called, in the state of Nature, it
will likewise necessarily follow, that there is
no such thing as Natural Rights properly so
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53522:238"/>
called; And so his Right of all men to all
things, and to make war upon all men, will
be very improperly called a Right; for they
cannot be properly so, but as they are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or permitted us, by some Laws properly
so called, which in this state can only be those
of God, or Nature.</p>
               <p n="7">Â§. 7. But we are weary of such Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
and therefore let us now farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the only Reason he brings why he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
their obligation to external Acts in the
state of Nature, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Because we cannot be
secured that others will observe them in those
things which are necessary to our preservation</hi>;
[and therefore infers] that every man's
hopes of his own Security are placed in this,
That by his own Force or Wiles he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his Neighbour openly, or at unawares.
This is that invincible Argument which seems
strong enough in his Judgment to destroy all
outward Obligations to the whole Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Yet I think for all that, it is easy enough
to be answered. And therefore in the first
place, we reply, That there is no need of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
such a perfect Security to be afforded
by the Laws of Nature concerning other
mens observing them, as must needs be free
from all Fear, before we can be obliged to
external Actions conformable to them; for
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53522:238"/>
the Will of God, the first Cause, being
known, whereby he establishes these Laws,
there will arise a certain obligation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of such external Actions; though
some men may be so wicked, as to break, or
neglect them, and to practice evil and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Actions towards those that would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them.</p>
               <p>But I shall now farther prove (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this Objection) that we are under a
greater obligation to the Laws of Nature,
than we are to the Civil Laws of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to whose external obedience he will have
all men whatsoever obliged. For all Persons,
although they are not under the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
yet are all Members of the same
more large Empire of God himself. Now it
is most notorious, that those that are Subjects
to the same Civil Power, cannot be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
secure, either that their Fellow-subjects
will observe all the Civil Laws, by abstaining
from Murther, Robbery, or Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
or that the Civil Sovereign can, or will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
punish all the Transgressors of his Laws,
especially where Factions are potent, though
he is never so watchful over the Publick
Good. So that if to these cautious Men of
Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Principles, it seems a sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for their outward obligation to the Civil
Laws, if it appears more probable that the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53522:239"/>
Civil Sovereign both will, and can take care
of the Authority of his Laws, by protecting
the Obedient, and punishing the Refractory,
than that he will forbear, or neglect so to do;
it will likewise follow, That to all men who
exercise true Piety, and Obedience to God's
Natural Laws, their obligation to observe
them will not prove the more infirm, though
God doth not always presently, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
punish all the Transgressions and Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Natural Laws; it being a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
security to them of his Goodness and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
since he will certainly inflict more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Punishments upon their Transgressors,
either in this life, or in that to come, than
any Humane Power can do upon Offenders
against their Civil Laws. So that if Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s
Argument were valid, not only the outward
obligation of all Natural, but also of all Civil
Laws, would be quite destroyed; since in
neither State we can be perfectly secure, that
all others will observe them; and indeed he
demands that which is altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when he requires an absolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Security concerning future voluntary
Actions, either in a Civil, or a Natural
State; which as such can be only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:53522:239"/>Â§. 8. But if he will permit us to call that
a State of security, which is the most free
of any from the fear of future Danger, or
Misery, we assert, That God has made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to all men, by all those signs, (which
we have already shown to be sufficient to
evince our Obligation) that even out of a
Civil Government, he shall be much more
safe from all sorts of Evil, who shall most
strictly and constantly observe all the Laws
of Nature in his outward Actions, as well
as internal Inclinations, than he who (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Doctrine) shall seek
this Security by endeavouring to prevent,
and assault all other men by force or
fraud.</p>
               <p>But it is necessary when we compare the
dangers, or security of the good or just men,
(which are only those who observe the Laws
of Nature in their outward Actions) as also
of the wicked or unjust, who do otherwise,
to make a true Experiment, which of these
will give most certain security; there
is not only to be reckoned into this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
those Evils which may happen to
them from the Violence of other men, but also
those, which such wicked men bring upon
themselves by their inconstant and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
way of living, as also by their inordinate
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53522:240"/>
Passions, such as Envy, Anger, Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and moreover, all those Evils, or
Punishments, which may with reason be
feared from God, both in this Life, and in
that to come; which also are to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not in any one particular case, or in a
few circumstances only, but in all those that
may happen through the whole course of
their Lives; for otherwise it is impossible,
that we should truly judge which course of
Life, either that of constant Justice or Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
would be more secure. But we have,
I hope already, sufficiently made out, that
their condition is much more happy and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
who observe the Laws of Nature in the
whole course of their Actions, than those who
act otherwise.</p>
               <p>To which I shall only add, That altho
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself, when he treats of the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
requisite to the outward Observation of
the Laws of Nature, doth wholly insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a perfect security from the Invasion of
other men, and affirms, Because it is not to
be had in the State of Nature, that therefore
no body is obliged in that State to outward
acts of Justice, but hath still a right to all
things, and of making War upon all Men;
Yet in other places of his Book, as if he had
forgot himself, he doth acknowledge (altho
but sparingly) that he himself perceived that
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53522:240"/>
there was a sufficient Obligation to an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Conformity to the Laws of Nature, even
out of a Civil State, lest we should fall into
other Evils besides those which may be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the violence of men. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when he endeavours to prove in his
<hi>De Cive, Cap.</hi> 3. Â§. 2, 3. That Faith is to be
kept with all men, he fetches his reason from
hence, <hi>That he who violates his Covenant,
commits a Contradiction, which he acknowledges
to be an Absurdity in Humane Conversation.</hi>
And therefore, if he can admit in this case,
that it is better to observe, than to violate
our Covenants, lest we should fall into a
Contradiction; what reason is there, why
we should not also universally infer the same
consequence from the breach of every Law
of Nature, and consequently an Obligation
to all their outward Actions? So that it will
be better to observe than to transgress them
in the State of Nature, because their Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth still imply a Contradiction or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
in all Humane Society or Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for whosoever will seriously consider
the Nature of rational Agents, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that all the Felicity possible for them,
doth depend upon the Common Good and
Happiness of the whole System, as its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and adequate Cause; and therefore
every man ought to seek both of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53522:241"/>
for whensoever he transgresses any
Law of Nature, he then separates his own
private Good or Advantage, from that of the
publick; which being contradictory ways
of acting, must needs raise a Civil War, or
Contest in a mans own Conscience, between
his Reason, and his Passions, which must
grievously disturb its Tranquility; which
Evil, since it also takes away his Peace
and Security, is no contemptible Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
naturally inflicted by God for such
Offences.</p>
               <p n="9">Â§. 9. I shall now only propose two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
more, whereby I think we may demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the falseness of this Argument of
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> The first is, That Presumption of
the Civil Laws, both in our own, and all
other Kingdoms, which sufficiently declares
what Judgment Civil Sovereigns (whom
this Author makes the only Judges of right
or wrong) have made of Humane Nature; to
wit, that every one is presumed to be good,
until the contrary be proved by some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Action, and that made out by suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Proof or Testimony; and therefore, if
their Judgment be true, he must own all
other men ought not to be esteemed as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or so wicked as he is pleased to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
so that they may be set upon and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53522:241"/>
killed, tho never so innocent, for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
mans security. And this Presumption
is more strong against Mr. <hi>H.</hi> because he
founds that Security, which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
to be sufficient in Commonwealths,
upon those Punishments by which the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Powers can restrain all Invaders
of other mens Rights; but it is certain, that
no Punishments are inflicted in Civil States,
unless according to the Sentence of some
Judges, who always give Sentence according
to this Presumption. This therefore is either
a true Presumption, and so able to direct our
Actions in the State of Nature, or else even
in Commonwealths there is not to be found a
sufficient security by the Laws made
and Punishments inflicted according to
this Presumption; and so neither Civil Laws
themselves do oblige us to outward Acts,
and thus every Commonwealth would soon
be dissolved. But since we are satisfied, that
publick Judgments given according to this
Presumption, do for the most part render
mens Lives secure enough, and certainly
much more safe, than if all who are arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Bar were presumed to be Enemies,
and according to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s rule of prevention,
should be all forthwith condemned to suffer
as guilty; therefore it also follows, that the
private Judgments of particular men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53522:242"/>
others, made according to this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
do more conduce to the security
of all men, than this Authors rash Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Universal Pravity of all men, and
would thence persuade us that all others in
the State of Nature are to be prevented, and
set upon by force and fraud.</p>
               <p n="10">Â§. 10. A second reason to prove, that the
violation of the Laws of Nature, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts, will procure us less security than
their exact observation, may be drawn from
hence, That Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself confesses, there
will thence necessarily follow a War of all
men against all; which War being once sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
he rightly acknowledges, that all men
would become miserable, and must presently
perish: From whence it appears, that all
security is sought for in vain, by this mad
state; so that there can remain no more hopes
of it; tho Mr. <hi>H.</hi> teaches otherwise in his
<hi>de Cive, cap.</hi> 5. Â§. 1. and <hi>Lev. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>viz.
That in the mutual fear of men, no body hath
a better way of security, than by this anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or prevention; that is, every one may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
so long to subject all others by force or fraud,
as he sees any man left, of whom he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi>;
that is, as long as there is one man left
alive; and so the whole earth would soon
become a desart, and the common sepulchre
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53522:242"/>
of mankind; for no man can provide any
aid or assistance for himself from other men
in this state, because Covenants of mutual
Faith, by which alone others can be joined
in Society with him, will not oblige to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
acts in this state, as I have shewed he
acknowledges; and therefore there remains
no security by this way of anticipation: So
that if there be any security in Nature, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the reasons and consciences of men,
whether this is not more likely to be had by
the endeavour of the common Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
by doing good and not evil to those who
have done us no harm, than by Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Anticipation which can yield no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at all.</p>

I do not impose upon Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in this Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I will give you his own words, in his <hi>de
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53522:243"/>
Cive,</hi> cap. 14. Â§. 9, 10. <hi>But because it arises
from Civil Laws, that as well every one should
have a proper Right to himself, distinct from
that of another, as also that he may be forbidden
to invade other mens Properties, it follows that
these Precepts, Honour thy Parents, Thou shalt
not defraud any man in that which is appointed by
the Laws; Thou mayest not kill a man whom the
Laws forbid thee to kill; Thou shalt avoid all
Carnal Copulation forbidden by the Laws; Thou
shalt not take away another mans Goods without his
consent; Thou shalt not frustrate Laws and
Iudgments by false Witness, are all Civil
Laws. It is true, the Laws of Nature prescribe
the same things, but immplicity; for the Law
of Nature, as is said before,</hi> Cap. 3. Â§. 2. <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
Compacts to be observed; and therefore,
also to yield Obedience when Obedience was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted;
and to abstain from what is anothers,
when it is defined by the Civil Law, what it is;
but all the Subjects do Covenant from the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
oi the Commonwealth, to yield Obedience
to his Commands, who hath the supream Power,
that is to the Civil Laws. For the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did oblige in the state of Nature, where
first of all where Nature gave all things to all
men, nothing was anothers, and therefore impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to invade it; and in the next place, where
all things were common; therefore also all Carnal
Copulations were lawful.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Where
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53522:243"/>
there was a state of War, it was then lawful to
kill any man.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Where all things were
determined by a man's own Iudgment, therefore
also were the Honours and Duties due to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
Lastly, <hi>Where there were no publick
Iudgments, therefore there was no need of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Testimony either true or false; since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Obligation to observe those Laws, is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to the Promulgation of them, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the very constitution of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
by vertue of this Law of Nature, which
prohibits the violation of Compacts; the Law
of Nature commands all Civil Laws to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
For where we are under an Obligation to
Obedience, before we know what will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
we are there universally, and in all
things obliged to obey; from whence it follows,
That no Civil Law which is not made in reproach
to God, (in respect of whom, all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
are not at their own Disposals, nor can
be said to give Laws), cannot be against the
Law of Nature. For altho the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
prohibits Theft, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet if the Civil
Laws should command you to take away any thing
from another, or to lye with any Woman; that is
not Theft, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the</hi> Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
<hi>of old, when by a certain Law, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their Boys privately to take away other
people's Goods; they then commanded those Goods
not to be the Owners, but theirs who thus stole
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53522:244"/>
them. And therefore such a private taking, was
no Theft. In like manner, the promiscuous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
of Sexes amongst the Heathens, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own Laws, were lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Â§. 2. There is nothing that Mr. <hi>H</hi> hath
written more rudely and wickedly, and
wherein he more contradicts himself, than
in this Assertion, concerning the mutability of
the Laws of Nature, as to outward Actions;
since he himself tells us immediately after,
<hi>That the Laws of Nature are immutable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;
and that Injustice, Ingratitude, Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
Pride, Iniquity, Acception of Persons,
and the like, can never be made lawful: for it can
never be that War shall preserve life, and Peace
destroy it.</hi> But how the Laws of Nature can
be immutable, and yet alterable as to outward
Actions, at the Will of the Civil Soveraign,
I cannot comprehend.</p>
               <p>But since we have already destroyed those
two main Principles introductive to this,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That no Action is good or evil in the
state of Nature, till either the revealed Law
of God, or that of the Civil Soveraign hath
made it so; and also that the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are not properly Laws in the state of
Nature; Let us now examine the only reason
he here gives us for this Assertion, which is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53522:244"/>
this; That the Law of Nature which prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
the violation of Compacts, commands
all Civil Laws to be observed; since our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Supream Powers is one of the
first Compacts that men made at the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Commonwealth; granting all
which to be true, yet was it not absolutely, or
in all things, that this Obedience was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but only in such as regard the publick
good of the Commonwealth, or tend to the
common Good or Preservation of Mankind;
for if the Civil Soveraign should make a
Law, that every one might knock his Father
in the Head, when he came to such an Age,
and marry his Mother, or rob any other man,
tho' his dearest Friend, of all the necessaries
of Life: All these wicked Actions will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
lawful to be done, nay, every man
were obliged to do them, if the Law of
Nature commanded all Civil Laws to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
without distinction; but he here tells
us, <hi>That no Civil Laws can be against the Law
of Nature, which are not made in direct reproach
to God.</hi> And upon this Principle no Law
can be so, but what directly denies his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;
since in his <hi>Leviathan, Ch.</hi>âhe makes
even Idolatry lawful, if it be once command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his infallible <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the Supream
Power: But if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had but read and
considered any ordinary System of Ethicks,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53522:245"/>
he would have found, that it was one of the
first Principles in that Science, that the Laws
of Nature (like the moral Vertues) are so
nearly linked, and have such an inseparable
dependance upon each other, that the first
and prior Laws of Nature can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
by the latter, or secondary. And
therefore tho' it is true, that Compacts are
to be observed by the Law of Nature, and
that Obedience to the Commands of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Soveraign, is one of those Compacts which
men make when they institute, and enter
into a Commonwealth, or Civil State; yet
were those Promises of Obedience only made
concerning such things, which the Laws of
Nature have commanded, or permitted to
be done, in order to the common good of
rational Beings. I grant therefore, That
the Civil Laws of every Commonwealth,
as they may appoint what outward Rewards
or Punishments they please for the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Transgression of the Law of Nature;
and also in order to this end may ordain what
outward Acts shall be called Murder, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet doth it not therefore
follow, That they have a Power to alter the
Nature of all moral Actions, and so make a
new Law of Nature; tho' I own they may
enlarge or restrain their exercise in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Actions or Instances. But since this
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53522:245"/>
is best cleared by examples, I shall here give
you some of each sort. <hi>First,</hi> Therefore tho'
our Laws give leave to men to converse
alone with married Women without any
Crime, yet in divers Countries it is not so,
But whoever is found alone in the Company
of another man's Wife without his leave,
it is lawful for the Husband to kill them both;
because such private Congresses being
esteem'd as bad as downright Adultery, the
Punishment of it is left as it was in the state
of Nature, to the discretion of the Husband:
But doth it therefore follow, That the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Power might make a Law, whereby
it may be lawful for a Husband to kill every
man that should but happen to look upon
his Wife, because he may at the same time
commit Adultery with her in his heart?
So likewise by our Law, the Husband is to
be esteemed the Father of all Children which
his Wife shall bring forth, if he were within
the <hi>English</hi> Dominions at the time when the
Child was Begot, though he were at that
same time an Hundred Miles off, and though
the Mother should assure the Child, that
not her Husband, but another man were
really his Father; Yet is not such a Child
obliged to believe her, or to pay any Duty
or respect to that Person, though he be really
his Father: But will it therefore follow,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53522:246"/>
that the King and Parliament may make a
Law, That no Child whatsoever should Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Obey his Parents. But to come to
the Author's last instance of the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Boys; I will not deny but it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the <hi>Spartans</hi> (as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> likewise
did) to make a Law, That private Thefts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
without discovery, or violence to
mens Persons, should not only alter the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
in the things stolen, bu also pass unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
since this may very well consist
with the Publick Peace and safety of the
People, and may also tend to the Publick
good of the Commonwealth; since it might
not only make men more careful of their
Goods, but might also serve to make those
Boys more crafty, secret, and undertaking in
greater matters, when they should come to
be men; which as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, was the
main reason why <hi>Licurgus</hi> made this Law:
But does it therefore follow, that either the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> or <hi>Egyptians</hi> might have
made it Lawful for Thieves and Robbers to
assault all mens Persons, and take away their
Goods by Force, or to Rob men of those
things (such as Food and Rayment) which
are absolutely necessary for Human Life, or
that such a Law could ever have been made practicable, or have been observed,
without the absolute dissolution of the Civil
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53522:246"/>
Government? Whereas if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had but
considered the distinction between that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Civil Property, which we have
made out in the first Chap. of the preceding
Discourse, he had never fallen into this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
of supposing all Theft or Robbery what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
to become Lawful, if once ordained so
by the Supreme Power.</p>
               <p n="3">Â§. 3. I shall give you but one instance more
from the Laws of our own Kingdom, by
which it is enacted, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall relieve a way going
Beggar, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stat</hi> 7. Jacobi. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</note> shall forfeit Ten shillings
to the Poor of the Parish; which Law was
made for the Publick Good, and to prevent
Wandering, Idleness, and Beggary in the
Poorer sort of People. But doth it therefore
follow, that it might be Lawful for the King
and Parliament to make a Law against all
Charity, or Relief of the Poor whatsoever?
So that you may see, that no Civil Laws
whatsoever, can lay any obligation upon
mens Consciences, but as they either regard
the publick Good of the Commonwealth,
or the more general good of all Rational
Beings.</p>
               <p n="4">Â§. 4. But whether Mr. <hi>H.</hi> fell into this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
for want of a due knowledge and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53522:247"/>
of this great Law of Nature; or else
out of a desire to flatter all Civil Sovereigns,
is hard to determine; though it be very sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious,
that he did it rather out of design
than ignorance; since he teaches us in his <hi>de
Cive, and Lev.</hi> That Princes being free from all
Promises and Compacts to their Subjects, may
dispose of their Lives and Fortunes at their
pleasure, and therefore can do them no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
though they treat them never so cruelly,
because he is in respect of them still in the
state of Nature; by which means he at once
endeavours to destroy all Virtue and Goodness
in Princes, and all Reverence and Respect in
the minds of their Subjects; and makes no
difference between a <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Caligula,</hi> and a
<hi>Trajan</hi> or an <hi>Antonine.</hi> And consequential to
this, he likewise makes the will of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power, though perhaps but one single
man, to be the only measure of Good and
Evil, Just and Unjust: So that whatever he
Commands or Forbids, must immediately be
look'd upon as Good or Evil, because he hath
Commanded it, or Forbidden it; by which
means, Princes would have no other Rules
left them of their Moral, or Politick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but their own Arbitrary Humours, or
Wills: Which if it were so, men would be
in a much worse condition under the Power
of this irresistible <hi>Leviathan,</hi> than they were
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53522:247"/>
in the state of Nature; since a man is in
more danger, as to his Life and Fortune,
who is at the Mercy of one Cruel and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
man, who commands an Hundred
thousand men, than he who was before in
danger of the violence of an Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
single men in the state of Nature, since
it was Lawful for him to have provided for
his own security by combination with others,
which in a Civil state it is upon his Principles
unlawful to do; though I confess, not being
true to them, he leaves every man a Right of
self-defence, or Resistance, even under a
Civil Government whenever he is strong
enough to Rebel, or Resist the Magistrate,
by which means he takes away with one
hand, all that he had before bestowed with
the other.</p>
               <p n="5">Â§. 5. But I think I have now sufficiently
exposed the Falseness, as well as Wickedness
of those Principles: And though I will not
be so uncharitable as to affirm, that either
Mr. <hi>H.,</hi> or all his Followers, either did, or
would always act according to them, (yet as
<hi>Cicero</hi> long since observed in his Offices) they
have more reason to thank the natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and generosity of their own Natures,
than the Doctrines they have embraced, if
they do not. But if I have been too tedious
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53522:248"/>
in the performance, I hope the Reader will
pardon me, if these pernicious Principles are
sufficiently Confuted at last, since it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any man to judge of their Truth
or Falsehood, without first considering the
Author's Opinion, in his own words, and
then strictly examining the reasons he brings
for them; which could not well be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a less compass. But having not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I hope, laid foundations for a more solid
building in the precedent Discourse; but also
cleared off that Rubbish in this second Part,
that might obstruct its Evidence in the minds
of all Candid and indifferent Readers; I shall
therefore beseech God, the great Ruler of
mens hearts and affections, That what we
have said in this Treatise, may have that good
effect, as if not to produce, yet at least to
increase true Piety towards God, and good
Will and Charity among men.</p>
