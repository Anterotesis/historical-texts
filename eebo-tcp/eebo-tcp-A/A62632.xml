            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But the Prophet tells them that they were quite out of the way, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pacifie God upon theſe terms, that there are other things which are much better and more pleaſing to him than any of theſe Sacrifices. For ſome of them were expreſly forbidden by God, as <hi>the offering up of our Children;</hi> and for the reſt, they were not good in themſelves, but meerly by vertue of their Inſtitution, and becauſe they were commanded. But the things which he would recommend to them, are ſuch as are good in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and required of us by God upon that account. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that in theſe words you have,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>An Enquiry which is the beſt way to appeaſe God when he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;</hi> Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God?</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The way that Men are apt to take in this Caſe; and that is by ſome external piece of Religion and Devotion; ſuch as Sacrifice was both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen.

way to appeaſe God when we have offended him? For who can bear his indignation, and who who can ſtand before him, when once he is angry? Let us conſider then, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, the way that Men are apt to take to pacifie God; and that is by ſome external piece of Religion and Devotion, ſuch as were Sacrifices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen.

            <p>And thus it is among our ſelves, when we apprehend God is diſpleaſed with us, and his Judgments abroad in the Earth, we are content to do any thing, but <hi>to learn Righteouſneſs;</hi> we are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37482:9"/>
willing to ſubmit to any kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Devotion and Humiliation, to Faſt, and Pray, to afflict our ſelves, and to cry mightily unto God; things ſome of them good in themſelves, but the leaſt part of that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us.</p>
            <p>And as for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in caſe of publick Judgments and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, they are the inquiſitive and (as they pretend) the moſt skilful People in the world to pacifie God; and they have a thouſand ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to this purpoſe.

ſhall I liſt my ſelf a Souldier for <hi>the Holy War,</hi> or for <hi>the Extirpation of Hereticks?</hi> Shall I give half my Eſtate to a <hi>Convent</hi> for my Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, or chaſtiſe and puniſh my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the Sin of my Soul?</q> Thus Men deceive themſelves, and will ſubmit to all the extravagant Severities, that the Petulancy and Folly of Men can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and impoſe upon them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not to be imagined, when Men are once under the Power of Superſtition, how ridiculous they may be, and yet think themſelves religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; how prodigiouſly they may play the Fool, and yet believe they pleaſe God; what cruel and barbarous things they may do to themſelves and others, and yet be <hi>verily perſwaded they do God good Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is the Myſtery of all this, but that Men are loath to do that, without which, nothing elſe that we do is acceptable to God? They <hi>hate to be reformed;</hi> and for this Reaſon, they will be content to do any Thing, rather than be put to the Trouble of Mending themſelves; every thing is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37482:10"/>
eaſie in compariſon of this Task, and God may have any Terms of them, ſo he will let them be quiet in their Sins, and excuſe them from the real Virtues of a Good Life. And this brings me to the</p>
            <p>Third <hi>Thing, which I principally intended to ſpeak to. The Courſe which God himſelf directs to, and which will effectually pacifie him.</hi> He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? <hi>In the handling of which, I ſhall,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider thoſe ſeveral Duties which God here requires of us, and upon the Performance of which he will be pacified towards us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By what Ways and Means God hath diſcovered theſe Duties to us, and the Goodneſs of them; <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We will briefly conſider the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Duties which God here requires
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37482:10"/>
of us, and upon the Performance of which he will be pacified towards us; <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do Juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was uſual among the <hi>Jews</hi> to reduce all the Duties of Religion to theſe three Heads, <hi>Juſtice, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Piety;</hi> under the firſt two, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Duties which we owe to one another, and under the third the Duties which we owe to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And I was going to tell you what it is, but I conſidered that every Man knows it, as well as any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition can explain it to him. I ſhall only put you in mind of ſome of the principal Inſtances of it, and the ſeveral Virtues comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Juſtice is concerned in the making of Laws; that they be ſuch as are equal and reaſonable, uſeful and beneficial, for the Honour of God and Religion, and for the publick good of Humane Society. This is a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37482:11"/>
great Truſt, in the diſcharge of which, if Men be byaſſed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Intereſt, and drawn aſide from the Conſideration and Regard of the publick Good, it is a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Crime, and of worſe Conſequence, than any private Act of Injuſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man.</p>
            <p>And then, Juſtice is alſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the due Execution of Laws; which are the Guard of private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the Security of Publick Peace, and of Religion and Good Manners. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In the Obſervance of Laws, and Obedience to them; which is a Debt that every Man owes to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society.</p>
            <p>But more eſpecially Juſtice is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Obſervance of thoſe Laws, whether of God or Man, which reſpect the Rights of Men, and their mutual Commerce and Intercourſe with one another. That we uſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Integrity in all our Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in Oppoſition to Fraud and Deceit;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37482:11"/>
Truth and Fidelity, in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Falſhood and Breach of Truſt; Equity and good Conſcience, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all kind of Oppreſſion and Exaction. Theſe are the principal Branches, and Inſtances of this great and comprehenſive Duty of Juſtice; the Violation whereof is ſo much the greater Sin, becauſe this Virtue is the firmeſt Bond of Humane Society, upon the Obſervation whereof, the Peace and Happineſs of Mankind does ſo much depend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mercy,</hi> which does not only ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the inward Affection of Pity and Compaſſion towards thoſe that are in Miſery and Neceſſity, but the Effects of it, in the actual Relief of thoſe whoſe Condition calls for our Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Help and Aſſiſtance; By feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and viſiting the Sick, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Oppreſſed, and comforting the afflicted, and miniſtring Eaſe and Relief to them if it be in our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And this is a very lovely Virtue, and argues more Goodneſs in Men than mere <hi>Juſtice</hi> doth. For <hi>Juſtice</hi>

is a ſtrict Debt; but <hi>Mercy</hi> is Favour and Kindneſs. And this perhaps may be the Reaſon of the different Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Text, that when God bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commands us <hi>to do juſtly,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires we ſhould <hi>love Mercy,</hi> that is, take a particular Pleaſure and Delight in the Exerciſe of this Virtue, which is ſo proper and agreeable to Mankind, that we commonly call it <hi>Humanity,</hi> giving it its Name from our very Nature. In ſhort, it is ſo excellent a Virtue, that I ſhould be very ſorry that any Religion ſhould be able to pretend to the Practice of it more than our own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Piety; To walk humbly with thy God. To walk humbly in the fear of the Lord;</hi> ſo the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe renders theſe Words. And this Phraſe may comprehend all thoſe Acts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which refer immediately to God; A firm Belief of his Being and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; an awful Senſe of him, as the dread Soveraign and righteous Judge of the World; a due Regard to his Service, and a reverent Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of our ſelves towards him in all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37482:13"/>
Acts of Worſhip and Religion, in Oppoſition to Atheiſm and a Prophane Neglect and Contempt of God and Religion; a new and monſtrous kind of Impiety! which of late Years hath broke in upon us, and got head among us, not only contrary to the Example of former Ages, but in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of the very Genius and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Nation, which is naturally devout and zealous in Religion.</p>
            <p>Or elſe this Phraſe of <hi>walking hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with God,</hi> may refer more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the Poſture and Condition of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time, who were fallen under the heavy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God for their Sins. And then the Duty required is, that being ſenſible how highly God hath been offended by us, by the general Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Viciouſneſs of the Age, which like a Leproſie hath ſpread it ſelf almoſt over the whole Body of the Nation, and by that open Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and thoſe inſolent Impieties which are daily committed amongſt us; I ſay, that being deeply ſenſible of this, we do with all Humility acknowledge our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37482:14"/>
Sins to God, and repent of them, and implore his Mercy and Forgiveneſs, and reſolve by his grace <hi>to turn every one from the evil of our ways,</hi> and from <hi>the wickedneſs that is in our hands;</hi> which God grant we may every one do <note n="*" place="margin">This Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was Preach'd upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a publick F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

So is it with a Man that faſteth for his Sins, and goeth again and doth the ſame things. Who will hear his Prayer, or what doth his humbling profit him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us conſider by what ways and means God hath made known theſe Duties to us, and the goodneſs and the obligation of them. <hi>He hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, O Man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee?</hi> I ſhall mention <hi>Five</hi> ways whereby God hath diſcovered this to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a kind of natural Inſtinct.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By natural Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the general vote and conſent of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:37482:15"/>
4. By external Revelation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By the inward Dictates and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's Spirit upon the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By a kind of natural Inſtinct, by which I mean a ſecret impreſſion upon the Minds of Men, whereby they are naturally carried to approve ſome things as good and fit, and to diſlike other things, as having a native evil and deformity in them. And this I call <hi>a natural Inſtinct,</hi> becauſe it does not ſeem to proceed ſo much from the exerciſe of our Reaſon, as from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural propenſion and inclination, like thoſe Inſtincts which are in Brute Creatures, of natural affection and care towards their young ones. And that theſe Inclinations are precedent to all reaſon and diſcourſe about them, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears by this, that they do put forth themſelves every whit as vigorouſly in young perſons, as in thoſe of riper Reaſon; in the rude and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſort of People, as in thoſe who are more poliſh'd and refin'd. For
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37482:15"/>
we ſee plainly that the young and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant have as ſtrong impreſſions of Piety and Devotion, as true a ſenſe of gratitude and juſtice and pity, as the wiſer and more knowing part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. A plain indication, that the Reaſon of Mankind is prevented by a kind of <hi>natural inſtinct</hi> and <hi>anticipation</hi> concerning the good or evil, the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs or deformity of theſe things. And though this do not equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all the inſtances of our Duty, yet as to the great lines and eſſential parts of it, Mankind hardly need to conſult any other Oracle, than the meer propenſions and inclinations of their Nature; as, whether we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the Divine Nature, to be grateful to thoſe who have conferred benefits upon us, to ſpeak the truth, to be faithful to our promiſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore that which is committed to us in truſt, to pity and relieve thoſe that are in miſery, and in all things to do to others as we would have them do to us. And this will further appear, if we conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:37482:16"/>
1. That Men are naturally innocent or guilty to themſelves, according to what they do in theſe things. So the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>When the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, and do ſhew the effect of the Law written in their hearts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts by turns</hi> (that is, according as they do well or ill) <hi>accuſing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing them.</hi> There is a ſecret comfort in innocence, and a ſtrange pleaſure and ſatisfaction in being acquitted by our own Minds for what we do. But on the contrary, when we contradict theſe natural Dictates, what uneaſineſs do we find in our own breaſts? Nay even before the Fact is committed, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſtrangely diſquieted at the thoughts of it. When a Man does but deſign to do a bad thing, he is guilty to himſelf, as if he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. Of this we have a conſiderable inſtance, in the firſt violence that was offered to Nature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Cain, why art thou wroth, and</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37482:16"/>
               <hi>why is thy countenance fallen?</hi> The very thought of that Wickedneſs which he did but then deſign, did diſorder his Mind, and make a change in his very Countenance. Guilt is the natural Concomitant of heinous Crimes, which ſo ſoon as ever a Man commits, his Spirit receives a ſecret wound, which cauſeth a great deal of ſmart and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. For guilt is reſtleſs, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> puts the Mind of Man into an unnatural working and fermentation, never to be ſettled again but by Repentance. <hi>The Wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt;</hi> which plainly ſhews that the Mind of Man hath a kind of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe</hi> of Good and Evil; becauſe when ever we offend againſt Nature, our Conſciences are touched to the quick, and we receive a ſting into our Soul, which ſhoots and pains us, when ever we reflect upon what we have done. I appeal to that witneſs which every Man carries in his breaſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men are naturally full of hopes and fears, according as they follow or go againſt theſe natural Dictates. A
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37482:17"/>
good Conſcience is apt to fill Men with confidence and good hopes. It does not only give eaſe; but ſecurity to the Mind of Man, againſt the dread of Inviſible Powers, and the fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of a future Judgment. Whereas guilt fills Men with diſmal apprehenſions of danger, and continual miſgivings concerning their own ſafety. Thus it was with <hi>Cain</hi> after he had ſlain his Brother; <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that every one that findeth me ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay me.</hi> Nay, when a Man hath done a ſecret fault, which none can accuſe him of, yet then is he haunted with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his own Mind, and cannot be ſecure in his own apprehenſions; which plainly ſhews that Men are conſcious to themſelves, when they do well, and when they do amiſs; and that the ſame <hi>Natural Inſtinct</hi> which prompts Men to their Duty, fills them with good hopes when they have done it, and with ſecret fears and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of danger when they have done contrary to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God ſhews Men what is good, by Natural Reaſon; and that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37482:17"/>
               <hi>two</hi> ways. By the convenience of things to our Nature; and by their tendency to our Happineſs and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Reaſon ſhews us the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of things to our Nature; and whatever is agreeable to the Primitive deſign and intention of Nature, that we call <hi>good;</hi> whatever is contrary thereto, we call <hi>evil.</hi> For Example, <hi>to honour and love God.</hi> It is natural to honour great power and perfection, and to love goodneſs wherever it is. So likewiſe, <hi>gratitude</hi> is natural, to acknowledge benefits received, and to be ready to requite them, and the contrary is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, and univerſally abhorred; and there is no greater ſign that any thing is contrary to Nature, than if it be deteſted by the whole kind. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable alſo to Nature to be <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>to do to others, as we would have them do to us;</hi> for this is to make our own natural inclinations and deſires, the rule of our dealing with others; and <hi>to be merciful;</hi> for no Man that hath not deveſted himſelf of humanity, can be cruel and hard-hearted to others, without feeling a pain in himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:37482:18"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Reaſon ſhews us the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of theſe Things to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Intereſt. And indeed the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> does common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer to the Conſequences of things, and we call that <hi>good,</hi> which will bring ſome Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, and that <hi>evil</hi> which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to produce ſome Miſchief and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; and by this rule Reaſon diſcovers to us that theſe Duties are <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with <hi>Piety</hi> towards God. Nothing can more evidently tend to our Intereſt, than to make him our Friend, upon whoſe Favour our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depends. So likewiſe for <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;</hi> it is a Virtue, to which if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not prompt us, our Intereſt would direct us; for every Man is ready to place Benefits there where he may hope for a thankful Return. <hi>Temperance</hi> does apparently conduce to our Health, which, next to a good Conſcience, is the moſt pleaſant and valuable thing in the World; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the intemperate Man is an open
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37482:18"/>
Enemy to himſelf, and continually mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſaults upon his own Life. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> are not more welcome to others, than they are delightful and beneficial to our ſelves; for we do not only gratifie our own Nature and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, by relieving thoſe who are in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but we provoke Mankind by our Example to the like Tenderneſs, and do prudently beſpeak the Commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others towards us, when it ſhall be our Turn to ſtand in need of it. And if we be wiſe enough, our Reaſon will likewiſe direct us to be <hi>juſt,</hi> as the ſureſt Art of thriving in this World; It gives a Man a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is a powerful Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in all the Affairs of this World; It is the ſhorteſt and eaſieſt way of diſpatching Buſineſs, the plaineſt, and leaſt entangled; and though it be not ſo <hi>ſudden</hi> a way of growing rich, as Fraud and Oppreſſion; yet it is much <hi>ſurer</hi> and more <hi>laſting,</hi> and not liable to thoſe terrible Back-blows and after-reckonings, to which Eſtates got by Injuſtice are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:37482:19"/>
And natural Reaſon does not only ſhew us that theſe things are <hi>good,</hi> but that <hi>the Lord requires them of us,</hi> that is, that they have the Force and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of <hi>Laws.</hi> For there needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to make any thing <hi>a Law,</hi> than a ſufficient declaration, that it is <hi>the Will of God;</hi> and this God hath ſufficiently ſignified to Mankind by the very Frame of our Natures, and of thoſe principles and faculties which he hath endued us withall; ſo that whenever we act contrary to theſe, we plainly diſobey the Will of him that made us, and violate thoſe Laws which he hath Enacted in our Natures, and written upon our Hearts.</p>
            <p>And this is all the <hi>Law</hi> that the greateſt part of Mankind were under, before the Revelation of the Goſpel. From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the World was almoſt ſolely governed by the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law;</hi> which ſeems to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that hard Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>For until the Law Sin was in the World,</hi> that is, before the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given, Men were capable of offending
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37482:19"/>
againſt ſome <hi>other Law,</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Sin could not have been imputed to them, for <hi>Sin is not imputed wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re there is no Law.</hi> And then it follows; <hi>Nevertheleſs Death reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adam's Tranſgreſſion;</hi> that is, during that ſpace from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> Men ſinned againſt the <hi>natural Law,</hi> and were liable to Death upon that account, though they had not offended againſt an expreſs Revelation from God, as <hi>Adam</hi> had done; for <hi>that</hi> the Apoſtle ſeems to mean, by <hi>ſinning after the Similitude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God hath ſhewn us what is good, by the general Vote and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Mankind. Not that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind do agree concerning Virtue and Vice; but that as to the greater Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Piety, Juſtice, Mercy,</hi> and the like, the Exceptions are but few in compariſon, and not enough to infringe a general Conſent. And of this I ſhall offer to you this threefold Evidence.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:37482:20"/>
1. That theſe Virtues are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praiſed and held in eſteem by Mankind, and the contrary Vices ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reproved and evil ſpoken of. Now to praiſe any thing, is to give Teſtimony to the Goodneſs of it, and to cenſure any thing, is to declare that we believe it to be evil. And if we conſult the Hiſtory of all Ages, we ſhall find that the things which are generally praiſed in the Lives of Men, and recommended to the Imitation of Poſterity are Piety and Devotion, Gratitude and Juſtice, Humanity and Charity; and that the contrary to theſe are marked with Ignominy and Reproach; the former are commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even in Enemies, and the latter are branded even by thoſe who had a kindneſs for the Perſons that were guilty of them. So conſtant hath Mankind always been in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Virtue, and in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Vice. Nay we find not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who are virtuous themſelves, giving their Teſtimony and Applauſe to Virtue, but even thoſe who are vicious; not out of love to Goodneſs,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37482:20"/>
but from the Conviction of their own Minds, and from a ſecret Reverence they bear to the common Conſent and Opinion of Mankind. And this is a great Teſtimony, becauſe it is the Teſtimony of an Enemy extorted by the meer light and force of Truth.</p>
            <p>And on the contrary; Nothing is more ordinary than for <hi>Vice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Sin,</hi> and to hear Men condemn the like, or the ſame things in others, which they allow in themſelves. And this is a clear Evidence, that Vice is generally condemned by Mankind, that many Men condemn it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and thoſe who are ſo kind as to ſpare themſelves, are very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted to ſpie a Fault in any body elſe, and will cenſure a bad Action done by another, with as much Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Impartiality, as the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Man in the World.</p>
            <p>And to this conſent of Mankind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Virtue and Vice, the Scripture frequently appeals. As when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>to provide things honeſt in the ſight of all Men;</hi> and <hi>by well-doing to</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:37482:21"/>
               <hi>put to ſilence the Ignorance of fooliſh Men;</hi> intimating that there are ſome things ſo confeſſedly good, and owned to be ſuch by ſo general a Vote of Mankind, that the worſt of Men have not the Face to open their Mouths againſt them. And it is made the Character of a virtuous Action, if it be <hi>lovely,</hi> and <hi>commendable,</hi> and <hi>of good report. Philip.</hi> 4 8. <hi>Whatſoever things are love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any Virtue, if there be any praiſe, make account of theſe things;</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to us, that Mankind do general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur in the Praiſe and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of what is virtuous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men do generally glory and ſtand upon their Innocency, when they do virtuouſly; but are aſhamed, and out of Countenance, when they do the contrary. Now Glory and Shame are nothing elſe but an Appeal to the Judgment of others concerning the good or evil of our Actions. There are indeed ſome ſuch Monſters as are impudent in their Impieties, but theſe are but few in compariſon. General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mankind is modeſt, the greateſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37482:21"/>
part of thoſe who do evil are apt to bluſh at their own Faults, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them in their Countenance, which is an Acknowledgment that they are not only guilty to themſelves that they have done amiſs, but that they are apprehenſive that others think ſo. For Guilt is a Paſſion reſpecting our ſelves, but Shame regards others. Now it is ſign of Shame, that Men love to conceal their Faults from others, and commit them ſecretly, in the dark and without Witneſſes, and are afraid even of a Child or a Fool: Or if they be diſcovered in them, they are ſolicitous to excuſe and extenuate them, and ready to lay the fault upon any bodyelſe, and to transfer their Guilt, or as much of it as they can, upon others. All which are certain Tokens, that Men are not only naturally guilty to themſelves, when they commit a Fault; but that they are ſenſible alſo what Opinions others have of theſe things.</p>
            <p>And on the contrary, Men are apt to ſtand upon their Juſtification, and to glory when they have done well. The Conſcience of a Man's own Virtue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37482:22"/>
and Integrity, lifts up his Head and gives him Confidence before others, becauſe he is ſatisfied they have a good Opinion of his Actions. What a good Face does a Man naturally ſet upon a good Deed? And how does he ſneak, when he hath done wickedly, being ſenſible that he is condemned by others, as well as by himſelf? No Man is afraid of being upbraided for having dealt honeſtly or kindly with others, nor does account it any Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Reproach, to have it reported of him, that he is a ſober and chaſt Man. No Man bluſheth, when he meets a Man with whom he hath kept his Word, and diſcharged his Truſt: but every Man is apt to do ſo, when he meets one with whom he has dealt diſhoneſtly, or who knows ſome notorious Crime by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Vice is generally forbidden and puniſhed by Humane Laws: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the contrary Virtues there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Law. Some Vices are ſo manifeſtly evil in themſelves, or ſo miſchievous to Humane Society, that the Laws of moſt Nations have taken
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37482:22"/>
care to diſcountenance them by ſevere Penalties. Scarce any Nation was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo barbarous, as not to maintain and vindicate the Honour of their Gods and Religion by publick Laws. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Adultery, Rebellion and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Perjury and breach of Truſt, Fraud and Oppreſſion, are Vices ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely prohibited by the Laws of moſt Nations. A clear Indication, what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the generality of Mankind, and the Wiſdom of Nations have always had of theſe things.</p>
            <p>But now againſt the contrary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues there never was any Law. No Man was ever impeached for <hi>living ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi> A plain Acknowledgment, that Mankind always thought them good, and never were ſenſible of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of them; for had they been ſo, they would have provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by Laws. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice of as a great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Virtues; <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Kindneſs, Fidelity, Meekneſs, Temperance; againſt</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:37482:23"/>
               <hi>ſuch there is no Law;</hi> the greateſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that could be given, that theſe things are unqueſtionably <hi>good</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of Mankind, <hi>againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> As if he had ſaid, turn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſearch thoſe of <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the <hi>twelve Tables</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Laws that have been added ſince; and you ſhall not in any of them find any of thoſe Virtues that I have mentioned, condemned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. A clear Evidence that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind never took any exception againſt them, but are generally agreed about the Goodneſs of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God hath ſhewn us what is good by External Revelation. In former Ages of the World, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his will to particular Perſons in an extraordinary manner, and more eſpecially to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the reſt of the World being in a great meaſure left to the conduct of natural Light. But in theſe later Ages he hath made a publick Revelation of his Will by his Son. And this as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Duty, is the ſame in Subſtance
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37482:23"/>
with the Law of Nature; For our Saviour comprehends all under theſe two general Heads, <hi>the love of God,</hi> and <hi>of our Neighbour.</hi> The Apoſtle redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all to three, <hi>Sobriety, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Piety; The grace of God that brings Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi> So that if we believe the Apoſtle, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel teacheth us the very ſame things which Nature dictated to Men before; only it hath made a more perfect diſcovery of them. So that whatever was doubtful and obſcure before, is now certain and plain; the Duties are ſtill the ſame, only it offers us more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Arguments, and a greater Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the performance of thoſe Duties; ſo that we may now much better ſay, than the Prophet could in his days, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good; and what it is that the Lord requires of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> God ſhews us what is good by the motions of his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37482:24"/>
Spirit upon the Minds of Men. This the Scripture aſſures us of, and good Men have experience more eſpecially of it; though it be hard to give an account of it, and to ſay what moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are from the Spirit of God, and what from our own Minds; for, <hi>as the wind blows where it liſteth, and we hear the ſound of it, but know not whence it comes, nor whither it goes;</hi> ſo are the Operations of the Spirit of God upon the Minds of Men, ſecret and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>three</hi> things I propounded to ſpeak to. All that now remains, is to make ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> from what hath been ſaid, by way of Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Seeing God hath ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided that we ſhould know our Duty, we are altogether inexcuſable, if we do not do it. Becauſe <hi>he hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of thee;</hi> therefore <hi>thou art inexcuſable, O Man, whoſoever thou art,</hi> who liveſt in a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this light. God hath acquainted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37482:24"/>
us with our Duty, by ſuch ways as may moſt effectually both direct and engage us to the practice of it; we are prompted to it by a kind of natural Inſtinct, and ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon our Minds of the difference of good and evil; we are led to the knowledge, and urged to the practice of it, by our Nature, and by our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and by our Intereſt, and by that which is commonly very prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, the general voice and conſent of Mankind; and by the moſt powerful and governing paſſions in Humane Nature, by hope, and by fear, and by ſhame; by the proſpect of advantage, by the apprehenſion of danger, and by the ſenſe of honour; and to take away all poſſible excuſe of ignorance from us, by an expreſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God, the cleareſt and moſt perfect that ever was made to the World. So that when ever we do contrary to our Duty, in any of theſe great Inſtances, we offend againſt all theſe, and do in the higheſt degree fall under the heavy Sentence of our Saviour, <hi>This is the Condemnation, that</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:37482:25"/>
               <hi>light is come into the world, and men lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved darkneſs rather than light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You ſee hence what are the great Duties of Religion, which God mainly requires of us, and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable they are; <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, and <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards Men; the knowledge whereof is planted in our Nature, and grows up with our Reaſon. And theſe are things which are unqueſtionably <hi>good,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which we can have no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; things that were never repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor found fault with by Mankind, neither our Nature nor our Reaſon ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up againſt them, or dictates any thing to the contrary. We have all the Obligation, and we have all the Encouragement to them, and are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure on all hands in the practice of them. In the doing of theſe things, there is no danger to us from the Laws of Men, no fear of diſpleaſure from God, no offence or ſting from our own Minds.</p>
            <p>And theſe things which are ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Nature, and our Reaſon, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37482:25"/>
our Intereſt, are the great things which our Religion requires of us, more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in themſelves, and more acceptable to God, than <hi>whole Burnt-offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ices,</hi> more than <hi>thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl;</hi> more than if we offered to him <hi>all the Beaſts of the Foreſt, and the Cattle upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Hills.</hi> We are not to neglect any Inſtitution of God; but above all, we are to ſecure the obſervance of thoſe great Duties to which we are directed by our very Nature, and tyed by the ſureſt and moſt ſacred of all other Laws, thoſe which God hath riveted in our Souls, and written upon our Hearts. And that Mankind might have no pretence left to excuſe them from theſe, the Chriſtian Religion hath ſet us free from thoſe many poſitive and outward obſervances, that the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Religion was incumbred withall; that we might be wholly intent upon theſe great Duties, and mind nothing in compariſon of the real and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Virtues of a good Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You ſee, in the laſt place, what is the beſt way to appeaſe the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37482:26"/>
diſpleaſure of God towards a ſinful Nation. God ſeems to have as great a Controverſie with us, as he had with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his wrath is of late years moſt viſibly gone out againſt us; and proportionably to the full meaſure of our Sins, it hath been pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon us in full Vials. How have the Judgments of God followed us? And how cloſe have they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another? What fearful Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have our eyes ſeen? enough to make the ears of every one that hears them to tingle. What terrible and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous Wars have we been ingaged in? What a raging Peſtilence did God ſend among us, that ſwept away thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and ten thouſands in our ſtreets? What a dreadful and fatal Fire, that was not to be checked and reſiſted in its courſe, 'till it had laid in Aſhes one of the Greateſt and Richeſt Cities in the World? What unſeaſonable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we had of late? as if for the Wickedneſs of Men upon the Earth, the very <hi>Ordinances of Heaven</hi> were <hi>changed,</hi> and <hi>Summer, and Winter, Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and Harveſt,</hi> had forgotten their <hi>appointed Seaſons.</hi> And, which is more
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37482:26"/>
and ſadder than all this, what danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempts have been made upon our Religion, by the reſtleſs Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of it?</p>
            <p>And now ſurely, <hi>after all this is come upon us for our Sins,</hi> it is time for us to look up to him that ſmites us, and to think of taking up this quarrel. 'Tis time to enquire as they do in the Text, <hi>Werewith ſhall we come before the Lord, and bow our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high God?</hi> And we are apt to take the ſame courſe they did, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to appeaſe God by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Devotion. We have now beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our ſelves to Prayer and Faſting, and 'twas very fit, nay neceſſary we ſhould do ſo; but let us not think this is all God expects from us. Theſe are but the <hi>Means</hi> to a further <hi>End,</hi> to oblige us for the future to the practice of a good Life. The outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion is not loſt amongſt us, there appears ſtill in Men a great and commendable zeal for the Reformed Religion, and there hath been too much occaſion for it; but that which God chiefly expects from us, is Reformed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37482:27"/>
Lives. Piety and Virtue are in a great meaſure gone from among us, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Men are ſtrangely corrupted, <hi>the great and weighty things of the Law</hi> are neglected, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity, Truth</hi> and <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> ſo that we may take up <hi>David</hi>'s Complaint, <hi>Help Lord! for the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man ceaſeth, for the faithful fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And 'till the Nation be brought back to a ſober ſenſe of Religion, from an airy and phantaſtical Piety, to real and unaffected Devotion, and from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious contention about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to the ſerious practice of what is neceſſary; from our violent heats and animoſities, to a more peaceable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and by a mutual condeſcenſion on all ſides, to a nearer and ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>onger union among our ſelves; 'till we recover in ſome meaſure, our ancient Virtue and Integrity of manners, we have reaſon to fear, that God will ſtill have a Controverſie with us, notwithſtanding all our noiſe and zeal about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>This is the true, this is the only courſe to appeaſe the indignation of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37482:27"/>
God, and to draw down his Favour and Bleſſing upon a poor diſtracted and gaſping Nation. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have but one word more, and that is to put you preſently upon the practice of one of theſe Duties that I have been perſwading you to, and that is <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Alms to the Poor.</hi> If what I have already ſaid, have had its effect upon you, I need not uſe any other Arguments; if it have not, I have hardly the heart to uſe any. I ſhall only put you in mind again, that God values this above all our external Devotion, <hi>he will have mercy rather than ſacrifice;</hi> that this is the way to find mercy with God, and to have our Prayers ſpeed in Heaven; and without this, all our Faſting and Humiliation ſignifies nothing. And to this purpoſe I will only read to you thoſe plain and perſwaſive words of the Prophet, which do ſo fully declare unto us the whole Duty of this Day, and particularly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37482:28"/>
urge us to this of Charity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen? a day for a Man to afflict his Soul?

Is not this the Faſt that I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the Poor that are caſt out to thy houſe? when thou ſeeſt the Naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own Fleſh? Then ſhall thy light break forth as the Morning, and thy Salvation ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily, and thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall go before thee, and the Glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rereward. Then thou ſhalt call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, here I am.</hi>

            <p>ONE of the moſt ſucceſsful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that have been made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion, by the Devil and his Inſtruments, hath been by ſetting the Laws of God at variance with themſelves, and by daſhing the ſeveral parts of Religion, and the two Tables of the Law againſt one another, to break all in pieces; and under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of advancing that part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which is <hi>Inſtituted</hi> and <hi>Revealed,</hi> to undermine and deſtroy that which is <hi>Natural,</hi> and of primary obligation.</p>

               </gap>eſe <hi>two</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Natural</hi> Religion is the foundation of all <hi>Inſtituted</hi> and <hi>Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That no <hi>Revealed</hi> or <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Religion was ever deſigned to take away the obligation of <hi>Natural</hi> Duties, but to confirm and eſtabliſh them.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe, I have choſen theſe words of our Saviour for the foundation of my following Diſcourſe; <hi>But go ye and learn, what that meaneth; I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi> The occaſion of which words was briefly this; The <hi>Phariſees</hi> found fault with him for keeping Company, and eating with <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi> He owns the thing which they objected to him, and endeavours to vindicate himſelf
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37482:29"/>
from any crime ot fault in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that, theſe two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By telling them, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to a Phyſician, and proper for his Office and Profeſſion, to converſe with the ſick, in order to their Cure and Recovery. He may abſtain, if he pleaſeth, from the converſation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but the ſick have need of him, and are his proper Care, and his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Employment lies among them; <hi>he ſaid unto them, they that be whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick; I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance;</hi> they who were already good, needed not to be call'd upon to amend and reform their lives; and they that were ſo conceited of their own Righteouſneſs, as the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> were, and ſo confident that they were ſound and whole, would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Phyſician, and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves incapable of Cure; and therefore he did not apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them; but to the Publicans and Sinners, who were acknowledged on all hands, both by themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be bad Men; ſo that it could
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37482:30"/>
not be denyed to be the proper work of a Spiritual Phyſician to converſe with ſuch Perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By endeavouring to convince them of their Ignorance of the true nature of Religion, and of the Rank and Order of the ſeveral Duties thereby required; <hi>but go ye and learn what that meaneth; I will have mercy and not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> which Saying is quoted by him, out of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> chap. 6. 6. <hi>I deſired mercy, and not ſacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> which Text our Saviour cites and applies upon two ſeveral Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the conſidering and comparing of which, will give full Light to the true meaning of it.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is here in the Text, upon occaſion of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> finding Fault with him, for converſing with <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> and <hi>Sinners;</hi> the other is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 7. where the <hi>Phariſees</hi> blaming the Diſciples of our Saviour for plucking the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath day, our Saviour tells them, <hi>if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:37482:30"/>
               <hi>Mercy and not Sacrifice, ye would not have comdemned the guiltleſs;</hi> that is, if they had underſtood the true Nature of Religion, and what Duties of it are chiefly and in the firſt place to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, they would not have been ſo forward to cenſure this Action of his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>So that the plain meaning of this Saying is this, that in comparing the parts of Religion and the Obligation of Duties together, thoſe Duties which are of <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> Obligation are moſt valued by God, and ought to take place of thoſe which are <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>ritual. I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> that is, <hi>rather than Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> according to the true meaning of this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phraſe, which is to be underſtood in a comparitive Senſe, as is evident from the Text it ſelf in <hi>Hoſea, I deſired mercy, and not ſacrifice; and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings;</hi> if they cannot be obſerved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, let <hi>Sacrifice</hi> be neglected, and the work of <hi>Mercy</hi> be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:37482:31"/>
And the Reaſon of this ſeems very plain; becauſe <hi>ſhewing Mercy,</hi> or <hi>doing Good</hi> in any kind is a prime Inſtance of thoſe <hi>moral</hi> Duties, which do <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> and <hi>perpetually</hi> oblige; but <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> is an inſtance of <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>ritual</hi> Obſervances, and one of the chief of the kind; ſo that when <hi>moral</hi> Duties, and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Obſervances come in Competition, and do claſh with one another, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a <hi>Rite,</hi> or <hi>poſitive Inſtitution,</hi> is to give way to a <hi>moral</hi> Duty; and it is no Sin in that caſe to neglect the Obſervation of ſuch a <hi>Rite,</hi> yea though it were commanded and appointed by God himſelf. And though this may ſeem to be a breach of the <hi>letter</hi> of the Law; yet it is according to the true <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of the Law; it being a tacit condition implyed in all Laws of a <hi>ritual</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> Nature, <hi>provided the obſervance of them be not to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance and prejudice of any Duty, which is of a higher and better nature;</hi> in that caſe the Obligation of it does for that time give way and is ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>And this will appear to be the true meaning of this Rule, by comparing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37482:31"/>
more particularly the Inſtances to which our Saviour applies it. His Diſciples paſſing through the Corn on the Sabbath Day, and being hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, pluckt the Ears and did eat; this our Saviour does juſtifie to be no Breach of the Law of the Sabbath; becauſe in that caſe, and in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it did not oblige: for the Diſciples being call'd to attend upon our Saviour, to be inſtructed by him in the things which concerned the Kingdom of God, that is, in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, which they were to publiſh to the World, this Attendance hindred them from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary Proviſions againſt the Sabbath, they, in obedience to their Maſter, being intent upon a better Work; but that they might not ſtarve, the neceſſities of Nature muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; and therefore it was fit, that the Law of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which was but <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>ritual,</hi> ſhould give way to an act of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have Mercy and not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:37482:32"/>
And the reaſon is the ſame as to any <hi>inſtrumental</hi> part of Religion, by which I mean any thing which may be a <hi>means</hi> to promote Piety and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as Prayer, hearing the Word of God, keeping good Company, and avoiding bad; the Duties of this kind, our Saviour here in the Text (where he likewiſe applies this Rule) compares with <hi>moral</hi> Duties. To avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of vicious and wicked Perſons, is a good means to preſerve men from the contagion of their Vices, and was always eſteemed a Duty among pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men, both Jews and Heathens, and is in no wiſe diſallowed by our Saviour: but yet not ſo a Duty, as to hinder a greater Duty, nor ſo ſtrictly and perverſely to be inſiſted upon, as if one ought not to converſe with bad Men in any Caſe, or upon any Account, no not for ſo great and good an end as to reclaim them from their Vices. In this Caſe we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that our firſt and higheſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is to <hi>moral</hi> Duties, comprehended under <hi>the love of God and our Neighbour;</hi> among which one of the chief is to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37482:32"/>
do good to Men, and to ſhew Mercy and Pity to thoſe that are in Miſery; and the greateſt good that one Man can do to another, is to be inſtrumental to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him from the Evil and Error of his Way; becauſe this is <hi>to ſave his ſoul from death;</hi> and we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God ever intended, by any Rule of <hi>prudence,</hi> or <hi>poſitive</hi> Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jewiſh Law, ſo to forbid their accompaning with bad and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Men, that it ſhould be unlawful to converſe with them in order to their Recovery and Amendment; <hi>Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of the ſame mind in the Precepts he gives concerning avoiding the Company of ſcandalous Chriſtians, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>and if any man obey not our word by this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, note that man, and have no Company with him, that he may be aſhamed; yet count him not as an enemy, but admoniſh him as a brother.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> qualifies his Precept, leſt Chriſtians ſhould miſtake it, and fall into the Jewiſh extream, not to converſe with thoſe whom they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37482:33"/>
eſteemed ſcandalous and wicked upon any account whatſoever, no not in order to their Amendment and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The Bond of Intimacy and Friendſhip with bad Men ought to be broken; and yet the Bond of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Humanity may be as ſtrong as ever. It is one thing to diſcountenance bad Men, to bring them to Shame, and a Senſe of their Fault; and quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to abandon them to Ruin; and even in caſe of notorious Hereſie, or wickedneſs of Life, it is one thing to cut them off from the Society and Communion of Chriſtians; and quite another, to cut them off from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, to cut their Throats, and to extirpate them out of the World.</p>
            <p>And yet the matter was carried thus far by the furious Zeal of the Jews, when Chriſtianity firſt appeared in the World; they thought that no Mercy in ſuch Caſes was the beſt Service that could be done, and the beſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that could be offered to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God; and this Pattern hath been ſince, not only cloſely followed, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37482:33"/>
out-done by the Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as we have too much Reaſon to remember upon <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>this</hi> day.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in the farther expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Text, the meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in ſhort is this; that the <hi>ritual</hi> and <hi>inſtrumental</hi> parts of Religion, and all Laws and Duties concerning them, are of leſs Value and Eſteem with God, than thoſe which are of a <hi>moral</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially the great Duties and Offices of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> of <hi>the love of God,</hi> and <hi>of our Neighbour.</hi> And if we conſider the matter well, we ſhall ſee the Reaſon of it to be very plain; becauſe <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are approved of God for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and for their own ſake, upon account of their own <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical</hi> Goodneſs; but the <hi>ritual</hi> and <hi>inſtrumental</hi> parts of Religion, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to God in order to theſe, and ſo far as they tend to beget and promote them in us; they are not <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> good in themſelves, but are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> by God for the ſake of the other; and therefore great
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37482:34"/>
Reaſon there is that they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, and give way to them, when they come in competition with one another.</p>
            <p>For this is a known Rule, which takes place in all Laws, <hi>that Laws of leſs importance ſhould give way to thoſe that are of greater; quoties Leges ex circumſtanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <q>When ever two Laws happen to be in ſuch circumſtances as to claſh with one another, ſo that both of them cannot be obſerved, that Law which is better and of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is to be kept.</q> And <hi>Tully</hi> gives much the ſame Rule in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <q>In comparing of Laws (ſays he) we are to conſider which Law is moſt uſeful, and juſt, and reaſonable to be obſerved.</q> From whence it will follow, that when two Laws, or more, or how many ſoever they be, cannot be obſerved, becauſe they claſh with one another; <hi>ea maxime conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanda putetur, quae ad maximas res pertinere videatur.</hi> 
               <q>It is reaſonable that that Law ſhould be obſerved,

which is of greateſt Moment and Concernment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid, we may learn what is the meaning of this Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which our Saviour more than once cites out of the Prophet, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, I ſhall take occaſion to proſecute the <hi>two</hi> Propoſitions which I mentioned before; namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Natural</hi> Religion is the Foundation of <hi>Inſtituted</hi> and <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That no <hi>Inſtituted</hi> Religion was ever deſigned to take away the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of <hi>Natural</hi> Duties; but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to eſtabliſh and confirm them. And both theſe are ſufficiently ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reaſon of our Saviour's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from this Rule, <hi>I will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and not Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That <hi>Natural</hi> Religion is the Foundation of <hi>Inſtituted</hi> and <hi>Revealed</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:37482:35"/>
Religion, and all <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion does ſuppoſe, and take for granted, the clear and undoubted Principles and Precepts of <hi>Natural</hi> Religion, and builds upon them. By <hi>Natural</hi> Religion, I mean obedience to the <hi>Natural Law,</hi> and the performance of ſuch duties as <hi>Natural Light,</hi> without any <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural Revelation,</hi> doth dictate to Men. Theſe lye at the bottom of all Religion, and are the Great and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Duties which God requires of all Mankind; as, that we ſhould love God, and behave our ſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently towards him; that we ſhould believe his Revelations; and teſtifie our dependance upon him, by imploring his aid and direction in all our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and diſtreſſes; and acknowledge our obligations to him for all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Benefits which we receive; that we ſhould moderate our Appetites, in reference to the Pleaſures and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this World, and uſe them temperately and chaſtly; that we ſhould be juſt and upright in all our Dealings with one another; true to our word, and faithful to our truſt; and in all our words and actions obſerve
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37482:35"/>
that Equity towards others, which we deſire they ſhould uſe towards us; that we ſhould be kind, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, merciful, and compaſſionate one towards another; ready to do good to all, and apt not only to pity, but to relieve them in their miſery and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Theſe, and ſuch like, are thoſe which we call <hi>Moral</hi> Duties; and they are of <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>perpetual</hi> obligation, becauſe they do <hi>naturally</hi> oblige, without any <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revelation</hi> from God. And theſe are the Foundation of <hi>Revealed</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted</hi> Religion, and all <hi>Revealed</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does ſuppoſe them, and build upon them; for all <hi>Revelation</hi> from God, ſuppoſeth us to be <hi>Men,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters nothing of thoſe Duties to which we were <hi>naturally obliged</hi> before. And this will clearly appear, if we conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> things;</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That no <hi>Inſtituted</hi> Service of God, no <hi>poſitive</hi> part of Religion, was ever acceptable to him, when theſe were neglected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the great Deſign of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, was to reſtore and reinforce the practice of the <hi>natural</hi> Law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Scripture every where ſpeaks of theſe as the main and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Duties of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. When our Saviour was ask'd, <hi>which was the firſt and great Commandment of the Law;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength; and thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> One would have expected he would have given quite another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and have pitched upon ſome of thoſe things which were ſo much magnified among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which they laid ſo much weight upon; that he ſhould have inſtanced in <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or the Law of the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> but he overlooks all theſe as inconſiderable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37482:36"/>
in compariſion, and inſtances only in thoſe two great heads of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duty, <hi>the love of God, and our Neighbour;</hi> which are of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>perpetual</hi> obligation, and comprehend under them all other <hi>Moral</hi> Duties.</p>

               <hi>And theſe are thoſe which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour calls</hi> the Law and the Prophets, <hi>and which he ſays</hi> he came not to deſtroy, but to fulfill, <hi>Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19, 20.</hi> Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets. I am not come to deſtroy; but to fulfill: for verily I ſay unto you, 'till Heaven and Earth paſs, one jot or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, 'till all be fulfilled. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be call'd the leaſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; but whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. For I ſay unto you, that except your Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:37482:37"/>
That our Saviour doth not here ſpeak of the <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of the Duties of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, will, I think, be very plain, from theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> Laws of the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and did ſo, not long after; but this Law, which our Saviour ſpeaks of, was to be <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>immutable;</hi> for he tells us, <hi>that Heaven and Earth ſhould paſs away, but one jot or one title of</hi> this <hi>Law ſhould not paſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The obſervation of the Law our Saviour ſpeaks of, conſiſted in ſuch things as the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees neglected; for he tells his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, upon this occaſion, <hi>that except their righteouſneſs did exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, they ſhould in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But now the Scribes and Phariſees were the moſt accurate and punctual People in the World, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Precepts of the <hi>Judicial</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law; they were ſo far from taking away any thing from theſe obſervances,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37482:37"/>
that they had added to them, and enlarged them, by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Traditions of their own; ſo exact were they, that they would <hi>pay tithe of mint, and aniſe, and cummin,</hi> as our Saviour obſerves; but then they were extreamly defective in <hi>Moral</hi> Duties; they were unnatural to their Parents, and would pretend that their Eſtates were conſecrated to God, that under this pretence of <hi>poſitive</hi> Religion, they might excuſe themſelves from a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Duty, and let their Parents ſtarve for God's ſake; they were Covetous, and Unjuſt, and <hi>devoured Widows houſes;</hi> in a word, our Saviour tells us, they neglected <hi>the weightier Matters of the Law, Mercy, Judgment, and the love of God, and keeping faith with Men;</hi> ſo that it is in theſe things, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our means, that <hi>our righteouſneſs muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, viz.</hi> in the practice of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, which were neglected by them; and conſequently 'tis the <hi>Moral</hi> Law which our Saviour came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:37482:38"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we conſider the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which our Saviour gives in his following diſcourſe, by which we may beſt judge what he means. He inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Murder,</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which are undoubtedly forbidden by the <hi>natural</hi> Law; and then he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in ſeveral Permiſſions which were indulged to them for the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts, but yet did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the Dictates of right Reaſon, and the firſt and original Conſtitution of things; as the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Divorce</hi> upon every ſlight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and of <hi>Revenge,</hi> and <hi>Retaliation of Injuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If we conſider, that by <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> our Saviour means that which was principally deſigned and ultimately intended by them; which was the Obſervation of <hi>moral</hi> Duties; which as they were written in the two Tables by the immediate Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God himſelf, ſo are chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated by the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. And ſo we find this Phraſe of <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> elſewhere uſed by our Saviour,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37482:38"/>
when he mentions that great Rule of Equity, that <hi>we ſhould do to others as we would have them do to us.</hi> Matth. 7. 12. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> But how was <hi>this the Law and the Prophets,</hi> when this Rule was never ſo much as mentioned in either? Our Saviour means, that this is the Foundation of all thoſe Duties of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> which are ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in <hi>the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that our Saviour makes the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>moral</hi> Duties to be the principal Deſign of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, and as it were the Foundation of it; and therefore he calls <hi>moral</hi> Duties, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the weightier matters of the Law,</hi> Matth. 23. 23. <hi>But ye</hi> (ſays he to the Scribes and Phariſees) <hi>have neglected the weightier things of the Law, judgment, and mercy, and fidelity.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees buſied themſelves chiefly about <hi>ritual</hi> Obſervances; but our Saviour tells them, that <hi>thoſe other</hi> were the moſt conſiderable and important
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37482:39"/>
Duties of the Law, and lay at the bottom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. And much the ſame enumeration the Prophet makes, where he compares <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> and theſe <hi>moral</hi> Duties together, Mic. 6. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Wherewith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with Calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or with ten thouſands of rivers of Oyl? Shall I give my firſt born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul? He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> He had required <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> but had no regard to them in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with theſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II. No</hi> Inſtituted <hi>Service of God, no</hi> poſitive <hi>part of Religion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was ever acceptable to God, when</hi> moral <hi>Duties were neglected; nay, ſo far from being acceptable to him, that he rejects them with Diſdain and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. To this purpoſe there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable Paſſages in the Prophets.</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:37482:39"/>
Iſa. <hi>1. 11.</hi> &amp;c. To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me? When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hands, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations; incenſe is an Abomination to me; the new moons and ſabbaths, the calling of aſſemblies, I cannot away with; it is Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, even the ſolemn meeting, and when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; when ye make many prayers I will not hear. <hi>What is the reaſon of all this? Becauſe they were defective in the</hi> moral <hi>Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſo it follows;</hi> your hands are full of Blood, waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well; ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead for the Widow; come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; <hi>implying that till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to</hi> moral <hi>Duties, all their</hi> external <hi>Worſhip and</hi> Sacrifices <hi>ſignified nothing. And ſo likewiſe,</hi> Iſa. <hi>66. 3. He tells them that nothing could be more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than their</hi> Sacrifices, <hi>ſo long as they allowed themſelves in wicked Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> He that killeth an Ox is as if he ſlew

Throughly amend your ways and your doings, throughly execute Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man and his neighbour; oppreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot the ſtranger, the fatherleſs and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſhed not innocent blood. <hi>If they did not practiſe</hi> theſe <hi>Duties, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear</hi> thoſe <hi>Sins, all the reverence for the</hi> temple <hi>and the</hi> worſhip of God <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nothing. You ſee in the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion what it was that was acceptable to God for it ſelf and its own ſake,</hi> viz. <hi>the practice of</hi> moral <hi>Duties; and that all</hi> Inſtituted <hi>Religion, that did not promote and further</hi> theſe, <hi>or was deſtitute of them, was abominable to God. And under the Goſpel our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our prefers a</hi> moral <hi>Duty before any</hi> gift <hi>we can offer to God, and will have</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:37482:40"/>
               <hi>it to take place,</hi> Mat. <hi>5. 23, 24.</hi> If thou bring thy gift unto the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</p>
            <p>But it ſhould ſeem by this, and what ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h been ſaid before, that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs to Men, before his own Worſhip; and obedience to the Precepts of the <hi>Second</hi> Table, before obedience to thoſe of the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this does but <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo; all that can be collected from this paſſage of our Saviour, or any thing that hath been already ſaid, are only theſe <hi>two</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God prefers the practice of the <hi>Moral</hi> Duties of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, before any <hi>inſtituted</hi> Worſhip, ſuch as <hi>Sacrif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37482:41"/>
concern the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if we neglect the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Table, of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> towards Men, God will not accept of our obedience to the Precepts of the <hi>firſt,</hi> nor of any act of <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> that we can perform. This our Saviour means, when he ſays, <hi>leave there thy gift before the Altar, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, then come and offer thy gift;</hi> intimating, that ſo long as we bear a revengeful mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Brethren, God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that we can offer to him; or indeed of any act of <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> that we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The great Deſign of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion is to reſtore and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the practice of the <hi>natural</hi> Law, or which is all one, of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties; and therefore our Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his firſt Sermon, by promiſing <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> to the practice of <hi>theſe</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; of <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Peaceableneſs,</hi> and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37482:41"/>
               <hi>Mercifulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to the will of God under Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and Sufferings for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake; and tells us (as I ſhew'd before) that he came not to releaſe Men from the practice of <hi>theſe</hi> Duties, but to oblige them thereto more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; and that as theſe were <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> that is, the main Duties and the Foundation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, ſo were they much more to be ſo of the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> This the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the New Teſtament do every where declare to be the great deſign of the Goſpel, and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to inſtruct us in theſe Duties, and to engage us effectually to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them.

               <hi>The grace of God</hi> (which is in and by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel) <hi>hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldy luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent world.</hi> And herein St. <hi>James</hi> tell us, the true nature, and the force and vertue of the Chriſtian Religion doth conſiſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>pure Religion, and undefiled before God and the Father is</hi>

                  </gap>ffliction, and to keep our ſelves unſpotted from the World.</hi> And Chap. 3. 17. <hi>The wiſdom which is from above</hi> (that is, that Heavenly and Divine Knowledge revealed to us by the Goſpel) hath theſe Properties, and is apt to produce theſe effects; <hi>it is firſt pure, and then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy, and of good fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the planting of theſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in us is that which the Scripture calls</hi> the new Creature, <hi>and</hi> the Image of God, Eph. <hi>4. 20, &amp;c. The Apoſtle ſpeaking there of the Vices and Luſts wherein the Gentiles lived, tells Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that</hi> they <hi>were otherwiſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Goſpel;</hi> but ye have not ſo learned Chriſt, if ſo be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus, that ye put off concerning the former converſation the old man which is cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37482:42"/>
holineſs, <hi>or, (as the words perhaps may better be rendred)</hi> in the holineſs of truth; <hi>for it immediately follows,</hi> wherefore putting away lying, ſpeak every man truth with his Neighbour.</p>
            <p>And this is that which the Apoſtle elſewhere makes to be <hi>all in all</hi> in the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion; but a new Creature, Gal.</hi> 6. 15. which the Apoſtle in the Chapter before expreſſeth thus; <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh</hi> (or is inſpired) <hi>by Charity.</hi> And yet more expreſly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion is nothing; but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi> By the comparing of which Texts, it appears, that the main thing in Chriſtianity, is the practice of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, and this is <hi>the new Creature,</hi> and this the proper effect of the Chriſtian Faith to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe Virtues in us. And indeed, the great Deſign of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and every thing in it, of the love of God in giving his Son to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37482:43"/>
die for us, of the pardon of our Sins, and juſtification in his blood, of all the Promiſes and Threatnings of the Goſpel, and of the aſſiſtance therein promiſed, is to engage, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and enable to the practice of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Duties.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I propoſed to ſpeak to, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Natural</hi> Religion is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Inſtituted</hi> and <hi>Revealed</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and all <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion does ſuppoſe it, and builds upon it. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> Namely, That no <hi>Revealed</hi> and <hi>Inſtituted</hi> Religion was ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to take away the obligation of <hi>Natural</hi> Duties, but was intended to confirm and eſtabliſh them. And this alſo will be evident, if we conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion calls Men to the practice of <hi>Natural</hi> Duties. Thus the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion did. The firſt Laws which God gave them, and which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37482:43"/>
by writing them in Tables of Stone with his own Finger, were the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law. And the great buſineſs of the Prophets whom God raiſed up among them from time to time, was to reprove not ſo much their defects in their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and in the Duties of <hi>Inſtituted</hi> Worſhip, as the breach of the <hi>natural</hi> Law by their Vices and Immoralities; and to threaten them with the Judgments of God, if they did not reform and amend theſe faults.</p>
            <p>And now under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of it is almoſt wholly made up of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, namely, thoſe which are comprehended under thoſe <hi>two</hi> great Commandments, of <hi>the love of God, and our Neighbour.</hi> In the Chriſtian Religion there is very little that is meerly <hi>Poſitive</hi> and <hi>Inſtituted,</hi> beſides <hi>the two Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>praying to God in the Name and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The moſt prefect Revelation that ever God made to Mankind (I mean that of the Chriſtian Religion) doth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37482:44"/>
furniſh us with the beſt helps and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for the performance of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties; it diſcovers our Duty more clearly to us; it offers us the greateſt aſſiſtance to enable us to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; it preſents us with the moſt powerful Motives and Arguments to engage us thereto; ſo that this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Goſpel is ſo far from weakning the obligation of <hi>natural</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it confirms and ſtrengthens it, and urgeth us more forcibly to the practice of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>poſitive</hi> Rites and Inſtitutions of <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion are ſo far from entrenching upon the Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> that they were always deſigned to be ſubordinate and ſubſervient to them; and when ever they come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, it is the declared will of God, that <hi>poſitive Inſtitutions</hi> ſhould give way to <hi>natural Duties;</hi> and this I have ſhewn to be plainly the meaning of this Saying in the Text, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi> If Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be ſuch, that one part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt give place, God will have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37482:44"/>
the <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Inſtituted</hi> part to give way to that which is <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is very frequent in Scripture, when the Duties of</hi> Natural <hi>Religion, and Rites of Divine</hi> Inſtitution <hi>come in competition, to ſlight and diſparage</hi> theſe <hi>in compariſon of</hi> Moral <hi>Duties, and to ſpeak of them as things which God hath no pleaſure in, and which in compariſon of the other he will hardly own that he hath commanded.</hi> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hands? <hi>Iſa. 1. 12.</hi> Thou deſireſt not Sacrifice, thou delighteſt not in Burnt-Offerings, <hi>Pſal. 51. 16.</hi> Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl? He hath ſhewn thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy?</p>
            <p>But God no where makes any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to the diſadvantage of <hi>Natural</hi> Duties; he never derogated from <hi>them</hi> in any Caſe; he never ſaid <hi>he would have ſuch a thing, and not mercy,</hi> or <hi>that he had rather ſuch a Rite of Religion</hi>

               <hi>ſhould be performed, than that men ſhould do the greateſt good, and ſhew the greateſt Charity to one another.</hi> It is no where made a queſtion, <hi>will the Lord be pleaſed that we deal juſtly every Man with his Neighbour, and ſpeak the truth one to another? that we be kind and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted, and ready to forgive? that we be willing to diſtribute and give Alms to thoſe that are in need?</hi> there is no ſuch queſtion as this put in Scripture; nay it is poſitive in theſe Matters, that <hi>with ſuch Sacrifices God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> I inſtance in this Vertue more eſpecially of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> becauſe it is one of the prime inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties; as <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is put for all the <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Inſtituted</hi> part of Religion; and this diſpoſition of Mind our Saviour makes the root of all <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Duties; <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it as the great End and Scope of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; The end of the Commandment is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And this temper and diſpoſition of Mind he advanceth above <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope; The greateſt of theſe is Charity;</hi> and without <hi>this,</hi> he will not allow a Man to be any

thing in Chriſtianity; <hi>this</hi> he makes our higheſt perfection and attainment, and that which abides and remains in the future ſtate; <hi>Charity never fails.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> our Saviour moſt effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to us, both in his Doctrine, and by his Example; this he preſſeth as the peculiar Law of his Religion, and the proper Mark and Character of a Diſciple. <hi>This</hi> he requires us to exerciſe towards thoſe who practice the contrary towards us; <hi>to love our Enemies, and to do good to them that hate us.</hi> And of <hi>this,</hi> he hath given us the greateſt Example that ever was; <hi>when we were Enemies to him,</hi> he loved us ſo as hardly ever any Man did his <hi>Friend,</hi> ſo as <hi>to lay down his Life for us;</hi> and he Inſtituted the Sacrament for a Memorial of his love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to put us in mind how we ought to love one another.</p>
            <p>And now the Application of what hath been ſaid upon this Argument, to the occaſion of <hi>this</hi> Day, is very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and there are <hi>two</hi> very natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:37482:46"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From what hath been ſaid upon this Argument, it plainly appears what place <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Duties ought to have in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and of all <hi>Natural</hi> Duties, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs. This</hi> is ſo primary a Duty of Humane Nature, ſo great and conſiderable a part of Religion, that all <hi>poſitive Inſtitutions</hi> muſt give way to it, and nothing of that kind can cancel the obligation of it, nor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the violation of this great and <hi>Natural</hi> Law. Our Bleſſed Saviour in his Religion hath declared nothing to the prejudice of it; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hath heightned our obligation to it, as much as is poſſible, by telling us that <hi>the Son of Man came not to deſtroy Mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>they know not what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Spirit they are of,</hi> who will <hi>kill Men to do God ſervice;</hi> and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Cauſe and Religion in the World, will break through all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Civil Society,</hi> and diſturb the Peace and Happineſs of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:37482:46"/>
Nor did our Saviour by any thing in his Religion deſign to releaſe Men from the obligation of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Duties. He had (as one would imagine) as much Power as the <hi>Pope;</hi> but yet he depoſed none of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this World, nor did Abſolve their Subjects from their Fidelity and Obedience to them, for their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Religion; he aſſumed no ſuch Power to himſelf (no not in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad Spiritualia)</hi> nor, that ever we read of, did he give it to any other. Whence then comes his <hi>pretended Vicar</hi> to have this Authority? And yet the horrid attempt of <hi>this</hi> Day was firſt deſigned, and afterwards carried on, in proſecution of the Popes <hi>Bull</hi> of Excommunication, and was not ſo much the effect of the deſpair and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of that Party here in <hi>England,</hi> as the Natural Conſequence of their Doctrines of <hi>Extirpating Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Depoſing Kings,</hi> and <hi>Abſolving Subjects from their Allegiance to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Zeal for any <hi>poſitive</hi> Inſtitution in Religion, can juſtifie the Violation
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37482:47"/>
of the <hi>natural</hi> Law, the Precepts whereof are of <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Obligation. The <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy</hi> is not ſo clear, as the Duty of <hi>Obedience to civil Government;</hi> nor is <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> ſo plainly revealed in Scripture, as it is both in Nature and Scripture, that we ſhould <hi>do no murder.</hi> And yet how many thouſands have been put to Death, becauſe they could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>this hardword,</hi> and believe <hi>this impoſſible thing!</hi> And yet if <hi>the ſupremacy of the Pope</hi> were clearly of Divine Right, and the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as plain as the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; yet theſe being but <hi>poſitive</hi> matters in Religion, there would be no reaſon to <hi>kill men</hi> for not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing theſe things; nay it would be contrary to Religion to do it; becauſe the Law of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> which is the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ought not to be violated for the promoting of any <hi>poſitive inſtitution;</hi> and God hath plainly ſaid, that <hi>he will have mercy rather than Sacrifice;</hi> yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>the Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> if it were what they pretend it is, <hi>the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the natural body and bloo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. What hath been ſaid gives us a right Notion and Character of that Church and Religion, which prefers the <hi>poſitive</hi> Rites and <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the obſervance of them, to thoſe Duties which are of <hi>natural</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>It is too plain to be denyed, that the Principles and Precepts of <hi>natural</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were never ſo effectually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and the <hi>Morality</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion never ſo intolerably corrupted and debauched, by any thing that ever yet had the face of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World, as by the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this out of a blind and furious Zeal for ſome Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Doctrines and Rites of the Chriſtian Religion, which at the beſt are of meer <hi>poſitive Inſtitution,</hi> and of the ſame rank among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion.

            </p>
            <p>Here was a <hi>prodigious Sacrifice</hi> indeed; but where was <hi>Mercy?</hi> the thing God chiefly deſires, and which above all other things is acceptable to him; no <hi>Mercy,</hi> not even to thoſe of their own Religion, whom theſe <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>tender Caſuiſts,</hi> after a ſolemn debate of the Caſe, had reſolved to involve in the ſame common Deſtruction with the reſt; rather <hi>no mercy,</hi> than that <hi>this Sacrifice</hi>which their <hi>mad zeal</hi> had promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to, ſhould be omitted.</p>

            <p>Our Saviour in this Sermon, (which contains the Sum and Subſtance of his Religion) doth earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to his Diſciples and Followers, and ſtrictly enjoyns the perfect Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Goodneſs and Virtue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to them, that he came to bring in and eſtabliſh that Righteouſneſs, which the Jewiſh Religion indeed aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but through the Weakneſs and Imperfection of that Diſpenſation, was not able to effect and accompliſh. And to take away all ſuſpicion of a Deſign, to contradict the former Revelations of God, made to the Jews by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> or to deſtroy their Divine

the meaning of our Saviour's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is this, that he was not come to <hi>diſſolve,</hi> and <hi>abrogate,</hi> and <hi>make void</hi> the Law, or to encourage Men to the breach of it; that the Precepts of his Religion were in no wiſe contrary to thoſe of the Law and the Prophets, did not thwart and oppoſe them, or any ways contradict the main deſign and intention of <hi>the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> that is, of <hi>the Jewiſh Religion;</hi> for ſo <hi>the Law and the Prophets</hi> do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſignifie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>therefore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets;</hi> that is, this is the main ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of what <hi>your Religion,</hi> contained <hi>in the Law and the Prophets,</hi> teacheth, concerning your Duty to one another.

to perfect and accompliſh it; to ſupply all the defects and weakneſſes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of that diſpenſation; this is the plain meaning of this caution and declaration of our Saviours; <hi>Think not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Deſign of our Saviour's Doctrine and Religion, is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thoſe former Revelations, which God made to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; this will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, whether we conſider the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and Predictions of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or the Laws and Precepts therein contained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Propheſies and Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Old Teſtament; our Saviour came not <hi>to contradict</hi> and <hi>overthrow</hi> theſe; but <hi>to fulfill</hi> them. The chief Predictions of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and his Spiritual Kingdom. In the Law it was foretold, <hi>that God would raiſe to them a Prophet like unto Moſes, whom they ought to hear and obey; and to him all the Prophets of the Old Teſtament</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:37482:52"/>
               <hi>gave witneſs,</hi> foretelling the time of his coming, his extraction, the manner and circumſtances of his Birth, the Purity and Efficacy of his Doctrine, the Actions and Miracles of his Life, his Paſſion, Death, and Burial, with the particular Circumſtances of them, his Reſurrection from the Dead, and his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and Exaltation at the right hand of God; ſo that this part of <hi>the Law and Prophets</hi> he did <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh</hi> and <hi>fulfill</hi> in a moſt eminent and remarkable manner; all things that the Prophets had foretold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſias, were punctually made good in the Perſon, and Actions, and Sufferings of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Laws and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Jewiſh Religion, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the Laws of Chriſtianity did not claſh with them, nor proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>abrogate</hi> them, and <hi>make them void,</hi> eſpecially as to the <hi>Moral</hi> Precepts, which were the very Life and Spirit, the ultimate Scope and Deſign of that Religion; nay, ſo far was it from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, that the main and proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Chriſtianity, was to <hi>clear</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:37482:52"/>
and <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> that, which was the main deſign of <hi>the Law and Prophets, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Law</hi> in this part, and to <hi>raiſe</hi> and <hi>advance Morality</hi> to its higheſt pitch, to ſupply all the defects and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Jewiſh Religion, and to make Men much better than that weak and imperfect Inſtitution was able to do. This was the great Deſign of Chriſtianity, and it is very probable that our Saviour had a principal, if not a ſole reſpect to the Precepts of <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law,</hi> when he here ſays, that <hi>he came not to deſtroy the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; but to perfect and fulfill them;</hi> as I ſhall have occaſion by and by to ſhew more at large.</p>
            <p>But that we may give a full Anſwer to the Objection of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt this Saying of our Saviour's, I ſhall ſhew that he did not come to <hi>thwart</hi> and <hi>contradict,</hi> and properly to <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> and <hi>make void the Jewiſh Law,</hi> in any part of it, neither the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Judicial,</hi> nor the <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> much leſs the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Precepts of it. This is more than I think to be abſolutely neceſſary, to reconcile
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37482:53"/>
this Saying of our Saviour with the reſt of his Doctrine and Actions; for tho' he had properly <hi>abrogated the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law,</hi> and in no ſence <hi>fulfill'd it;</hi> yet, notwithſtanding this, it may be true, that <hi>he came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets;</hi> that is, to <hi>deſtroy the obligation of Moral Duties,</hi> which he ſpeaks of in this Chapter, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where declares to be the ultimate ſcope, the ſum and ſubſtance of <hi>the Law and the Prophets.</hi> For if the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was not deſigned by God to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,</hi> but to give way to <hi>a more perfect diſpenſation;</hi> then our Saviour did no way <hi>thwart</hi> and <hi>contradict the Law and the Prophets,</hi> by <hi>abrogating the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law,</hi> at that time, when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned that a period ſhould be put to it. But yet for the fuller ſatisfaction to this Objection, I ſhall ſhew that our Saviour did not properly <hi>abrogate</hi> any part of the <hi>Jewiſh Law,</hi> no not the <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part of it; but did <hi>fulfill it.</hi>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> not their <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Judicial</hi> Laws. Theſe, in the original intention of them, were not Laws deſigned for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37482:53"/>
Mankind, but ſuited and fitted to the diſpoſition and temper, the Condition and Circumſtances of a particular Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nation; to theſe our Saviour taught obedience, and paid it himſelf, and never did any thing contrary to them, nor in the leaſt weaken the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of them; but they continued in full force, 'till that Nation and Commonwealth was diſſolved. So that theſe Laws were no way impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or <hi>abrogated</hi> by the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but they fell, for want of a ſubject to exerciſe their power upon, and becauſe the People that were to be governed by them were deſtroyed or diſſipated! and tho' they neither are, nor ever were obligatory to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as they were the peculiar Laws of a particular Nation; yet the Natural Reaſon and Equity of them, ſo far as it concerned Mankind, is duly conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by us, and many of theſe Laws are adopted into the Laws of moſt Chriſtian Nations. It is plain then, that this part of the Jewiſh Law received no prejudice by Chriſtianity, but continued in full force, ſo long as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37482:54"/>
that Nation and Commonwealth laſted, which was to be governed by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial</hi> part of the Jewiſh Law, which conſiſted in Circumciſion, and Purifications, and Sacrifices, in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Meats, and Times, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other Rites and Obſervances; this was not properly <hi>abrogated</hi> and <hi>made void</hi> by the coming of Chriſt, but <hi>fulfill'd</hi> and <hi>made good</hi> by him. The Rites and Ceremonies of the Law, were the Types and Shadows of thoſe <hi>future good things</hi> which were promiſed under the Goſpel, a kind of rude draught of a better and more perfect Inſtitution, which was deſigned, and at laſt <hi>fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dowed</hi> and <hi>figured</hi> by thoſe <hi>legal obſervances,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:37482:54"/>
And ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> calls the Prieſts and Sacrifices of the Law, the <hi>Examples and ſhadows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things,</hi> Chap. 8. 5. and ſo Chap. 10. 1. <hi>the Law having a Shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things,</hi> that is, being but <hi>an obſcure Type,</hi> and not <hi>a perfect Repreſentation</hi> of the Bleſſings and Benefits of the Goſpel, which we now have in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> Now reaſon will tell us, that the Laws concerning theſe <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> were only to continue 'till the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the things ſignified by them ſhould come, and that they would be of no longer uſe, when <hi>that more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Inſtitution,</hi> which was figured by them, ſhould take place, and then they would expire, and become void of themſelves, becauſe the reaſon and uſe of them ceaſing, they muſt neceſſarily fall.</p>
            <p>But they did not expire immediately upon the coming of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he himſelf ſubmitted to theſe Laws, ſo long as they continued in force; he was Circumciſed, and preſented in the Temple, and performed all other Rites
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37482:55"/>
required by the Law, <hi>that firſt Covenant</hi> to which theſe Laws and Ordinances belonged, continuing in force, 'till the ratification of <hi>the ſecond Covenant</hi> by the death of Chriſt, and then theſe Laws expired, or rather were <hi>fulfill'd,</hi> and had their accompliſhment in the Sacrifice of Chriſt, which made all the Sacrifices and other Rites of the Jewiſh Religion needleſs, and of no uſe for the future; Chriſt having by this <hi>one Sacrifice of himſelf, perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> as the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. So that Chriſt did not properly <hi>abrogate</hi> and <hi>repeal</hi> thoſe <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws; but they having continued as long as they were deſigned to do, and there was any uſe of them, they <hi>abated</hi> and <hi>ceaſed</hi> of themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that the death of Chriſt was the time of their expiration, becauſe then the</hi> new Covenant <hi>took place, St.</hi> Paul <hi>expreſly tells us,</hi> Eph. <hi>2. 15.</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aboliſht or voided in his fleſh the law of Commandments contained in Ordinances; <hi>and this</hi> v. <hi>16. he is ſaid to have done</hi> by his Croſs; <hi>and more plainly,</hi> Col. <hi>2. 14.</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:37482:55"/>
blotting out the hand-writing of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which was againſt us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee that even the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> Law was not ſo properly <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> by the Sacrifice and Death of Chriſt, but rather had its <hi>accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and attained its <hi>end</hi> in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, which by the Eternal efficacy of it to the expiation of Sin, and the purifying of our Conſciences, hath made all the Sacrifices and Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other Rites of the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law,</hi> for ever needleſs and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But eſpecially as to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law,</hi> and thoſe Precepts which are of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Perpetual</hi> obligation, our Saviour did not come either <hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,</hi> or <hi>to leſſen</hi> and <hi>ſlacken</hi> the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
            <p>And of this I told you our Saviour doth principally, if not ſolely ſpeak here in the Text, as will appear to any one that ſhall attentively conſider the ſcope of his Diſcourſe. In the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37482:56"/>
beginning of his Sermon, he promiſeth Bleſſing to thoſe, and thoſe only who were endowed with thoſe Virtues which are required by the Precepts of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> or comprehended in them; and then he tells them, that Chriſtians muſt be very eminent and conſpicuous for the practice of them, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good works, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie your Father which is in Heaven;</hi> and then he cautions them not to entertain any ſuch imagination, as if he intended to diſſolve the obligation of the Law, and to free Men from the practice of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, which probably ſome might have ſuggeſted againſt him; <hi>think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets;</hi> as if he had ſaid, you cannot entertain any ſuch conceit, if you conſider that the Precepts which I inculcate upon you, and thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the practice whereof I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, are the ſame which are contained in <hi>the Law and the Prophets.</hi> So that I am ſo far from croſſing the main deſign of <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> and taking away the obligation of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties enjoyned by the Jewiſh
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37482:56"/>
Religion, that I come purpoſely to carry on the ſame Deſign to <hi>further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> to give a <hi>more perfect and clear Law,</hi> and to give <hi>a greater enforcement</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> to the practice of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties; theſe were always the ſum and ſubſtance of Religion, the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate deſign of <hi>the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and therefore I am ſo far from diſcharging Men from the obligation of the <hi>Moral</hi> Precepts of <hi>the Law,</hi> that I come to bind them more ſtrongly upon you. And <hi>verily I ſay unto you,</hi> that is, I ſolemnly declare, <hi>that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſhall teach Men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, he ſhall in no wiſe enter therein. You think the Scribes and Phariſees very Pious and Excellent Men, and to have attained to a high pitch of Righteouſneſs; <hi>but I ſay unto you, that except your Righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And then he inſtanceth in ſeveral Precepts of <hi>the Moral Law,</hi> which in the letter of them, eſpecially as they were interpreted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37482:57"/>
by the Teachers of the Law among the Jews, were very much ſhort of that Righteouſneſs and Perfection which he now requires of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Followers. So that his whole Diſcourſe is about Precepts and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of <hi>the Moral</hi> Law, and not a word concerning the <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> Law; which makes me very prone to think, that our Saviour's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Text is this, that his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ſo far from thwarting and oppoſing that which was the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal intention of Chriſtianity was to advance the practice of goodneſs and virtue, by ſtrengthning the obligation of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, and giving us a more perfect Law and Rule of Life, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering better Arguments, and greater Encouragements to the obedience of this Law. Therefore for the fuller explication and illuſtration of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall endeavour to clear theſe <hi>three</hi> Points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Main and Ultimate Deſign of <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37482:57"/>
to engage Men to the practice of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Duties, that is, of real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the diſpenſation of the Jewiſh Religion, was comparatively very weak, and inſufficient to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Chriſtian Religion hath ſupplied all the defects, and weakneſſes and imperfections of that diſpenſation; theſe three Particulars will fully clear our Saviour's meaning in this Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Main and Ultimate Deſign of <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> was to engage Men to the practice of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties; that is, of real and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Goodneſs, conſiſting in thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which our Saviour mentions at the beginning of this Sermon; <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs.</hi> This our Saviour more than once tells us was the ſum and ſubſtance, the main ſcope and deſign of the whole Doctrine of <hi>the Law and the</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:37482:58"/>
               <hi>Prophets.</hi> Mat. 7. 12. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 40. That <hi>the love of God</hi> and <hi>our Neighbour,</hi> thoſe <hi>two great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> to which all <hi>Moral</hi> Duties are reduced, are the two great hinges of the Jewiſh Religion, <hi>on theſe two hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Love, the fulfilling of the whole Law, Rom.</hi> 13. 10. St. <hi>James, the Perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct and the Royal Law,</hi> as that which hath a Soveraign influence upon all parts of Religion. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. tells us, that this more perfect <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which was brought in by the Goſpel, or the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, is <hi>witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets.</hi> And indeed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets every where do ſlight and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part of Religion, in compariſon of the practice of <hi>Moral</hi> Duties. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto me? bring no more vain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, your New Moons and your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Feaſts my Soul hateth.</hi> But what then are the things that are acceptable
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37482:58"/>
to God? He tells us at the 16<hi>th</hi> ver. <hi>waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well; ſeek judgment, relieve the Oppreſſed, judge the Fatherleſs, plead for the Widow.</hi> And by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> God tells that People, that the buſineſs of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> was not the thing primarily deſigned by God, but obedience to the <hi>Moral</hi> Law; the <hi>Ritual</hi> Law came in upon occaſion, for the prevention of Idolatry, and by way of condeſcention to the temper of that People; and thus <hi>Maimonides</hi> and the Learned Jews underſtand theſe words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the Land of Egypt, concerning Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sacrifices; but this thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded I them, ſaying, obey my voice, and walk in all the ways that I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People.</hi> So likewiſe in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> God plainly prefers the <hi>Moral</hi> before the <hi>Ritual</hi> part of Religion, as that which was principally deſigned and intended by him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Mercy, and not Sacrifice; and the</hi>

                  </gap>uſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Theſe it ſeems were the great things which God ſtood upon and required of Men even under that imperfect diſpenſation; and theſe are the very things which the Chriſtian Religion doth ſo ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn and command; ſo that <hi>this Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs</hi> which the Goſpel requires, <hi>was witneſſed to by the Law and the Prophets.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Point, That the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> or the diſpenſation of the Jewiſh Religion, was comparatively very weak, and inſufficient to make Men truly good, and for the promoting of real and inward righteouſneſs; it gave Laws indeed to this purpoſe, but thoſe not ſo clear and perfect, or at leaſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37482:59"/>
not ſo clearly underſtood, as they are now under the Goſpel; and it made no expreſs promiſes of inward Grace, and aſſiſtance, to quicken and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us in the doing of our Duty; it made no explicit promiſes of any bleſſing and reward to the doing of our duty beyond this Life; ſo that the beſt and moſt powerful Arguments and Encouragements to Obedience, were either wholly wanting, or very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely revealed under this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this inſufficiency of the Jewiſh diſpenſation, both to our juſtification and ſanctification, to the reconciling of us to God, and the making of us really good, the Apoſtle frequently incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in the New Teſtament; St.</hi> Paul, Acts <hi>13. 38, 39.</hi> Be it known unto you therefore, Men and Brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and by him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified, from all thoſe things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes; <hi>and</hi> Rom. <hi>8. 3.</hi> What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh; <hi>that is, by reaſon of</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:37482:60"/>
               <hi>the carnality of that diſpenſation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the purification of the body.</hi> Gal. <hi>3. 21. he calls it a Law unfit to give Life;</hi> If there had been a Law which could have given Life, verily Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been by the Law. <hi>And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>Ch. 8. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. finds fault with the diſpenſation of the Law, for the lowneſs and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Promiſes, being only of Temporal good things; and for want of conferring an inward and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Principle to enable Men to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> but now hath he obtained <hi>(ſpeaking of Chriſt)</hi> a more excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes; for if that firſt Covenant had been fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for a ſecond; <hi>and this</hi> ſecond <hi>and</hi> better Covenant, <hi>he tells us, was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament;</hi> for finding fault with them, he ſaith, behold the days come ſaith the Lord, when I will make a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Houſe of Iſrael, and the Houſe of Judah; not according to the Covenant which I made with their Fathers.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37482:60"/>
For this is the Covenant which I will make with the Houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord. I will put my Laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts. <hi>And</hi> Chap. <hi>10. 1, 4. he ſhews the inefficacy of their Sacrifices for the real expiation of Sin,</hi> the Law having <hi>but</hi> a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the lively repreſentation of the things <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> can never with thoſe Sacrifices which they offer'd year by year continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, make the comers thereunto perfect; for it is not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away ſins.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now have proceeded to the <hi>Third</hi> Particular; namely, that the Chriſtian Religion hath ſupplied all the defects and weakneſs and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Jewiſh diſpenſation; but that I ſhall not now enter upon, but make one plain inference from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I have already diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon this Argument.</p>
            <p>If our Saviour <hi>came not to diſſolve</hi> and <hi>looſen</hi> the obligation of <hi>Moral</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> it, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37482:61"/>
to <hi>enforce</hi> and <hi>bind</hi> the practice of theſe Duties <hi>more ſtrongly</hi> upon us, then they do widely and wilfully miſtake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſtianity, who teach that <hi>it diſchargeth Men from the obligation of the Moral Law,</hi> which is the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and avowed Principle of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrine, but directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Declaration of our Saviour in the Text, <hi>that he came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but</hi> to perfect and <hi>fulfill them;</hi> (for to take away the obligation of a Law, is plainly to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> and <hi>make it void;)</hi> and contrary to the Apoſtle's ſolemn reſolution of this matter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith?</hi> That is, does the Goſpel deſtroy and take away the obligation of the Law? <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, yea we eſtabliſh the Law;</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is ſo far from deſigning or doing any ſuch thing, that it gives new ſtrength and force to it.</p>
            <p>But ſurely they that teach this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, did never duly conſider that terrible threatning of our Saviour after the Text, which ſeems to be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly level'd at them; <hi>whoſoever ſhall</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:37482:61"/>
               <hi>break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and ſhall teach Men ſo, he ſhall be call'd the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> for how can Men more effectually <hi>teach</hi> the violation, not only of <hi>the leaſt,</hi> but of <hi>the greateſt</hi> of Gods Commandments, than by declaring that <hi>the Goſpel hath ſet Men free from the obligation of the Moral Law?</hi> which is in effect to ſay, that Chriſtians may act contrary to all the Duties of <hi>Morality,</hi> that is, do the moſt impious things in the World, without any offence againſt God, and notwithſtanding this, continue to be his Children, and highly in the favour of God.</p>
            <p>And all the ſecurity they have againſt this impious Conſequence, is that weak and ſlender pretence, <q>that gratitude and love to God, will preſerve them from making this ill uſe of the grace of the Goſpel, and oblige them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Sin, and to endeavour to pleaſe God as much as any Law could do.</q> But then they do not conſider the nonſenſe of this; for there can be no ſuch thing as <hi>Sin,</hi> if the obligation of the Law be taken away; for <hi>where</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:37482:62"/>
               <hi>there is no Law, there</hi> can be <hi>no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> as the Apoſtle, and common Reaſon likewiſe tells us; ſo that the Law being removed and taken away, all Actions become indifferent, and one thing is not more <hi>a ſin</hi> or <hi>offence againſt God</hi> than another. And what then is it they mean that gratitude will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige Men to, or preſerve them from? When there can be no ſuch thing as <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>duty,</hi> as <hi>pleaſing</hi> or <hi>offending</hi> God, if there be no <hi>Law</hi> to oblige us to the one, or reſtrain us from the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what is, if</hi> this <hi>be not,</hi> to turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, <hi>and to make</hi> Chriſtian Liberty a Cloke <hi>for all ſorts of Sins? A Man cannot do a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deſpite to the Chriſtian Religion, nor take a more effectual courſe to bring it into contempt, and to make it to be hiſs'd out of the World, than to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it as a lewd and licentious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which gives Men a perfect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from all the Duties of</hi> Morality, <hi>and obligeth them only</hi> to believe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that Chriſt hath purchaſed for them a liberty to do what they will, and that upon theſe terms, and no other, they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37482:62"/>
are ſecure of the favour of God in this World, and Eternal Salvation in the other. <hi>This is the ſum and the plain reſult of the</hi> Antinomian <hi>Doctrine, the moſt pernicious</hi> Hereſie, <hi>and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly deſtructive of the great End and Deſign of Chriſtianity, that ever yet was broached in the World. But</hi> ye have not ſo learned Chriſt, if ſo be ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus, that ye put off concerning your former converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the old Man, which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to deceitful Luſts, and that ye be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind, and put on the new Man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs, and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have conſider'd this Saying of our Saviour's with reſpect to <hi>the Moral Law,</hi> and thoſe Precepts which are of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Perpetual</hi> force, and that our Saviour did not come either to <hi>diſſolve</hi> or <hi>looſen</hi> the obligation of them; for the illuſtration of which, I propounded to clear theſe <hi>three</hi> Points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the main and ultimate deſign of <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37482:64"/>
to engage Men to the practice of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Duties, that is, of real and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>the Law of Moſes,</hi> or the diſpenſation of the Jewiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was comparatively very weak, and inſufficient to make Men truly good, and ineffectual to promote inward and real Righteouſneſs. Theſe <hi>two</hi> points I have ſpoken to. I ſhall now proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> Namely, that the Chriſtian Religion doth ſupply all the defects and weakneſſes and imperfections of the Jewiſh diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh Religion had very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantages above the meer <hi>light of Nature,</hi> which was all that the Heathen World had to conduct them towards Eternal Happineſs; the <hi>Jews</hi> had the knowledge of the one true God, and very ſignal and particular Teſtimonies of the Divine Providence, which did naturally tend to beget in them good hopes of a future Life, and the rewards of another World; they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37482:64"/>
had the Natural Law revealed, and the main Precepts of it written with God's own hand, and by <hi>Moſes</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them; by which means they had a more certain and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their duty; they had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets frequently ſent to them, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them of their Duty, and to exhort them to Repentance, and to warn them of approaching judgments. They had good encouragement given to hope for the pardon of Sin, by God's appointment of ſeveral ways of expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; which, how unlikely ſoever they were to be available to the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual expiation of Sin, yet they did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that the Divine Nature was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and did ſeem to figure ſome more effectual way, deſigned by God for that purpoſe, that ſhould be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in due time. And finally they had moſt expreſs promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Temporal Bleſſings and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to encourage them in their obedience, and to deter them from the tranſgreſſion of God's Laws. Theſe Advantages the Jews plainly had above the reſt of the World, <hi>God did not deal</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:37482:65"/>
               <hi>ſo with other Nations, neither had the Heathen</hi> ſuch <hi>a knowledge of God's Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this, the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion was very ſhort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, very weak and infectual to the great end of Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, and to raiſe Men to that perfection of goodneſs, of which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature through the grace of God is capable; and therefore there wanted a more perfect Inſtitution, to ſupply the defects and weakneſs and imperfection even of that Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which God had made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and really to effect and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which the Jewiſh Religion attempted and aimed at, and was but, as I may ſay, rudely begun under that imperfect Inſtitution. And this the Goſpel, or the Chriſtian Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt hath fully effected, as will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear by a particular Survey and Conſideration of the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Jewiſh Religion, which I ſhall ſhew to be all perfectly made up by the revelation of the Goſpel, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37482:65"/>
the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> it was a great defect of the Jewiſh Religion, that a conſiderable part of it was meerly <hi>external,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purification of <hi>the Body</hi> and <hi>the Fleſh,</hi> and only figurative of that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Purity and <hi>real</hi> Righteouſneſs, which renders Men truly good, and like to God; for which reaſon the Jewiſh Inſtitution is by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call'd <hi>the Law of a Carnal Commandment, Heb.</hi> 7. 16; and <hi>Ch.</hi> 9. 10, is ſaid <hi>to conſiſt only</hi> (that is chiefly) <hi>in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings, and carnal Ordinances impoſed on them until the time of Reformation;</hi> that is, 'till the Meſſias ſhould come, and give ſuch Laws as ſhould really tend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Hearts and Lives of Men; and therefore theſe Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are call'd <hi>poor pitiful Elements,</hi> and <hi>the Rudiments of the World,</hi> fitted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Children</hi> in underſtanding and goodneſs, than to bring <hi>Men</hi> to any maturity and perfection in goodneſs. All their Rites of purification did <hi>only ſanctifie to the purifying of the Fleſh;</hi> but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37482:66"/>
               <hi>did not purge the Conſcience from dead works,</hi> as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks, Ch. 9. 13, 14. <hi>they could not make thoſe that performed and obſerved them perfect, as pertaining to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, v.</hi> 9. that is, theſe Laws had no effect upon the minds of Men, to make them really better, to cure them of their <hi>Moral</hi> Defects and Impurities, their Sins and Vices.</p>
            <p>But the Chriſtian Inſtitution doth perfectly ſupply this defect, by taking us off from thoſe <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>External</hi> Obſervances, and principally requiring that we <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> by giving us ſuch Laws as wholly tend to advance <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> goodneſs, purity and holineſs of heart and life, ſuch as mainly tend to reform the Minds and Manners of Men, and to make us like to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfect Being whom we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and beſides an external humble and reverent demeanour of our ſelves in the worſhip of God, (to which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion doth likewiſe direct;) Chriſtianity hath only Inſtituted <hi>two</hi> ſolemn <hi>External Rites,</hi> viz. <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:37482:66"/>
and <hi>the Lords Supper;</hi> whereby we ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly oblige our ſelves to the practice of all virtue and goodneſs, I ſay <hi>only theſe two,</hi> that by the multitude of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Obſervances, Chriſtians might not be taken off from the minding of the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have extreamly abated and weakned the force of Chriſtianity upon the Hearts and Lives of Men, by amuſing them with <hi>External Rites,</hi> which they have multiplied to that exceſſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to make the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>heavier</hi> than that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Chriſtian Religion, a more <hi>external</hi> and <hi>carnal Commandment</hi> than that of the Law, and by this means have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and taken off the Minds of Men from the main deſign of Chriſtianity, inſomuch that they are ſo employed and taken up with Matters of <hi>external Ceremony,</hi> that they have no leiſure to think of being <hi>good Men,</hi> and to mind the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Duties and Virtues of the Chriſtian Life; ſo that they have ſpoil'd the Chriſtian Religion
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37482:67"/>
of one of its chief Excellencies and Perfections, I mean the <hi>ſimplicity of its Worſhip,</hi> which they have now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with ſo many fooliſh and frivolous <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Obſervances,</hi> as do not only render it more burthenſom, but leſs apt to make men <hi>inwardly</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> good, than even <hi>Judaiſm</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf. This is ſo true and ſo viſible, that the wiſer and better ſort of them have complain'd of it for ſeveral Ages, and ſtill do, as much as they dare for fear of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> or ſome other cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another defect of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was, that it did not give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough to Repentance, by declaring and aſſuring to us any certain way and method for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and forgiveneſs of Sin. This the Rites of all Religion aimed at, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; but were very ineffectual to that end. The Heathen Sacrifices, and all the cruel and barbarous Rites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, did all pretend to be ſo many ways of appeaſing the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deity, and of making atonement and expiation for Sin; and the Sacrifices
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37482:67"/>
of the Jews were Inſtituted by God himſelf, to make an <hi>external</hi> and <hi>legal expiation,</hi> and to be Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>a better</hi> and <hi>more perfect Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> which ſhould really expiate Sin; but even this was very darkly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly diſcovered to them; beſides, that the expiations of the Law did only extend to the leaſt ſorts of Sins, thoſe of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>inadvertency,</hi> but not at all to <hi>preſumptuous</hi> Sins, and ſuch as were committed with <hi>a high hand,</hi> not to <hi>wilfull</hi> and <hi>deliberate</hi> Sins, except in ſome very few and rare Caſes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentioned in the Law; ſo that tho' a great part of the Religious Rites both of the Pagan and Jewiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aimed at the expiation of Sin, yet were they really ineffectual to that end; and upon the whole matter, Mankind, tho' they conceived good hope of God's mercy and forgiveneſs in caſe of Repentance <hi>(Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his anger?)</hi> yet they were unacquainted with any certain and effectual means to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:37482:68"/>
It remains then, that this great bleſſing of the Forgiveneſs of Sins, was never ſufficiently declared and aſſured to Mankind, but through Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerts, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of Sins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> The Goſpel hath provided an expiation for all Sins in general, and that by a Sacrifice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value, <hi>the blood of the Son of God.</hi> And this is a mighty encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Repentance, and one moſt effectual means to reclaim Men from their Sins, to be aſſured that they are indemnified for what is paſt. And this the Apoſtle means, when he ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. that <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us;</hi> that is, whereas the Law left Sinners, as to thoſe Sins which ſtood moſt in need of pardon, under a Curſe, having provided no expiation for them, Chriſt hath redeemed them from <hi>that</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:37482:68"/>
               <hi>Curſe,</hi> by making a general expiation for Sin; and in this ſenſe it is that the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays, <hi>Ch.</hi> 9. 15. that Chriſt died <hi>for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> that is, for thoſe Sins for which the Covenant of the Law had provided no way of forgiveneſs; and therefore St. <hi>John</hi> ſays emphatically, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. that <hi>the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Law did not afford ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently plain and certain Rules and Directions for a good Life. As the corruption and degeneracy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind grew worſe, ſo the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture waxed dimmer and dimmer, and the Rule of Good and Evil was more doubtful and uncertain, and that in very conſiderable inſtances of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was peculiar to the Jews; and even to them, who only had the benefit and advantage of it, it did not give clear and perfect light and direction as to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Duties, and thoſe things which are of an <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable</hi> Reaſon and Goodneſs. And therefore our Saviour
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37482:69"/>
in this Sermon explains it to a greater perfection than it was underſtood to have among the Jews, or the letter of it ſeemed to intend, and hath not only forbidden ſeveral things permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that Law, as <hi>Divorce,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation of Injuries;</hi> but hath heightned our Duty in ſeveral inſtances of it, requiring us <hi>to love our Enemies,</hi> and <hi>to forgive the greateſt injuries and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, tho' never ſo often repeated,</hi> and not only <hi>not to revenge them,</hi> but <hi>to requite them with good turns,</hi> which were not underſtood by Mankind to be Laws before, but yet when duly conſider'd, are very agreeable to right Reaſon, and the ſenſe of the wiſeſt and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt Men. So that the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath not only fixt and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Duty, and brought it to <hi>a greater certainty,</hi> but hath raiſed it to <hi>a greater perfection,</hi> and rendered it every way fit to bring the Minds of Men to a more Divine temper, and a more reaſonable and perfect way of ſerving God, than ever the World was inſtructed in before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:37482:69"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law were only of <hi>temporal</hi> good and evil things, which are, in compariſon of the <hi>endleſs</hi> Rewards and Puniſhments of <hi>another World,</hi> but very languid and faint Motives to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Not but that the Jews under the Law, had ſuch apprehenſions of their own Immortality, and of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of Happineſs and Miſery after this Life, as Natural Light ſuggeſted to them; which was in moſt but a wavering and uncertain perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and conſequently of ſmall effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to engage Men to their Duty; but the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> added little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the clearneſs of thoſe Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions concerning a future ſtate, and the ſtrengthning of this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Minds of Men; it did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſe it, than give any new force and life to it. And for this Reaſon more particularly the Apoſtle tells us that <hi>the Law was</hi> but <hi>weak</hi> to make Men good; becauſe it did not work ſtrongly enough upon the hopes and fears of Men, by the weight of its Promiſes, and the terrour of its
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37482:70"/>
Threatnings; and that for this <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>imperfection</hi> of it, it was <hi>removed,</hi> and a more <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>awakening</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation brought in in the place of it; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18, 19. <hi>For there is verily a diſannulling of the Commandment that was before</hi> (that is of the Jewiſh Law) <hi>for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did;</hi> that is, the Covenant of the Goſpel, which promiſeth <hi>Eternal</hi> Life. And <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. 6. for this Reaſon more eſpecially the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays, that Chriſt had <hi>obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, being the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a better Covenant, which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd upon better Promiſes.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 18. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, that for this Reaſon <hi>the Goſpel is the power of God unto Salvation,</hi> becauſe <hi>therein the wrath of God is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Men.</hi> The clear Revelation of <hi>a Future Judgment,</hi> was that which made the Goſpel ſo proper and ſo powerful an Inſtrument for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men. The great impiety of Mankind, and their impenitency in it, was not ſo much to be wondred at before,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37482:70"/>
while the World was in a great meaſure ignorant of the infinite dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a wicked Life; and therefore God is ſaid in ſome ſort <hi>to overlook it; but now he commands all Men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the World in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by that Man, whom he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead, Acts</hi> 17. 30, 31. The clear diſcovery and perfect aſſurance of <hi>a future Judgment,</hi> calls loudly upon all Men to leave their Sins, and turn to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Covenant of the Law had no ſpiritual Promiſes contained in it, of the grace and aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, for the mortifying of Sin, and enabling Men to their Duty, and ſupporting them under Sufferings: but the Goſpel is full of clear and expreſs Promiſes to this purpoſe. Our Saviour hath aſſured us, that <hi>God will give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him, Luke</hi> 11. 13. and this the Apoſtle tells us is actually confer'd upon all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, thoſe who do ſincerely embrace
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37482:71"/>
and believe the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Hence the Goſpel is call'd by the ſame Apoſtle <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> v. 2d of that Chap. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death;</hi> and in the next words he tells us, that herein manifeſtly appeared the weakneſs of the Law, that it left Men deſtitute of this mighty help and advantage (at leaſt as to any ſpecial promiſe of it) <hi>What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and by making him a Sacrifice for ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin in the fleſh, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> that is, that that Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs which the Law aimed at and ſignified, but was too weak to effect, might be really accompliſht in us, <hi>who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> that is, who are acted and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by a higher and better Principle than Men either have in <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>the carnal diſpeſnation of the Law</hi> did
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37482:71"/>
endow Men withall. And becauſe of this great defect, the Law is ſaid to be a ſtate of <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Servitude;</hi> and on the contrary, the Goſpel, by Reaſon of this mighty advantage, is call'd a ſtate of <hi>Adoption</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>for ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage, but the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, whereby we cry Abba Father;</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty.</hi> And to this very thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> appeals, as that whereby Men might judge whether the Law or the Goſpel were the more excellent and powerful Diſpenſation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> As if he had ſaid, let this one thing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that whole Matter; were ye made Pertakers of this great Priviledge and Bleſſing of the Spirit, while ye were of the Jewiſh Religion, or ſince ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtians? And <hi>ver.</hi> 14. he calls it <hi>the bleſſing of Abraham;</hi> that is, the bleſſing promiſed to all Nations by <hi>Abraham's Seed,</hi> namely, <hi>the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus I have as briefly as well I could ſhewed, how the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion doth ſupply all the weakneſſes and defects and imperfections of the Jewiſh Religion, and conſequently, does in no wiſe <hi>contradict</hi> or <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feer</hi> with the great Deſign of the <hi>Law and the Prophets,</hi> but hath <hi>perfected</hi> and <hi>made up</hi> whatever was weak or wanting in that Inſtitution to make Men truly good, or, as the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is in the Prophet <hi>Daniel, to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, to <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> thoſe Laws of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs, which are of <hi>indiſpenſible</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> obligation.</p>

any Religion or Inſtitution that ever was in the World, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perfection of its Laws, and the force of its Motives and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to Repentance, and a Holy Life, and in reſpect of the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which it gives, and the Examples which it ſets before us, and the powerful aſſiſtance which it offers to us, to enable us <hi>to clean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The greater helps and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we have of being good, the greater things may juſtly be expected from us; for <hi>to whomſoever much is given, of him much ſhall be required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtianity is</hi> the fulfilling of the Righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>by</hi> walking not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit, <hi>by</hi> mortifying the deeds of the Fleſh, <hi>and by</hi> bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37482:74"/>
               <hi>which are</hi> Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Fidelity, Meekneſs, and Temperance. The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith <hi>doth not conſiſt in a barren and ineffectual belief of the Goſpel, in a meer embracing of the Promiſes of it, and relying upon Chriſt for Salvation, in</hi> a Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works, <hi>which is</hi> dead; <hi>but in</hi> a Faith which worketh by Love, <hi>in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming</hi> new Creatures, <hi>and in</hi> keeping the Commandments of God. The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe. This is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another, as he gave us Commandment, <hi>1 John 3. 23. and</hi> this Commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, <hi>1 John 4. 21.</hi> That we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the things that are excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the glory and the praiſe of God, <hi>Phil. 1. 10, 11.</hi> Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report, if

there be any virtue, if there be any praiſe, mind theſe things, <hi>Ch. 4. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then conſidering what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant proviſion the Goſpel hath made for our attainment of Everlaſting Salvation, we are altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, if we periſh. Since God <hi>hath raiſed up ſo mighty a Salvation for us; how ſhall we eſcape?</hi> If we <hi>die in our Sins,</hi> it is not becauſe God would not forgive them, but becauſe we would not Repent and be Saved; the fault is all our own, and we owe it wholly to our ſelves, if we be loſt and undone for ever. If when <hi>Life and Death,</hi> Heaven and Hell, are ſo plainly <hi>ſet before us,</hi> Eternal Miſery and Perdition fall to our Lot and Portion, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were not warned of our Danger, or becauſe Happineſs and <hi>the things of our Peace were hid from our eyes,</hi> but becauſe we have made Death and Deſtruction our obſtinate and final Choice.</p>
            <p>But, Beloved, I hope better things of you, and things which accompany Salvation,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37482:75"/>
tho' I thus ſpeak. Only let your Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt; <hi>and if we be careful to perform the Conditions which the Goſpel requires on our part, we ſhall not fail to be made</hi> Partakers of that Eternal Life, which God, that cannot lie, hath promiſed to us, for his Mercy's ſake in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <q>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſton availeth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion; but a new Creature.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE are two Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> namely, that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and this to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> which are principally and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deſign'd to confute a falſe perſwaſion, which had prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many Chriſtians, eſpecially thoſe who were Converted from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm; <hi>that it was not enough for Men to embrace and confeſs the Chriſtian Religion,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37482:77"/>
unleſs they kept the Law of Moſes, or at leaſt ſubmitted to that great Precept of Circumciſion; the neglect whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the affirmative Precepts of the Law, was only threatned with exciſion, or being cut off from among the People.</hi> And of the prevalency of this Errour, and the great diſturbance which it made in the Chriſtian Church, we have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. where a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council of the Apoſtles is call'd, and a Letter written in their Names to all the Chriſtian Churches, to rectifie their apprehenſions in this matter, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. of that <hi>Chap. For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us, have troubled you with words, ſubverting your Souls, ſaying ye muſt be Circumcis'd, and keep the Law, to whom we gave no ſuch Commandment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And upon this occaſion likewiſe it was, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> as likewiſe that to the <hi>Romans;</hi> in the former of which, after he had at large confuted this Errour, (which he calls <hi>the preaching of another Goſpel, than what the Apoſtles had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Chriſtians firſt received)</hi> In
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37482:77"/>
the beginning of the 5<hi>th</hi> Chapt. he Exhorts them to aſſert the Liberty, which Chriſt had purchas'd for them, from the obligation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ver. 1, 2. <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoak of bondage. Behold, I Paul ſay unto you, that if ye be Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> Not that hereby he condemneth Circumciſion, as a thing evil in it ſelf; for God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Inſtituted or Commanded any thing that was ſo; but he oppoſeth the opinion of the neceſſity of it to our Juſtification and Salvation, when the Goſpel had ſo plainly taken away the obligation and uſe of it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to affirm ſtill the neceſſity of it, was really to renounce Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. For if Judaiſm was ſtill the way to Salvation, Chriſtianity was to no purpoſe; and if Chriſtianity be now the way, then the obligation to the Jewiſh Religion was ceaſed. To avoid the force of this Reaſoning, it was not enough for the falſe Apoſtles to ſay (as it ſeems they did) that Chriſtians were not obliged univerſally
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37482:78"/>
to the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but principally to the Law of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; becauſe Circumciſion being the ſign and badge of that Covenant, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever took that upon him, did thereby own his obligation to the whole Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

whether he be a Jew or a Gentile. All that the Goſpel requires as neceſſary to theſe purpoſes, is, that we perform the Conditions of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that ſo we may be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Partakers of the bleſſings of it.</p>

               <hi>that obey him;</hi> where <hi>Obedience</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put for the whole condition of the Goſpel, the performance whereof en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles us to Eternal Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Now that by theſe various expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, one and the ſame thing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly intended and meant, <hi>viz.</hi> The Condition of the Goſpel; that which is requir'd on our part, in order to our full and perfect juſtification and acceptance with God, is evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all denial; by comparing the three different ways whereby St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſs the ſame propoſition for ſenſe and ſubſtance; in which he tells us, what it is that will avail to our Juſtification under the Goſpel, that is according to the terms of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; that it is neither here nor there, that it ſignifies nothing whether a Man be Circumciſed or not, but that we be ſo qualified as the Goſpel requires, that the Conditions upon which the Bleſſings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are promiſed be found in us. And there are three Texts wherein the ſame thing is plainly intended, in three very different expreſſions. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt neither Circumciſion</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:37482:80"/>
               <hi>availeth any thing, nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: but Faith, which is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> or <hi>made perfect by Charity.</hi> Gal. 6. 15. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: but a new Creature.</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion is nothing: but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi> It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in theſe three Texts the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle deſigns to ſay the ſame thing, and conſequently that <hi>Faith which is made perfect by Charity,</hi> and <hi>the new Creature,</hi> and <hi>keeping of the Commandments of God,</hi> are the ſame in ſenſe and ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Condition of our Juſtification and acceptance with God under the Covenant of the Goſpel, or in the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at preſent, by God's aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, handle the ſecond of theſe Texts. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: but a new Creature.</hi> And here the Condition of the Goſpel is expreſt to us, by the change of our State, which in Scripture is call'd our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or becoming <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and <hi>new Men.</hi> Circumciſion was

but an outward ſign and mark upon the Body, and the Fleſh, though it did indeed prefigure and typifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumciſion of the heart, the giving of Men <hi>new Hearts,</hi> and <hi>new Spirits,</hi> under the more perfect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel? but now <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is, in the Chriſtian Religion, the preſence or the want of this outward mark will avail nothing to our juſtification; but that which was ſignified by it, the renovation of our Hearts and Spirits, our becoming <hi>new Creatures,</hi> is now the Condition of our juſtification and acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>The falſe Apoſtles indeed did lay great ſtreſs upon the buſineſs of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, not ſo much out of zeal to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to avoid Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>They conſtrain you to be Circumciſed, only left they ſhould ſuffer Perſecution for the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> For at that time, though the Chriſtians were Perſecuted, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Edicts had the free exerciſe of their Religion, and therefore they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in this external mark of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe it exempted them from

ſuffering; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in his ſufferings for Chriſt, and the marks of that upon his Body, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>I bear in my Body the marks of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> He tells them, what neceſſities ſoever they might pretend of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, either for their Juſtification, or Salvation, the true ground of all was to ſave themſelves from Temporal Sufferings; and that in the Chriſtian Religion it ſignified nothing to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the favour of God, whether they were Circumciſed or not; nothing would be available to this purpoſe, but the renovation and change of their Hearts and Lives. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion: but a new Creature,</hi>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Goſpel hath taken away the Obligation of the Law of <hi>Moſes; in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That according to the terms of the Chriſtian Religion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will avail to our juſtification and acceptance with God, but the real renovation of our Hearts and Lives; <hi>neither Circumciſion, nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: but a new Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Goſpel hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the obligation of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. In Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion.</hi> There was never any general Obligation upon Mankind to this Rite of Circumciſion, but only upon the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but yet upon the preaching of the Goſpel, many of the Jewiſh Chriſtians would have brought the Gentiles under this yoak; pretending that Chriſtianity was but a ſuperſtructure upon the Law of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37482:82"/>
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> which together with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, was to be the Religion of the whole World; and there was ſome colour for this, becauſe our Saviour himſelf ſubmitted to this Rite, and was Circumciſed; which the Apoſtle takes notice of in the 4<hi>th</hi> Chap. of this Epiſt. <hi>ver</hi> 4. <hi>When the fullneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> that is, <hi>Circumciſed.</hi> And 'tis true indeed, that our bleſſed Saviour was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, but not to ſignifie to us the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of Circumciſion, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it under the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but for a quite different end; as a teſtimony of his Obedience to that Law, which tho' afterwards it was to expire, yet was to be obeyed whilſt it was in force, by all that were born under it; he was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> and <hi>it became him,</hi> who came to teach Mankind Obedience to the Laws of God, <hi>to fulfill all Righteouſneſs</hi> himſelf. And therefore the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, where he takes notice of this, that Chriſt was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> gives this Reaſon of it, that he might be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itter to free thoſe who
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37482:82"/>
were under it, from the ſervitude of it; he was <hi>made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law;</hi> and that thoſe who were in the condition of Servants before, might be ſet at liberty, and <hi>receive the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how did his being <hi>made under the Law,</hi> qualifie him <hi>to redeem thoſe who were under the Law?</hi> Thus; By ſubmitting to it himſelf, he ſhewed that he owned the Authority of it, and that he had no malice or enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; or as he himſelf expreſſes it, that <hi>he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill it.</hi> And being <hi>fulfill'd,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſerv'd the time and end for which God intended it, it expir'd of it ſelf; like a Law which is not made for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, but limited to a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. And our Bleſſed Saviour, who came with greater Authority than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and gave greater Teſtimony of his Divine Authority, had ſufficient power to declare the expiration of it; and by Commiſſioning his Diſciples before and after his death to Preach the Goſpel to the whole World, he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:37482:83"/>
put an end to that <hi>particular Law and Diſpenſation,</hi> which only concern'd <hi>the Jewiſh Nation,</hi> by giving <hi>a general Law to all Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that from the Death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his Aſcenſion into Heaven, upon which followed the general pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Goſpel, the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ceaſed, and according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's expreſs appointment, Proſelytes were to be admitted into the Chriſtian Church only by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and not by <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f Circumciſion, which was the ſign of that Covenant, was laid aſide, then the whole Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Law and Covenant which God had made with the Jews, was alſo ceaſed. It was once indeed the mark of God's choſen and peculiar People; but now that God hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the whole World by his Son, and offers Salvation to all Mankind, Gentiles as well as Jews, the <hi>wall of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is broken down,</hi> and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was the mark of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between Jews and Gentiles, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; and therefore he is ſaid <hi>to have made peace by his Croſs, and to</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:37482:83"/>
               <hi>have blotted out, and taken away the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances, nailing it to his Croſs;</hi> that is, from the time of his Death to have taken away the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> tho' it was a good while after, before the Jews were wholly weaned from the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Nay, it was ſome time before the Apoſtles were clearly convinc'd, that the Goſpel was to be preach'd to the Gentiles; this being one of thoſe Truths, which our Saviour promiſed after his departure, his Spirit ſhould lead them into the perfect knowledge of; and then they were fully inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was expir'd, and that it was no longer neceſſary to the Salvation of Men, that they ſhould be Circumciſed, and keep that Law. And tho' it was once enjoyn'd by God himſelf to the Jews, and their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it was neceſſary to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, yet now by Chriſt Jeſus, God had offered Salvation to Men upon other Terms; and whether they were Circumciſed, or not, was of no moment to their Juſtification or

Salvation one way or other; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they perform'd the Condition of this New Covenant of the Goſpel, they were all alike capable of the Divine Favour and Acceptance.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to that, which I mainly intended to proſecute from theſe words; and that is the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Particular in the Text, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that according to the terms of the Goſpel, and the Chriſtian Religion, nothing will avail to our juſtification and acceptance with God, but the real renovation of our Hearts and Lives; <hi>neither Circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion: but a new Creature.</hi> For the full expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this, I ſhall do theſe <hi>three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this is the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our juſtification and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with God, and that it is the ſame in ſubſtance with <hi>Faith perfected by</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

And,</hi> Coloſ. <hi>3. 9, 10, 11th</hi> verſes, <hi>it is repreſented much after the ſame manner,</hi> Seeing ye have put off the old Man with his deeds, and have put on the new Man, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in knowledge after the Image of him that Created him, where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Greek nor Jew, Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion, Barbarian, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Creature; <hi>that is, theſe external Marks and Differences ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but this inward Change,</hi> the new Creature, Chriſt formed in us, <hi>this in the Chriſtian Religion is</hi> all in all.</p>
            <p>But that we may the more clearly underſtand the juſt importance of this Metaphor of <hi>a new Creature,</hi> or <hi>a new Creation,</hi> I ſhall,</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider what this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor doth certainly import, ſo as to be undeniably evident from other

more clear and full Texts of Sripture, namely, theſe <hi>two</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatneſs of this Change.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is effected and wrought by a Divine Power.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatneſs of this Change; it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a new Creation;</hi> as if the Chriſtian Doctrine, firmly entertained and believed, did as it were mould and faſhion Men over again, transforming them into a quite other ſort of Perſons than what they were before, and made ſuch a change in them, as the Creating Power of God did, in bringing this Beautiful and orderly frame of things out of their dark and rude <hi>Chaos.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle repreſents it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs,</hi> (alluding to the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>hath ſhined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We are tranſlated from one extream to another, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. When our Lord ſends <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Goſpel to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37482:87"/>
Gentiles, he tells him what a change it would make in them, by <hi>opening their eyes, and turning them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the change which Chriſtianity makes in Men, by their being <hi>call'd out of darkneſs into a marvellous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. And ſo St. <hi>Paul. Eph.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, wherever the Doctrine of Chriſt hath its full effect, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work, it makes a mighty change both in their inward Principles, and outward Practice; it darts a new light into their Minds, ſo that they ſee things otherwiſe than they did before, and form a different judgment of things from what they did before; it endues them with a new Principle, and new Reſolutions, gives them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit, and another Temper, a quite different ſenſe and guſt of things from what they formerly had. And this inward change of their Minds neceſſarily produceth a proportionable change in their Lives and Converſations,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37482:87"/>
ſo that the Man ſteers quite another courſe, acts after another rate, and drives on quite other deſigns from what he did before.</p>
            <p>And this is remarkably ſeen in thoſe who are reclaimed from Impiety and Prophaneneſs to Religion, and from a vicious to a virtuous courſe of Life. The Change is great and real in all; but not ſo ſenſible and viſible in ſome, as others: in thoſe who are made good by the inſenſible ſteps of a pious and virtuous Education; as in thoſe who are tranſlated out of a quite contrary ſtate, and <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rn'd from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> and <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, into the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> which was the caſe of the Heathen World, in their firſt Converſion to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Change is effected and wrought by a Divine Power, of the ſame kind with that, which Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World, and raiſed up Chriſt Jeſus from the Dead; two great and glorious Inſtances of the Divine Power;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37482:88"/>
and to theſe the Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alludes, when it ſpeaks of this <hi>New Creation. God, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into our hearts. Like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, ſo we alſo are raiſed to newneſs of life,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6. 4. And to the ſame purpoſe the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20. <hi>And that ye may know what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the operation of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> So that our <hi>Renovation,</hi> and being made <hi>new Creatures,</hi> is an inſtance of the ſame glorious Power, which exerted it ſelf in the firſt Creation of things, and in the Reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead; but not altogether after the ſame manner, as I ſhall ſhew under the next Head.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place proceed to ſhew, that this Metaphor of a new Creation doth not import what ſome Men would extend it to,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37482:88"/>
ſo as to found Doctrines of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence upon the ſingle ſtrength of this and other like Metaphors of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any manner of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and confirmation from plain Texts.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is pretended, that as the Creation was by an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of the Divine Power, ſo is <hi>the new Creation,</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:37482:91"/>
or the Converſion of a Sinner; and this is ſolely argued from the Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expreſſions of Scripture concerning Converſion; ſuch as being <hi>called out of darkneſs into light,</hi> alluding to that powerful <hi>word</hi> of God, which in the firſt Creation <hi>commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs; being quicken'd and rais'd to a new Life;</hi> and from this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor here in the Text, of <hi>a new Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſurely it is a dangerous thing in Divinity, to build Doctrines upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, eſpecially if we ſtrain them to all the ſimilitudes which a quick and lively imagination can find out; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſome one obvious thing is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended in the Metaphor, and the meaning is abſolv'd and acquitted in that, and it is folly to purſue it into all thoſe ſimilitudes, which a good fancy may ſuggeſt. When our Saviour ſays, <hi>that he will come as a Thief in the night,</hi> it is plain what he means; that the Day of Judgment will ſurprize the careleſs World, when they leaſt look for it, that <hi>he will come at an hour when they are not aware;</hi> and tho' he reſemble
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37482:92"/>
his coming to that of <hi>a Thief in the night,</hi> yet here is nothing of <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> in the caſe. So here when the change which Chriſtianity makes in Men, is called <hi>a new Creation,</hi> this only imports the greatneſs of the Change, which by the power of God's grace is made upon the hearts and lives of Men; and the Metaphor is ſufficiently abſolv'd in this plain ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, agreeable to the literal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture concerning this thing, and there is no need that this Change ſhould in all other reſpects anſwer the work of Creation; and conſequently there is no neceſſity that it ſhould be effected in an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> manner, or that we ſhould be <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſive</hi> in this Change, and that we ſhould no ways concur to it by any act of our own, or that this work ſhould be done <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no ſteps and degrees.</p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary that this Change ſhould be effected in an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> manner. God may do ſo, when he pleaſeth, without any injury to his Creatures; for it is certainly no wrong
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37482:92"/>
to any Man to be made good and happy againſt his will; and I do not deny, but that God ſometimes does ſo. The Call of the Diſciples to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt ſeems to have been a very ſudden and forcible impreſſion upon their Minds, without any appearing reaſon for it; for it is not reaſonable for any Man to leave his Calling, and follow every one that bids him do ſo. The Converſion of <hi>Saul</hi> from a Perſecutor of Chriſtianity, to a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Preacher of it, was certainly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, if not in an <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> yet in a very <hi>forcible</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> manner. The Converſion of three thouſand at one Sermon, when the Holy Ghoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in a viſible manner upon the Apoſtles, was certainly the effect of a mighty and <hi>over-powering</hi> degree of God's grace. And the like may be ſaid of the ſudden Converſion of ſo many Perſons from Heatheniſm, and great wickedneſs and impiety of Life, to the ſincere profeſſion of Chriſtianity, by the preaching of the Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:37482:93"/>
But that this is not of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, nor the ordinary method of God's grace, to work upon the minds of Men in ſo <hi>over-powering,</hi> much leſs in an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> manner, is as plain as any thing of that Nature can be, both from Experience, and the Reaſon of the thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g, and the conſtant tenour of the Scripture. We find that many (perhaps the greateſt part) of thoſe that are good are made ſo by the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſteps and degrees of a Religious Education, and having been never vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, can give no great account of any ſenſible Change, only that when they came to years of underſtanding, they conſider'd things more, and the Principles that were inſtill'd into them in their younger years, did put forth themſelves more vigorouſly at that time, as Seeds ſprout out of the ground, after they have a good while been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and lain hid in the Earth.</p>
            <p>And it is contrary to Reaſon, to make an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of Divine Power neceſſary to our Repentance, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37482:93"/>
Converſion; becauſe this neceſſarily involves in it <hi>two</hi> things which ſeem very unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That no Man Repents upon Conſideration and Choice, but upon meer force and violent neceſſity, which quite takes away the Virtue of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whatever virtue there may be in the conſequent acts of a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It implies that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Repentance of thoſe, upon whom God doth not work <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> is impoſſible, which is the utmoſt can be ſaid to excuſe the impenitency of Men, by taking it off from their own choice, and laying it upon the impoſſibility of the thing, and an utter diſability in them to chooſe and do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>And it is likewiſe contrary to the conſtant tenour of the Bible, which ſuppoſeth that Men do very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt the Grace and Holy Spirit of God. It is ſaid of the Phariſees by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30. that <hi>they rejected</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:37482:94"/>
               <hi>the Counſel of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> that is, the merciful Deſign of God for their Salvation. And of the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. that <hi>they always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that ſome ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God's grace and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are <hi>reſiſtible,</hi> and ſuch, as if Men did not reſiſt them, would be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to bring them to Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; elſe why are the Phariſees ſaid to <hi>reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> that is, <hi>to their own ruine;</hi> implying, that if they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, they might have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and if they had, it had been without <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> Grace; for that which was offered to them, was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>reſiſted</hi> by them. Other Texts plainly ſhew, that the Reaſon of Mens impenitency and unbelief is not any thing wanting on God's part, but on theirs; as thoſe known Texts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Saviour laments the Caſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe they obſtinately brought deſtruction upon themſelves. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42. <hi>If thou hadſt known in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace;</hi> intimating that they might have known them, ſo as to have prevented
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37482:94"/>
that deſolation which was coming upon them, and was a forerunner of their Eternal Ruine; <hi>but now they are hid from thine eyes;</hi> intimating, that then God gave them up to their own blindneſs and obſtinacy, but the time was, when they might have <hi>known the things of their peace;</hi> which cannot be upon the ſuppoſition of the neceſſity of an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of God's Grace to their Converſion, and Repentance; becauſe then without that they could not have Repented, and if that had been afforded to them, they had infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly Repented. So likewiſe in that other Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>Oh! Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thee, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and you would not.</hi> And in <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me that ye might have life.</hi> He <hi>would have gathered them,</hi> and they <hi>would not;</hi> he would have given them <hi>Life,</hi> but they <hi>would not come to him.</hi> Are theſe ſerious and compaſſionate expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and declarations of our Saviour's gracious intention towards them, any ways conſiſtent with an impoſſibility
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37482:95"/>
of their Repentance? which yet muſt be ſaid, if <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> grace be neceſſary thereto; for then Repentance is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible without it, and that it was not afforded to them is plain, becauſe they did not Repent. The ſame may be ſaid of that ſolemn declaration of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive.</hi> Can it be ſaid that God hath <hi>no pleaſure in the death of Sinners,</hi> and yet be true, that he denys to the greateſt part of them, that grace which is neceſſary to their Repentance? Upon this Suppoſition, how can it be true, that <hi>if the mighty works that were done in Chorazin, and Bethſaida, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have Repented, Matth.</hi> 11. 21. ſince <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> grace did not accompany thoſe Miracles? For if it had, <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida had Repented,</hi> and without it <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon could not Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame difficulty is in thoſe Texts, wherein God is repreſented as expecting the Repentance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners; and our Saviour
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37482:95"/>
               <hi>wondering at their unbelief and hardneſs of heart,</hi> and <hi>upbraiding them with it, Iſa.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? Mark</hi> 6. 6. 'tis ſaid <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our marvell'd at the unbelief</hi> of the Jews. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 14. that <hi>he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided his Diſciples with their unbelief, and hardneſs of heart.</hi> But why ſhould the Repentance of Sinners be expected, or their unbelief marvell'd at, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be upbraided to them, by him who knew it impoſſible to them, without an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> power and grace, which he knew likewiſe was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to them? Neither God nor Men have reaſon to wonder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat any Man does not do that, which at the ſame time they certainly know he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</p>
            <p>The bottom of all that is ſaid to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this preſſing difficulty, is this; <q>that this impotency and diſability of Sinners is their Sin, and therefore cannot be pleaded in their excuſe, for their impenitency; but God may
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37482:96"/>
ſtill juſtly require that of them, which they had once a natural power to do, but wilfully forfeited and loſt it; they had this power in <hi>Adam,</hi> and forfeited it by his diſobedience.</q> To ſhew how ſlight this evaſion is, I need not run into that Argument, how far we are guilty of the Sin of our firſt Parents. That by that firſt tranſgreſſion and diſobedience all Mankind ſuffers, and our Natures are extreamly corrupted and depraved, cannot be denied: but the corruption of our Natures is a thing very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Perſonal guilt, ſtrictly and properly ſo call'd. I will take the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs much ſhorter, and granting that Mankind had in <hi>Adam</hi> a Natural power to have continued obedient to the Laws of God, yet ſince <hi>by one Man Sin enter'd into the World,</hi> and <hi>all are now Sinners,</hi> here is an obligation to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> as well as to <hi>Obedience,</hi> and Men ſhall be Condemned for their <hi>Impenitency.</hi> I ask now, whether in <hi>Adam</hi> we had a power to <hi>Repent?</hi> 'Tis certain <hi>Adam</hi> had not this power, and therefore I cannot ſee how we could loſe it, and forfeit it in him.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37482:96"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> indeed had a Natural Power <hi>not to have ſinned,</hi> and ſo <hi>not to have needed Repentance;</hi> but no power to <hi>Repent</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that ſtate Repentance was impoſſible, becauſe there could be no occaſion for it: he had it not after his fall, becauſe by that he forfeited all his power to that which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good. 'Tis ſaid indeed he had it in Innocency, but forfeited it by his Fall; ſo that he had it, when there was no occaſion or poſſibility of the exerciſe of it, and loſt it when there was occaſion for it: or if he did not loſe it by his Fall, we have it ſtill, and then there is no need of any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, much leſs <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> grace to <hi>Repentance;</hi> ſo that our impotency, as to the particular Duty of <hi>Repentance,</hi> cannot be charg'd upon us as our fault, not ſo much as upon the account of Original Sin.</p>
            <p>But the want of this Power is the conſequent and juſt puniſhment of our firſt Tranſgreſſion. Be it ſo; but if this impotency ſtill remain in all thoſe to whom God doth not afford
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37482:97"/>
his <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> grace, how comes th grace offer'd in the Goſpel to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the impenitency of Men, and encreaſe their Condemnation? For if it be no Remedy againſt this impotency, how comes it to inflame the guilt of Impenitency? Or how is it Grace to offer Mercy to thoſe upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, who are out of a poſſibility of Repenting; and yet to puniſh them more ſeverely for their impenitency after this offer made to them, which they cannot accept without that grace which God is reſolved not to afford them? If this be the Caſe, the greateſt favour had been to have had no ſuch offer made to them, and it had been happier for Mankind, that <hi>the grace of God had</hi> not <hi>appear'd to all Men,</hi> but only to thoſe who ſhall <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> be made partakers of the benefit of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Doctrine grounded upon this Metaphor of <hi>a new Creation,</hi> is, that we are <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in the work of Converſion, and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and contribute nothing to it; that God does all, and we do nothing at all; and this follows from the former, eſpecially
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37482:97"/>
if we allow the Metaphor as far as it will carry us. For as the firſt Creation of things was by an <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible</hi> act of Divine Power, ſo the things that were made, were only <hi>paſſive</hi> in their Creation; and as they could make no reſiſtance, ſo neither could they contribute any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o their being what they are. And this Doctrine is not only argued from the Metaphor of <hi>a new Creation,</hi> but from ſeveral other Metaphors uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deſcribe our Natural State; as namely, <hi>darkneſs, blindneſs,</hi> and our being <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> from whence it is inferr'd, that we contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute no more to our Renovation, than darkneſs doth to the introduction of light, than a blind Man can do to the recovery of his ſight, or a dead Man to his own Reſurrection; but are <hi>wholly paſſive</hi> in this work. And to countenance this Notion, they make great advantage of the Character which is given in Scripture of the moſt degenerate Heathen, taking it for granted, that their Condition is the true ſtandard of a Natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate State; and to this purpoſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37482:98"/>
they inſiſt particularly upon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the gentile Idolaters, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18, 19. <hi>Having the underſtanding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts; who being paſt feeling, have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> Which is indeed a deſcription of Men in their Natural State, but not of <hi>all,</hi> but of ſuch as by the worſt ſort of vicious practices of the groſſeſt Idolatry, and moſt abominable lewdneſs, were dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the utmoſt, ſo that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſeemed deſperate, without a miraculous and an extraordinary grace of God, which was probably afforded to many of theſe. In like manner they argue the common Condition of Mankind, from the deſcription which is given of the wickedneſs of Men, before God brought the Flood upon them, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>God ſaw that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> This they make the Character of <hi>all Men</hi> in their <hi>Natural</hi> State, whereas this is a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37482:98"/>
deſcription of an <hi>extraordinary</hi> degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Men, ſignifying that the world was then extreamly bad, and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the higheſt degree; for God gives this as a Reaſon why he was reſolved to drown the World, and <hi>to deſtroy Man from the face of the Earth,</hi> becauſe <hi>their wickedneſs was grown to ſo great an height.</hi> But if this were a deſcription of the Natural State of Mankind, this could be no particular Reaſon for bringing a Flood upon the World at that time, there being the ſame Reaſon for it for fifteen hundred years before, and ever will be the ſame Reaſon to the end of the World, that is, that Men are naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and depraved. Surely they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Scripture very ſuperficially, that interpret it at this rate.</p>
            <p>'Tis too true, that the Nature of Man is ſadly corrupted and depraved; but not ſo bad as by vicious practices and habits it may be made; all Men are not equally at the ſame diſtance from the grace of God; ſome are <hi>nearer to the Kingdom of God</hi> than others, and leſs force and violence will ſerve <hi>to</hi>

               </gap>ectly good; ſo that it is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to argue the common Condition of all Mankind, from the deſcriptions that are given in the Scripture of the worſt of Men; and therefore if it were granted that <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> grace were neceſſary for the Converſion of <hi>ſuch,</hi> it will not follow that the ſame is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All unregenerate Men are not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoid of a ſenſe of God, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, they have many Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of what they ought to be and do, and under thoſe Convictions are very capable of perſwaſion, which dead Men are not. The grace of God is neceſſary to the Converſion of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but it is not neceſſary that he ſhould be <hi>only paſſive</hi> in this work. Experience
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37482:99"/>
tells us the contrary, that we can do ſomething, that we can co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the grace of God; and the Scripture tells us the ſame, and makes it an argument and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us <hi>to work out our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe <hi>God works in us both to will and to do of his own goodneſs. Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. Beſides that, it is the greateſt and juſteſt diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world to all endeavours of Repentance and Reformation, to tell Men that they can do nothing in it. He that is ſure of this, that he can do nothing in this work, is a Fool if he make any attempt to become better, becauſe he ſtruggles with an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and if the work will be done at all, it will be done without him, and he neither can, nor ought to have any hand in it. But will any Metaphor bear Men out againſt ſo palpable an abſurdity as this?</p>
            <p>And yet after all, there is no force in theſe Metaphors, to prove what they aim at by them. For if to be <hi>dead in ſin</hi> ſignifies <hi>an utter impotency to goodneſs,</hi> then <hi>to be dead to ſin</hi> muſt on the contrary ſignifie an <hi>impoſſibility</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:37482:100"/>
               <hi>of ſinning;</hi> for juſt as the <hi>unregenerate</hi> Man is <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> ſo he that is <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> is ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>dead to ſin:</hi> But yet the beſt of regenerate Men, notwithſtanding they are <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> and <hi>alive to God, do offend in many things,</hi> and too frequently fall into ſin. Why then ſhould the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor be ſo ſtrong on the one ſide, that a Man who is ſaid <hi>to be dead in ſin,</hi> ſhould not be able ſo much as to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate</hi> with the grace of God in the work of Repentance and Converſion?</p>
            <p>In ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort, if this be true, that Men in an unregenerate and unconverted ſtate are perfectly <hi>dead,</hi> and have no more ſenſe of Spiritual Things, than a dead Man hath of Natural Objects, then all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Exhortations to Repentance, and all Promiſes and Threatnings to argue and perſwade Men thereto are vain, and to no purpoſe; and it would be every whit as proper and reaſonable for us to preach in the <hi>Church-yard,</hi> over the graves of dead Men, as in the <hi>Church</hi> to the unregenerate; becauſe they can no more act and move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own recovery out of a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37482:100"/>
ſtate of Sin and Death, than the dead Bodies can riſe out of their graves.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, that the end of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Promiſes is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to Men their <hi>Power,</hi> but their <hi>Duty.</hi> But if they be <hi>inſenſible,</hi> it is to as little purpoſe to declare to them their <hi>Duty,</hi> as their <hi>Power.</hi> Beſides, it will be an hard thing to convince Men that any thing is their <hi>Duty,</hi> which at the ſame time we declare to them to be <hi>out of their Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> to ſay that of our ſelves we can Repent and turn to God. and who ſays we can <hi>of our ſelves</hi> do this beſides the <hi>Pelagians?</hi> We affirm the neceſſity of God's grace hereto, and withall, the neceſſity of our <hi>co-operating</hi> with the grace of God. We ſay that without the powerful excitation and aid of God's grace, no Man can Repent, and turn to God; but we ſay likewiſe, that God cannot be properly ſaid to <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>aſſiſt</hi> thoſe, who do nothing themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:37482:101"/>
But Men <hi>can do more than they do,</hi> and therefore are juſtly Condemned. Not in the work of Converſion ſure; if they can do <hi>nothing at all.</hi> But they can do more by way of <hi>preparation</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. Suppoſe they do all they can towards it, will this ſave them, or will God upon this <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> work their Converſion? No, they ſay, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any preparatory work that we can do, Converſion may not follow; how then does this mend the matter?</p>
            <p>But ſtill they ſay the fault is in Men's want of <hi>will,</hi> and not of <hi>power; You will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</hi> But can they <hi>will</hi> to come? No, that they cannot neither. Why then it is ſtill want of <hi>power</hi> that hinders them. The offer of Life is a very gracious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to them that are guilty, and liable to death, as we all are; but not if the Condition be utterly impoſſible to us, tho' the impoſſibility ſprings from our own fault, as I will plainly ſhew by a fair inſtance. A Prince offers a Pardon to a Traytor faſt lockt in Chains, if he will come to him and ſubmit himſelf;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37482:101"/>
but if he be ſtill detained in Chains, and the Prince do not ſome way or other help him to his Liberty, 'tis ſo far from being <hi>a favour</hi> to offer him a Pardon upon theſe terms, that it is <hi>a cruel deriſion</hi> of his miſery, to ſay to him <hi>you will not come to me that you may be pardon'd;</hi> and this notwithſtanding that his being caſt into Chains, was the effect of his own Crime and Fault; the application is obvious. I ſhould now proceed to anſwer an Objection or two, and then to give a clear ſtate of this Matter, ſo as is moſt agreeable to Scripture, and the Attributes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God; but this I ſhall reſerve for another Diſcourſe.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>GALAT. VI. 15.</bibl>
               <q>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion; but a new Creature.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Point which I am upon from theſe words is, that</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nothing will avail to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the real renovation of our Hearts and Lives.</p>
            <p>For the full explication of this, I propounded to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:37482:103"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is implied in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>new Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this is the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our juſtification and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is highly Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that this ſhould be the Condition of our Juſtification.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to the firſt of theſe, I have ſhewed, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> What this Metaphor doth certainly import; and 2<hi>dly,</hi> That it doth not import what ſome would extend it to, whereon to found ſuch Doctrines as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as the Creation was an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of the Divine Power, ſo is this <hi>new Creation,</hi> or the Converſion of a Sinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Creatures were <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in their being made, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed nothing at all to it, no more do we in our Converſion, and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:37482:103"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as the Creation of the ſeveral Kinds and Ranks of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was effected <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> by the powerful Word of God, ſaying, <hi>let ſuch and ſuch things be,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately they were; ſo this <hi>new Creation</hi> is <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and admits of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe I have conſider'd, and enter'd upon the <hi>ſecond;</hi> namely, that as the Creatures were <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in their being made, and contributed nothing at all thereto, no more do we in our Converſion and Regeneration.</p>
            <p>This I told you does plainly make void all the Precepts and Exhortations, and all the Promiſes and Threatnings of Scripture, to argue and perſwade Men to Repentance.</p>
            <p>That which remains to be done upon this Argument, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To anſwer an Objection or two, which are commonly urged by the Aſſertors of this Doctrine, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37482:104"/>
we are <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in the work of Converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To give a clear ſtate of this Matter, ſo as is moſt agreeable to Scripture, and the Attributes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God. For the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Objections are theſe <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That if we be not <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in the work of Regeneration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, we aſcribe the whole glory of this work to our ſelves, and not to God.</p>
            <p>Or, 2<hi>dly,</hi> We do however extenuate or leſſen the grace of God, if there be any active Concurrence and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of our own towards this Change.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> They ask St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>Who maketh thee to differ?</hi> and think it impoſſible to be anſwer'd, if the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of God's grace to depend upon our concurrence and compliance with it. Theſe are all the Material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections I know; to every one of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37482:104"/>
which I hope to give a very clear and ſufficient Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Objection.</hi> If we be not <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in the Work of Regeneration and Converſion, we aſcribe the whole glory of this work to our ſelves, and not to God. But that I certainly know this Objection is commonly made, and have ſeen it in very Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Authors, I could not believe that Men of ſo good ſenſe could make it. For this is to ſay, that if we do any thing in this work, tho' we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that what we do in it, we do by the aſſiſtance of God's grace, we aſcribe it wholly to our ſelves, and rob God altogether of the glory of his grace; or in plainer terms, it is to ſay, that tho' we ſay God does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, and we but very little in this work, yet if we do not ſay that God does <hi>all,</hi> and we <hi>nothing at all,</hi> we take the whole work to our ſelves, and ſay God does <hi>nothing at all;</hi> which let any one that conſiders what we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay judge, whether we ſay ſo or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:37482:105"/>
The Scripture, which never robs God of the glory of his grace, does I'm ſure aſcribe our Converſion and Repentance, our Regeneration and Sanctification to ſeveral Cauſes; To the Holy Spirit of God, to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to his Word, and to our ſelves. To the Holy Spirit of God, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Author, and Efficient. Hence we are ſaid <hi>to be born of the Spirit, to be ſanctified by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To the Miniſters of God, as the Inſtruments of our Converſion. Hence they are ſaid <hi>to turn Men to Righteouſneſs, to Convert a Sinner from the evil of his ways, to ſave Souls from death, to ſave themſelves, and them that hear them; to be our Spiritual Fathers, and to beget us in Chriſt.</hi> To the word of God, as the ſubordinate Means and Inſtruments of our Converſion. Hence we are ſaid <hi>to be begotten by the word of truth, to be ſanctified by the truth.</hi> And laſtly, to our ſelves, as concurring ſome way or other to this work. Hence we are ſaid <hi>to believe</hi> and <hi>repent, to turn from our evil ways,</hi> and <hi>to turn to the Lord, to cleanſe and purifie our</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:37482:105"/>
               <hi>ſelves.</hi> Hence likewiſe are thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Commands in Scripture, <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ways and doings, to waſh our hearts from wickedneſs, to repent and turn our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>to make our ſelves new Hearts, and new Spirits.</hi> So that all theſe Cauſes, the Spirit of God, his Miniſters, his Word, and we our ſelves, do all ſome way or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur and contribute to this Effect. God indeed is the Principal, and hath ſo great an hand in this Work from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to end, that all the reſt are nothing in Compariſon, and we do well to aſcribe to him the whole glory of it, <hi>that no Fleſh may glory in his ſight:</hi> But nevertheleſs in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech ſufficiently warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Miniſters of God, and the Word of God, and we our ſelves do all <hi>co-operate</hi> ſome way or other to our Converſion, and Regeneration; and by aſcribing to any of theſe ſuch parts as they truly have in this work, God is not robbed of <hi>any part</hi> of the glory of his grace, much leſs of the <hi>whole.</hi> Much leſs is it the aſcribing it <hi>all</hi> to our ſelves, whom we affirm to have <hi>the leaſt part</hi> in it, not worthy to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37482:106"/>
be mention'd, in Compariſon of <hi>the riches of God's grace</hi> towards us. And yet unleſs we do <hi>ſomething,</hi> what can be the meaning of <hi>making our ſelves new hearts and new ſpirits?</hi> Is it only that we ſhould be <hi>paſſive</hi> to the <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible</hi> operation's of God's grace? that is, that we ſhould not hinder, what we can neither hinder nor promote; that we ſhould ſo demean our ſelves, as of neceſſity we muſt whether we will or no. So then <hi>to make our ſelves new hearts and new ſpirits,</hi> is to do nothing at all towards the hinderance or further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this work; and if this be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meaning of it, it is a Precept and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation juſt as fit for <hi>Stones,</hi> as for <hi>Men;</hi> that is, very improper for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Objection.</hi> But however, we do extenuate and leſſen the grace of God, if there be any active concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and endeavours on our part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Change. For anſwer to this, <hi>three</hi> things deſerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:37482:106"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is very well worthy our Conſideration, that they who make this Objection, have the confidence to pretend that <hi>they</hi> do not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>miniſh the grace of God, by confining it to a very ſmall part of Mankind in Compariſon; nay, they will needs face us down, that by this very thing they do very much exalt and magnifie it, and that the grace of God is ſo much the greater, by how much the fewer they are that are partakers of it. But I hope they only mean that the grace is greater to themſelves; (in which conceit there is commonly as much of envy as grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) but ſurely they cannot mean that the grace which is limited to a few, is greater in it ſelf, and upon the whole matter, than that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a great many; it being a down-right Contradiction, to ſay that the grace of God is magnified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined. For at this rate of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, the leſſer it is, the greater it muſt be, and by undeniable conſequence would be greateſt of all, if it were none at all. So that it ſeems the grace of God may be extenuated in favour of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37482:107"/>
our ſelves; but when we do ſo, we muſt <hi>ſay</hi> we magnifie it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But to come cloſe to the Objection; tho' it be true, that if God's grace in our Converſion do not do all, it does not do ſo much as if it did all; yet this is really no injury or diſhonour to the grace of God; and tho' in ſome ſenſe it doth extenuate it, it doth not in truth and reality take off from the glory of it. In my Opinion, the grace and favour of a Prince is not the leſs in offering a Pardon to a Traytor, who puts forth his hand and gladly receives it, than if he forc'd it upon him whether he would or no. I am ſure it is in the firſt Caſe much fitter to give it, and he on whom it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd much better qualified to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. 'Tis no diſparagement to a Prince's Favour, that it is beſtow'd on one who is in ſome meaſure qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to receive it. But be it more or leſs in one Caſe than the other, this is certain, that in both Caſes the Man ows his Life to the great grace and goodneſs of his Prince; and I cannot ſee how it leſſens the grace, that the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37482:107"/>
miſerable Object of it, the guilty and condemned Perſon, was either by his humble ſubmiſſion, or thankful accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, in ſome degree better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to receive ſuch a Favour, than an obſtinate Refuſer of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Which is the Principal Conſideration of all, we muſt take great heed, that while we endeavour to make God to do <hi>all</hi> in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sinners, we do not by this means charge upon him the ruine and deſtruction of impenitent Sinners, which I doubt we ſhould do, if we make the Reaſon of their impenitency and ruine their utter impotency and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to Repent; and we certainly make this the Reaſon of their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency and ruine if there be no other difference but this between pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and impenitent Sinners, namely, that in the one God works Repentance by an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of his Power, ſo that he cannot but Repent, and denys this grace to the other, without which he cannot poſſibly Repent. But the Scripture chargeth the deſtruction of Men upon themſelves, and lays their
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:37482:108"/>
impenitency at their own door. <hi>Oh Iſrael! thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf; but in me is thy help, Hoſea</hi> 13. 9. But <hi>where</hi> is the <hi>help,</hi> when the grace abſolutely neceſſary to Repentance is denied? And how is <hi>their deſtruction of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> if it is unavoidable, let them do what they can? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 3, 4. God appeals to his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting on his part, that was fit and neceſſary to be done, that they might bring forth the fruits of Repentance, and better Obedience. <hi>And now, O Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and Men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my Vineyard; what could have been done more to my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, that I have not done in it? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> Is it true that God hath done all that was neceſſary to have brought them to Repentance? Then if <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> grace be neceſſary, he afforded them <hi>that;</hi> but <hi>that</hi> was not afforded them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then they muſt unavoidably have Repented, and there had been no cauſe for this Complaint: If he did not afford it, but only the <hi>outward means</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:37482:108"/>
of Repentance without the <hi>inward grace</hi> (as ſome ſay;) then it is eaſie <hi>to judge</hi> why <hi>they did not</hi> Repent; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they could not;</hi> and there ſeems to be no Cauſe either of Wonder, or Complaint. Beſides that it will be hard to juſtifie that Saying, <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> when it is acknowledg'd by the aſſertors of this Doctrine, that the main thing was not done, and that without which all the reſt ſignify'd nothing, leaving them under the ſame impoſſibility of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as if nothing at all had been done to them.</p>
            <p>But now upon <hi>our</hi> ſuppoſition, that <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> was afforded to them, which they wilfully neglected to make uſe of, the Reaſon and Equity of this Complaint is evident, and God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, as having done what was needful on his part, and the Sinner juſtly Condemned, for not concurring with the grace of God as he might have done; which ſhews that we are not <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in this work, but ſomething is expected from us, after

God hath done his part, which if we neglect to do, <hi>our deſtruction is of our ſelves.</hi> Whereas the contrary ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon pretence of glorifying God's <hi>grace,</hi> by making him to do <hi>all</hi> in the Converſion of Sinners, indangers the honour of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by laying the impenitency of Sinners, and their ruine conſequent upon it, at his door; which is to advance one Attribute of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ruine of another; whereas it is a Fundamental Principle of Religion, to take care to reconcile the Attributes and Perfections of God to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for that is not a Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which contradicts any other Perfection.</p>
            <p>The 3<hi>d Objection</hi> is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that queſtion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ?</hi> which they think impoſſible to be anſwer'd, if the efficacy of God's grace depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our concurrence and compliance with it. For, ſay they, when God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his grace to two perſons for their Repentance, if the true Reaſon why the one Repents, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains impenitent, be this, that the one
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37482:109"/>
complieth with this grace of God, and yieldeth to it, the other reſiſts and ſtands out againſt it; then it is not the grace of God which makes the difference, for <hi>that</hi> is equal to both, but ſomething in themſelves, and ſo it is not <hi>God that makes them to differ,</hi> but <hi>they themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this queſtion is impertinent to this Caſe. The Apoſtle ſpeaks it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spiritual Gifts, upon account of which, they factiouſly admir'd ſome of the Apoſtles above others, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>them</hi> the queſtion is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>who maketh thee to differ?</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts were ſo order'd by God, that Men were <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of them, and contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the obtaining of them; and therefore if one had greater gifts than another, it was meerly the pleaſure of God that made the difference. But the Caſe is not the ſame in the graces of God's Spirit, towards the obtaining and improving whereof, we our ſelves may contribute ſomething; our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our having aſſur'd us, that <hi>to him that hath, ſhall be given.</hi> And here the queſtion
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37482:110"/>
is not proper, nor is it true <hi>that the grace of God makes all the difference.</hi> It is indeed the Foundation of all the good that is in us: but our different Improvement makes different attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in grace and goodneſs. Among thoſe to whom the Talents were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, what <hi>made the difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Man <hi>who wrapt his Talent in the Napkin, and buried it,</hi> and thoſe <hi>who gained double by theirs,</hi> but that <hi>the one</hi> improv'd the grace conferr'd on him, <hi>the other</hi> neglected it, and this without any manner of reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diminution of the grace of God, or any danger from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>who maketh thee to differ?</hi> Put the Caſe a Pardon is offered to two Malefactors, the one accepts, the other refuſes it; <hi>their own choice makes the difference between them;</hi> but he that is ſaved is nevertheleſs beholden to the King's Pardon for his Life, and it were a ſenſeleſs ingratitude in him, becauſe he accepts the Pardon, when the other refuſeth it, to ſay that he did not owe his Life to the grace and favour of his Prince, but might thank himſelf for it; whereas that he was in a capacity
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37482:110"/>
to accept a Pardon, was wholly due to the clemency of his Prince, who offer'd it to him when he no wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it. In this Caſe the thing plainly appears as it is, by which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man may ſee, that it is againſt common ſenſe to pretend that the grace of God is deſtroyed, if there be any compliance on our part with it; that it is no grace, if it be not forc'd upon us, and we be not <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in the reception of it. I proceed in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, to give a clear ſtate of this Matter, ſo as is moſt agreeable to the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, and the eſſential Attributes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God. In order to which, I will give you a ſhort view of the ſeveral Opinions concerning this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And there are two <hi>extream,</hi> and two <hi>middle</hi> Opinions, concerning the operation of God's grace in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Sinner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>extream</hi> Opinions is that which all this while I have been arguing againſt, namely, that all that are Conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ted and Regenerated, are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37482:111"/>
wrought upon in an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and are <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in it; and that thoſe who are not thus wrought upon, their Repentance and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is <hi>impoſſible.</hi> What the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of this Opinion are, I have ſhewed at large.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>extream</hi> Opinion is, that none are thus wrought upon, becauſe it would be a violence and injury to Man's Natural Liberty; but that <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace</hi> is offered to all, one time or other, who live under the Goſpel, which they may comply with or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; and conſequently if they be not brought to Repentance, their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and ruine is the effect of their own choice, and God is <hi>free from the blood of all Men.</hi> But this Opinion, tho' infinitely more reaſonable than the other, ſeems not to have any neceſſary Foundation either in Scripture or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. There are ſome inſtances in Scripture of the Converſion of Men after a very <hi>violent,</hi> if not an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> manner, which ſeems to be attributed to a particular <hi>predeſtination</hi> of God; as <hi>that</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays of himſelf,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:37482:111"/>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15. that <hi>he was ſeparated from his Mother's Womb to that work to which he was called;</hi> and the manner of his Converſion was anſwerable to ſuch a <hi>predeſtination;</hi> and there is nothing in Reaſon againſt this, ſince it is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to any Man to be made good and happy againſt his will.</p>
            <p>The two <hi>middle</hi> Opinions are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>irreſiſtible Grace</hi> is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>all the Elect,</hi> and <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> to all others who live under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel (for of thoſe only we ſpeak, the Caſe of others being peculiar, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the extraordinary Mercy of God) but then they ſay, that none of thoſe to whom this <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> is afforded, ſhall effectually comply with it, and be ſaved. This Opinion ſeems more moderate, and hath this advantage in it, that it acquits the Juſtice of God in the Condemnation of thoſe, who having <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> afforded to them, did yet notwithſtanding continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent; but yet it hath two great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:37482:112"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this Suppoſition is to no purpoſe, as to any real effect for the Salvation of Men, becauſe not one perſon more is ſaved, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Univerſal ſufficient Grace,</hi> which they ſay is afforded to all; for they take it for granted it is never <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and then it ſeems very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, that a Means <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to its End ſhould <hi>Univerſally</hi> prove <hi>ineffectual;</hi> nay, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is next to a Demonſtration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of a Means, if <hi>perpetually</hi> and <hi>in all inſtances</hi> it fails of its End. This would tempt any Man to think, that ſurely there is ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it, or ſomething that hinders the efficacy of it; if being <hi>perpetually</hi> and <hi>generally</hi> afforded, it doth <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and <hi>univerſally</hi> miſcarry, without ſo much as <hi>one inſtance</hi> among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions to the contrary. So that this Opinion ſeems rather to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd for a colour and ſhelter againſt ſome abſurdity, which Men know not how to avoid otherwiſe, than to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rve any good purpoſe, or to be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:37482:112"/>
embraced for the truth and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>middle</hi> Opinion is, That ſome are Converted in an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> manner, when God pleaſeth, and whom he deſigns to be extraordinary Examples and Inſtruments for the good of others, and that <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> is afforded to others, which is <hi>effectual</hi> to the Salvation of <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> by <hi>a great many.</hi> And this avoids all the inconveniency of the other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and is evidently moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both to the tenour of Scripture, and to the beſt notions which Men have concerning the Attributes and Perfections of God, and gives greateſt encouragement to the endeavours of Men. It agrees very well with the ſolemn declarations of Scripture, that God is not wanting on his part, to afford Men ſufficient Means to bring them to Repentance; that <hi>he deſires not the death of a Sinner, but rather that he ſhould turn from his wickedneſs and live;</hi> That <hi>he would have all Men to be ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth;</hi> That <hi>he would not</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:37482:113"/>
               <hi>that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance;</hi> That <hi>Mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is of themſelves.</hi> And this makes all the Exhortations and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Scripture to Repentance to be of ſome force and ſignificancy, and gives encouragement to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and Endeavours of Men to become better. This clearly acquits the Juſtice of God in the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of impenitent Sinners, and ſixeth the Reaſon of their ruine upon their own choice. This perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles the operation and aſſiſtance of God's grace in our Converſion and Regeneration, in our Sanctification and Perſeverance in a good Courſe, with the concurrence of our own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and makes thoſe plain Texts of Scripture have ſome ſenſe and ſignificancy in them; <hi>Work out your own Salvation; Repent and turn your ſelves from all your evil ways; Make ye new Hearts and new Spirits.</hi> Theſe are more than a thouſand Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors to convince a Man, that we may and ought to do ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Repentance and Converſion.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37482:113"/>
And if any Man be ſure that we neither do nor can do any thing in this Work, then I am ſure that theſe Texts ſignifie nothing. Finally, theſe Texts which ſpeak moſt clearly of the neceſſity of the Divine Grace and Aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtance, to our doing of any thing that is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good, do ſuppoſe ſomething to be done on our part. That of our Saviour, <hi>without me you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> implies that <hi>with</hi> his Grace and Aſſiſtance <hi>we can.</hi> That of St. <hi>Paul, I am able to do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthning me,</hi> implies, that what we do <hi>by the ſtrength of Chriſt</hi> is truly <hi>our own act; I am able to do all things.</hi> And this does not in the leaſt prejudice nor obſcure the glory of God's grace. St. <hi>Paul</hi> it ſeems knew very well how to reconcile theſe two, and to give the grace of God its due, without rejecting all concurrence of our own induſtry and endeavour, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his Grace which was beſtowed upon me was not in vain;</hi> not becauſe it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:37482:114"/>
was <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> and he <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in the reception of it; but becauſe he did <hi>concurr</hi> and <hi>co-operate</hi> with it. So he tells us, <hi>his Grace that was beſtowed upon me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> So that our Concurrence and Endeavour in the doing of any thing that is good, does not derogate from the grace of God, provided that we aſcribe the good which we do to the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, to which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more due, than to our own activity and endeavour. And ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> does, <hi>I labour'd abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet not I, but the grace of God, which was with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the glory of God's grace may be advanced to its due pitch, without aſſerting that we are <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> to the Operations of it. God's grace may be <hi>abundantly beſtowed</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and yet we may <hi>labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly; God may work in us to will and to do,</hi> and yet <hi>we may work</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:37482:114"/>
               <hi>out our own Salvation.</hi> I have done with the <hi>Second Doctrine</hi> grounded upon this Metaphor of a <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

            <p>IN Diſcourſing on theſe Words, that which I was laſt upon was to ſhew, that this Metaphor of a <hi>New Creature</hi> doth not import what ſome would extend it to, and that ſo as to found Doctrines of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence upon the ſingle ſtrength of this, and other like Metaphors, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch Doctrines as theſe <hi>three.</hi>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as the Creation was by an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of the Divine Power, ſo is this <hi>new Creation,</hi> or the Converſion of a Sinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as Creatures were <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in their being made, and contributed nothing at all thereto, no more do we to our Converſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as the Creation was <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> only by the powerful Word of God, ſo this new Creation is <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and admits of <hi>no degrees.</hi> The <hi>two</hi> firſt of theſe I have ſpoken to, and ſhewed, that as they had no neceſſary Foundation in this and the like Metaphors of Scripture, ſo they are contrary to Reaſon and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the plain and conſtant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Scripture, which is the Rule and Meaſure of Chriſts Doctrine. I proceed now to conſider the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Doctrine,</hi> which is grounded upon this Metaphor, namely, That as the Creation of the ſeveral Ranks and

Orders of Creatures was <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and effected by the powerful Word of God, ſaying <hi>let ſuch and ſuch things be,</hi> and immediately they were; ſo this <hi>new Creation</hi> is <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>no ſteps and degrees.</hi> And this Doctrine is nothing elſe but a farther purſuit of the Metaphor; and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>two</hi> former Doctrines to be true, and well grounded upon this Metaphor, this <hi>third</hi> Doctrine follows well enough from them; for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable enough, that that which is effected by an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, without any concurrence or operation on our part, ſhould be done <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and <hi>all at once.</hi> Not that this is neceſſary, but that it is reaſonable; for why ſhould Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence uſe delays, and take time, and proceed <hi>by degrees</hi> in the doing of that, which with the ſame eaſe it can do <hi>at once,</hi> and <hi>in an inſtant?</hi> eſpecially conſidering how well this ſuits with the other Metaphors of Scripture, as well as with this of <hi>a new Creation, viz.</hi> the Metaphor of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> A Child is born <hi>at</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance and Conſpiracy of Metaphors, I ſhall ſhew that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Converſion and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Sinner being effected <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and <hi>all at once,</hi> is not well grounded either upon Scripture, or Experience. Not but that God can do ſo if he pleaſeth, and works this Change in ſome much ſooner and quicker than in others; but there is nothing either in Scripture or Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to perſwade us that this is the <hi>uſual,</hi> much leſs the <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable</hi> Method of God's grace in the Converſion of a Sinner, to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>ſteps</hi> and <hi>degrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the full clearing of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall proceed by theſe ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew upon what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Grounds and Principles this Doctrine relies, beſides the Metaphors

already mention'd, which I have ſhewn to be of no force to prove the thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall plainly ſhew what <hi>Regeneration</hi> is; by which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it is not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> effected <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and <hi>at once,</hi> but admits of <hi>degrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is evidently ſo in experience of the <hi>ordinary</hi> Methods of God's grace, both in thoſe who are Regenerated by a Pious and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education, and in thoſe who are reclaimed from a vitious Courſe of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all this is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant and agreeable to what the Scripture plainly and conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares concerning it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall diſcover ſeveral Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes upon which this Doctrine is grounded, beſides the Metaphors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd, and which I have ſhewn to be of no force to prove the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That Regeneration is <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and admits of <hi>no degrees.</hi> As,</p>

But this is a groſs miſtake; for <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> are but different expreſſions of the ſelf ſelf ſame thing; for <hi>Regeneration</hi> is a Metaphor which the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure uſeth to expreſs our <hi>tranſlation</hi> and <hi>change from one ſtate to another,</hi> from a ſtate of Sin and Wickedneſs, to a ſtate of Grace and Holineſs, as if we were <hi>born over again,</hi> and were <hi>the Children of another Father,</hi> and from being <hi>the Children of the Devil,</hi> did become <hi>the Children of God;</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> is our being <hi>made Holy,</hi> our being <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> and <hi>cleanſed</hi> from Sin and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And hence it is that <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> are attributed to the ſame Cauſes, Principal, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental, to <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and to <hi>the word of God;</hi> we are ſaid <hi>to be born again of the Spirit,</hi> and to be <hi>ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt; to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the word of truth,</hi> and <hi>to be ſanctified by the truth,</hi> which is <hi>the word of God.</hi> So that the Scripture ſpeaks of them as the ſame thing; and they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:37482:118"/>
muſt needs be ſo, for if <hi>Sanctification</hi> be the making of us Holy, and <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> make us <hi>Holy;</hi> then <hi>Regeneration</hi> is <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> only ſignifies our <hi>firſt entrance</hi> into this ſtate, and Sanctification our <hi>progreſs</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> in it. But this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is a great Miſtake. For tho' it be true, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> doth ſignifie our <hi>firſt entrance</hi> into this ſtate, yet it is not true, that it <hi>only</hi> ſignifies that; for it is uſed likewiſe in Scripture to ſignifie our <hi>continuance</hi> in that ſtate; for Chriſtians are ſaid to be <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> and conſequently in a <hi>regenerate</hi> ſtate, not only in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> of this Change, but during their <hi>continuance</hi> in it. Beſides that our <hi>firſt Change</hi> is as well call'd our <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> as our <hi>Progreſs</hi> and <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> in a ſtate of Holineſs. So that neither in this is there any difference between <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> They do both of them ſignifie both our <hi>firſt entrance</hi> into an Holy ſtate, and our <hi>continuance</hi> and <hi>progreſs</hi> in it' tho' <hi>Regeneration</hi> do more <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> denote the <hi>making</hi> of this Change, and our <hi>firſt entrance</hi> into it.</p>

3. It is ſaid that one of the main Differences between <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> is this, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> is incapable of <hi>degrees,</hi> and all that are Regenerate are <hi>equally</hi> ſo, and one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Perſon is not <hi>more or leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> than another; whereas <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> is <hi>a gradual progreſs</hi> from one degree of Holineſs to another, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem that are truly Sanctified and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one may be <hi>more Sanctified</hi> and <hi>more Holy</hi> than another. But this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is a meer fancy and imagination, without any real ground. For as an <hi>unregenerate</hi> ſtate does plainly admit of <hi>degrees,</hi> ſo likewiſe doth the <hi>regenerate,</hi> and for the ſame Reaſon. That an <hi>unregenerate</hi> ſtate admits of <hi>degrees,</hi> is evident, in that ſome unregenerate Perſons are <hi>more wicked</hi> than others, and thereby <hi>more the Children of wrath,</hi> and <hi>the Devil,</hi> than others, which are the Scripture expreſſions concerning the <hi>degrees</hi> of Mens Wickedneſs and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty. In like manner, they that are <hi>more Holy,</hi> and <hi>more like God,</hi> are <hi>more the Children of God;</hi> and to be <hi>more a Child of God,</hi> is ſurely to be <hi>more regenerate,</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:37482:119"/>
that is, <hi>more renewed after the Image of God,</hi> which conſiſts <hi>in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and true Holineſs.</hi> So that it is a meer precarious aſſertion, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe to affirm, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> doth not admit of <hi>degrees,</hi> and that one is not <hi>more Regenerate</hi> than another.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> and laſtly, They ground this Conceit upon the Doctrine of the Schools, which teach, that in <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> all the habits of grace are infuſed, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at once.</hi> I confeſs I have no regard, much leſs a veneration for the Doctrine of <hi>the Schools,</hi> where it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from that of <hi>the Holy Scriptures,</hi> which ſays not one word of <hi>infuſed habits,</hi> which yet are much talk'd of in Divinity; and to ſpeak the truth, theſe words ſerve only to obſcure the thing. For to ſay that in <hi>Converſion</hi> the <hi>habits</hi> of all graces and virtues are <hi>infuſed together and at once,</hi> is to ſay, that <hi>in an inſtant</hi> Men that were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious before in ſeveral kinds, are by an Omnipotent act of God's grace, and by a new Principle infuſed into them, endued with the habits of the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37482:120"/>
Graces and Virtues, and are as Chaſt, and Temperate, and Juſt, and Meek, and Humble, as if by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practice of theſe Virtues they had become ſo. That this <hi>may be,</hi> and <hi>ſometimes is,</hi> I am ſo far from deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I believe it to be ſo. Some Men, by an <hi>extraordinary</hi> power of God's grace upon their hearts, are <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly changed,</hi> and ſtrangely reclaimed from a very Wicked and Vicious, to a very Religious and Virtuous Courſe of Life, and that which others attain to by ſlower degrees, and great conflicts with themſelves, before they can gain the upper hand of their Luſts, theſe arrive at <hi>all on the ſudden,</hi> by a mighty Reſolution wrought in them by the power of God's grace, and as it were a new byaſs and inclination put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon their Souls, equal to an habit gain'd by long uſe and cuſtom. This God <hi>ſometimes</hi> does, and when he does this, it may in ſome ſenſe be call'd <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the habits of Grace and Virtue together and at once;</hi> becauſe the Man is hereby endowed with a Principle of equal force and power with habits that are acquir'd by long uſe and practice.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:37482:120"/>
A ſtrong and vigorous Faith is the principle and root of all Graces and Virtues, and may have ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful influence upon the Reſolutions of our Minds, and the government of our Actions, that from this Principle all Graces and Virtues may ſpring and grow up by degrees into habits; but then this Principle is not <hi>formally</hi> but <hi>virtually,</hi> in the power and efficacy of it; <hi>the infuſion of the habits of every Grace and Virtue;</hi> and even in thoſe Perſons in whom this Change is ſo <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> and as it were <hi>at once,</hi> I doubt not but that the habits of ſeveral Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Virtues are afterwards attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the frequent practice of them, in the virtue of this powerful Principle of the Faith of the Goſpel, as I ſhall ſhew in the progreſs of this Diſcourſe. And this I doubt not was very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and viſible in many of the firſt Converts to Chriſtianity; eſpecially of thoſe, who from the abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Impiety of Heatheniſm were gained to the Chriſtian Religion. The Spirit of God did then work very Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, as well in the Cures of Spiritual as of Bodily Diſeaſes. But
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37482:121"/>
then to make this the Rule and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of God's ordinary Proceedings in the Converſion and Regeneration of Men, is equally unreaſonable, as ſtill to expect Miracles for the Cure of Diſeaſes; and 'tis certain in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that this is not God's <hi>ordinary</hi> Method in the Converſion of Sinners, as I ſhall fully ſhew by and by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew what <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is, by which it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that there is no neceſſity that it ſhould be effected <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and <hi>at once,</hi> but that it will admit of <hi>degrees.</hi> I do not deny that it may be <hi>in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> and <hi>at once.</hi> The Power of God is able to do this, and <hi>ſometimes</hi> does it <hi>very thoroughly,</hi> and <hi>very ſuddenly.</hi> But the queſtion is, whether there be <hi>a neceſſity</hi> it ſhould be ſo, and <hi>always</hi> be ſo. Now <hi>Regeneration</hi> is <hi>the change of a Man's ſtate, from a ſtate of Sin, to a ſtate of Holineſs;</hi> which becauſe it is an entrance upon a new kind or courſe of Life, it is fitly reſembled to <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>a new Birth;</hi> to <hi>a new Creation,</hi> the Man being as it were <hi>quite charged,</hi> or <hi>made over again,</hi> ſo as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37482:121"/>
not to be, as to the main purpoſe and deſign of his life, <hi>the ſame Man</hi> he was before. This is a plain ſenſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the thing, which every one may eaſily underſtand. Now there is nothing in Reaſon, why a Man may not <hi>gradually</hi> be changed, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at this ſtate <hi>by degrees;</hi> as well as after this change is made, and he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at this ſtate of a Regenerate Man, he may <hi>by degrees</hi> grow and improve in it. But <hi>the latter</hi> no Man doubts of, but that a Man that is in a ſtate of grace, may <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> in grace; and there is as little Reaſon to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion why a Man may not <hi>come to this ſtate by degrees,</hi> as well as <hi>leap into it at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the difficulty I know of in this Matter, is a meer nicety, that there is <hi>an inſtant</hi> in which every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and therefore <hi>Regeneration</hi> is <hi>in an inſtant;</hi> ſo that the inſtant before the Man arrived at this ſtate, it could not be ſaid <hi>that he was Regenerate,</hi> and the inſtant after he is in this ſtate, it cannot be denied that he is ſo. But this is idle ſubtilety, juſt as if a Man
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37482:122"/>
ſhould prove that an Houſe was built <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> becauſe it could not be ſaid <hi>to be built,</hi> 'till the inſtant it was <hi>finiſh'd;</hi> tho' for all this, nothing is more certain than that it was built <hi>by degrees.</hi> Or, ſuppoſe the time of arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at Man's eſtate be at <hi>one and twenty,</hi> does it from hence follow, that a Man does not grow to be a Man <hi>by degrees,</hi> but is made a Man <hi>in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;</hi> becauſe juſt before <hi>one and twenty</hi> he was not at Man's eſtate, and juſt then he was? Not but that God, if he pleaſe, can make a Man <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> as he did <hi>Adam;</hi> but it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from this Example, that all Men ſhould be made ſo, much leſs does it follow from this vain ſubtilety. This is juſt the Caſe. All the while the Man is tending towards a Regenerate ſtate, and is ſtrugling with his Luſts, 'till by the power of God's Grace, and his own Reſolution he get the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; all the while he is under the ſenſe and conviction of his ſinful and miſerable ſtate, and ſorrowing for the folly of his paſt Life, and coming to an effectual Purpoſe and Reſolution of changing his Courſe; and it may be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:37482:122"/>
ſeveral times thrown back by the temptations of the Devil, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of evil habits, and the weakneſs and inſtability of his own purpoſe; 'till at laſt, by the grace of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and aſſiſting him, he comes to a firm Reſolution of a better Life, which Reſolution governs him for the future; I ſay all this while, which in ſome Perſons is longer, in others ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according to the power of evil habits, and the different degrees of God's grace afforded to Men; all this time the Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> is <hi>going on,</hi> and tho' a Man cannot be ſaid <hi>to be in a Regenerate ſtate,</hi> 'till that very <hi>inſtant</hi> that the Principle of Grace and his good Reſolution have got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of his Luſts, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for all this, that the Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> was not <hi>effected in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi> This is plainly and truly the Caſe, as I ſhall ſhew in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Particular I propounded, namely, that it is evident from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the <hi>ordinary</hi> Methods of God's grace, both in thoſe who are Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by a Pious and Religious Education,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37482:123"/>
and thoſe who are reclaimed from a vicious Courſe of Life.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort, namely thoſe who are brought to goodneſs by a Religious and Virtuous Education; theſe (at leaſt, ſo far as my Obſervation reacheth) make up a very conſiderable part of the number of the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> that is, of <hi>good Men.</hi> And tho' it be certain, conſidering the Univerſal Corruption and degeneracy of Humane Nature, that there is a real Change made in them, by the operation of God's grace upon their Minds, yet it is as certain in experience, that this Change is made in very many, by very <hi>ſilent</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible degrees,</hi> 'till at length the ſeeds of Religion, which were planted in them by a good Education, do viſibly prevail over all the evil inclinations of corrupt Nature, ſo as to ſway and govern the Actions of their Lives; and when the Principles of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do <hi>apparently prevail,</hi> we may conclude them <hi>to be in a Regenerate ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate,</hi> tho' perhaps very few of theſe can give any account of the particular time and occaſion of this Change. For
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37482:123"/>
things may be ſeen in their <hi>Effect,</hi> which were never very ſenſible in their <hi>Cauſe.</hi> And it is very Reaſonable, that ſuch Perſons who never lived in any evil courſe, ſhould eſcape thoſe Pangs and Terrours which unavoidably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto others, from a courſe of actual Sin, and the guilt of a wicked Life; and if there be any ſuch Perſons as I have deſcribed, who are in this <hi>gradual</hi> and <hi>inſenſible</hi> manner Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and made good, this is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that there is <hi>no neceſſity</hi> that this Change ſhould be <hi>in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> it being ſo frequently found to be otherwiſe in Experience.</p>
            <p>And as for others, who are viſibly reclaimed from a notorious wicked Courſe, in theſe we likewiſe frequently ſee this Change <hi>gradually</hi> made, by ſtrong impreſſions made upon their Minds, moſt frequently by the Word of God, ſometimes by his Providence, whereby they are convin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d of the evil and danger of their Courſe, and awakened to Conſideration, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Sorrow and Repentance, and perhaps exercis'd with great terrours
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37482:124"/>
of Conſcience, 'till at length by the grace of God, they come to a fixt Purpoſe and Reſolution of forſaking their Sins, and turning to God; and after many ſtruglings and conflicts with their Luſts, and the ſtrong byaſs of evil habits, this Reſolution aſſiſted by the grace of God, doth effectually prevail, and make a real change both in the Temper of their Minds, and the Courſe of their Lives; and when this is done, and not before, they are ſaid to be <hi>Regenerate.</hi> But all the while this was a doing, the <hi>new Man</hi> was forming, and the work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration was going on; and it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a very conſiderable time from the firſt beginning of it, 'till it came to a fixt and ſetled ſtate. And this I doubt not in experience of moſt Perſons who are reclaim'd from a vicious courſe of Life, is found to be the uſual and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Method of God's grace in their Converſion. And if ſo, it is in vain to pretend that a thing is done <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> which by ſo manifold experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is found to take up a great deal of time, and to be effected <hi>by degrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:37482:124"/>
And whereas ſome Men are pleaſed to call all this the <hi>Preparatory</hi> work to Regeneration, but not the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, this is an idle contention about words. For if theſe Preparations be a degree of goodneſs, and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual tendency towards it, then the work is begun by them, and during the continuance of them, is all the while a doing, and tho' it be hard to fix the point or inſtant when a Man juſt arrives at this ſtate, and not before, yet it is very ſenſible when a Man is in it, and this Change when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made, will ſoon diſcover it ſelf by plain and ſenſible effects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Laſtly, all this is very agreeable to the plain and conſtant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Scripture. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16. where the Prophet exhorts to this Change, he ſpeaks of it as a <hi>gradual</hi> thing, <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well;</hi> that is, break off evil and vicious habits, and gain the contrary habits of virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the exerciſe of it. The Scripture
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37482:125"/>
ſpeaks of ſome, as farther from a ſtate of grace than others, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots, then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil;</hi> plainly declaring the great difficulty, equal almoſt to a natural impoſſibility, of reclaiming thoſe to goodneſs, who have been long habituated to an evil courſe. And the Scripture ſpeaks of ſome as nearer to a ſtate of grace than others. Our Saviour tells the young Man in the Goſpel, who ſaid <hi>he had kept the Commands of God from his youth;</hi> that <hi>he was not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> But now if by an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> act of God's power, this Change be made <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> and cannot otherwiſe be made, how is one Man nearer to a ſtate of Grace, or farther from it than another? If all that are made good, muſt be made ſo <hi>in an inſtant</hi> or not at all, then no Man is nearer being made good than another; for if he were nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to it, he might ſooner be made ſo; but that cannot be, if all muſt be made good <hi>in an inſtant,</hi> for ſooner than <hi>that</hi> no Man can be made ſo. If the ſimilitude of our <hi>being dead in ſins and</hi>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:37482:125"/>
               <hi>treſpaſſes</hi> be ſtrictly taken, no Man is nearer a Reſurrection to <hi>a new Life</hi> than another; as he that died but a week ago, is as far from being raiſed to life again, as he that died a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago; the Reſurrection of both requires an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> act, and to <hi>that</hi> both are equally eaſie.</p>
            <p>The two Parables of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 31, 33. are by many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters underſtood of the <hi>gradual</hi> operation of grace upon the hearts of Men. <hi>That</hi> wherein <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a grain of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, which being ſown, was the leaſt of all ſeeds,</hi> but by degrees <hi>grew up to be the greateſt of herbs;</hi> and <hi>to leaven, which a Woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, 'till the whole was leavened;</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the progreſs of God's grace, which <hi>by degrees</hi> diffuſeth it ſelf over the whole temper of a Man's Mind, into all the actions of his Life. To be ſure the Parable of <hi>the ſeed which fell upon good ground,</hi> does repreſent the efficacy of the word of God, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by his grace upon the Minds of Men, and <hi>that</hi> is ſaid <hi>to ſpring up</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:37482:126"/>
               <hi>and increaſe, and to bring forth fruit with patience;</hi> which ſurely does ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſs to us the <hi>gradual</hi> operation of God's word and grace iu the Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Change of a Man's Heart and Life.</p>
            <p>The New Teſtament indeed ſpeaks of the ſudden Change of many upon the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, which I have told you before is not a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the ordinary Method of God's grace, the not conſidering of which, hath been a great Cauſe of all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in this Matter. 'Tis true, thoſe which were thus Converted to the belief of the Goſpel, their Faith was <hi>a virtual Principle</hi> of all grace and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, tho' not <hi>formally the habit</hi> of every particular grace. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who was a prime inſtance of this kind, ſpeaks as if he acquir'd the grace of Contentment by great Conſideration, and diligent Care of himſelf in ſeveral Conditions; not as if the habit of this grace had been infuſed into him at once, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>I have learn'd in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abaſed,</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:37482:126"/>
               <hi>and I know how to abound; every where and in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, both to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and to ſuffer need.</hi> And thus I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to Conſider, namely, the true and juſt Importance of this Metaphor of <hi>the new Creation.</hi> The <hi>two</hi> Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which remain, I ſhall by God's aſſiſtance finiſh in my next Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

            <p>In treating of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I have conſider'd ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as founded upon this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, which I have ſhewn at large, not only to have no Foundation in Scripture, or Reaſon, or Experience; but alſo to be very unreaſonable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and contrary to the plain and conſtant tenour of Scripture, and to the ordinary Method of God's grace in the Regeneration of Men, whether by a Religious and Virtuous Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in thoſe who are reclaim'd from a notorious wicked Courſe of Life. And that I have ſo long inſiſted upon this Argument, and handled it in a more contentious way than is uſual with me, did not proceed from
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:37482:128"/>
any love to Controverſie, which I am leſs fond of every day than other; but from a great deſire to put an end to theſe Controverſies, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the dark, by bringing them to a clear ſtate and plain iſſue, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to undeceive good Men concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome current Notions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which I do really believe to be diſhonourable to God, and contrary to the plain declarations of Scripture, and a cauſe of great perplexity and diſcomfort to the Minds of Men, and a real diſcouragement to the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Endeavours of becoming bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Upon which Conſiderations I was ſtrongly urgent to ſearch theſe Doctrines to the bottom, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute what in me lay, to the reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good Men from the diſquiet and entanglement of them.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Matter with a few Cautions not unworthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by us; That we would be careful ſo to aſcribe all <hi>Good</hi> to God; that we be ſure we aſcribe nothing to him that is <hi>Evil,</hi> or any ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him; That we do not
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:37482:129"/>
make him the ſole Author of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in ſuch a way, as will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably charge upon him the final impenitency and ruine of a great part of Mankind; That we do not ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the grace of God, as to make his Precepts and Exhortations ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts, and new Spirits; ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate;</hi> Where, if by <hi>the ſtrait gate</hi> be meant the difficulty of our <hi>firſt entrance</hi> upon a Religious Courſe, that is, of our Converſion and Regeneration, I cannot imagine how it is poſſible to reconcile our being <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> in this work, and doing <hi>nothing at all</hi> in it, with our Saviour's Precept of <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate;</hi> unleſs to be <hi>very active,</hi> and to be <hi>meerly paſſive</hi> about the ſame thing be all one, and an <hi>earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and endeavour</hi> be the ſame thing with <hi>doing nothing.</hi> Again, that we do not make the utmoſt degeneracy and depravation which Men ever ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at by the greateſt abuſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the moſt vile and wicked practices, the ſtandard of an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate, and of the common Condition
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:37482:129"/>
of all Men by Nature. And laſtly, that we do not make ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances in Scripture, of the ſtrange and ſudden Converſion of ſome Perſons (as namely, of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Jaylor in the <hi>Acts)</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule and meaſure of every Man's Converſion; ſo that unleſs a Man be as it were ſtruck down by a Light and Power from Heaven, and taken with a fit of trembling, and frighted almoſt out of his wits, or find in himſelf ſomething equal to this, he can have no aſſurance of his Converſion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a much ſurer Judgment may be made of the ſincerity of a Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, by the real Effects of this Change, than by the Manner of it. This our Saviour hath taught us, by that apt reſemblance of <hi>the operation of God's Spirit</hi> to <hi>the blowing of the wind,</hi> of the Original Cauſe whereof, and of the reaſon of its ceaſing or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and why it blows ſtronger or gentler, this way or that way, we are altogether ignorant; but <hi>that it is,</hi> we are ſenſible from the ſound of it, <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and thou heareſt the ſound of it,</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:37482:130"/>
               <hi>but canſt not tell whence it cometh, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goeth: So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> The effects of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in the Regeneration of Men are ſenſible, tho' the manner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of his operation upon the Souls of Men are ſo various, that we can give no account of them; by which, one wou'd think our Saviour had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently caution'd us, not to reduce the Operations of God's grace and Holy Spirit in the Regeneration of Men, to any certain Rule or Standard, but chiefly to regard the ſenſible effects of this ſecret work upon the Hearts and Lives of Men.</p>
            <p>And after all, it is in vain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by any Arguments againſt clear and certain experience. If we plainly ſee that many are <hi>inſenſibly</hi> changed, and made good by pious Education, <hi>in the Nurture aud Admonition of the Lord,</hi> and that ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> who have long lived in a prophane neglect and contempt of Religion, are by the ſecret power of God's word and Holy Spirit, upon calm conſideration, without any great terrours and amazement, viſibly changed
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:37482:130"/>
and brought to a better Mind and Courſe; it is in vain in theſe Caſes to pretend that this Change is not real, becauſe the Manner of it is not anſwerable to ſome Inſtances which are Recorded in Scripture, or which we have obſerv'd in our Experience, and becauſe theſe Perſons cannot give ſuch an account of the time and manner of their Converſion, as is agreeable to theſe inſtances; which is juſt as if I ſhould meet a Man beyond Sea, whom I had known in <hi>England,</hi> and would not believe that he had croſt the Seas, becauſe he ſaid he had a ſmooth and eaſie paſſage, and was wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus I have fully and faithfully endeavour'd to open to you the juſt importance of this Phraſe or Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Text, of <hi>the new Creature, or the new Creation.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Particular I propounded, namely, that the real Renovation of our Hearts and Lives is, according to the terms of the Goſpel, and the Chriſtian
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:37482:131"/>
Religion, the great Condition of our juſtification and acceptance with God, and that this is the ſame in ſenſe and ſubſtance with thoſe Phraſes in the parallel Texts to this, of <hi>Faith perfected by Charity,</hi> and of <hi>keeping the Commandments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That according to the terms of the Goſpel, the great Condition of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and acceptance with God, is the real Renovation of our Hearts and Lives, is plain, not only from this Text, which affirms, that in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Chriſtian Religion nothing will avail us but <hi>the new Creature;</hi> but likewiſe from many other clear Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this, whether by Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be meant our firſt Juſtification upon our Faith and Repentance, or our continuance in this ſtate, or our final Juſtification by our ſolemn Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital and Abſolution at the Great Day, which in Scripture is called <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is the Condition of our firſt Juſtification, that is, of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of our Sins, and our being received
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:37482:131"/>
into the grace and favour of God, is plain from all thoſe Texts, where this Change is expreſt by our <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Converſion,</hi> by our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> and <hi>Renovation,</hi> by our <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms of the like importance. For under every one of theſe Notions, this Change is made the Condition of the forgiveneſs of our Sins, and acceptance to the favour of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Under the Notion of</hi> Repentance <hi>and</hi> Converſion, <hi>Acts 2. 38.</hi> Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins. <hi>Acts 3. 19.</hi> Repent, and be Converted, that your ſins may be blotted out. <hi>Upon the ſame account, a penitent acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of our Sins, which is an eſſential part of Repentance, is made a Condition of the forgiveneſs of them, 1</hi> John <hi>1. 9.</hi> If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs. <hi>Under the notion of</hi> Regeneration <hi>and</hi> Renovation, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 17.</hi> If any Man be in Chriſt, <hi>that is, become a true Chriſtian, which is all</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:37482:132"/>
               <hi>one with being in a juſtified ſtate;</hi> he is a new Creature, old things are paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, behold all things are became new. Tit. <hi>3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. where the Apoſtle declares at large, what Change is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to put us into a juſtified ſtate, and to entitle us to the inheritance of Eternal Life.</hi> For we our ſelves were alſo ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love of God our Saviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man appeared, not by works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, <hi>that is, not for any precedent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ours, for we were great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> but according to his mercy he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, that being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by his Grace, we ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of Eternal Life. <hi>So that the Change of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Temper, and Converſion, and Regeneration, and</hi> the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>is antecedently neceſſary to our Juſtification, that is, to the</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:37482:132"/>
               <hi>pardon of our Sins, and our reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the favour of God, and the hope of Eternal Life. So likewiſe under the notion of</hi> Purification <hi>and</hi> Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>6. 9, 10, 11. where the Apoſtle enumerates ſeveral Sins and Vices, which will certainly exclude Men from the Favour and Kingdom of God, from which we muſt be cleanſed, before we can be juſtified or ſaved.</hi> Know ye not that the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God. And ſuch were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God. <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>6. 17, 18. where the Apoſtle likewiſe makes our</hi> purification <hi>a Condition of our being received into the favour of God, and reckon'd into the number of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:37482:133"/>
               <hi>And that by</hi> not touching the unclean thing, <hi>is here certainly meant our Sanctification and Purification from Sin, is evident from what immediately follows in the beginning of the next Chapter;</hi> Having therefore theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Dearly Beloved! let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God; <hi>that is, having this Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that upon this Condition we ſhall be received to the favour of God, let us purifie our ſelves, that we may be capable of this great Bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our continuance in this ſtate of grace and favour with God, depends upon our perſeverance in Holineſs; for <hi>if any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Laſtly, this is alſo the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our final Juſtification, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution by the Sentence of the great Day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart; for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Joh. 3. 3. <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>Follow Holineſs, without which, no Man</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:37482:133"/>
               <hi>ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle there ſpeaking of the bleſſed ſight and enjoyment of God, tells us what we muſt do, if ever we hope to be Partakers of it; <hi>Every Man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Condition here mentioned in the Text, of our being <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> is the ſame in ſenſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with thoſe Expreſſions which we find in the two parallel Texts to this, where <hi>Faith which is perfected by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> are made the Condition of our juſtification and acceptance with God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing, nor Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; but Faith, which is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> or <hi>made perfect by Charity;</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and Uncircumciſion is nothing; but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi> It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the Deſign and Meaning of theſe three Texts is the ſame, and therefore theſe three Expreſſions of <hi>the new Creature,</hi> and of <hi>Faith perfected by Charity,</hi> and of <hi>keeping the Commandments</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:37482:134"/>
               <hi>of God,</hi> do certainly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame thing. That <hi>the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſignifies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he change of our ſtate, from a ſtate of Diſobedience and Sin, to a ſtate of Obedience and Holineſs of Life, I have ſhewn at large; and the Apoſtle explaining this <hi>New Creation,</hi> moſt expreſly tells us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10 <hi>We are his wormanſhip, Created in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto good works, which God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ring, forbearing one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another; and above all theſe things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfection.</hi> And the Apoſtle St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> tells us, that our Regeneration, which he calls <hi>Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is <hi>unto obedience,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. So
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:37482:134"/>
that our Renovation conſiſteth in the Principle and Practice of Obedience, and a good Life; And what is this but <hi>Faith perfected by Charity?</hi> And <hi>Charity</hi> the Apoſtle tells us <hi>is the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> and what is <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> but <hi>keeping the Commandments of God?</hi> And <hi>keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> or at leaſt a ſincere Reſolution of Obedience, when there is not time and opportunity for the tryal of it, is in Scripture as expreſly made a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of our preſent and final ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and acceptance with God, as <hi>Faith</hi> is, and in truth is the ſame with <hi>a living and operative Faith,</hi> and <hi>a Faith that is conſummate,</hi> and <hi>made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by Charity. Acts</hi> 10. 34, 35. <hi>Of a truth I perceive</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Peter) that God is no reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted with him;</hi> which ſpeech does as plainly, as words can do any thing, declare to us, upon what terms all Mankind, of what Condition or Nation ſoever, may find acceptance with God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Who will render to every Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deeds, to them who by patient</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:37482:135"/>
               <hi>continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life: but to them who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and obey not the Truth, but obey Unrighteouſneſs, Indignation and Wrath Tribulation and Anguiſh upon every Soul of Man that doth Evil; of the Jews firſt, and alſo of the Gentiles: but Glory, Honour, and Peace to every Man that worketh good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile.</hi> As to our acceptance with God, and the Rewards of another World, it matters not whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile, Circumciſed,</hi> or <hi>Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> that which maketh the difference, is <hi>obeying the Truth,</hi> or <hi>obeying Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, working Good,</hi> or <hi>doing Evil;</hi> theſe are the things which will avail to our Juſtification, or Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the Great Day. To the ſame purpoſe is that Saying of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 5. 9. That <hi>Chriſt is the Author of Eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude this Matter with two Remarkable Sayings, the one towards the beginning, the other towards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd of the Bible, to ſatisfie us that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:37482:135"/>
this is the tenour of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the conſtant Doctrine of it from the beginning to the end. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. It is God's Speech to <hi>Cain, If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> thing I propounded, which was to ſhew, that according to the terms of the Goſpel, and the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the real Renovation of our Hearts and Lives is the great Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our juſtification and acceptance with God, and that this in ſenſe and ſubſtance is the ſame with <hi>Faith made perfect by Charity,</hi> and <hi>keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt Particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be ſpoken to, namely, That it is highly reaſonable that this ſhould be the Condition of our Juſtification, and acceptance to the favour of God; and that upon theſe <hi>two</hi> accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:37482:136"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the honour of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In order to the qualifying of us for the favour of God, and the enjoyment of him; for the pardon of our Sins, and the Reward of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the honour of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. For ſhould God have received Men to his favour, and rewarded them with Eternal Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the meer belief of the Goſpel, or a confident perſwaſion that Chriſt would ſave them without any change of their Hearts and Lives, without <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> and <hi>fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> and <hi>amendment of Life;</hi> he had not given ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the World of his Love to Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, and of his hatred of Sin and Iniquity. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, that God in the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Sinner <hi>declares his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> but ſhould he juſtifie Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other terms, this would not <hi>declare his Righteouſneſs</hi> and love of Holineſs,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:37482:136"/>
but rather an indifferency, whether Men were good and Righteous or not. For a bare aſſent to the truth of the Goſpel, without the fruits of Holineſs and Obedience, is not <hi>a living,</hi> but <hi>a dead Faith,</hi> and ſo far from being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, that it is an affront to him; and a confident reliance upon Chriſt for Salvation, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in our Sins, is not a juſtifying Faith, but a bold and impudent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption upon the Mercy of God, and the Merits of our Saviour; who indeed <hi>juſtifies the ungodly,</hi> that is, thoſe that <hi>have been</hi> ſo, but not thoſe that <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo.</hi> And if God ſhould pardon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and reward them with Eternal Life, upon any other terms than upon our becoming <hi>New Creatures,</hi> than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch <hi>a Faith</hi> as is <hi>made perfect by Charity,</hi> that is, by <hi>keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God;</hi> this would be ſo far from <hi>declaring his Righteouſneſs,</hi> and being a teſtimony of his hatred and diſpleaſure againſt Sin, that it would give the greateſt countenance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to it imaginable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:37482:137"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is likewiſe very Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that ſuch a Faith, that makes us <hi>New Creatures,</hi> and is <hi>perfected by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> ſhould be the Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in order to the qualifying of us for the Pardon of our Sins, and the Reward of Eternal Life; that is, for the favour of God, and for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. To forgive Men upon other terms, were to give countenance and encouragement to perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Diſobedience. That Man is not fit to be forgiven, who is ſo far from being ſorry for his fault, that he goes on to offend; he is utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Mercy, who is not ſenſible that he hath done amiſs, and reſolved to amend. No Prince ever thought a Rebellious Subject capable of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon lower terms than theſe. It is in the nature of the thing unfit that an obſtinate Offender ſhould have any Mercy or Favour ſhewn to him.</p>
            <p>And as without Repentance and Reſolution of better Obedience, we are unfit for Forgiveneſs, ſo much
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:37482:137"/>
more for a Reward; as we cannot expect God's Favour, ſo we are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the enjoyment of him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Holineſs. Holineſs is the Image of God, and makes us like to him; and 'till we be <hi>like him,</hi> we cannot <hi>ſee him,</hi> we can have no enjoyment of him. All delightful Communion and agreeable Society is founded in a ſimilitude of Diſpoſition and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and therefore ſo long as we are unlike to God in the temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our Minds, and in the Actions and Courſe of our Lives, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can God take pleaſure in us, nor we in him, but there will be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual jarring and diſcord between him and us; and tho' we were in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſeated in the place of the Bleſſed, yet we ſhould not, nay we could not be Happy; becauſe we ſhould want the neceſſary Materials and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of Happineſs. For it is with the Soul in this reſpect, as it is with the Body; tho' all things be eaſie without us; and no Cruelty be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd upon us, to give torment and vexation to us, yet if we be inwardly Diſeaſed, we may have pain and anguiſh
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:37482:138"/>
enough, we may be as it were upon the rack, and feel as great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the inward diſorder of our humours, as if we were tortur'd from without. So it is with the Soul, Sin and Vice are internal Diſeaſes, which do naturally create trouble and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and nothing but diverſion, and the variety of Objects and Pleaſures which entertain Men in this World, hinders a wicked Man from being out of his wits, whenever he reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf; for all the irregular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Paſſions, Luſt, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and Revenge, are ſo many <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> within us, and tho' there were no Devil to torment us, yet the diſorder of our own Minds, and the horrours of a guilty Conſcience would be a Hell to us, and make us extreamly miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the very Regions of Happineſs. So that it is neceſſary that our <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould be <hi>made perfect by Charity,</hi> and that we ſhould become <hi>new Creatures;</hi> not only from the arbitrary conſtitution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, but from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon of the thing; becauſe nothing but this can diſpoſe us for that Bleſſedneſs, which God hath promis'd
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:37482:138"/>
to us, and prepared for us. Faith conſider'd abſtractly from the Fruits of Holineſs and Obedience, of Goodneſs and Charity, will bring no Man into the favour of God. All the excellency of Faith is, that it is the Principle of a good Life, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with the beſt Motives and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments thereto, the Promiſes and Threatnings of the Goſpel; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Heaven, when we come to <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>enjoyment, Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> ſhall ceaſe, but <hi>Charity never faileth;</hi> for if it ſhould, Heaven would ceaſe to be Heaven to us, becauſe it is the very frame and temper of Happineſs; and if this diſpoſition be not wrought in us in this World, we ſhall be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incapable of the felicity of the other.</p>
            <p>You ſee then what it is that muſt recommend us to the favour of God; the real Renovation of our Hearts and Lives, after the Image of him that Created us. This muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in us, before ever we can hope to be reſtored to the grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, or to be capable of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:37482:139"/>
Reward of Eternal Life. And what could God have done more Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than to make theſe very things the terms of our Salvation, which are the neceſſary Cauſes and Means of it? How could he have dealt more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and kindly with us, than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>that</hi> to be the Condition of our Happineſs, which is the only qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that can make us capable of it?</p>
            <p>I will conclude all with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent paſſage in the Wiſdom of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Chap. 6. 17, 18. <hi>The very true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Wiſdom is the deſire of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the care of diſcipline is love, and love is the keeping of her laws, and taking heed to her laws is the aſſurance of incorruption.</hi> The Summ of what I have ſaid upon this Argument amounts to this, that upon the terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel we can have no hope of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of our Sins, and Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs our Nature be renewed, and the Image of God, which is defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Sin, be repaired in us, and we be <hi>Created in Chriſt unto good works;</hi> That no Faith will avail to our Juſtification
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:37482:139"/>
and acceptance with God, but that which is <hi>made perfect by Charity,</hi> that is, by <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> and <hi>keeping the Commandments of God;</hi> by ſincere Obedience and Holineſs of Life, which notwithſtanding the inavoidable imperfection of it in this ſtate, will nevertheleſs be accepted with God, through the Merits of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>who hath loved us, and waſht us from our Sins in his own blood. To whom be Glory for ever.</hi>

               <q>For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of Men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs; becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter, the Apoſtle declares that he was particularly deſign'd and appointed by God to preach the Goſpel to the World, and that he was not aſhamed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:37482:141"/>
of his Miniſtry, notwithſtanding all the Reproach and Perſecution it was attended withall, and notwithſtanding the ſlight and undervaluing Opinion which the World had of the Doctrine which he preached, it being <hi>to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs;</hi> for tho' this might reflect ſome diſparagement upon it in the eſteem of ſenſual and carnal Men, yet to thoſe who weighed things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and conſider'd the Excellent End and Deſign of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the force and efficacy of it to that end, it would appear to be an Inſtrument admirably fitted by the Wiſdom of God, for the Reformation and Salvation of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And therefore he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. that how much ſoever it was deſpiſed by that ignorant and inconſiderate Age, <hi>he was not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt; becauſe it is the power of God unto Salvation, to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek;</hi> that is, the Doctrine of the Goſpel ſincerely believed and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is a moſt proper and powerful
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:37482:141"/>
means, deſigned by God for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind; not only of the Jews, but alſo of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>The Revelations which God had formerly made, were chiefly reſtrained to the Jewiſh Nation; but this great and laſt Revelation of the Goſpel, was equally Calculated for the benefit and advantage of all Mankind. The Goſpel indeed was firſt preached to the Jews, and from thence publiſh'd to the whole World; and as this Doctrine was deſign'd for the general benefit of Mankind, ſo it was very likely to be effectual to that end, being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument equally fitted for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole World, Gentiles as well as Jews; <hi>it is the power of God to Salvation to every one that believes, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſhew the efficacy of it, he inſtanceth in <hi>two</hi> things, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo powerful and effectual a Means for the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

               <hi>which is by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe. The Righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted;</hi> that is, the way which God hath taken to juſtifie Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and declare them Righteous, <hi>without the deeds of the Law,</hi> that is, without obſerving the Law of <hi>Moſes, is manifeſted,</hi> that is, is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel, (which is the ſame with what the Apoſtle had ſaid before, that <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed in the Goſpel) being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets,</hi> that is, the Righteouſneſs of God, or the Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners by Jeſus Chriſt, is clearly revealed in the Goſpel, being alſo in a more obſcure manner atteſted or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Old Teſtament, which he calls <hi>the Law and the Prophets;</hi> and this fully explains that difficult Phraſe of <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Goſpel from faith to faith;</hi> that is, by a gradual Revelation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more obſcurely foretold in the Old Teſtament, and clearly diſcovered in the New; ſo that theſe two paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are equivalent; <hi>In the Goſpel, the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from</hi>

And then the Citation which follows is very pertinent, <hi>as it is written, The Juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> for this Citation out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament plainly ſhews, that the way of Juſtification by Faith was there mentioned; or, as our Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>was witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets;</hi> and conſequently that this was a gradual diſcovery, which he calls <hi>a Revelation from faith to faith. The Juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> that is, good Men ſhall be ſaved by their Faith, ſhall be juſtified and eſteemed Righteous in the ſight of God, and finally ſaved by their Faith. And ſo the Apoſtle in the 5<hi>th</hi> Chapt. of this Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. calls our Juſtification by the faith of the Goſpel, <hi>the juſtification of Life,</hi> in oppoſition
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:37482:143"/>
to <hi>Condemnation</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> which very well explains that Saying of the Prophet, <hi>the Juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> I have been the longer upon this, that I might give ſome light to a very difficult and obſcure Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other Inſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle proves the Goſpel to be ſo powerful a means for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Salvation of Men is, that therein alſo the ſeverity of God againſt impenitent Sinners, as well as his grace and mercy in the juſtification of the penitent, is clearly revealed, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>For the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven, againſt all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs; becauſe that which may be known of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> The firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the grace of God in our Juſtification and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins paſt, is a moſt proper and powerful Argument to encourage us to Obedience for the future, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more likely to reclaim Men to their Duty, than the aſſurance of indemnity for paſt Crimes; and the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:37482:144"/>
other is one of the moſt effectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations in the World to deter Men from Sin, that <hi>the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From which words I ſhall obſerve theſe <hi>Six</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The infinite danger that a wicked and ſinful Courſe doth plainly expoſe Men to. <hi>The wrath of God</hi> is here ſaid to be <hi>revealed againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and unrighteouſneſs of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The clear and undoubted Revelation which the Goſpel hath made of this danger. <hi>The wrath of God</hi> againſt the Sins of Men, is ſaid to be <hi>revealed from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That every wicked and vicious practice doth expoſe Men to this great danger. <hi>The wrath of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>revealed againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unrighteouſneſs of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it is a very great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of Sin, for Men to offend
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:37482:144"/>
againſt the light of their own Minds. The Apoſtle here aggravates the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and wickedneſs of the Heathen World, that they did not live up to the knowledge which they had of God, but contradicted it in their lives, which he calls <hi>holding the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Natural knowledge which Men have of God, if they live wickedly, is a clear evidence of their</hi> holding the truth in unrighteouſneſs. <hi>The Apoſtle therefore chargeth them with</hi> holding the truth in unrighteouſneſs, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> that which may be known of God, is manifeſted in them, God having ſhewed it to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and Laſtly, that the clear Revelation of the wrath of God in the Goſpel, againſt the impiety and wickedneſs of Men, renders it a very powerful and likely means for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Salvation of Men. For the Apoſtle proves <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>the power of God to Salvation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>therein the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:37482:145"/>
               <hi>and unrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> that is, againſt all impenitent Sinners.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at the preſent, by God's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſpeak to the <hi>three</hi> firſt of theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The infinite danger that a wicked and ſinful Courſe doth plainly expoſe Men to. If there be a God that made the World, and governs it, and takes care of Mankind, and hath given them Laws and Rules to live by, he cannot but be greatly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the violation and tranſgreſſion of them; and certainly the diſpleaſure of God is the moſt dreadful thing in the World, and the effects of it the moſt inſupportable. The greateſt fear is from the greateſt danger, and the greateſt danger is from the greateſt power offended and enraged; and this is a Conſideration exceeding full of terror, that by a ſinful Courſe we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to the utmoſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the great and terrible God; for <hi>who knows the power of his wrath?</hi> and <hi>who may ſtand before him when once he is</hi>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:37482:145"/>
               <hi>angry? According to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt.) There is no paſſion in the Mind of Man that is more boundleſs and infinite than our <hi>fear,</hi> it is apt to make wild and frightful repreſentations of Evils, and to imagine them many times greater than really they are; but in this Caſe our imagination muſt fall ſhort of the truth and terrour of the thing; for the wrath of God doth far exceed the utmoſt jealouſie and ſuſpicion of the moſt fearful and guilty Conſcience, and the greateſt Sinner under his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt anguiſh and deſpair, cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or fear it more than there is Reaſon for; <hi>according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were only the wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of <hi>Men</hi> that the Sinner were expoſed to, there might be reaſon enough for fear, becauſe <hi>they</hi> have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times power enough to cruſh an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fender, and cruelty enough to fret every vein of his Body, and to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him in every part: but the wrath and vengeance of <hi>Men</hi> bears no Compariſon with the wrath of <hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Their paſſions are many times ſtrong and bluſtering; but their arm is but ſhort, and their power ſmall, <hi>they have not an arm like God, nor can they thunder with a voice like him.</hi> They may deſign conſiderable harm and miſchief to us; but it is not always in the power of their hand to wreak their Malice upon us, and to execute all the miſchief which their enraged Minds may prompt them to; the very utmoſt they can deſign, is to torment our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to take away our Lives, and when they have deſigned this, they may <hi>die</hi> firſt, and <hi>return to their duſt, and then their thoughts periſh with them,</hi> and all their malicious Deſigns are at an end; they are always under the Power and Government of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Being, and can go no further than he gives them leave. However if they do their worſt, and ſhoot all their Arrows at us, we cannot ſtand at the Mark long, their wrath will ſoon make an end of us, and ſet us free from all their Cruelty and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; <hi>they can but kill the Body, and after that they have no more that they can do;</hi> their moſt refined Malice cannot
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:37482:146"/>
reach our <hi>Spirits,</hi> no Weapon that can be formed by the utmoſt art of Man can pierce and wound our <hi>Souls;</hi> they can drive us out of <hi>this</hi> World, but they cannot purſue us into the <hi>other;</hi> ſo that at the worſt the Grave will be a Sanctuary to us, and Death a ſafe Retreat from all their Rage and Fury.</p>
            <p>But the wrath of God is not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any of theſe limits. <hi>Once hath God ſpoken</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> by an Elegant Hebrew Phraſe to expreſs the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the thing) <hi>once hath God ſpoken, and twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God,</hi> Pſal. 62. 11. <hi>He hath a Mighty Arm,</hi> and when he pleaſeth to ſtretch it out, none may ſtay it, nor <hi>ſay unto him what doſt thou;</hi> he hath power enough to make good all his threatnings; whatever he ſays, he is able to effect, and whatever he <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth</hi> he can <hi>bring to paſs;</hi> for <hi>his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will accompliſh all his pleaſure;</hi> he need but ſpeak the word, and it is done; for we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſiſt his Power, nor flye from it; if we flye to the utmoſt parts of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:37482:147"/>
Earth, his hand can reach us, for <hi>in his hand are all the corners of the Earth;</hi> if we take refuge in the Grave (and we cannot do that without his leave) thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his wrath can follow us, and there it will overtake us; for his power is not confined to <hi>this</hi> World, nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to our <hi>Bodies; after he hath kill'd, he can deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is that <hi>wrath of God</hi> which is <hi>revealed from Heaven,</hi> and which the Apoſtle chiefly intends, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Puniſhment of another World, this God hath threatned Sinners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; to expreſs which to us, as fully as words can do, he heaps up in the next Chapter ſo many weighty and terrible words, <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every Soul of Man that doth evil;</hi> in oppoſition to that great and glorious Reward of <hi>immortality and eternal life,</hi> which is promiſed to <hi>a patient continuance in well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>the wrath of God</hi> which is here denounced <hi>againſt the impiety and unrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> comprehends all
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:37482:147"/>
the Evils and Miſeries of this and the other World, which every Sinner is in danger of whilſt he continues im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent; for as according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Goſpel, <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of this Life, and of that which is to come,</hi> ſo impenitency in Sin expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Men to the Evils of both Worlds, to the Judgments of <hi>the Life that now is,</hi> and to the endleſs and intolerable torments of <hi>that which is to come.</hi> And what can be more dreadful than the diſpleaſure of an Almighty and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being? who can puniſh to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and <hi>who lives for ever,</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his wrath and vengeance upon Sinners; ſo that well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſider this all ye that forget God,</hi> that neglect him, and live in continual diſobedience to his Holy and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Laws; much more thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and affront him, and live in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual defiance of him. <hi>Will ye provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are ye ſtronger than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e?</hi> Think of it ſeriouſly, and forget him if you can, deſpiſe him if you dare;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:37482:148"/>
conſider this, leſt he take you into conſideration, and rouze like a Lion out of ſleep, and <hi>tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> This is the <hi>firſt</hi> Obſervation, the infinite danger that a wicked and ſinful Courſe doth expoſe Men to, <hi>the wrath of God,</hi> which doth not only ſignifie more than all the Evils that we know, but than all thoſe which the wildeſt fears and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions of our Minds can imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next thing obſervable, is the clear and undoubted Revelation which the Goſpel hath made of this danger, <hi>the wrath of God is revealed,</hi> &amp;c. By which the Apoſtle intimates to us, that this was but obſcurely known to the World before, at leaſt in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that clear diſcovery which the Goſpel hath now made of it; ſo that I may allude to that expreſſion in <hi>Job,</hi> which he applies to Death and the Grave, that <hi>Hell is naked before us, and deſtruction hath no covering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not but that Mankind had always apprehenſions and jealouſies of the danger of a wicked Life, and Sinners
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:37482:148"/>
were always afraid of the vengeance of God purſuing their evil Deeds, not only in this Life, but after it too; and tho' they had turned the Puniſhments of another World into ridiculous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yet the wiſer ſort of Mankind could not get it out of their Minds, that there was ſomething real un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; and that <hi>Ixion</hi>'s Wheel, which by a perpetual motion carried him about, and <hi>Siſyphus</hi> his Stone, which he was perpetually rolling up the Hill, and when he had got it near the top tumbled down, and ſtill cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him a new labour; and <hi>Tantalus</hi> his continual hunger and thirſt, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by a perpetual nearneſs of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and a perpetual diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and <hi>Prometheus</hi> his being chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Rock, with an Eagle or Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perpetually preying upon his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which grew as faſt as it was gnawed; I ſay even the wiſer among the Heathens lookt upon theſe as fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Repreſentations of ſomething that was Real, <hi>viz.</hi> the grievous and endleſs Puniſhment of Sinners, the not to be endured, and yet perpetually renewed Torments of another World;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:37482:149"/>
for in the midſt of all the ignorance and degeneracy of the Heathen World, Mens Conſciences did accuſe them when they did amiſs, and they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret fears and miſgivings of ſome mighty danger hanging over them, from the diſpleaſure of a ſuperior Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the apprehenſion of ſome great miſchiefs likely to follow their wicked actions, which ſome time or other would overtake them; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not always in this World, they dreaded them in the next. And this was the foundation of all thoſe Superſtitions, whereby the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pagans endeavoured ſo carefully to appeaſe their offended Deities, and to avert the Calamities which they feared they would ſend down upon them. But all this while they had no certain aſſurance by any clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revelation from God to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but only the jealouſies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions of their own Minds, naturally conſequent upon thoſe Notions which Men generally had of God, but ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and depraved by the Luſts and Vices of Men, and by the groſs and falſe conceptions which they had of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:37482:149"/>
God, that they only ſerv'd to make them ſuperſtitious, but were not clear and ſtrong enough to make them wiſely and ſeriouſly Religious. And to ſpeak the truth, the more knowing and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the Heathen World had brought all theſe things into great doubt and uncertainty, by the nicety and ſubtilty of Diſputes about them; ſo that it was no great wonder, that theſe Principles had no greater effect upon the Lives of Men, when their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of them were ſo dark and doubtful.</p>
            <p>But the Goſpel hath made a moſt clear and certain Revelation of theſe things to Mankind. It was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon Men's Hearts as the great Sanction of the Law of Nature, but the impreſſions of this were in a great meaſure blurred and worn out, ſo that it had no great power and efficacy upon the Minds and Manners of Men: but now it is clearly diſcovered to us, <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> which expreſſion may well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:37482:150"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Clearneſs of the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; <hi>the wrath of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The extraordinary Manner of it; it is ſaid to be <hi>revealed from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Certainty of it; not being the reſult of ſubtle and doubtful Reaſonings, but having a Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and Confirmation given to it, which is the proper meaning of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It imports the Clearneſs of the Diſcovery. The Puniſhment of Sinners in another World is not ſo obſcure a Matter as it was before, it is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared in the Goſpel, together with the particular Circumſtances of it, namely, that there is another Life after this, wherein Men ſhall receive the juſt recompence of Reward for all the actions done by them in this Life; that there is a particular time appointed, wherein God will call all the World to a ſolemn account, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:37482:150"/>
thoſe who are in their graves ſhall by a powerful voice be raiſed to Life, and thoſe who ſhall then be found alive ſhall be ſuddenly changed; <hi>when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Eternal and only begotten Son of God, who once came in great humility to ſave us, ſhall come again <hi>in Power, and great Glory,</hi> attended with <hi>his Mighty Angels,</hi> and <hi>all Nations ſhall be gathered before him,</hi> and all Mankind ſhall be ſeparated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Companies, <hi>the Righteous</hi> and <hi>the Wicked,</hi> who after a full Hearing, and fair Tryal, ſhall be ſentenced ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Actions, the one to <hi>Eternal Life and Happineſs,</hi> the other to <hi>Everlaſting Miſery and Torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Goſpel hath not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the thing to us, that there ſhall be a future Judgment; but for our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſurance and ſatisfaction in this Matter, and that theſe things might make a deep impreſſion, and ſtrike a great awe upon our Minds, God hath been pleaſed to reveal it to us with a great many particular Circumſtances, ſuch as are very worthy of God, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:37482:151"/>
apt to fill the Minds of Men with dread and aſtoniſhment, as often as they think of them.</p>
            <p>For the Circumſtances of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment revealed to us in the Goſpel, are very ſolemn and awful, not ſuch as the wild fancies and imaginations of Men would have been apt to have dreſt it up withal, ſuch as are the Fictions of the Heathen Poets, and the extravagancies of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> which tho' they be terrible enough, yet they are withal ridiculous; but ſuch as are every way becoming the Majeſty of the great God, and the Solemnity of that great Day, and ſuch as do not in the leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour of the vanity and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of humane imagination.</p>
            <p>For what more fair and equal, than that Men ſhould be tried by <hi>a Man</hi> like themſelves, one of the ſame Rank and Condition, that had experience of the Infirmities and Temptations of Humane Nature. So our Lord tells us, that <hi>the Father hath committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son, becauſe he is the Son of Man,</hi> and therefore cannot be excepted
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:37482:151"/>
againſt, as not being a fit and equal Judge. And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> offers as a clear proof of the equitable proceedings of that Day; <hi>God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Day, in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then what more congruous, than that the Son of God, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much pains for the Salvation of Men, and came into the World for that purpoſe, and had uſed all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable means for the Reformation of Mankind, I ſay what more congruous, than that this very Perſon ſhould be honoured by God to ſit in Judgment upon the World, and to Condemn thoſe, who after all the means that had been tried for their Recovery, would not Repent and be Saved. And what more proper, than that Men, who are to be judged for <hi>things done in the Body,</hi> ſhould be judged <hi>in the Body,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Reſurrection of the Dead ſhould precede the general Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:37482:152"/>
And what more Magnificent and ſuitable to this glorious Solemnity, than the awful Circumſtances which the Scripture mentions of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this great Judge; that he ſhall <hi>deſcend from Heaven</hi> in great Majeſty and Glory, attended with <hi>his mighty Angels,</hi> and that <hi>every eye ſhall ſee him;</hi> that upon his appearance, the frame of Nature ſhall be in an agony, and the whole World in <hi>Flame</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;</hi> that thoſe great and Glorious Bodies of Light ſhall be obſcured, and by degrees extinguiſh'd; <hi>the Sun ſhall be darkned, and the Moon turned into Blood, and all the Powers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhaken;</hi> yea, <hi>the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of God, and the ſolemn Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole World? The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes of the Judgment of another World, of <hi>the Eliſian Fields,</hi> and <hi>the Infernal Regions,</hi> how infinitely do they fall ſhort of the Majeſty of the Holy Scripture, and the deſcription there made of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and of <hi>the Great and Terrible Day of the Lord!</hi> ſo that in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are Childiſh and trifling; and yet perhaps he had the moſt regular and moſt govern'd imagination of any Man that ever lived, and obſerved the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Expreſſion of <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ath of God</hi> being <hi>Revealed from Heaven,</hi> doth not only imply the clear diſcovery of the thing, but likewiſe ſomething extraordinary in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Diſcovery. It is not only a Natural impreſſion upon the Minds of Men, that God will ſeverely puniſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inners; but he hath taken care that Mankind ſhould be inſtructed in this
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:37482:153"/>
Matter in a very particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner. He hath not left it to the Reaſon of Men to Collect it from the Conſideration of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Perfections, his Holineſs and Juſtice, and from the Conſideration of the promiſcuous adminiſtration of his Providence towards good and bad Men in this World; but he hath been pleaſed to ſend an extraordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Heaven, on purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this thing plainly to the World, <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> that is, God ſent <hi>his own Son from Heaven,</hi> on purpoſe to declare <hi>his wrath</hi> againſt all obſtinate and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners, that he might effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awaken the drouzie World to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; he hath ſent an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ambaſſador into the World, to give warning to all thoſe who continue in their Sins, of the Judgment of the great Day, and to ſummon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his dreadful Tribunal. So the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Acts 17. 30, 31. <hi>Now he commandeth all Men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>very where to Repent; becauſe he hath appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:37482:153"/>
               <hi>whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Expreſſion implies likewiſe the certainty of this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. If the wrath of God had only been declared in the Diſcourſes of Wiſe Men, tho' grounded upon very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Reaſon, yet it might have been brought into doubt by the contrary Reaſonings of Subtle and Diſputing Men: but to put the Matter out of all queſtion, we have a Divine Teſtimony for it, and God hath confirmed it from Heaven, by Signs, and Wonders, and Miracles, eſpecially by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead; for <hi>by this he hath given aſſurance unto all Men, that it is he who is ordained of God to judge the quick and dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee in what reſpect <hi>the wrath of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>reveal'd from Heaven,</hi> in that the Goſpel hath made a more clear, and particular, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſcovery of the Judgment of the great Day, than ever was made to the World before. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:37482:154"/>
               <hi>Third</hi> Obſervation, which I ſhall ſpeak but briefly to; namely, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Wicked and Vicious Practice doth expoſe Men to this dreadful danger. The Apoſtle inſtanceth in the two chief Heads to which the Sins of Men may be reduced, <hi>Impiety</hi> towards God, and <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> towards Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and therefore he is to be underſtood to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>the wrath of God</hi> againſt every particular kind of Sin, comprehended under theſe general Heads; ſo that no Man that allows himſelf in any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and wickedneſs of Life, can hope to eſcape the wrath of God. Therefore it concerns us to be entirely Religious, and <hi>to have reſpect to all God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and to take heed that we do not allow our ſelves in the practice of any kind of Sin whatſoever; becauſe the living in any one known Sin, is enough to expoſe us to the dreadful wrath of God. Tho' a Man be Juſt and Righteous in his Dealing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with Men, yet if he neglect the Worſhip and Service of God, this will certainly bring him under Condemnation: and on the other hand, tho' a Man may
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:37482:154"/>
ſerve God never ſo diligently and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, yet if he be defective in Righteouſneſs toward Men, if he deal falſly and fraudulently with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he ſhall not eſcape the wrath of God; tho' a Man pretend to never ſo much Piety and Devotion, yet if he be <hi>unrighteous, he ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> if any Man <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach and defraud his Brother in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Lord is the avenger of ſuch,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>So that here is a very powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to take Men off from all Sin, and to engage them to a conſtant and careful diſcharge of their whole Duty toward God and Men, and to Reform whatever is amiſs either in the frame and temper of their Minds, or in the Actions and Courſe of their Lives; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any kind of wickedneſs, any one ſort of vicious Courſe, lays Men open to the vengeance of God, and the puniſhments of another World; <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of Men;</hi> there is no exception in the Caſe, we muſt forſake all Sin, ſubdue
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:37482:155"/>
every Luſt, <hi>be holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> otherwiſe we can have no reaſonable hopes of eſcaping <hi>the wrath of God,</hi> and the damnation of Hell. But I proceed to the</p>

               <hi>Fourth</hi> Obſervation; namely, that it is a very great aggravation of Sin, for Men to offend againſt the light of their own Minds. The Apoſtle here aggravates the wickedneſs of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World, that they did not live up to that Knowledge which they had of God, but contradicted it in their Lives, <hi>holding the truth of God in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi> And that he ſpeaks here of the Heathen, is plain from his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, and the Character he gives of thoſe Perſons of whom he was ſpeaking, <hi>who hold the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs; becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewn it unto them;</hi> and this he proves, becauſe thoſe who were deſtitute of Divine Revelation, were not without all knowledge of God, being led by the ſight of this viſible World, to the knowledge of

            <p>And this is one of the higheſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of the Sins of Men, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt Knowledge, and that light which God hath ſet up in every Man's Mind. If Men wander and ſtumble in the dark, it is not to be wondred at, many times it is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and no care can prevent it: but in the light it is expected Men ſhould look before them, and diſcern their way. That Natural Light which the Heathens had, tho' it was but compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively dim and imperfect, yet the Apoſtle takes notice of it as a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their Idolatrous and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Practices. Thoſe natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which all Men have of God, if they had in any meaſure attended to them, and govern'd themſelves by them, might have been ſufficient to have preſerved them from diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deity, by <hi>worſhiping Creatures inſtead of God;</hi> the common light of Nature was enough to have diſcovered
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:37482:157"/>
to them the evil of thoſe lewd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural practices, which many of them were guilty of: but they <hi>detained</hi> and <hi>ſuppreſt the truth</hi> moſt <hi>injuriouſly,</hi> and would not ſuffer it to have its natural and proper influence upon them; and this is that which left them <hi>without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi> that from the light of Nature they had knowledge enough to have done better, and to have preſerved them from thoſe great Crimes which were ſo common among them.</p>
            <p>And if this was ſo great an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the impiety and wickedneſs of the Heathen, and left them <hi>without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe;</hi> what Apology can be made for the impiety and unrighteouſneſs of Chriſtians, who have ſo ſtrong and clear a light to diſcover to them their duty, and the danger of neglecting it, to whom <hi>the wrath of God is</hi> plainly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men?</hi> The Truths of the Goſpel are ſo very clear and powerful, and ſuch an improvement of Natural light, that Men muſt uſe great force and violence to ſuppreſs them, and to hinder the efficacy of them upon
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:37482:158"/>
their lives. And this is a certain Rule, by how much the greater our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by ſo much the leſs is our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and ſo much the greater Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is due to our faults. So our Lord hath told us, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47. <hi>That Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant which knew his Lord's will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. <hi>If ye were blind</hi> (ſays our Saviour to the Jews) <hi>ye ſhould have no ſin.</hi> So much ignorance as there is of our Duty, ſo much abatement of the wilfulneſs of our faults: but <hi>if we ſin wilfully, after we have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, there remains no more Sacrifice for ſin, but a fearful expectation of Judgment and fiery indignation,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 10. 26, 27. <hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that Men cannot pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for their faults, after ſo clear a revelation of the will of God, as is made to Mankind by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And upon this Conſideration it is, that our Saviour doth ſo aggravate the impenitency and unbelief of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:37482:158"/>
becauſe it was in oppoſition to all the advantages of Knowledge, which can be imagined to be afforded to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>John</hi> 15. 22, 23, 24. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin;</hi> that is, in Compariſon their Sin had been much more excuſable; <hi>but now they have no cloak for their ſin. He that hateth me, hateth my Father alſo. If I had not done among them the works which none other Man did, they had not had ſin; but now have they both ſeen, and hated both me, and my Father.</hi> How is that? Our Saviour means, that they had now ſinned againſt all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of knowing the will of God, that Mankind could poſſibly have; at once oppoſing Natural Light, which was the diſpenſation of <hi>the Father;</hi> and the cleareſt revelation of God's will, in the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel by <hi>his Son; Now have they both ſeen and hated both Me and my Father.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There is a Natural Knowledge of God, and of the Duty we owe to him, which the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>that of God which is obvious to be known</hi> by the light of Nature, and is as much as is abſolutely neceſſary for us to know. There is ſomething of God that is incomprehenſible, and beyond the reach of our Underſtandings; but his <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Eſſential Perfections</hi> may be known, which he calls his <hi>Eternal Power and Godhead; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nown to Men;</hi> the contrary
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:37482:160"/>
whereof <hi>Socinus</hi> poſitively maintains, tho' therein he be forſaken by moſt of his Followers; an Opinion, in my Judgment, very unworthy of one, who, not without Reaſon, was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo great a Maſter of Reaſon; and (tho' I believe he did not ſee it) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt Foundation of all Religion, which, when the Natural Notions of God are once taken away, will certainly want its beſt ſupport. Beſides that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any Natural Knowledge of God, and his Eſſential Perfections, he freely gives away one of the moſt plauſible grounds of oppoſing the Doctrine of the Trinity. But becauſe this is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Conſequence, and he was a great Man, and is not to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by contempt, but by better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it can be found; I will Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Reaſons for this Opinion, and return a particular Anſwer to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſays that if the Knowledge of God were Natural, it would not be <hi>of Faith;</hi> but the Apoſtle ſays, that <hi>we muſt believe that he is.</hi> The force of which Argument, if it have any,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:37482:161"/>
lies in this, that the Object of Faith is Divine Revelation, and therefore we cannot be ſaid to <hi>believe</hi> what we <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally know.</hi> The Schoolmen indeed ſay ſo; but the Scripture uſeth the word <hi>Faith</hi> more largely, for <hi>a rela perſwaſion</hi> of any thing, whether grounded upon Senſe, or Reaſon, or Divine Revelation. And our Saviour's Speech to <hi>Thomas, Becauſe thou haſt ſeen, thou haſt believed,</hi> does ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that a Man may <hi>believe</hi> what he <hi>ſees;</hi> and if ſo, what ſhould hinder, but that a Man may be ſaid to <hi>believe</hi> what he <hi>Naturally knows;</hi> that is, be really perſwaded that there is a God from <hi>Natural</hi> Light?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His next Argument is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame Apoſtle concludes <hi>Enoch</hi> to have believed God, becauſe he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, <hi>and without Faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe him.</hi> From whence he ſays it is certain that Men may be without this Belief, which if it be <hi>Natural</hi> they cannot. Indeed if the Apoſtle had ſaid, that whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a God, muſt of neceſſity obey and pleaſe him, then the Inference had been good, that all Men do not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:37482:161"/>
Naturally believe a God, becauſe it is certain they do not pleaſe him: but it is not good the other way, no more than if a Man ſhould argue thus, that becauſe whoever acts rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, muſt be endowed with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, therefore Men are not Naturally endowed with Reaſon. For as Men may Naturally be endowed with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet not always make uſe of it; ſo Men may Naturally know and believe a God, and yet not be careful to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Third</hi> Argument is, that the Scripture ſays that there are ſome that do not believe a God, for which he cites that of <hi>David, The Fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God;</hi> which certainly proves, that bad Men live ſo, as if they believed there were no God; nay, it may farther import, that they endeavour as much as they can, to ſtifle and extinguiſh the belief of a God in their Minds, and would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade themſelves there is no God, becauſe it is convenient for them there ſhould be none; and whether <hi>David</hi> meant ſo or not, it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſome may arrive to that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:37482:162"/>
height of Impiety, as for a time at leaſt, and in ſome moods, to disbelieve a God, and to be very confident of the Arguments on that ſide. But what then? Is the Knowledge and Belief of a God therefore not Natural to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? Nature it ſelf, as conſtant and uniform as it is, admits of ſome Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities and Exceptions, in Effects that are meerly Natural, much more in thoſe which have ſomething in them that is voluntary, and depends upon the good or bad uſe of our Reaſon and Underſtanding; and there is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from what is <hi>Monſtrous,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what is <hi>Natural.</hi> It is Natural for Men to have five Fingers upon a Hand, and yet ſome are born other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: but in voluntary Agents, that which is Natural may be perverted, and in a great meaſure extinguiſht in ſome particular inſtances; ſo that there is no force at all in this Objection.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt Argument is, that there have not only been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, but whole Nations who have had no ſenſe, nor ſo much as ſuſpicion of a Deity. This I confeſs
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:37482:162"/>
were of great force, if it were true; and for the proof of this, he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the inſtance of <hi>Braſil</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> But I utterly deny the matter of fact and Hiſtory, and challenge any Man to bring good teſtimony, not only of any Nation, but of any City in the World, that ever were <hi>profeſſed Atheiſts.</hi> I know this was affirmed of ſome part of <hi>Braſil,</hi> by ſome of the firſt Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers, who yet at the ſame time owned, that theſe very People did moſt expreſly believe the immortality of the Soul, and the Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of another Life; Opinions which no Man can well reconcile with the denial and disbelief of a Deity. But to put an end to this Argument, later and more perfect diſcoveries have found this not to be true, and do aſſure us upon better acquaintance with thoſe barbarous People, that they are deeply poſſeſt with the belief of <hi>One ſupream God, who made and governs the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus given a particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Socinus</hi> his Arguments againſt the Natural knowledge of a God, I will now briefly offer ſome Arguments
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:37482:163"/>
for it. And to prove that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of a God is natural to Mankind, my</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> Argument ſhall be from the Univerſal Conſent in this matter, of all Nations in all Ages. And this is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of great force, there being no better way to prove any thing to be natural to any kind of Being, than if it be generally found in the whole Kind. <hi>Omnium conſenſus naturae vox eſt,</hi> 
               <q>the Conſent of all is the voice of Nature,</q> ſaith <hi>Tully.</hi> And indeed by what other Argument can we prove that Reaſon, and Speech, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Society are Natural to Men; but that theſe belong to the whole Kind?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Unleſs the Knowledge of God and his Eſſential Perfections be Natural, I do not ſee what ſufficient and certain foundation there can be of Revealed Religion. For unleſs we naturally know God to be a Being of all perfection, and conſequently that whatever he ſays is true, I cannot ſee what Divine Revelation can ſignifie.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:37482:163"/>
For God's revealing or declaring ſuch a thing to us, is no neceſſary Argument that it is ſo, unleſs antecedently to this Revelation, we be poſſeſt firmly with this Principle, that whatever God ſays is true. And whatever is known antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to Revelation, muſt be known by Natural Light, and by Reaſonings and Deductions from Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I might further add to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the only ſtandard and meaſure to judge of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to diſtinguiſh between what are true, and what are counterfeit, are the Natural Notions which Men have of God, and of his Eſſential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Notion of a God be not Natural, I do not ſee how Men can have any Natural Notion of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Moral Good and Evil, Juſt, and Unjuſt. For if I do not naturally know there is a God, how can I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally know that there is any Law obliging to the one, and forbidding the other? all Law and Obligation to Obedience, neceſſarily ſuppoſing the Authority of a Superiour Being. But

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> My laſt Argument I ground upon the words of the Apoſtle in my Text, <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them. Is manifeſt in them,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>among them,</hi> God hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſted it to Mankind. And which way hath God done this? by Revelation? or by the Natural Light of Reaſon? He tells us at the 20<hi>th ver. For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen;</hi> that is, God, who in himſelf is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ever ſince he hath Created the World, hath given a viſible Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of himſelf, that is, of <hi>his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Godhead, being underſtood by the things which are made.</hi> The plain
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:37482:165"/>
ſenſe of the whole is, that this wiſe and wonderful frame of the World, which cannot Reaſonably be aſcribed to any other Cauſe but God, is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Demonſtration to all Mankind, of an Eternal and Powerful Being that was the Author and Framer of it. The only Queſtion now is, Whether this Text ſpeak of the Knowledge of God by particular Revelation, or by Natural Light and Reaſon, from the contemplation of the Works of God? <hi>Socinus</hi> having no other way to avoid the force of this Text, will needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the Knowledge of God by the Revelation of the Goſpel. His words are theſe; <q>The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays in this place, that the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Godhead of God, that is, that which God would always have us to do (for <hi>the Godhead</hi> is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this ſenſe) and his Eternal Power, that is, his Promiſe which never fails, (in which ſenſe he ſaid a little before that the Goſpel is the Power of God) theſe I ſay, which were never ſeen by Men, that is, were never known to them ſince the Creation of the World, are known
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:37482:165"/>
by his Works; that is, by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Operation of God, and Divine Men, eſpecially of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</q> Theſe are his very words, and now I refer it to any indifferent Judgment, whether this be not a very forced and conſtrained Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Text; and whether that which I have before given, be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more free and natural, and every way more agreeable to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſenſe of the words, and the ſcope of the Apoſtle's Argument. For he plainly ſpeaks of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and proves them to be <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> becauſe <hi>they held the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and having a Natural Knowledge of God, from the contemplation of his Works, and the things which are made, <hi>they did not glorifie him as God.</hi> And therefore I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to give any other Anſwer to it; for by the abſurd violence of it in every part, it confutes it ſelf more effectually than any Diſcourſe about it can do.</p>
            <p>I have been the larger upon this, becauſe it is a Matter of ſo great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and lies at the bottom of all
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:37482:166"/>
Religion. For the Natural Knowledge which Men have of God, is, when all is done, the ſureſt and faſteſt hold that Religion hath on Humane Nature. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, how ſhould God judge that part of the World who are wholly deſtitute of Divine Revelation, if they had no Natural Knowledge of him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently could not be under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and government of any Law? For <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and where Men are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the breach of no Law, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Judged and Condemned for it; for <hi>the Judgment of God is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this being eſtabliſht, that Men have a Natural Knowledge of God; if they contradict it by their Life and Practice, they are guilty of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the truth of God in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> For by this Argument the Apoſtle proves the <hi>Heathen</hi> to be guilty of <hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe notwithſtanding the Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they had of God <hi>by the things which were made,</hi> they lived in
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:37482:166"/>
the practice of groſs Idolatry, and the moſt abominable Sins and Vices.</p>
            <p>And this concerns us much more, who have the glorious Light of the Goſpel added to the Light of Nature. For if they who offended againſt the Light of Nature, were liable to the judgment of God, of how much ſorer Puniſhment ſhall we be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, if we neglect thoſe infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the Revelation of the Goſpel hath ſuperadded to Natural Light? He hath now ſet our Duty in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt Light that ever was afforded to Mankind, ſo that if we will not now Believe and Repent, there is no Remedy for us, but we muſt <hi>die in our ſins; if we ſin wilfully, after</hi> ſo much <hi>knowledge of the truth, there remains no more Sacrifice for Sin; but a fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery indignation to conſume us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Summ of what hath been ſaid on this Argument, is briefly this; that Men have a Natural Knowledge of God, and of thoſe great Duties which reſult from the Knowledge of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:37482:167"/>
him; ſo that whatever Men ſay and pretend, as to the main things of Religion, <hi>the Worſhip of God, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs toward Men,</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide Divine Revelation, we are all Naturally convinc'd of our Duty, and of what we ought to do, and thoſe who live in a bad Courſe, need only be put in mind of what they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally know, better than any body elſe can tell them, that they are in a bad Courſe; ſo that I may appeal to all wicked Men from <hi>themſelves,</hi> raſh, and heated, and intoxicated with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Vanity, tranſported and hurried away by Luſt and Paſſion; to <hi>themſelves</hi> ſerious and compoſed, and in a cool and conſiderate temper. And can any ſober Man forbear to follow the Convictions of his own Mind, and to reſolve to do what he inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to as beſt? Let us but be true to our ſelves, and obey the Dictates of our own Minds, and give leave to our own Conſciences to Counſel us, and tell us what we ought to do, and we ſhall be <hi>a Law to our ſelves.</hi> I proceed to the</p>

               <hi>Sixth</hi> and laſt Obſervation, namely, that the clear Revelation of the wrath of God in the Goſpel, againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and unrighteouſneſs of Men, is one principal thing, which renders it ſo very powerful and likely a means for the Salvation of Mankind. For the Apoſtle inſtanceth in <hi>two</hi> things, which give the Goſpel ſo great an advantage to this purpoſe, the Mercy of God to Penitent Sinners, and his Severity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Impenitent; both which are ſo fully and clearly revealed in the Goſpel. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to Salvation, to every one that believeth, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The other Reaſon which he gives of the Goſpel's being <hi>the power of God to Salvation,</hi> is the plain declaration of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:37482:168"/>
the Severity of God toward Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners, <hi>Becauſe therein</hi> alſo <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men.</hi> The force of which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will appear, if we conſider theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Declarations of the Goſpel in this Matter are ſo plain and expreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they are very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and terrible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there is no ſafety or hope of impunity for Men that go on and continue in their Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That this Argument will take hold of the moſt deſperate and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ligate Sinners, and ſtill retain its force upon the Minds of Men, when all other Conſiderations fail, and are of little or no efficacy. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That no Religion in the World can urge this Argument with
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:37482:168"/>
that force and advantage that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity does.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the declarations of the Goſpel in this Matter, are moſt plain and expreſs; and that not only againſt Sin and Wickedneſs in general, but againſt particular Sins and Vices; ſo that no Man that lives in any Evil and Vicious Courſe, can be ignorant of his danger. Our Lord hath told us in general, what ſhall be the Doom of the Workers of Iniquity, yea, tho' they may have owned him, and made profeſſion of his Name,</hi> Mat. <hi>7. 21.</hi> Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, &amp;c. then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work Iniquity. <hi>Math. 13. 49, 50.</hi> So ſhall it be at the end of the World, the Angels ſhall come forth and ſever the Wicked from among the Juſt, and ſhall caſt them into the furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, <hi>Math. 25. 46.</hi> The Wicked ſhall go away
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:37482:169"/>
into Everlaſting Puniſhment, but the Righteous into Life Eternal. <hi>Joh. 5. 28, 29.</hi> The hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done evil, unto the Reſurrection of Damnatiom. <hi>Rom. 2. 6. St.</hi> Paul <hi>tells us that there is</hi> a Day of wrath, and of the Revelation of the Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who will render to every Man according to his deeds; to them who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of Man that doth evil. <hi>2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8, 9. That</hi> the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſht with everlaſting deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his Power. <hi>Nothing can be more plain and expreſs than theſe general declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the wrath of God againſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that there is a Day of Judgment appointed, and a Judge conſtituted to take cogniſance of the Actions of Men,</hi>

            <p>Our Saviour likewiſe tells us, that Men ſhall not only be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt for Sins of <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> but for the bare <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and <hi>Neglect</hi> of their Duty, eſpecially in Works of Mercy and Charity; for <hi>not feeding the hungry,</hi> and the like, as we ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and that for the omiſſion of theſe, he will paſs that terrible Sentence, <hi>Depart ye Curſed,</hi> &amp;c. So that it nearly concerns us to be careful of our whole Life, of all our Words and Actions, ſince the Goſpel hath ſo plainly and expreſly declared, that <hi>for all theſe things God will bring us into Judgment.</hi> And if the threatnings of the Goſpel be true, <hi>What manner of Perſons ought we to be, in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs?</hi>

that diſmal Priſon, into which Wicked and Impure Souls are to be thruſt, and the miſery they muſt there endure, without the leaſt ſpark of Comfort, or glimering of Hope, how they wail and groan under the intolerable wrath of God, the inſolent ſcorn and cruelty of Devils, the ſevere laſhes and ſtings, the raging anguiſh and horrible deſpair of their own minds, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without pity, and without hope of ever ſeeing an end of that miſery, which yet is unſupportable for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; could I repreſent theſe things to you according to the terror of them, what effect muſt they have upon us? and with what patience could any Man bear to think of plunging himſelf into this miſery? and by his own wilful fault and folly to endanger his <hi>coming into this place</hi> and ſtate <hi>of torments?</hi> Eſpecially if we conſider in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> place, that the Goſpel hath likewiſe declared, that there is no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this miſery, no hopes of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if Men go on and continue in their Sins. The terms of the Goſpel in this are peremptory, that <hi>except we Repent,</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:37482:173"/>
               <hi>we ſhall periſh;</hi> that <hi>without holineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> that <hi>the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And this is a very preſſing Conſideration, and brings the Matter to a ſhort and plain iſſue. Either we muſt leave our Sins, or die in them; either we muſt Repent of them, or be Judged for them; either we muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orſake our Sins, and break off that wicked Courſe which we have lived in, or we muſt quit all hopes of Heaven and Happineſs, nay we cannot <hi>eſcape the damnation of Hell.</hi> The clear revelation of a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo preſſing an Argument to Repentance, as no Man can in Reaſon reſiſt, that hath not a mind to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians) he ſtraightly chargeth all Men every where to Repent, becauſe he hath appointed a Day in the which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men may cheat themſelves, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be deluded by others, about ſeveral means and devices of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling a wicked Life, with the hopes of Heaven and Eternal Salvation; as by mingling ſome pangs of ſorrow for
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:37482:173"/>
Sin, and ſome hot Fits of Devotion, with a ſinful Life; which is only the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of a wicked Courſe, without Reformation and amendment of Life: but <hi>let no Man deceive you with vain words;</hi> for our Bleſſed Saviour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided no other ways to ſave Men, but upon the terms of Repentance, and Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Argument takes hold of the moſt deſperate and profligate Sinners, and ſtill retains its force upon the Minds of Men, when almoſt all other Conſiderations fail, and have loſt their efficacy upon us. Many Men are gone ſo far in an Evil Courſe, that neither ſhame of their Vices, nor the love of God and Virtue, nor the hopes of Heaven are of any force with them, to reclaim them and bring them to a better Mind: but there is one handle yet left, whereby to lay hold of them, and that is their <hi>Fear.</hi> This is a Paſſion that lies deep in our Nature, being founded in ſelf-preſervation, and ſticks ſo cloſe to us, that we cannot quit our ſelves of it, nor ſhake it off. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

all Obligations of gratitude, Men may harden their Foreheads, and Conquer all ſenſe of ſhame: but they can never perfectly ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le and ſubdue their <hi>Fears,</hi> they can hardly ſo extinguiſh <hi>the fear of Hell,</hi> but that ſome ſparks of that Fire will ever and anon be flying about in their Conſciences, eſpecially when they are made ſober, and brought to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by affliction, and by the preſent apprehenſions of Death, have a nearer ſight of another World. And if it was ſo hard for the Heathen to Conquer theſe apprehenſions, how much harder muſt it be to Chriſtians, who have ſo much greater aſſurance of theſe things, and to whom <hi>the wrath of God is</hi> ſo clearly <hi>revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> No Religion in the World ever urged this Argument upon Men, with that force and advantage which Chriſtianity does. The Philoſophy of the Heathen gave Men no ſteady aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the thing; the moſt knowing Perſons among them were not agreed about a Future State; the greateſt part of them ſpake but doubtfully concerning
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:37482:174"/>
another Life. And beſides the natural jealouſies and ſuſpicions of Mankind concerning theſe things, they had only ſome fair probabilities of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Authority of their Poets, who talkt they knew not what about <hi>the Elizian Fields,</hi> and <hi>the Infernal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> and <hi>the three Judges of Hell;</hi> ſo that the Wiſeſt among them, had hardly aſſurance enough in themſelves of the truth of the thing, to preſs it upon others with any great confidence, and therefore it was not likely to have any great efficacy upon the generality of Mankind.</p>
            <p>As for the Jewiſh Religion, tho' that ſuppoſed and took for granted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of another World, as a Principle of Natural Religion; yet in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> there was no particular and expreſs Revelation of the Life of the World to come; and what was dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from it, was by remote and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Conſequence. Temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings it had many and clear, and their Eyes were ſo dazled with theſe, that it is probable that the generality of them did but little conſider

               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:37482:176"/>
a Future State, 'till they fell into great temporal Calamities under the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empires, whereby they were almoſt neceſſarily awakened to the Conſideration and hopes of a better Life, to relieve them under their preſent Evils and Sufferings; and yet even in that time they were divided into two great Factions about this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the one affirming, and the other as conſidently denying any Life after this. But <hi>the Goſpel hath brought Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o light,</hi> and we are aſſured <hi>from Heaven</hi> of the truth and reality of another State, and a Future Judgment. The Son of God was ſent into the World to preach this Doctrine, and roſe again from the Dead, and was taken up into Heaven, for a viſible demonſtration to all Mankind of another Life after this, and conſequently of a Future Judgment, which no Man ever doubted of, that did firmly believe a Future State.</p>
            <p>The Sum of all that I have ſaid is this; the Goſpel hath plainly declared to us, that the only way to Salvation is by forſaking our Sins, and living a Holy and Virtuous Life; and the moſt
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:37482:176"/>
effectual Argument in the World to perſwade Men to this, is the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the infinite danger that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Courſe expoſeth Men to, ſince <hi>the wrath of God</hi> continually hangs over Sinners, and if they continue in their Sins, will certainly fall upon them, and overwhelm them with Miſery; and he that is not moved by this Argument, is loſt to all intents and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>All that now remains, is to urge this Argument upon Men, and from the ſerious Conſideration of it, to perſwade them to Repent, and reform their wicked Lives. And was there ever Age wherein this was more needful? when <hi>Iniquity doth</hi> not only <hi>abound,</hi> but even <hi>rage</hi> among us; when Infidelity and Profaneneſs, and all manner of Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vice appears ſo boldly and openly, and Men commit the greateſt Abominations without bluſhing at them; when Vice hath got ſuch head, that it can hardly bear to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Remedies of them.</q> Our Vices are grown to a prodigious and intolerable height, and yet Men hardly have the patience to hear of them; and ſurely a Diſeaſe is then dangerous indeed, when it cannot bear the ſeverity that is neceſſary to a Cure. But yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, we who are the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God to Men, to warn them of their ſin and danger, muſt not keep ſilence, and ſpare to tell them both of their ſins, and of the Judgment of God which hangs over them; that <hi>God will viſit for theſe things,</hi> and that <hi>his Soul will be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this.</hi> At leaſt we may have leave to warn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are not yet <hi>run to the ſame exceſs of riot, to ſave themſelves from this untoward generation. God's Judgments are abroad in the Earth,</hi> and call aloud upon us, <hi>to learn Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is but a ſmall Conſideration, in Compariſon of the Judgment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, which we who call our ſelves Chriſtians, do profeſs to believe, as one of the Chief Articles of our Faith.

               <q>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TWO Things make up Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of it; and the <hi>Firſt</hi> is wholly in order to the <hi>Second;</hi> and God hath not revealed to us the Knowledge of Himſelf and his Will, meerly for the improvement of our Underſtanding, but for the bettering of our Hearts and Lives; not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Minds with the ſpeculations of Religion and Virtue, but to form
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:37482:180"/>
and govern our Actions. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words, our bleſſed Saviour does from a particular inſtance take occaſion to ſettle a general Concluſion, namely, that Religion doth mainly conſiſt in Practice, and that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Doctrine, without the real effects of it upon our Lives, will bring no Man to Heaven. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, our great Lord and Maſter, to teſtifie his Love to his Diſciples, and to give them a lively Inſtance and Example of that great Virtue of Humility, is pleaſed to condeſcend to a very low and mean Office, ſuch as was uſed to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Servants to their Maſters, and not by the Maſter to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; namely, to waſh their feet; and when he had done this, he asks them if they did underſtand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſtrange Action. <hi>Know ye what I have done unto you? ye call me Maſter, and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am; if I then your Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:37482:180"/>
               <hi>to waſh one anothers feet; for I have given you an Example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the Servant is not greater than the Lord, neither he that is ſent, greater than he that ſent him; if ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> As if he had ſaid, This which I have now done, is eaſie to be underſtood, and ſo likewiſe are all thoſe other Chriſtian Graces and Virtues, which I have heretofore by my Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample recommended to you; but it is not enough to <hi>know</hi> theſe things, but ye muſt likewiſe <hi>do</hi> them. The End and the Life of all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Religion, is to put in practice what we know. It is neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that we ſhould know our Duty, but Knowledge alone will never bring us to that Happineſs, which Religion deſigns to make us partakers of, if our Knowledge have not its due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per influence upon our Lives. Nay, ſo far will our Knowledge be from making us Happy, if it be ſeparated from the Virtues of a good Life, that it will prove one of the heavieſt aggravations
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:37482:181"/>
of our miſery; and it is as if he had ſaid, <hi>if ye know theſe things, wo be unto you, if ye do them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe words then, I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe <hi>three</hi> things, which I ſhall ſpeak but briefly to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Knowledge of God's Will, and our Duty, is neceſſary to the practice of it; <hi>If ye know theſe things,</hi> which ſuppoſeth that we muſt <hi>know</hi> our Duty, before we can <hi>do</hi> it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Knowledge of our Duty, and the Practice of it, may be, and too often are ſeparated. This likewiſe the Text ſuppoſeth, that Men may <hi>know</hi> their Duty, and yet not do it, and that this is very frequent, which is the Reaſon why our Saviour gives this Caution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Practice of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the doing of what we know to be our Duty, is the only way to Happineſs; <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re ye if ye do them.</hi> I begin with the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:37482:181"/>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, namely, That the Knowledge of God's Will and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is neceſſary in order to the Practice of it. The truth of this Propoſition is ſo clear and evident at firſt view, that nothing can obſcure it, and bring it in queſtion, but to endeavour to prove it; and therefore inſtead of ſpending time in that, I ſhall take occaſion from it, juſtly to reprove that prepoſterous Courſe which is taken, and openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and juſtified by ſome, as the ſafeſt and beſt way to make Men Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and to bring them to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; namely, by taking away from them the Means of Knowledge; as if the beſt way to bring Men <hi>to do the Will of God,</hi> were to keep them from <hi>knowing it.</hi> For what elſe can be the meaning of that Maxim ſo currant in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion?</hi> or of that ſtrange and injurious practice of theirs, of Locking up from the People that great Storehouſe and Treaſury of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge, <hi>the Holy Scriptures,</hi> in an unknown Tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:37482:182"/>
I know very well, that in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this hard uſage of their People, it is pretended that Knowledge is apt to puff Men up, to make them Proud and Contentious, Refractory and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and Heretical, and what not? and particularly, that the free and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar uſe of the Holy Scriptures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the People, hath miniſtred occaſion to the People, of falling into great and dangerous Errors, and of making great diſturbance and diviſions among Chriſtians. For anſwer to this pretence, I deſire theſe <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> things may be Conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That unleſs this be the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary</hi> effect of Knowledge in Religion, and of the free uſe of the Holy Scriptures, there is no force in this Reaſon; and if this be the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> effect of this Knowledge, then this Reaſon will reach a great way farther, than thoſe who make uſe of it are willing it ſhould.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this is not the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> effect of Knowledge in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:37482:182"/>
Religion, but only <hi>accidental,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Men's abuſe of it; for which the thing it ſelf is not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Effects and Conſequences of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> are equally pernicious, and much more certain and unavoidable, than thoſe which are accidentally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That if this Reaſon be good, it is much ſtronger for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Scriptures from the Prieſts and the Learned, than from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That this danger was as great, and as well known in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, and yet they took a quite contrary Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I deſire it may be conſider'd, that unleſs this be the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> effect of Knowledge in Religion, and of the free uſe of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there is no force in this Reaſon; for that which is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or <hi>highly</hi>

               <hi>uſeful,</hi> ought not to be taken away, becauſe it is liable to be perverted, and abuſed to ill purpoſes. If it ought, then not only Knowledge in Religion, but all other Knowledge ought to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſuppreſt; for all Knowledge is apt to <hi>puff up,</hi> and liable to be abuſed to many ill purpoſes. At this rate, Light, and Liberty, and Reaſon, yea and Life it ſelf, ought all to be taken away, becauſe they are all greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by many Men, to ſome ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes or other; ſo that unleſs theſe ill effects do <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſpring from Knowledge in Religion, the Objection from them is of no force; and if they do <hi>neceſſarily</hi> flow from it, then this Reaſon will reach a great way further than thoſe that make uſe of it are willing it ſhould; for if this be true, that the Knowledge of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it is Revealed in the Holy Scriptures, is <hi>of its own Nature</hi> ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, as to make Men proud and Contentious, and Heretical, and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to Authority, then the blame of all this would fall upon our bleſſed Saviour, for revealing ſo pernicious a Doctrine, and upon his Apoſtles, for
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:37482:183"/>
publiſhing this Doctrine in a known Tongue to all Mankind, and thereby laying the Foundation of perpetual Schiſms and Hereſies in the Church.</p>

                  </gap>
               </hi> But this is not the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> effect of Knowledge in Religion, but only <hi>accidental,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Mens abuſe of it, for which the thing it ſelf ought not to be taken away. And thus much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they will grant, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any face be denied; and if ſo, then the Means of Knowledge are not to be denied, but only Men are to be cautioned not to prevert and abuſe them. And if any Man abuſe the Holy Scriptures to the Patronizing of Error or Hereſie, or to any other bad purpoſe, he does it at his peril, and muſt give an account to God for it, but ought not to be deprived of the means of Knowledge, for fear he ſhould make an ill uſe of them. We muſt not hinder Men from being <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> to preſerve them from being <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and put out Mens Eyes, for fear they ſhould ſome time or other
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:37482:184"/>
take upon them to diſpute their way with their Guides.</p>
            <p>I remember that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. takes notice of this <hi>accidental</hi> inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that <hi>it puffeth up,</hi> and that this Pride occaſioned great Contentions and Diviſions among them: but the Remedy which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes againſt this miſchief of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is not to with-hold from Men the Means of it, and to Celebrate the Service of God, the Prayers of the Church, and the Reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>in an unknown Tongue,</hi> but quite contrary, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. of that Epiſtle, he ſtrictly enjoyns that the Service of God in the Church be ſo performed, as may be for the <hi>edification</hi> of the People, which he ſays cannot be, if it be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>in an unknown Tongue;</hi> and the Remedy he preſcribes againſt the <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental</hi> miſchief and inconvenience of Knowledge, is not <hi>Ignorance;</hi> but <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> to govern their Knowledge, and to help them to make a right uſe of it; <hi>ver.</hi> 20. of that Chapt. after he had declared that the Service of God ought to be performed <hi>in a known</hi>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:37482:184"/>
               <hi>Tongue,</hi> he immediately adds, <hi>Brethren be not Children in underſtanding; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-it in malice be ye Children, but in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be ye Men.</hi> He commends Knowledge, he encourageth it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of all Chriſtians; ſo far is he from checking the purſuit of it, and depriving the People of the Means of it. And indeed there is nothing in the Chriſtian Religion, but what is fit for every Man to know, becauſe there is nothing in it, but what is deſigned to promote Holineſs, and a good Life; and if Men make any other uſe of their Knowledge, it is their own fault, for it certainly tends to make Men good; and being ſo uſeful and neceſſary to ſo good a purpoſe, Men ought not to be debarr'd of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let it be Conſider'd, that the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> Effects and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of <hi>ignorance</hi> are equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, and much more certain and unavoidable, than thoſe which are <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally</hi> occaſioned by <hi>Knowledge;</hi> for ſo far as a Man is ignorant of his Duty, it is impoſſible he ſhould do it. He that hath the Knowledge of Religion,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:37482:185"/>
may be a bad Chriſtian, but he that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of it, can be none at all. Or if ignorance do beget and promote ſome kind of Devotion in Men, it is ſuch a Devotion as is not properly <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>Superſtition;</hi> the ignorant Man may be <hi>zealouſly ſuperſtitious,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome meaſure of Knowledge, no Man can be <hi>truly Religious. That the Soul be without Knowledge it is not good,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 19. 2. becauſe good practices depends upon our Knowledge, and muſt be directed by it; when as a Man that is trained up only to the outward performance of ſome things in Religion, as to the ſaying over ſo many Prayers in an unknown Tongue, this Man cannot be <hi>truly Religious,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing is <hi>Religious,</hi> that is not <hi>a Reaſonable Service;</hi> and no Service can be <hi>Reaſonable,</hi> that is not directed by our <hi>Underſtandings.</hi> Indeed, if the end of Prayer were only to give God to underſtand what we want, it were all one what Language we Prayed in, and whether we underſtood what we asked of him or not: but ſo long as the end of Prayer is to teſtifie the ſenſe of our own wants, and of our dependance
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:37482:185"/>
upon God for the ſupply of them, it is impoſſible that any Man ſhould in any tolerable propriety of Speech be ſaid <hi>to Pray,</hi> who does not underſtand what he asks; and the ſaying over ſo many <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> by one that does not underſtand the meaning of them, is no more <hi>a Prayer,</hi> than the repeating over ſo many Verſes in <hi>Virgil.</hi> And if this were good Reaſoning, that Men muſt not be permitted to know ſo much as they can in Religion, for fear they ſhould grow troubleſome with their Knowledge, then certainly the beſt way in the World to maintain Peace in the Chriſtian Church, would be to let the People know nothing at all in Religion; and the beſt way to ſecure the ignorance of the People would be to keep the Prieſts as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as the People, and then to be ſure they could teach them nothing: but then the miſchief would be, that out of a fondneſs to maintain Peace in the Chriſtian Church, there would be no Church, nor no Chriſtianity; which would be the ſame wiſe Contrivance, as if a Prince ſhould deſtroy his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to keep his Kingdom quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:37482:186"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us likewiſe Conſider, that if this Reaſon be good, it is much ſtronger for withholding the Scriptures from the Prieſts, and the Learned, than from the People; becauſe the danger of ſtarting Errors and Hereſies, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing them from Scripture, and managing them plauſibly and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, is much more to be feared from the Learned, than from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People; and the Experience of all Ages hath ſhewn, that the great Broachers and Abettors of Hereſie in the Chriſtian Church, have been Men of Learning and Wit; and moſt of the famous Hereſies, that are Recorded in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, have their Names from ſome Learned Man or other; ſo that it is a great miſtake to think that the way to prevent Error and Hereſie in the Church, is to take the Bible out of the hands of the People, ſo long as the free uſe of it is permitted to Men of Learning and Skill, in whoſe hands the danger of perverting it is much greater. The Ancient Fathers, I am ſure, do frequently preſcribe to the People the conſtant and careful reading
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:37482:186"/>
of the Holy Scriptures, as the ſureſt Antidote againſt the Poiſon of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Errors, and damnable Hereſies; and if there be ſo much danger of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into Error from the Oracles of Truth, by what other or better Means can we hope to be ſec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red againſt this danger? If <hi>the word of God</hi> be ſo croſs and improper a Means to this End, one would think that the <hi>teachings of Men</hi> ſhould be much leſs effectual; ſo that Men muſt either be left in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or they muſt be permitted to learn from <hi>the word of truth;</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever force this Reaſon of the danger of Hereſie hath in it, to deprive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People of the uſe of the Scriptures, I am ſure it is much ſtronger to wreſt them out of the hands of the Prieſts and the Learned, becauſe they are much more capable of perverting them to ſo bad a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and laſtly, this danger was as great and viſible in the Age of the Apoſtles, as it is now; and yet they took a quite contrary Courſe; there were Hereſies then, as well as now, and either the Scriptures were not
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:37482:187"/>
thought by being in the hands of the People to be the Cauſe of them, or they did not think the taking of them out of their hands a proper Remedy. The Apoſtles in all their Epiſtles, do earneſtly Exhort the People <hi>to grow in Knowledge,</hi> and commend them for <hi>ſearching the Scriptures,</hi> and charge them that <hi>the word of God ſhould dwell richly in them.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> takes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of ſome Men wreſting ſome difficult paſſages in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, as likewiſe in the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to their own deſtruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. where ſpeaking of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, he ſays <hi>there are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> Here the Danger Objected is taken notice of; but the Remedy preſcribed by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is not to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut after he had cautioned againſt the like weakneſs and errors, he exhorts them to <hi>grow in Knowledge,</hi> ver. 17, 18. <hi>Ye therefore, Beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before</hi> (that is, ſeeing ye are ſo
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:37482:187"/>
plainly told and warned of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) <hi>beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs; but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> (that is of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;) believing, it ſeems, that the more knowledge they had in Religion, the leſs they would be in danger of falling into damnable Errors. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of our Duty, and the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of it, may and often are ſeparated. This likewiſe is ſuppoſed in the Text, that Men may, and often do know the Will of God, and their Duty, and yet fail in the Practice of it. Our Saviour elſewhere ſuppoſeth, that many <hi>know their Maſter's Will, who do not do it;</hi> and he compares thoſe <hi>that hear his Sayings, and do them not, to a fooliſh Man that built his houſe upon the ſand.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>who are hearers of the word only, but not doers of it,</hi> and for that Reaſon fall ſhort of Happineſs. And this is no wonder, becauſe the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to that knowledge of Religion
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:37482:188"/>
which is neceſſary to Salvation is no difficult task. A great part of it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our hearts, and we cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it if we would; as that there is a God, and a Providence, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State after this Life, wherein we ſhall be Rewarded, or Puniſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we have lived here in this World; that God is to be Worſhipped, to be Prayed to for what we want, and to be Praiſed for what we enjoy. Thus far Nature inſtructs Men in Religion, and in the great Duties of Morality, as Juſtice, and Temperance, and the like. And as for Revealed Religion, as that Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God came in our Nature to ſave us, by revealing our Duty more clearly and fully to us, by giving us a more perfect Example of Holineſs and Obedience in his own Life and Converſation, and by dying for our Sins, and riſing again for our Juſtification; theſe are things which Men may eaſily underſtand; and yet for all that, they are difficulty brought to the Practice of Religion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance in three ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in whom the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Religion
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:37482:188"/>
is more remarkably ſeparated from the <hi>Practice</hi> of it; and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſake, I may call them by theſe three Names; the <hi>Spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ulative,</hi> the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> and the <hi>Hypocritical</hi> Chriſtian. The firſt of theſe makes Religion only <hi>a Science,</hi> the ſecond takes it up for <hi>a Faſhion,</hi> the third makes ſome <hi>Worldly advantage</hi> of it, and ſerves ſome <hi>ſecular Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> by it. All theſe are upon ſeveral accounts concerned to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſomething of Religion; but yet will not be brought to the Practice of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe whom I call the <hi>Specul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tive</hi> Chriſtian, is he who makes Religion only <hi>a Science,</hi> and ſtudies it as a piece of Learning, and part of that general knowledge in which he affects the reputation of being a Maſter; he hath no deſign to practice it, but he is loth to be ignorant of it, becauſe the knowledge of it is a good Ornament of Converſation, and will ſerve for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Entertainment among thoſe who are diſpoſed to be grave and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and becauſe he does not intend to practice it, he paſſeth over thoſe
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:37482:189"/>
things which are plain and eaſie to be underſtood, and applies himſelf chiefly to the Conſideration of thoſe things which are more abſtruſe, and will afford Matter of Controverſie and ſubtle Diſpute, as the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity, Predeſtination, Free-will,</hi> and the like. Of this temper ſeem many of the School-Men of old to have been, who made it their great ſtudy and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to puzzle Religion, and to make every thing in it intricate, by ſtarting infinite queſtions and difficulties about the plaineſt truths; and of the ſame rank uſually are the Heads and Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Parties and Factions in Religion, who by needleſs Controverſies, and endleſs Diſputes about ſome thing or other, commonly of no great moment in Religion, hinder themſelves and others from minding the Practice of the great and ſubſtantial Duties of a good Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the <hi>Formal</hi> Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who takes up Religion for <hi>a Faſhion.</hi> He is born and bred in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where Chriſtianity is profeſt, and Countenanced, and therefore thinks it
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:37482:189"/>
convenient for him to know ſomething of it. Of this ſort there are, I fear, a great many, who read the Scriptures ſometimes as others do, to know the Hiſtory of it; and go to Church, and hear the Goſpel preached, and by this means come in ſome meaſure to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Hiſtory of our Saviour, and the Chriſtian Doctrine; but do not at all bend themſelves to comply with the great End and Deſign of it; they do not heartily endeavour to form and faſhion their Lives according to the Laws and Precepts of it; they think they are very good Chriſtians, if they can give an account of the Articles of their Faith, profeſs their Belief in God and Chriſt, and declare that they hope to be Saved by him, tho' they take no care to keep his Commandments. Theſe are they of whom our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 46. who <hi>call him, Lord, Lord; but do not the things which he ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Hypocritical</hi> Chriſtians, who make an <hi>intereſt</hi> of Religion, and ſerve ſome <hi>worldly deſign</hi> by it. Theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to underſtand Religion more than ordinary, that they may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:37482:190"/>
it handſomly, and may not be at a loſs when they have occaſion to put on the garb of it. And this is one part of the Character which the Apoſtle gives of thoſe Perſons, who he foretels would appear in the laſt days, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. he ſays they ſhould be <hi>Lovers of their own ſelves, Covetous, Heady, High-Minded, Lovers of Pleaſure more than Lovers of God, having a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but denying the Power of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe Men do not love Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but they have occaſion to make uſe of it; and therefore they will have no more of it than will juſt ſerve their Purpoſe and Deſign. And indeed he that hath any other Deſign in Religion than to pleaſe God, and ſave his Soul, needs no more than ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, as will ſerve him <hi>to act a part</hi> in it upon occaſion. I come to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> and laſt Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Practice</hi> of Religion, and <hi>the doing</hi> of what we know to be our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the only way to Happineſs; <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:37482:190"/>
               <hi>them;</hi> not <hi>if ye know theſe things happy are ye;</hi> but <hi>if ye know and do them.</hi> Now to convince Men of ſo important a Truth, I ſhall endeavour to make out theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Goſpel makes the <hi>Practice</hi> of Religion a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thing makes it a neceſſary Qualification for it.</p>

               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:37482:192"/>
               <hi>your own ſelves;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Whoſ looketh into the perfect Law of Libert</hi> (that is the Law or Doctrine of the Goſpel,) <hi>and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this Man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed;</hi> and therefore he adds, that the truth and reality of Religion is to be meaſured by the effects of it, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our words, and ordering of our Lives, <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. <hi>If any Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you ſeem to be religious, and brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this Man's Religion is vain. Pure Religion, and undefiled before God and the Father is this; to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widow in their aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iction, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the World.</hi> Men talk of Religion, and keep a great ſtir about it; but nothing will paſs for <hi>true Religion before God,</hi> but the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Charitable Actions of a good Life; and God will accept no Man to Eternal Life upon any other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So the Apoſtle tells us moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Follow peace with all Men, and holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:37482:192"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As God hath made the <hi>Practice</hi> of Religion a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Happineſs, ſo the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon of the thing makes it a neceſſary Qualification for it. It is neceſſary that we become like to God, in order to the enjoyment of him; and nothing makes us like to God, but the <hi>Practice</hi> of Holineſs and Goodneſs. <hi>Knowledge</hi> indeed is a Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but that alone, as it doth not render a Man like God, ſo neither doth it diſpoſe him for the enjoyment of him. If a Man had the underſtanding of an Angel, he might for all that be a Devil; <hi>he that committeth ſin is of the Devil,</hi> and whatever <hi>Knowledge</hi> ſuch a Man may have, he is of a deviliſh temper and diſpoſition: <hi>but every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of God.</hi> By this we are <hi>like God,</hi> and only by our likeneſs to him, do we become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight</hi> and <hi>enjoyment</hi> of him; therefore every Man that hopes to be Happy by the bleſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of God in the next Life, muſt endeavour after Holineſs in this Life. So the ſame Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:37482:193"/>
               <hi>Every Man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> A wicked temper and diſpoſition of Mind is, in the very Nature of the thing, utterly inconſiſtent with all reaſonable hopes of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn that the <hi>Practice</hi> of Religion, and the <hi>doing</hi> of what we <hi>know</hi> to be our Duty, is the only way to Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And now the proper Inference from all this is, to put Men upon the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Practice</hi> of Religion. Let no Man content himſelf with the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of his Duty, unleſs he <hi>do</hi> it; and to this purpoſe I ſhall briefly urge theſe <hi>three</hi> Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is the great End of all our Knowledge in Religion, to <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi> what we <hi>know.</hi> The knowledge of God and of our Duty hath ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial a reſpect to Practice, that the Scripture will hardly allow it to be properly called <hi>Knowledge,</hi> unleſs it have an influence upon our Lives. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 3, 4. <hi>Hereby we do know that</hi>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:37482:193"/>
               <hi>we know him, if we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Practice</hi> is the beſt way to increaſe and perfect our <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Knowledge directs us in our Practice, but Practice confirms and increaſeth our Knowledge, <hi>John</hi> 7. 17. <hi>If any Man will do the will of God, he ſhall know of the Doctrine.</hi> The beſt way to know God, is to be like him our ſelves, and to have the lively image of his Perfections imprinted upon our Souls; and the beſt way to underſtand the Chriſtian Religion, is ſeriouſly to ſet about the Practice of it; this will give a Man a better Notion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than any Speculation can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> without the <hi>Practice</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, our <hi>Knowledge</hi> will be ſo far from being any furtherance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our Happineſs, that it will be one of the unhappieſt aggravations of our miſery. He that is ignorant of his Duty, hath ſome excuſe to pretend for himſelf: but he that underſtands the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:37482:194"/>
Chriſtian Religion, and does not live according to it, hath <hi>no cloak for his ſin.</hi> The defects of our Knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be groſs and wilful, will find an eaſie Pardon with God: but the faults of our Lives ſhall be ſeverely puniſht, when we <hi>knew</hi> our Duty and would not <hi>do</hi> it. I will conclude with that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47, 48. <hi>That Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant which knew his Lord's will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes; for unto whomſoever much is given, of him much ſhall be required.</hi> When we come into the other World, no Conſideration will ſting us more, and add more to the rage of our Torments than this, that we did wickedly, when we underſtood to have done better; and choſe to make our ſelves Miſerable, when we knew ſo well the way to have been Happy.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN proſecution of the Argument which I handled in my laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, namely, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Duty, without the Practice
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:37482:195"/>
of it, will not bring us to Happineſs, I ſhall proceed to ſhew, that if our Practice be not anſwerable to our Knowledge, this will be a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation both of our Sin and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe, I have pitched upon theſe words of our Lord, which are the application of two Parables, which he had delivered before, to ſtir up Men to a diligent and careful Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their Duty, that ſo they may be in a continual readineſs and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the coming of their Lord. The firſt Parable is more general, and concerns all Men, who are repreſented as ſo many Servants in a great Family, from which the Lord is abſent, and they being uncertain of the time of his return, ſhould always be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and poſture to receive him. Upon the hearing of this Parable, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> enquires of our Saviour, whether he intended this only for his Diſciples, or for all? To which Queſtion our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour returns an Anſwer in another Parable, which more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them; who becauſe they were
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:37482:195"/>
to be the Chief Rulers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of his Church, are repreſented by the Stewards of a great Family, <hi>Ver.</hi> 42. <hi>Who then is that faithful and wiſe Steward, whom his Lord ſhall make Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler over his houſehold, to give them their portion of meat in due ſeaſon?</hi> If he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Duty, <hi>bleſſed is he;</hi> but if he ſhall take occaſion in his Lord's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to domineer over his fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and riotouſly to waſte his Lords goods, his Lord, when he comes, will puniſh him after a more ſevere and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary manner.</p>
            <p>And then follows the application of the whole, in the words of the Text, <hi>And that Servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> As if he had ſaid, and well may ſuch a Servant deſerve ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Puniſhment, who having ſuch a truſt committed to him, and knowing his Lord's will ſo much better, yet does contrary to it; upon which our Saviour takes occaſion to compare the Fault and Puniſhment of thoſe who have greater advantages and opportuniti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:37482:196"/>
of knowing their Duty, with thoſe wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are ignorant of it; <hi>That Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant which knew his Lord's will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not himſelf, neither did according to it, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes: but he that knew not, but did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi> And then he adds the Reaſon and the Equity of this proceeding, <hi>For unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required; and to whom Men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words in general do allude to that Law of the Jews, mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 2. where the Judge is required to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Malefactor puniſh'd according to his Fault, by a certain number of Stripes; in relation to which known Law among the <hi>Jews,</hi> our Saviour here ſays, that <hi>thoſe who knew their Lord's will, and did it not, ſhould be beaten with many ſtripes: but thoſe who knew it not, ſhould be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi> So that there are two Obſervations lie plainly before us in the words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:37482:196"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the greater Advantages and Opportunities and Man hath of knowing his Duty, if he do it not, the greater will be his Condemnation; <hi>The Servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to it, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ignorance is a great excuſe of Mens faults, and will leſſen their Puniſhment; <hi>But he that knew not, but did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the latter of theſe <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe it will make way for the other; <hi>Viz.</hi> That ignorance is a great excuſe of Men's faults, and will leſſen their Puniſhment; <hi>He that knew not, but did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this, it will be requiſite to conſider what ignorance it is which our Saviour here ſpeaks of; and this is neceſſary to be enquired into, becauſe it is certain that there is ſome ſort of ignorance which doth
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:37482:197"/>
wholly excuſe and clear from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of guilt; and there is another ſort, which doth either not at all, or very little extenuate the faults of Men, ſo that it muſt be a third ſort, different from both theſe, which our Saviour here means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is an ignorance which doth wholly excuſe and clear from all manner of guilt, and that is <hi>an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and invincible ignorance,</hi> when a Perſon is wholly ignorant of the thing, which if he knew, he ſhould be bound to do, but neither can nor could have helpt it, that he is ignorant of it; that is, he either had not the Capacity, or wanted the Means and Opportunity of knowing it. In this Caſe a Perſon is in no fault, if he did not do what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew, nor could know to be his Duty. For God meaſures the faults of Men by their <hi>Wills,</hi> and if there be no defect there, there can be no guilt; for no Man is guilty, but he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf that he would not do what he knew he ought to do, or would do what he knew he ought not to do. Now if a Man be <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>invincibly</hi>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:37482:197"/>
               <hi>ignorant</hi> of his Duty, his neglect of it is altogether <hi>involuntary;</hi> for the Will hath nothing to do, where the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth not firſt direct. And this is the Caſe of <hi>Children</hi> who are not yet come to the uſe of Reaſon; for tho' they may do that which is <hi>materially</hi> a fault, yet it is none <hi>in them,</hi> becauſe by reaſon of their incapacity, they are at preſent <hi>invincibly ignorant</hi> of what they ought to do. And this is the Caſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of <hi>Ideots,</hi> who are under a natural incapacity of Knowledge, and ſo far as they are ſo, nothing that they do is imputed to them as a fault. The ſame may be ſaid of diſtracted Perſons, who are deprived either wholly, or at ſome times, of the uſe of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſo far, and ſo long as they are thus deprived, they are free from all guilt; and to Perſons who have the free and perfect uſe of their Reaſon, no neglect of any Duty is imputed, of which they are <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>invincibly ignorant.</hi> For inſtance, it is a Duty incumbent upon all Mankind, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Son of God, where he is ſufficiently manifeſted and revealed to them; but thoſe who never heard of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:37482:198"/>
him, nor had any opportunity of coming to the Knowledge of him, ſhall not be Condemned for this infidelity, becauſe it is impoſſible they ſhould <hi>believe on him, of whom they never heard;</hi> they may indeed be Condemned upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inning againſt the light of Nature, and for not obeying <hi>the Law which was written in their hearts;</hi> for what the Apoſtle ſays of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, is as true of any other Revelation of God, <hi>As many as have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without Law, ſhall alſo periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law; and as many as have ſinned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law, Rom.</hi> 2. 12. In like manner, thoſe who have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inned without <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> (that is, who never had the knowledge of it) ſhall not be Condemned for any offence againſt that Revelation which was never made to them, but for their violation of <hi>the Law of Nature;</hi> only they that have <hi>ſinned under the Goſpel,</hi> ſhall be <hi>judged by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is likewiſe another ſort of ignorance, which either does not at all, or very little extenuate the faults of Men, when Men are not
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:37482:198"/>
only ignorant, but <hi>chuſe to be ſo;</hi> that is, when they wilfully neglect thoſe Means and Opportunities of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which are afforded to them; ſuch as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14. <hi>Who ſay unto God depart from us, for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> And this ſort of ignorance many among the <hi>Jews</hi> were guilty of, when our Saviour came and preached to them, but they would not be inſtructed by him; <hi>The light came among them, but they loved darkneſs rather than light,</hi> as he himſelf ſays of them; and as he ſays elſewhere of the Phariſees, <hi>They rejected the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut their eyes againſt that light which offered it ſelf to them; <hi>They would not ſee with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor underſtand with their hearts, that they might be converted, and healed.</hi> Now an ignorance in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree wilful, can hardly be imagined to carry any excuſe at all in it. He that knew not his Lord's Will, becauſe he would not know it, becauſe he wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected the Means of coming to the knowledge of it, deſerves to be beaten with as many ſtripes, as if he
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:37482:199"/>
had known it; becauſe he might have known it, and would not. He that will not take notice of the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, or will ſtop his ears when it is read, and afterwards offends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, does equally deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thoſe who have read it, and heard it; and diſobey'd it, becauſe he was as groſly faulty in not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and there is no reaſon that any Man's groſs fault ſhould be his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p>So that it is neither of theſe ſorts of ignorance that our Saviour means, neither abſolute and invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor that which is groſly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and affected; for the firſt, Men deſerve not to be beaten at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot help it; for the latter they deſerve not to be excuſed, becauſe they might have helped their ignorance, and would not.</p>
            <p>But our Saviour here ſpeaks of ſuch an ignorance as does in a good degree extenuate the fault, and yet not wholly excuſe it; for he ſays of them,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:37482:199"/>
that <hi>they knew not their Lord's will,</hi> and yet that this ignorance did not wholly excuſe them from blame, nor exempt them from puniſhment, <hi>but they ſhould be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi> In the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> place then, there is an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which is in ſome degree faulty, and yet does in a great meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the faults which proceed from it; and this is when Men are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ignorant of their Duty, but only in compariſon of others, who have a far more clear and diſtinct Knowledge of it; and tho' they do not groſly and wilfully neglect the Means of further Knowledge, yet perhaps they do not make the beſt uſe they might of the opportunities they have of knowing their Duty better; and therefore in compariſon of others, who have far better Means and Advantages of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lord's Will, they may be ſaid not to know it, tho' they are not ſimply ignorant of it, but only have a more obſcure and uncertain knowledge of it. Now this ignorance does in a
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:37482:200"/>
great meaſure excuſe ſuch Perſons, and extenuate their Crimes, in compariſon of thoſe who had a clearer and more perfect knowledge of their Maſter's Will; and yet it does not free them from all guilt; becauſe they did not live up to that degree of knowledge which they had; and perhaps if they had uſed more care and induſtry, they might have known their Lord's Will better. And this was the Caſe of the Heathen, who in compariſon of thoſe who enjoyed the light of the Goſpel, might be ſaid not to have known their Lord's Will, tho' as to many parts of their Duty, they had ſome directions from Natural Light, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences did urge them to many things by the obſcure apprehenſions and hopes of a Future Reward, and the fear of a Future Puniſhment. But this was but a very obſcure and uncertain <hi>knowledge,</hi> in compariſon of the clear Light of the Goſpel, which hath diſcovered to us our Duty ſo plainly by the Laws and Precepts of it, and hath preſented us with ſuch powerful Motives and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to Obedience in the Promiſes and Threatnings of it. And this likewiſe
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:37482:200"/>
is the Caſe of many Chriſtians, who either through the natural ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Underſtandings, or by the neglect of their Parents and Teachers, or other Circumſtances of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have had far leſs Means and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Knowledge than others. God does not expect ſo much from thoſe, as from others, to whom he hath given greater Capacity, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Knowledge; and when our Lord ſhall come to call his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to an account, they ſhall be beaten with fewer ſtripes than others; they ſhall not wholly eſcape, becauſe they were not wholly ignorant; but by how much they had leſs Knowledge than others, by ſo much their Puniſhment ſhall be lighter.</p>
            <p>And there is all the Equity in the World it ſhould be ſo, that Men ſhould be accountable according to what they have received, and that to whom leſs is given, leſs ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands. The Scripture hath told us, that <hi>God will judge the World in Righteouſneſs;</hi> now Juſtice does require, that in taxing the Puniſhment
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:37482:201"/>
of Offenders, every thing ſhould be conſider'd, that may be a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and extenuation of their Crimes, and that accordingly their Puniſhment ſhould be abated. Now the greateſt extenuation of any fault is ignorance, which when it proceeds from no fault of ours, no fault can proceed from it; ſo that ſo far as any Man is innocently ignorant of his Duty, ſo far he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable for the neglect of it; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree of ignorance takes off ſo much from the perverſeneſs of the will; &amp; <hi>nihil ardet in inferno, niſi propria voluntas,</hi> 
               <q>Nothing is puniſht in Hell, but what is voluntary, and proceeds from our Wills.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I do not intend this Diſcourſe for any commendation of Ignorance, or encouragement to it. For Knowledge hath many advantages above it, and is much more deſirable, if we uſe it well; and if we do not, it is our own fault; if we be not wanting to our ſelves, we may be much happier by our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, than any Man can be by his Ignorance; for tho' Ignorance may plead an excuſe, yet it can hope for no
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:37482:201"/>
Reward; and it is always better to need no excuſe, than to have the beſt in the world ready at hand to plead for our ſelves. Beſides, that we may do well to conſider, that ignorance is no where an excuſe where it is cheriſht; ſo that it would be the vaineſt thing in the world for any Man to foſter it, in hopes thereby to excuſe himſelf; for where it is wilful and choſen, it is a fault, and (as I ſaid before) it is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the World, that any Man's fault ſhould prove his excuſe. So that this can be no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ignorance, to ſay that it extenuates the faults of Men; for it does not extenuate them, whenever it is wilful and affected; and when ever it is deſigned and choſen, it is wilful; and then no Man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably deſign to continue ignorant, that he may have an excuſe for his faults, becauſe then the ignorance is wilful, and whenever it is ſo, it ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be an excuſe.</p>
            <p>I the rather ſpeak this, becauſe Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance hath had the good fortune to meet with great Patrons in the World,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:37482:202"/>
and to be extol'd, tho' not upon this account, yet upon another, for which there is leſs pretence of Reaſon; as if it were the Mother of Devotion. Of Superſtition I grant it is, and of this we ſee plentiful proof, among thoſe who are ſo careful to preſerve and cheriſh it: but that true Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion ſhould ſpring from it, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, as that Darkneſs ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Light. I do hope indeed, and Charitably believe, that the ignorance in which ſome are detained by their Teachers and Governours, will be a real excuſe, to as many of them as are otherwiſe honeſt and ſincere; but I doubt not, but the errors and faults which proceed from this ignorance, will lie heavy upon thoſe who keep them in it. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Obſervation, That the greater Advantages and Opportunities any Man hath of knowing the will of God, and his Duty, the greater will be his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation if he do not do it. <hi>The Servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to it, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:37482:202"/>
               <hi>Which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf;</hi> The preparation of our Mind to do the Will of God, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is occaſion and opportunity for it, is accepted with him; a Will rightly diſpoſed to obey God, tho' it be not brought in to act, for want of opportunity, does not loſe its Reward: but when, notwithſtanding we know our Lord's Will, there are neither of theſe, neither the act, nor the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reſolution of doing it, what puniſhment may we not expect?</p>
            <p>The Juſt God, in puniſhing the ſins of Men, proportions the puniſhment to the Crime, and where the Crime is greater, the puniſhment riſeth; as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews, where the Crime was ſmall, the Malefactor was ſentenced to <hi>a few ſtripes;</hi> where it was great, he was <hi>beaten with many.</hi> Thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour repreſents the great Judge of the World dealing with Sinners; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Sins are aggravated, he will add to their puniſhment. Now after all the aggravations of ſin, there is none that doth more intrinſically heighten the malignity of it, than when
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:37482:203"/>
it is committed againſt the clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Duty, and that upon theſe <hi>three</hi> accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Knowledge of God's Will is ſo great an advantage to the doing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it is a great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon us to the doing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the neglect of our Duty in this caſe, cannot be without a great deal of wilfulneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I ſhall ſpeak briefly to theſe <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the knowledge of God's Will is ſo great an advantage to the doing of it; and every advantage of doing our Duty, is a certain aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our neglect of it. And this is the Reaſon which our Saviour adds here in the Text, <hi>For to whomſoever much is given, of them much will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and to whom Men have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much, of him they will ask the more.</hi> It was, no doubt, a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſadvantage to the Heathen,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:37482:203"/>
that they were ſo doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the will of God, and in many caſes left to the uncertainty of their own Reaſon, by what way and means they might beſt apply themſelves to the pleaſing of him; and this diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged ſeveral of the wiſeſt of them from all ſerious endeavours in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, thinking it as good to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as to be miſtaken about it. Others that were more naturally De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, and could not ſatisfie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences without ſome expreſſions of Religion, fell into various ſuperſtitions, and were ready to embrace any way of Worſhip which Cuſtom preſcribed, or the fancies of Men could ſuggeſt to them; and hence ſprang all the ſtupid and barbarous Idolatries of the Heathen. For ignorance growing upon the World, that natural propention which was in the Minds of Men to Religion, and the Worſhip of a Deity, for want of certain direction, expreſt it ſelf in thoſe fooliſh and abominable Idolatries, which were practiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:37482:204"/>
And is it not then a mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, that we have the clear and certain direction of Divine Revelation? We have the Will of God plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to us, and all the parts of our Duty clearly defined and determined, ſo that no Man that is in any meaſure free from intereſt and prejudice, can eaſily miſtake in any great and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part of his Duty. We have the Nature of God plainly revealed to us, and ſuch a Character of him given, as is moſt ſuitable to our natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of a Deity, as render him both awful and amiable; for the Scripture repreſents him to us as Great and Good, Powerful and Merciful, a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sin, and a great lover of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and we have the Law and manner of his Worſhip (ſo far as was needful) and the Rules of a good Life clearly expreſt and laid down; and as a powerful Motive and Argument to the obedience of thoſe Laws, a plain diſcovery made to us of the endleſs Rewards and Puniſhments of another World. And is not this a mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the doing of God's Will,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:37482:204"/>
to have it ſo plainly declared to us, and ſo powerfully enforced upon us? So that our Duty lies plainly before us, we ſee what we have to do, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of neglecting it; ſo that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantage we have of doing God's Will, by our clear knowledge of it, we are altogether inexcuſable if we do it not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The knowledge of our Lord's Will is likewiſe a great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us to the doing of it. For what ought in reaſon to oblige us more to do any thing, than to be fully aſſur'd that it is the Will of God, and that it is the Law of the great Soveraign of the World, who is able to ſave, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy? that it is the pleaſure of him that made us, and who hath declared that he deſigns to make us happy, by our obedience to his Laws? So that if we know theſe things to be the Will of God, we have the greateſt obligation to do them, whether we conſider the Authority of God, or our own intereſt; and if we neglect them, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay in our own excuſe. We knew the Law, and the advantage of
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:37482:205"/>
keeping it, and the penalty of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and if after this we will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, there is no Apology to be made for us. They have ſomething to plead for themſelves, who can ſay, that tho' they had ſome apprehenſion of ſome parts of their Duty, and their Minds were apt to dictate to them that they ought to do ſome things, yet the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent apprehenſions of Mankind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeveral of theſe things, and the doubts and uncertainties of their own Minds concerning them, made them eaſie to be carried off from their Duty, by the vicious inclinations of their own Nature, and the tyranny of Cuſtom and Example, and the pleaſant temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of fleſh and blood; but had they had a clear and undoubted Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God, and had certainly known theſe things to be his Will, this would have conquered and born down all Objections and Temptations to the contrary; or if it had not, would have ſtopt their mouths, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all excuſe from them. There is ſome colour in this plea, that in many caſes they did not know certainly what the Will of God was: but for us who
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:37482:205"/>
own a clear Revelation from God, and profeſs to believe it, what can we ſay for our ſelves, to mitigate the ſeverity of God toward us; why he ſhould not pour forth all his wrath, and execute upon us the fierceneſs of his anger?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The neglect of God's will when we know it, cannot be without a great deal of wilfulneſs and contempt. If we know it, and do it not, the fault is ſolely in our wills, and the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful any ſin is, the more hainouſly wicked is it. There can hardly be a greater aggravation of a Crime, than if it proceed from meer obſtinacy and perverſeneſs; and if we know it to be our Lord's Will, and do it not, we are guilty of the higheſt contempt of the greateſt Authority in the World. And do we think this to be but a ſmall ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, to affront the great Soveraign and Judge of the World? not only to break his Laws; but to trample upon them and deſpiſe them, when we know whoſe Laws they are? <hi>Will we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are we ſtronger than he?</hi> We believe that it is God who ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:37482:206"/>
               <hi>thou ſhalt not Steal; thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy Neighbour; thou ſhalt not hate, or oppreſs, or defraud thy Brother in any thing; but thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> and will we notwithſtanding venture to break theſe Laws, knowing whoſe Authority they are ſtampt withal? After this contempt of him, what favour can we hope for from him? what can we ſay for our ſelves, why any one of thoſe many ſtripes which are threatned ſhould be abated to us? <hi>Ignoſci aliquatenus igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiae poteſt; contemptus veniam non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet;</hi> 
               <q>Something may be pardoned to ignorance; but contempt can expect no forgiveneſs.</q> He that ſtrikes his Prince, not knowing him to be ſo, hath ſomething to ſay for himſelf, that tho' he did a diſloyal act, yet it did not proceed from a diſloyal Mind: but he that firſt acknowledgeth him for his Prince, and then affronts him, deſerves to be proſecuted with the utmoſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe he did it wilfully, and in meer contempt. The knowledge of our Duty, and that it is the will of God which we go againſt, takes away all poſſible excuſe from us; for nothing
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:37482:206"/>
can be ſaid, why we ſhould offend him, who hath both Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, and Power to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>And thus I have, as briefly as I could, repreſented to you the true ground and reaſon of the aggravation of thoſe Sins, which are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the clear knowledge of God's Will, and our Duty; becauſe this knowledge is ſo great an advantage to the doing of our Duty; ſo great an obligation upon us to it; and becauſe the neglect of our Lord's Will in this caſe, cannot be without great wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a down-right contempt of his Authority.</p>
            <p>And ſhall I now need to tell you, how much it concerns every one of us, to live up to that knowledge which we have of our Lord's Will, and to prepare our ſelves to do according to it; to be always in a readineſs and diſpoſition to do what we know to be his Will, and actually to do it, when there is occaſion, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And it concerns us the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we, in this Age and Nation,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:37482:207"/>
have ſo many advantages, above a great part of the World, of coming to the knowledge of our Duty. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the cleareſt and moſt perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which God ever made of his Will to Mankind, and have the light of Divine Truth plentifully ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, by the free uſe of the holy Scriptures, which is not a ſealed Book to us, but lies open to be read, and ſtudied by us; this Spiritual Food is <hi>rained down</hi> like Manna <hi>round about our Tents,</hi> and every one may gather ſo much as is ſufficient; we are not ſtinted, nor have the word of God given out to us in broken pieces, or mixt and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, here a Leſſon of Scripture, and there a Legend; but whole and entire, ſincere and uncorrupt.</p>
            <p>God hath not left us, as he did the Heathen for many Ages, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and uncertain direction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light; nor hath he revealed his Will to us, as he did to the Jews, in dark Types and Shadows: but hath made a clear diſcovery of his Mind and Will to us. The Diſpenſation which we are under, hath no vail upon it, <hi>the</hi>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:37482:207"/>
               <hi>Darkneſs is paſt, and the true Light now ſhineth; we are of the Day, and of the Light,</hi> and therefore it may juſtly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that we ſhould <hi>put off the Works of Darkneſs, and walk as Children of the Light.</hi> Every degree of knowledge which we have, is an aggravation of the Sins committed againſt it, and when our Lord comes to paſs Sentence upon us, will add to the number of our ſtripes. Nay, if God ſhould inflict no poſitive torment upon Sinners; yet their own Minds would deal moſt ſeverely with them upon this account, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will gall their Conſciences more, than to remember againſt what Light they did offend. For herein lies the very nature and ſting of all guilt, to be conſcious to our ſelves, <hi>that we knew what we ought to have done, and did it not.</hi> The Vices and Corruptions which reigned in the World before, will be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in compariſon of ours. <hi>The times of that ignorance God winked at: but now he commands all Men every where to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> Mankind had ſome excuſe for their Errors before, and God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a great meaſure to overlook them: but <hi>if we continue ſtill in our ſins,</hi>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:37482:208"/>
               <hi>we have no cloak for them.</hi> All the degrees of Light which we enjoy, are ſo many Talents committed to us by our Lord, for the improving whereof, he will call us to a ſtrict account; <hi>for unto whomſoever much is given, of him much ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and to whom he hath committed much, of him he will ask the more.</hi> And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more reaſonable, than that Men ſhould account for all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and opportunities they have had of knowing the Will of God; and that as their knowledge was increaſed, ſo their ſorrow and puniſhment ſhould proportionably riſe, if they ſin againſt it. The ignorance of a great part of the World is deſervedly pitied and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by us; but the Condemnation of none is ſo ſad, as of thoſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the knowledge of God's Will, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do it; <hi>how much better had it been for them not to have kuown the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them!</hi> If we had been born, and brought up in ignorance of the true God and his Will, <hi>we had had no ſin,</hi> in compariſon of what now we have: <hi>but now that we ſee, our ſin remains.</hi>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:37482:208"/>
This will aggravate our Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation beyond meaſure, that we had the knowledge of Salvation ſo clearly revealed to us. Our Duty lies plainly before us, we know what we ought to do, and <hi>what manner of Perſons we ought to be, in all holy Converſation and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> We believe the coming of our Lord to Judgment, and we know not how ſoon He may be <hi>revealed from Heaven with his Mighty Angels,</hi> not only <hi>to take vengeance on them that know not God,</hi> but on them that have known him, and yet <hi>obey not the Goſpel of his Son.</hi> And if all this will not move us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves to do our Lord's Will, we deſerve to have our ſtripes multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. No Condemnation can be too heavy for thoſe who offend againſt the clear knowledge of God's Will, and their Duty.</p>
            <p>Let us then be perſwaded to ſet upon the practice of what we know; let the light which is in our Underſtandings, deſcend upon our Hearts and Lives; let us not dare to continue any longer in the practice of any known Sin, nor in the neglect of any thing which we are
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:37482:209"/>
convinced is our Duty, and <hi>if our hearts condemn us not,</hi> neither for the neglect of the means of Knowledge, nor for rebelling againſt the Light of God's Truth ſhining in our Minds, and glaring upon our Conſciences, <hi>then have we confidence towards God: but if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knows all things.</hi>

               </gap>ef of a God, and his Providence, there is nothing more Fundamentally neceſſary to the practice of a good Life, than the belief of theſe two Principles, <hi>That God is not the Author of Sin,</hi> and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:37482:210"/>
               <hi>That every Man's Sin lies at his own door and he hath reaſon to blame himſelf for all the evil that he does.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>God is not the Author of Sin,</hi> that he is no way acceſſary to our faults, either by tempting or forcing us to the Commiſſion of them. For if he were, they would neither properly be <hi>Sins,</hi> nor could they be juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. They would not properly be <hi>Sins,</hi> for <hi>Sin</hi> is a contradiction to the Will of God; but ſuppoſing Men to be either tempted or neceſſitated thereto, that which we call <hi>Sin,</hi> would either be a meer paſſive Obedience to the Will of God, or an active Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it, but neither way a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to it. Nor could theſe actions be juſtly puniſhed; for all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſuppoſeth a fault, and a fault ſuppoſeth liberty and freedom from force and neceſſity; ſo that no Man can be juſtly puniſhed for that which he cannot help, and no Man can help that, which he is neceſſitated and compel'd to. And tho' there were no force in the caſe, but only temptation, yet it would be unreaſonable for the ſame perſon to tempt and puniſh. For as nothing is more contrary to the holineſs
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:37482:210"/>
of God, than to tempt Men to Sin; ſo nothing can be more againſt juſtice and goodneſs, than firſt to draw Men into a fault, and then to chaſtize them for it. So that this is a Principle which lies at the bottom of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>That God is not the Author of the Sins of Men.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That every Man's fault lies at his own door, and he has reaſon enough to blame himſelf for all the evil that he does.</hi> And this is that which makes Men properly <hi>guilty,</hi> that when they have done amiſs, they are conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves it was their own act, and they might have done otherwiſe; and <hi>guilt</hi> is that which makes Men liable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and fear of puniſhment is the great reſtraint from Sin, and one of the principal Arguments for Virtue and Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And both theſe Principles our Apoſtle St.</hi> James <hi>does here fully aſſert in the words which I have read unto you.</hi> L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:37482:211"/>
God tempts Men. Let no Man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The manner in which he rejects it. <hi>Let no Man ſay ſo.</hi> By which manner of ſpeaking, the Apoſtle inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates theſe <hi>two</hi> Things. 1. That Men are apt to lay their faults upon God: For when he ſays, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t no Man ſay ſo,</hi> he intimates, that Men are apt to <hi>ſay</hi> ſo, and it is very probable that ſome <hi>did ſay</hi> ſo; and, 2<hi>dly.</hi> That it is not only a fault, but an impious aſſertion to ſay that God tempts Men. He ſpeaks of it as a thing to be rejected with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Let no Man ſay;</hi> that is, far be it from us to affirm a thing ſo impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſhonourable to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Reaſon and Argument that he brings againſt it,</hi> For God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be tempted with evil, neither temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth he any Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Propoſition which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here rejects, and that is, <hi>That God tempts Men: Let no Man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</hi> Now that we may the more diſtinctly underſtand
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:37482:212"/>
the meaning of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Apoſtle here rejects, it will be very requiſite to conſider what <hi>Temptation</hi> is, and the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of it. To <hi>Tempt</hi> a Man, is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, nothing elſe but to make trial of him in any kind what he will do. In Scripture Temptation is commonly confin'd to the trial of a Man's good or bad, of his virtuous or vicious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But then it is ſuch a trial as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers a Man's virtue, and if he be not well reſolved, is likely to overcome it, and to make him fall into Sin. So that temptation does always imply ſomething of danger the worſt way. And Men are thus tempted, either from themſelves, or by others; by others chiefly theſe <hi>two</hi> ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By direct and down-right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By being brought into ſuch Circumſtances as will greatly endanger their falling into it, tho' none ſolicit and perſwade them to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:37482:212"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By direct and down-right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to Sin. Thus the Devil temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Firſt Parents, by repreſenting things ſo to them, as might on the one hand incite them to Sin, and on the other hand, weaken and looſen that, which was the great curb and reſtraint from it. On the one hand, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to them the advantages they ſhould have by breaking God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> On the other hand, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the danger of offending not to be ſo great and certain as they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>The Serpent ſaid unto the Woman, ye ſhall not ſurely dye.</hi> And the Devil had ſo good ſucceſs in this way of tempting the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to ſet upon the ſecond, our Bleſſed Saviour, in the ſame manner; for he would have perſwaded him <hi>to fall down and worſhip him,</hi> by offering him <hi>all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them.</hi> And thus bad Men many times tempt others, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw them into the ſame
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:37482:213"/>
wicked Courſes with themſelves. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> repreſents to us the manner and the danger of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 13, 14. <hi>My Son, if Sinners entice thee, conſent thou not; if they ſay, come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cauſe; we ſhall find all precious ſubſtance, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoil. Caſt in thy lot amongſt us, let us all have one purſe.</hi> This is the firſt way of temptation.</p>
            <p>And to be ſure God tempts no Man this way. He offers no Arguments to Man to perſwade him to Sin; he no where propoſeth either Reward or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity to Sinners: but on the contrary, gives all imaginable encouragement to Obedience, and threatens the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his Law with moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Men are likewiſe tempted, by being brought into ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as will greatly endanger their falling into Sin, tho' none perſwade them to it; and this happens two ways; when Men are remarkably beſet with the allurements of the World, or aſſaulted
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:37482:213"/>
with the Evils and Calamities of it; for either of theſe Conditions are great temptations to Men, and make powerful aſſaults upon them, eſpecially when they fall upon thoſe who are ill diſpoſed before, or are but of a weak Virtue and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>The allurements of the World are ſtrong temptations; Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Pleaſures, they are the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and Incentives to many Luſts. Honour and Greatneſs, Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, eſpecially when Men are ſuddenly lifted up, and from a low Condition, are apt to tranſport Men to Pride and Inſolency towards others. Power is a ſtrong Liquor which does eaſily intoxicate weak Minds, and make them apt to ſay and do undecent things. <hi>Man that is in Honour and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not, is like the Beaſts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;</hi> Intimating that Men who are exalted to an high Condition, are very apt to forget themſelves, and to play the Fools and Beaſts. It requires great Conſideration, and a well-poiſed Mind, not to be lifted up with one's Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Weak heads are apt to turn and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:37482:214"/>
grow dizzy, when they look down from a great height.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo likewiſe Eaſe and Proſperity are a very ſlippery Condition to moſt Men, and without great care, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the falling into great Sins. So</hi> Solomon <hi>obſerves,</hi> Prov. <hi>1. 32.</hi> For the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them. <hi>For this Reaſon</hi> Agur <hi>maketh his Prayer to God, that he would</hi> give him neither Poverty nor Riches, <hi>but keep him in a mean Condition, becauſe of the danger of both extreams,</hi> Prov. <hi>30. 8, 9.</hi> Give me not Riches, leſt I be full, and deny thee. <hi>Both the eager deſire, and the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of Riches do frequently prove fatal to Men. So our Saviour tells us elſewhere very Emphatically,</hi> Mat. <hi>19. 23, 24.</hi> Verily I ſay unto you, that a Rich Man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: And again I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very fully declares unto us the</hi>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:37482:214"/>
               <hi>great danger of this Condition, 1</hi> Tim. <hi>6. 9, 10.</hi> But they that will be Rich, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown Men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and perdition; for the love of mony is the root of all evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt Bait of all to Fleſh and Blood, is ſenſual Pleaſures; the very preſence and opportunity of theſe, are apt to kindle the Deſires, and to inflame the Luſts of Men, eſpecially where theſe temptations meet with ſuitable tempers, where every ſpark that falls catcheth.</p>
            <p>And on the other hand, the Evils and Calamities of this World, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they threaten or fall upon Men in any degree of extremity, are ſtrong temptations to Human Nature. Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Want, Pain and Suffering, and the fear of any great Evil, eſpecially of Death, theſe are great ſtraits to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and apt to tempt Men to great Sins, to impatience and diſcontent,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:37482:215"/>
to unjuſt and diſhoneſt ſhifts, to the forſaking of God, and Apoſtacy from his Truth and Religion. <hi>Agur</hi> was ſenſible of the dangerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Poverty, and therefore he prays againſt <hi>that,</hi> as well as againſt Riches; <hi>Give me not Poverty, leſt being Poor I ſteal, and take the name of the Lord my God in vain;</hi> that is, leſt I be tempted to Theft, and Perjury. The Devil, whoſe Trade it is to tempt Men to Sin, knew very well the force of theſe ſorts of Temptations, when he deſired God firſt to touch <hi>Job</hi> in his Eſtate, and to ſee what effect that would have, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 11. <hi>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> And when he found himſelf deceived in this, ſurely he thought, that were he but afflicted with great bodily pains, that would put him out of all patience, and fleſh and blood would not be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Temptation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> And this was the great Temptation that the Primitive Chriſtians were aſſaulted withal; they
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:37482:215"/>
were tempted to forſake Chriſt and his Religion, by a moſt violent Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, by the ſpoiling of their goods, by Impriſonment, and Torture, and Death. And this is that kind of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which the Apoſtle particularly ſpeaks of before the Text, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that endureth temptation; for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him;</hi> and then it follows, <hi>Let no Man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</hi> And thus I have given an account of the ſeveral ſorts of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations comprehended under this <hi>ſecond</hi> Head, namely, when Men are tempted by being brought into ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as do greatly endanger their falling into Sin, by the Allurements of this World, and by the Evils and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it.</p>
            <p>Now the Queſtion is, how far God hath an hand in theſe kind of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſo we may know how to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Propoſition, which the Apoſtle here rejects, <hi>that Men are tempted of God. Let no Man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:37482:216"/>
That the Providence of God does order, or at leaſt permit Men to be brought into theſe Circumſtances I have ſpoken of, which are ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptations to Sin, no Man can doubt, that believes his Providence to be concern'd in the affairs of the World. All the difficulty is, how far the Apoſtle does here intend to exempt God from an hand in theſe temptations. Now for the clearer underſtanding of this, it will be requiſite to conſider the ſeveral Ends and Reaſons, which thoſe who tempt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may have in tempting them; and all temptation is for one of theſe <hi>three</hi> Ends or Reaſons; either for the trial and improvement of Men's Virtues; or by way of Judgment and Puniſhment for ſome former great Sins and Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or with a direct purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſeduce Men to Sin; theſe I think are the chief Ends and Reaſons that can be imagined, of exerciſing Men with dangerous temptations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the exerciſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men's Graces and Virtues. And this is the End which God always aims
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:37482:216"/>
at, in bringing good Men, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to be brought into dangerous temptations. And therefore St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of it as a matter of joy, when good Men are exerciſed with afflictions; not becauſe afflictions are deſirable for themſelves, but becauſe of the happy conſequences of them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 2, 3. of this <hi>Chap. My Brethren, count it all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 5. 3, 4, 5. <hi>We glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth patience, and patience experience;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Patience trieth a Man, <hi>and</hi> this <hi>trial worketh hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi> Theſe are happy effects and conſequences of affliction and ſuffering, when they improve the Virtues of Men, and increaſe their Graces, and thereby make way for the increaſe of their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Upon this account, St. <hi>James</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth thoſe <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> who are <hi>thus tempted. Bleſſed is the Man that endureth temptation; for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:37482:217"/>
And this certainly is no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Providence of God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Men to be thus tempted, when he permits it for no other end, but to make them better Men, and thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for a greater Reward: And ſo the Apoſtle aſſures us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17, 18. <hi>If ſo be we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo be glorified with him; for I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>For we know that all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to them that love God.</hi> And this happy end and iſſue of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to good Men the Providence of God ſecures to them (if they be not wanting to themſelves) one of theſe two ways, either by proportioning the temptation to their ſtrength; or if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>that,</hi> by miniſtring new ſtrength and ſupport to them, by the ſecret and extraordinary aids of his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By proportioning the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their ſtrength; ordering things ſo by his ſecret and wiſe Providence, that they ſhall not be aſſaulted by any temptation, which is beyond their
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:37482:217"/>
ſtrength to reſiſt and overcome. And herein the ſecurity of good Men doth ordinarily conſiſt; and the very beſt of us, thoſe who have the firmeſt and moſt reſolute virtue were in infinite danger, if the Providence of God did not take this care of us. For a temptation may ſet upon the beſt Men with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or ſurprize them at ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as no ordinary degree of grace and virtue is able to withſtand: But where Men are ſincerely good, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly reſolv'd, the Providence of God doth ward off theſe fierce blows, and put by theſe violent thruſts, and by a ſecret diſpoſal of things, keep them from being aſſaulted by theſe irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible kinds of temptations.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration whereof, as it is a great encouragement to Men to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely good, ſo likewiſe a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for a continual dependance upon the Providence of God, and to take us off from confidence in our ſelves, and our own ſtrength. And this uſe the Apoſtle makes of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtandeth,</hi> (that is confident that nothing ſhall be able to ſhake him, or throw
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:37482:218"/>
him down) <hi>take heed leſt he fall; there hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to Men;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>but what is humane;</hi> nothing but what an humane ſtrength, aſſiſted by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grace of God, may be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and Conquer. But there are greater and more violent temptations than theſe, which you have not yet been tried with; and when thoſe happen, we muſt have recourſe to God for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtance. And this is the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> way I mention'd, whereby the Providence of God does ſecure good Men in caſe of extraordinary temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which no humane ſtrength can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably reſiſt. And this the ſame Apoſtle aſſures us of in the very next words, <hi>God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it.</hi> That is, in caſe of great and violent temptations (ſuch as the Chriſtians in the height of their Perſecutions were expoſed to) God will ſecretly miniſter ſtrength and ſupport equal to the force and power of the temptation. And this
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:37482:218"/>
God did in an extraordinary manner to the Chriſtian Martyrs, and that to ſuch a degree, as made them joyfully to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their Sufferings, and with the greateſt chearfulneſs in the world to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thoſe torments, which no humane patience was able to bear. And where God doth thus ſecure Men againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or ſupport them under them, it is no reflection at all upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or juſtice of his Providence, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be thus tempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God permits others to be thus tempted, by way of Judgment and Puniſhment for ſome former great Sins and Provocations which they have been guilty of. And thus many times God puniſheth great and notorious Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by permitting them to fall into great temptations, which meeting with a vicious diſpoſition, are likely to be too hard for them, eſpecially conſidering how by a long habit of wickedneſs, and wilful commiſſion of great and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sins, they have made themſelves an eaſie prey to every temptation, and have driven the Spirit of God from them, and deprived themſelves of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:37482:219"/>
aids and reſtraints of his Grace, which he ordinarily affords, not only to good Men, but likewiſe to thoſe who are not very bad. And thus God is ſaid to have <hi>hardened Pharaoh</hi> by thoſe Plagues and Judgments which he ſent upon him and his Kingdom. But if we carefully read the Story, it is ſaid that <hi>he firſt harden'd himſelf,</hi> and then that <hi>God hardened him;</hi> that is, he being hardened under the firſt Judgments of God, God ſent more, which meeting with his obſtinacy, had this unnatural effect upon him, to harden him yet more; not that God did infuſe any wickedneſs or obſtinacy into him, but by his juſt Judgments ſent more Plagues upon him, which hardened him yet more, and which were likely to have that effect upon him, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill temper of the Man. And it was juſt by way of puniſhment that they ſhould. And ſo likewiſe, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 11. 19, 20. it is ſaid that the Cities of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did not make peace with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> becauſe <hi>it was of the Lord to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their hearts, that they ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael in Battel, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them utterly;</hi> that is, for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer iniquities, the meaſure whereof
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:37482:219"/>
was now full, the Providence of God did juſtly bring them into, and leave them under thoſe Circumſtances, which made them obſtinate againſt all terms of Peace, and this proved fatal to them.</p>
            <p>And in the like ſenſe we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſeveral other expreſſions in Scripture, which likewiſe might ſeem very harſh. As <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Make the heart of this People fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and be healed;</hi> all which expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſignifie no more, but that God, for the former provocations and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of that People, did leave them to their own hardneſs and blindneſs, ſo that they did not deſire to underſtand and make uſe of the means of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. So likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24. God is ſaid to have <hi>given up</hi> the idolatrous Heathen <hi>to uncleanneſs, to vile and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural luſts;</hi> and <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. <hi>to a reprobate and injudicious Mind;</hi> that is, as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their Idolatry, he left them to the power of thoſe temptations, which betrayed them to the vileſt luſts.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:37482:220"/>
And to mention but one Text more, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11. the Apoſtle threatens thoſe that rejected the truth, that <hi>for this cauſe God would ſend them ſtrong deluſions,</hi> (the efficacy of error) <hi>that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> that is, as a juſt puniſhment for their renouncing the truth, God gave them over to the power of deluſion; their error had its full ſcope at them, to tempt them with all its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and pretences.</p>
            <p>But it is obſervable, that, in all theſe places which I have mention'd, God is ſaid to give Men up to the power of temptation, as a puniſhment of ſome former great Crimes and Provocations. And it is not unjuſt with God thus to deal with Men, to leave them to the power of temptation, when they had firſt wilfully forſaken him; and in this caſe God doth not tempt Men to Sin, but leaves them to themſelves, to be tempted by their own hearts luſts; and if they yield and are Conquered, it is their own fault, becauſe they have neglected God's grace, whereby they
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:37482:220"/>
might have been able to have reſiſted thoſe temptations; and have forced his holy Spirit to withdraw himſelf from them, and to leave them open and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to thoſe aſſaults of temptation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which they might otherwiſe have been ſufficiently armed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The laſt end of temptation which I mentioned, is to try Men, with a direct purpoſe and intention to ſeduce Men to Sin. Thus wicked Men tempt others, and thus the Devil tempts Men. Thus he tempted our firſt Parents, and ſeduced them from their Obedience and Allegiance to God. Thus he tempted <hi>Job,</hi> by bringing him into thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which were very likely to have forc'd him into impatience, and diſcontent. And thus he tempted our bleſſed Saviour; but <hi>found nothing in him</hi> to work upon, or to give him any advantage over him. And thus he daily tempts Men, by laying all ſorts of baits and ſnares before them, <hi>going about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, ſeeking whom he may</hi> ſeduce and deſtroy; and as far as God permits him, and his Power reacheth, he ſuits his temptations as near as he can to the

humours and appetites and inclinations of Men, contriving them into ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as that he may ply his temptations upon them to the greateſt advantage; propounding ſuch Objects to them, as may moſt probably draw forth the corruptions of Men, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle their irregular deſires, and inflame their luſts, and tempt their evil incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that way, which they are moſt ſtrongly bent. He tempts the Covetous Man with Gain, the Ambitious Man with Preferment, the Voluptuous Man with Carnal and Senſual Pleaſures; and where none of theſe baits will take, he ſtirs up his Inſtruments to perſecute thoſe, who are ſtedfaſt and confirmed in Reſolutions of Piety and Virtue, to try if he can work upon their Fear, and ſhake their Conſtancy and Fidelity to God and Goodneſs that way; and all this he doth with a direct deſign and earneſt deſire to ſeduce Men from their Duty, and to betray them to Sin.</p>
            <p>But thus <hi>God tempts no Man,</hi> and in this ſenſe it is that the Apoſtle means, that <hi>no Man when he is tempted, is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God.</hi> God hath no deſign to ſeduce
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:37482:221"/>
any Man to Sin. He often proves the obedience of Men, and ſuffers them to <hi>fall into divers temptations,</hi> for <hi>the trial of their faith,</hi> and exerciſe of their obedience, and other Virtues; and he permits bad Men to be aſſaulted with great temptations, and as a puniſhment of their former obſtinacy and impiety, withdraws the aids and aſſiſtances of his grace from them, and leaves them to their own weakneſs and folly; but not ſo as to take away all reſtraint of his grace even from bad Men, unleſs it be upon very high provocation, and a long and obſtinate continuance in Sin: But God never tempts any Man, with any intention to ſeduce him to Sin, and with a deſire he ſhould do wickedly. This is the proper work of the Devil and his Inſtruments; in this ſenſe it is far from God <hi>to tempt any Man;</hi> and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the ordinary courſe, and by the common permiſſion of his Providence, Men <hi>fall into temptation,</hi> the utmoſt that God does, is <hi>to leave them to themſelves;</hi> and he does not do this neither, but to thoſe who have highly provoked him to depart from them; that is, to thoſe who have juſtly deſerved to be ſo dealt withal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:37482:222"/>
And thus I have conſider'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which the Apoſtle here rejects, namely, <hi>that God tempts Men,</hi> and have ſhewn as clearly as I can, how it is to be limited and underſtood. I now proceed to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing which I propounded to conſider, <hi>viz.</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Apoſtle rejects this Propoſition, <hi>Let no Man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</hi> By which manner of ſpeaking, he inſinuates <hi>two</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Men are apt to lay their faults upon God. For when he ſays, <hi>let no Man ſay ſo,</hi> he intimates that Men were apt <hi>to ſay</hi> thus; and 'tis probable ſome <hi>did ſay ſo,</hi> to excuſe themſelves for their deſerting their Religion upon the temptation of Perſecution and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. 'Tis not unlikely, that Men might lay the fault upon God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which expoſed them to theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult trials, and thereby tempted them to forſake their Religion.</p>
            <p>But however this be, we find it very natural to Men, to transfer their faults upon others. Men are naturally ſenſible
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:37482:222"/>
when they offend, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Duty; and the guilt of Sin is an heavy burthen, of which Men would be glad to eaſe themſelves as much as they can; and they think it is a mitigation and excuſe of their faults, if they did not proceed only from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but from the violence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, the temptation and inſtigation of others. But eſpecially Men are very glad to lay their faults upon God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a full and ſufficient excuſe, nothing being to be blamed that comes from him. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> did, upon the commiſſion of the very firſt Sin that Mankind was guilty of. When God charged him for breaking of his Law, by eating of the fruit of the forbidden Tree, he endeavours to excuſe himſelf, by laying the fault obliquely upon God; <hi>The Woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the Tree, and I did eat. The Woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me;</hi> he does what he can to derive the fault upon God. And tho' this be very unreaſonable, yet it ſeems it is very natural. Men would fain have the pleaſure of committing Sin, but then they would be glad to remove as much
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:37482:223"/>
of the trouble and guilt of it from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This manner of Speech, which the Apoſtle here uſeth, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate further to us, that it is not only a falſe, but an impious aſſertion, to ſay that God tempts Men to Sin. He ſpeaks of it, not only as a thing unfit to be ſaid, but fit to be rejected with the greateſt indignation; <hi>let no Man ſay,</hi> that is, far be it from us to affirm any thing ſo impious and ſo diſhonourable to God. For nothing can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the holy and righteous nature of God, and to thoſe plain declarations which he hath made of himſelf, than to ſeduce Men to wickedneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e no Man, that hath any regard to the honour of God, can entertain the leaſt ſuſpicion of his having any hand in the Sins of Men, or give heed to any Principles or Doctrines, from whence ſo odious and abominable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence may be drawn. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Thing I propounded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>viz.</hi> The Reaſon or Argument
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:37482:223"/>
which the Apoſtle brings againſt this impious ſuggeſtion; <hi>That God cannot be tempted with evil,</hi> and therefore no Man can imagine that he ſhould <hi>tempt any Man</hi> to it; <hi>Let no Man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth he any Man.</hi> And in ſpeaking to this, I ſhall</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> Conſider the ſtrength and force of this Argument; And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Nature and Kind of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſtrength and force of this Argument, <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any Man;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he is untempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by evil;</hi> he cannot be drawn to any thing that is bad himſelf, and therefore it cannot be imagined he ſhould have any inclination or deſign to ſeduce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And this will appear to be a ſtrong and forcible Argument, if we conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:37482:224"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Propoſition upon which it is grounded, <hi>that God cannot be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Conſequence that clearly follows from it; and that is, that becauſe God cannot be tempted by evil, therefore <hi>he cannot tempt any Man to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We will conſider the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which this Argument is built, and that is, <hi>that God cannot be tempted by evil.</hi> He is out of the reach of any temptation to evil. Whoever is tempted to any thing, is either tempted by his own inclination, or by the allurement of the Object, or by ſome external Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Conſideration: but none of all theſe can be imagined to have any place in God, to tempt him to evil.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> he hath no temptation to it from his own inclination. The holy and pure Nature of God is at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vil, and at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contrariety to it. He is ſo far from having any inclination to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vil, that it
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:37482:224"/>
is the only thing in the World to which he hath an irreconcilable Antipathy. This the Scripture frequently declares to us, and that in a very emphatical manner. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>He is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him.</hi> The words are <hi>a Diminution,</hi> and leſs is ſaid, than is intended by them; the meaning is, that God is ſo far from taking pleaſure in Sin, that he hath a perfect hatred and abhorrence of it. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look upon iniquity.</hi> As when Men hate a thing to the higheſt degree, they turn away their eyes, and cannot endure to look upon it. Light and Darkneſs are not more oppoſite to one another, than the Holy Nature of God is to Sin. <hi>What fellowſhip hath Light with Darkneſs, or God with Belial?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is no allurement in the Object, to ſtir up any inclination in him towards it. Sin in its very nature is imperfection, and irregularity, crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and deformity; ſo that unleſs there be an inclination to it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, there is nothing in it to move
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:37482:225"/>
any ones liking or deſire towards it; it hath no attractives or enticements in it, but to a corrupt and ill-diſpoſed Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither are there external Motives and Conſiderations, that can be imagined to tempt God to it. All Arguments that have any temptation, are either founded in hope or fear; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the hope of gaining ſome benefit or advantage, or in the fear of falling into ſome miſchief or inconvenience. Now the Divine Nature being perfectly happy, and perfectly ſecured in its own happineſs, is out of the reach of any of theſe temptations. Men are many times tempted to evil very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by theſe Conſiderations; they want many things to make them happy, and they fear many things which may make them miſerable; and the hopes of the one, and the fears of the other, are apt to work very powerfully upon them, to ſeduce them from their Duty, and to draw them to Sin: but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is firm againſt all theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, by its own fullneſs and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that you ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> now the Propoſition,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:37482:225"/>
upon which the Apoſtle grounds his Argument, is evidentally true, and beyond all exception, <hi>that God cannot be tempted with evil.</hi> Let us then in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, conſider the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that clearly follows from it; That becauſe God cannot be tempted with evil, <hi>therefore he cannot tempt any Man to it.</hi> For why ſhould he deſire to draw Men into that, which he himſelf abhors, and which is ſo contrary to his own nature and diſpoſition? When Men tempt one another to Sin, they do it to make others like themſelves; and when the Devil tempts Men to Sin, it is either out of direct malice to God, or out of envy to Men. But none of theſe Conſiderations can have any place in God, or be any Motive to him to tempt Men to Sin.</p>
            <p>Bad Men tempt others to Sin, to make them like themſelves, and that with one of theſe <hi>two</hi> Deſigns; either for the comfort or pleaſure of Company, or for the countenance of it, that there may be ſome kind of Apology and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:37482:226"/>
For the Comfort and Pleaſure of Company. Man does not love to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and for this Reaſon bad Men endeavour to make others like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that agreeing with them in the ſame diſpoſition and manners, they may be fit Company for them. For no Man takes pleaſure in the Society and Converſation of thoſe, who are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tempers and Inclinations to them, becauſe they are continually warring and claſhing with one another. And for this Reaſon bad Men hate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thoſe that are good. <hi>Let us lie in wait</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for the Righteous, becauſe he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings; he is grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us even to behold; for his life is not like other Mens, and his ways are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſhion;</hi> as it is expreſt in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Solomon.</hi> So that wicked Men tempt others to Sin, that they may have the pleaſure and contentment of their Society. But now for this Reaſon God cannot be imagined to tempt Men to Sin; becauſe that would be the way to make them unlike himſelf, and ſuch as his Soul could take no pleaſure in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:37482:226"/>
Another Deſign that bad Men have in ſeducing others to Sin, is thereby to give countenance to their bad actions, and to be ſome kind of Excuſe and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for them. Among Men, the multitude of Offenders does ſometimes procure impunity, but it always gives countenance to Vice; and Men are apt to alledge it in their excuſe, that they are not alone guilty of ſuch a fault, that they did not do it without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Example; which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil;</hi> implying, that Men are very apt to take encouragement to any thing that is bad, from Company and Example. But neither hath this Reaſon any place in God, who being far from doing evil himſelf, can have no Reaſon to tempt others to do ſo, by way of excuſe, and vindication of himſelf.</p>
            <p>And when the Devil tempts Men to Sin, it is either out of direct ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to God, or out of envy to Men. Out of malice to God, to ſpoil his Workmanſhip, and to pervert that
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:37482:227"/>
which came innocent and upright out of his hands; to rob God of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to debauch them from their Duty and Allegiance to him; to ſtrengthen the Rebellion which he has raiſed againſt God, and to make him as many Enemies as he can. But for this End God cannot tempt any Man; for this would be to procure diſhonour to himſelf, and to deface the work of his own hands.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon why the Devil tempts Men, is Envy. When he was fallen from God, and Happineſs, and by his own Rebellion had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf miſerable, he was diſcontented to ſee the happy Condition of Man, and <hi>it grieved him at his very heart;</hi> and this moved him to tempt Man to Sin, that he might involve him in the ſame miſery into which he had plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf. It is a pleaſure to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to over-turn the happineſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to lay them level with themſelves. But the Divine Nature is full of goodneſs, and delights in the happineſs of all his Creatures. His
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:37482:227"/>
own incomparable felicity has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him as much above any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to envying others, as above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion of being contemned by them. He grudges no Man's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore cannot tempt Men to Sin, out of a deſire to ſee them miſerable. So that none of thoſe Conſiderations which move the Devil to tempt Men to Sin, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Men to tempt one another to do wickedly, can be imagined to have any place in God.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee the force of the Apoſtle's Argument, that becauſe <hi>God cannot be tempted to evil,</hi> therefore <hi>he can tempt no Man.</hi> None tempt others to be bad, but thoſe who are firſt ſo themſemſelves. I ſhall now in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, Conſider the Nature and Kind of the Argument, which the Apoſtle here uſeth, <hi>Let no Man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any Man.</hi> He does not reject this impious Propoſition
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:37482:228"/>
barely upon his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but he argues againſt it from the Nature and Perfection of God; and therein appeals to the common Notions of Mankind concerning God. We might very well have reſted in his Authority, being an Apoſtle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by our Saviour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily aſſiſted and witneſſed to, by the Miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, wherewith he was endowed. But he condeſcends to give a Reaſon of what he ſays, and appeals to the common Principles of Mankind. For all Men will readily agree to this, <hi>that God hath all imaginable perfection:</hi> but it is a plain imperfection to be liable to be tempted to Evil, and therefore <hi>God cannot be tempted to Evil.</hi> And if ſo, it is as impoſſible <hi>that he ſhould tempt others to it;</hi> for none can have either an inclination or intereſt to ſeduce others to Evil, but thoſe who have been firſt ſeduced to it themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now in this Method of Arguing, the Apoſtle teacheth us one of the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:37482:228"/>
ſureſt ways of Reaſoning in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely, from <hi>the Natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Men have of God.</hi> So that all Doctrines plainly contrary to thoſe Natural Notions which Men have of God, are to be rejected, what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſoever they pretend to; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever plainly derogates from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or juſtice of God, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Perfections, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe, what Authority ſoever it may claim from the Judgment of Learned and Pious Men; yea tho' it pretend to be countenanc'd from the Texts and Expreſſions of Holy Scripture. Becauſe nothing can be entertain'd as a Divine Revelation, which plainly contradicts the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Natural Notions which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have of God. For all Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Divine Revelation, and whether that which pretends to be ſo, be really ſo or not, is to be govern'd by thoſe Natural Notions. And if any thing that pretends to be a Revelation from God, ſhould teach Men that there is no God, or that he is not Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and Good, and Juſt,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:37482:229"/>
and Powerful; this is Reaſon enough to reject it, how confident ſoever the pretence be, that it is a Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>And if any thing be, upon good grounds in Reaſon, received for a Divine Revelation, (as the Holy Scriptures are amongſt Chriſtians) no Man ought to be regarded, who from thence pretends to maintain any Doctrine contrary to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions, which Men have of God; ſuch as clearly contradict his Holineſs, or Goodneſs, or Juſtice, or do by plain and undeniable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence make God the Author of Sin, or the like; becauſe the very attempt to prove any ſuch thing out of Scripture, does ſtrike at the Divine Authority of thoſe Books. For if they be from God, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they can contain no ſuch thing. So that no Man ought to ſuffer himſelf to be ſeduced into any ſuch Opinions, upon pretence that there are expreſſions in Scripture, which ſeem to countenance them. For if
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:37482:229"/>
they really did ſo, the Conſequence would not be the confirming of ſuch Opinions; but the weakning of the Authority of the Scripture it ſelf. For juſt ſo many Arguments as any Man can draw from Scripture for any ſuch Opinion, ſo many Weapons he puts into the han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of Atheiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scripture it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I do not ſpeak this, as if I thought there were any ground from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for any ſuch Doctrine, I am very certain there is not. And if there be any par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cular expreſſions, which to prejudic'd Men may ſeem to import any ſuch thing, every Man ought to govern himſelf in the interpretation of ſuch paſſages, by what is clear and plain, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the main Scope and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Bible, and to thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notions which Men have of God, and of his Perfections. For when all is done, this is one of the ſureſt ways of Reaſoning in Religion; and whoever guides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſteers by this Compaſs,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:37482:230"/>
can never err much: but whoever ſuffers himſelf to be led away by the appearance of ſome more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Phraſes in the expreſſions of Scripture, and the gloſſes of Men upon them, without regard to this Rule, may run into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Deluſions, may wander Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and loſe himſelf in one Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take after another, and ſhall never find his way out of this endleſs <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth,</hi> but by <hi>this Clue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If St. <hi>James</hi> had not been an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, the Argument which he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth would have convinced any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man, <hi>that God tempts no Man to Sin,</hi> becauſe <hi>he cannot be tempted with Evil himſelf,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is unreaſonable to imagine <hi>he ſhould tempt any Man.</hi> For he argues from ſuch a Principle, as all Mankind will, at firſt hearing, aſſent to.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> Thing aſſerted by the Apoſtle here in the Text; <hi>That God tempts</hi>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:37482:230"/>
               <hi>no Man to Sin.

fundamentally neceſſary to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a good Life, than the Belief of theſe <hi>two</hi> Principles; <hi>That God is not the Author of the Sins of Men;</hi> and <hi>That every Man's fault lies at his own door.</hi> And both theſe Principles St. <hi>James</hi> does clearly and fully aſſert in theſe Words.</p>

            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe I have largely ſpoken to in my former Diſcourſe; and from what I then ſaid, I ſhall only draw a few uſeful Inferences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to the <hi>ſecond; Viz.</hi> Theſe which follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us beware of all ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as do any ways tend to make God the Author of Sin; either by laying a Neceſſity upon Men of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or by laying ſecret Deſigns to tempt and ſeduce Men to Sin. Nothing can be farther from the Nature of God,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:37482:232"/>
than to do any ſuch thing, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more diſhonourable to him, than to imagine any ſuch thing of him; <hi>he is of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold evil;</hi> and can we think, that he who cannot endure to ſee it, ſhould have any hand in it? We find that the Holy Men in Scripture are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to remove all thought and ſuſpicion of this from God. <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 36. 3. before he would argue about God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence with <hi>Job,</hi> he reſolves in the firſt place, to attribute nothing to God, that is unworthy of him. <hi>I will</hi> (ſays he) <hi>aſcribe righteouſneſs to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi> So likewiſe St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Is the Law Sin? God forbid. Is the Law Sin?</hi> That is, hath God given Men a Law to this end, that he might draw them into Sin? far be it from him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Is Chriſt the miniſter of Sin? God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee then how tender good Men have always been of aſcribing any thing to God, that might ſeem to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the Author of Sin. So that
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:37482:233"/>
we have reaſon to take heed of all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that are of this tendency; ſuch as are the Doctrines of an abſolute and irreſpective decree to damn the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Mankind; and in order to that, and as a Means to it, efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to permit Men to Sin. For if theſe things be true, that God hath abſolutely decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to damn the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Men, and to make good this decree, he permits them to Sin, not by a bare permiſſion of leaving them to themſelves, but by ſuch a permiſſion as ſhall be efficacious; that is, he will ſo permit them to Sin, as they cannot avo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d it; then thoſe who are under this decree of God, are under a neceſſity of Sinning; which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſince it does not proceed from themſelves, but from the decree of God, does by conſequence make God the Author of Sin. And then that other Doctrine, which is ſubſervient to this, that God does by a Phyſical and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral influence upon the Minds and Wills of Men, determine them to every action that they do, to bad actions as well as good. I know they who ſay ſo, tell us that God only determines Men to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:37482:233"/>
the action, but not to the evil of it. For inſtance, when <hi>Cain</hi> kill'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God determin'd him (they ſay) to the Natural Action of taking away a Man's Life, which in many Caſes may be done without Sin. Very true: but if in theſe Circumſtances the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Action could not be done without committing the Sin, he that determin'd him to the Natural Action, determin'd him likewiſe to the Sin.</p>
            <p>I am far from any thought that thoſe that maintain theſe Doctrines, had any intention to make God the Author of Sin: but if this be the neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe Doctrines, there is Reaſon enough to reject them, how innocent ſoever the intention be of thoſe who maintain them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let not us tempt any Man to Sin. All Piety pretends to be an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God, therefore let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be like him in this. 'Tis true indeed, we may be tempted with evil, and therefore we are likely enough to tempt others: but we ought not to do ſo. It is contrary to holineſs and goodneſs,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:37482:234"/>
to the temper and diſpoſition of the moſt perfect Being in the World. God tempts no Man; nay, it is the proper Work and Employment of the Devil, 'tis his very Trade and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; he goes about, ſeeking whom he may betray into Sin and Deſtruction. To this end he walks up and down the Earth, waiting all Opportunities and Advantages upon Men to draw them into Sin; ſo that we are his Factors and Inſtruments, whenever we tempt Men to Sin.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe Conſider this, who are ſo active and buſie to ſeduce Men into any kind of wickedneſs, and to inſtruct them in the Arts of Iniquity, who tempt Men into bad Company and Courſes, and take pleaſure in debauching a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, and make it matter of great Triumph to make a ſober Man drunk, as if it were ſo glorious an Action to ruine a Soul, and deſtroy that, which is more worth than the whole World. Whenever you go about this Work, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whoſe Inſtruments you are, and whoſe work you do, and what kind of Work it is. Tempting others
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:37482:234"/>
to Sin is in Scripture called Murder, for which Reaſon, the Devil is ſaid to be <hi>a Murderer from the beginning,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>a Tempter. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committeth Sin is of the Devil:</hi> but whoſoever tempts others to Sin, is a ſort of Devil himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Since God tempts no Man, let us not tempt him. There is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention in Scripture of Men's tempting God, <hi>i. e.</hi> trying him as it were, whether he will do any thing for their ſakes, that is miſ-becoming his Goodneſs, and Wiſdom, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other of his Perfections. Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>tempted God in the Wilderneſs forty years together,</hi> and in that ſpace, more remarkably <hi>ten times.</hi> The meaning of which Expreſſions is, that when God had promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to bring his ſeed into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that People, by their great and repeated provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, did often provoke him to have deſtroyed them, and conſequently to have fail'd of the Promiſe which he made to the Fathers. The Devil like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tempted our Saviour to tempt God,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:37482:235"/>
by caſting himſelf down from the Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Temple, in confidence that the Angels would take care of him: but our Saviour anſwers him, <hi>it is written, thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> From which Inſtance it appears, that Men are ſaid to tempt God, whenever they expect the protection of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in an unwarrantable way. God hath promiſed to take care of good Men: but if they neglect themſelves, or willingly caſt themſelves into danger, and expect his Providence and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they do not truſt God, but tempt him; they try whether God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will countenance their raſhneſs, and provide for them, when they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themſelves; and protect them from thoſe dangers, to which they wilfully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xpoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> themſelves.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe if we be negligent in our Callings, whereby we ſhould provide for our Families, if we laviſh away that which we ſhould lay up for them, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n depend upon the Providence of God to ſupply them, and take care of them, we tempt God to that which is unworthy of him; which is to give approbation
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:37482:235"/>
to our folly, and to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance our ſloth and careleſneſs. We cannot ſeduce God, and draw him to do any thing that miſ-becomes him, but we tempt him, in expecting the Care and Protection of his Providence, when we wilfully run our ſelves into danger, and neglect the Means of providing for our own ſafety. And thus I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> great Principle contain'd in the Text; <hi>viz. That God is not the Author of the Sins of Men.</hi> I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second, That every Man is his own greateſt Tempter. But every Man is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when he is drawn aſide of his own luſt, and enticed.</hi> God does not tempt any Man to Sin: but every Man is then tempted, when by his own Luſt, his irregular Inclination and Deſire, he is ſeduced to evil, and enticed; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is caught as it were with a bait, for ſo the greek word ſignifies.</p>
            <p>In which words the Apoſtle gives us a true account of the prevalency and efficacy of temptation upon Men. It is not becauſe God has any deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare Men in Sin; but their own Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uption
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:37482:236"/>
and vicious inclination ſeduce them to that which is evil. To inſtance in the particular temptation the Apoſtle was ſpeaking of, Perſecution &amp; Suffering for the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> to avoid which, many did then forſake the Truth, and Apoſtatiz'd from their Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The true Cauſe of which, was not the Providence of God, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to be expoſed to thoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; but their inordinate love of the good things of this Life, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable fears of the Evils and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it; they valued the enjoyments of this preſent Life, more than the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and that Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had promiſed to them in another Life; and they feared the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of Men, more than the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God, and the dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of another World. They had an inordinate affection for the eaſe and pleaſure of this Life, and their unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to part with eaſe, was a great temptation to them to quit their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; by this bait they were caught, when it came to the trial:</p>
            <p>And thus it is proportionably in all other ſorts of temptations. Men are betrayed
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:37482:236"/>
by themſelves, and the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without hath a Party within them, with which it holds a ſecret correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and which is ready to yield and give conſent to it; ſo that it is our own conſent, and treachery to our ſelves, that makes any temptation Maſter of us, and without that we are not to be overcome; <hi>Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn aſide of his own luſt, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi> It is the Luſt of Men complying with the temptations which are offer'd to us, which renders them effectual, and gives them the Victory over us.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Argument, I ſhall from theſe words of the Apoſtle obſerve to you theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as the Apoſtle doth here acquit God from any hand in tempting Men to Sin, ſo he does not aſcribe the prevalency of temptation to the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he aſcribes the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of temptation to the Luſt and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inclinations of Men, which ſeduce them to a compliance with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are preſented to them; <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is tempted, when he is drawn aſide</hi>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:37482:237"/>
               <hi>of his own luſt, and enticed.</hi> Theſe <hi>two</hi> Obſervations ſhall be the ſubject of my preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as the Apoſtle doth here acquit God from any hand in tempting M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to Sin, ſo he does not aſcribe the prevalency and efficacy of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Devil. That he acquits God, I have ſhewn at large in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſcourſe. It is evident likewiſe, that he does not aſcribe the efficacy and prevalency of temptation to the Devil; for the Apoſtle in this Diſcourſe of his concerning temptations, makes no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention of the Devil; he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth indeed, that baits are laid for Men, <hi>every Man is tempted, when he is drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of his own luſt, and enticed. i. e.</hi> when he plays with the baits that are laid for him, and ſwallows them. And the Scripture elſewhere frequently tells us, that the Devil is very active and buſie to tempt Men, and is continually lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baits before them: but their own Luſts are the Cauſe why they are caught by them.</p>
            <p>And I do the rather inſiſt upon this, becauſe Men are apt to lay great load
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:37482:237"/>
upon the Devil, in the buſineſs of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, hoping thereby either wholly, or at leaſt in a great meaſure to excuſe themſelves; and therefore I ſhall here conſider, how far the Devil by his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is the cauſe of the Sins which Men by compliance with thoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are drawn into.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is certain that the Devil is very active and buſie to Miniſter to them the occaſions of Sin, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it. For ever ſince he fell from God, partly out of enmity to him, and partly out of envy and malice to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he hath made it his great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and employment to ſeduce Men to Sin; and to this end he walks up and down the Earth, and watcheth all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and opportunities to tempt Men to Sin; and ſo far as his Power reacheth, and God permits him, he lays baits and temptations before them in all their ways, preſenting them wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and opportunities to Sin, and with ſuch baits and allurements as are moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uitable to their tempers, and moſt likely to prevail with their particular inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as often as he can, ſurprizing Men with theſe at the eaſieſt time of acceſs, and with ſuch Circumſtances, as
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:37482:238"/>
may give his temptations the greateſt force and advantage. Of this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſures us in general, when it tells us of theſe wiles and devices of Satan, and of the methods of his temptations; ſo that tho' we do not particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how and when he doth this, yet we have no reaſon to doubt of the thing, if we believe that there is ſuch a Spirit in the World, as the Scripture particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly tells us there is, that works in the Children of diſobedience, and that God, from whom nothing is hidden, and who ſees all the ſecret Engines which are at work in the World, to do us good or harm, hath in mercy to Mankind, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us particular warning of it, that we may not be wholly ignorant of our Enemies, and their malicious Deſigns upon us, and that we may be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon our guard, aware of our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and armed againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Devil does not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Men the temptations and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Sin; but when he is permitted to make nearer approaches to them, does excite and ſtir them up to comply with theſe temptations, and to yield to them. And this he does, not only by employing
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:37482:238"/>
his Inſtruments to ſolicit for him, and to draw Men to Sin by bad Counſel and Example, which we ſee frequently done, and probably very often by the Devil's inſtigation; (thoſe who are very wicked themſelves, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more enſlaved to the Devil, and under his Power, being as it were Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for him to ſeduce others;) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, 'tis not improbable but the Devil himſelf does many times immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately excite Men to Sin, by working upon the humours of their Bodies, or upon their Imaginations; and by that means infuſing and ſuggeſting evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into them; or by diverting them from thoſe Thoughts and Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which might check and reſtrain them from that wickedneſs to which he is tempting them; or by ſome other ways and means more ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us. For the power of Spirits, whether good or bad, and the manner of their operation upon our Minds, are things very ſecret, and of which we can give little or no account; but yet for all that, we have many times reaſon ſufficient to believe a thing to be ſo, when we are wholly ignorant of the manner of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="462" facs="tcp:37482:239"/>
And there is Reaſon from what is ſaid in Scripture to believe, that the Devil, in ſome Caſes, hath a more immediate power and influence upon the Minds of Men, to excite them to Sin, and, where he diſcovers a very bad inclination or reſolution, to help it forward, and to keep Men to it; as when it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 13. 27. that <hi>the Devil enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judas,</hi> to puſh him on in that ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which he had already engaged in, of betraying our Saviour. And <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3. Satan is ſaid to have <hi>filled the heart of Ananias, to lie to the Holy-Ghoſt, and to keep back part of the price</hi> for which he had ſold his Eſtate; which expreſſions do ſeem to intimate to us ſome more immediate power and influence which the Devil had upon thoſe Perſons: but then 'tis very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that this power is never aſcribed to the Devil, but in the caſe of great and horrid Sins, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re Men are before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand notoriouſly depraved, and either by the actual commiſſion of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer great Sin, or by entertaining ſome very wicked deſign, have provoked God to permit the Devil a nearer acceſs to them. For <hi>Judas</hi> had firſt taken Council how to betray Chriſt, before it
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:37482:239"/>
is ſaid <hi>the Devil entered into him,</hi> to puſh him on to the execution of it. And <hi>Ananias</hi> his Covetouſneſs had firſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to keep back part of his Eſtate, before it is ſaid <hi>the Devil fill'd his heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo that what power the Devil hath over Men, they firſt give it him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they conſent to his outward temptations, before he can get within them. Hence it is that in Scripture great Sinners are deſcribed, as being more immedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tely under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and influence of the Devil. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, where the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe, who from Heat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> that is, thoſe who continue in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and would not believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Goſpel. When Men are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wicked, and diſobedient to the Counſels of God, the Devil is ſaid to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:37482:240"/>
act and inſpire them, which certainly ſignifies ſome more immediate power and influence which he hath over ſuch Perſons.</p>
            <p>For as it is very probable, that the Devil is ſometimes permitted to come near good Men, ſo as to tempt them; ſo by notorious wickedneſs and impiety, Men do give admiſſion to him, and he is permitted by the juſt judgment of God, to exerciſe greater Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. By reſiſting his temptations, we drive him from us. So St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Reſiſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and he will flee from you:</hi> but as we yield to his temptations, he continually makes nearer approaches to us, and gains a greater power over us.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But for all this, the Devil can force no Man to Sin; his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may move and excite Men to Sin, but that they are prevalent and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, proceeds from our own will and conſent; 'tis our <hi>own Luſts</hi> cloſing with his Temptations, that produce Sin. The Devil hath more or leſs power over Men, according as they give way to him; but never ſo much as to force their Wills, and to compel them to conſent to, and comply with his temptations.
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:37482:240"/>
The grace of God doth hardly offer this violence to Men for their good, in order to their Salvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much leſs will he permit the Devil to have this power over Men, to their ruine and deſtruction. God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to reſiſt the Devil, ſuppoſeth that his temptations are not irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From what hath been ſaid, it appears, that tho' the Devil be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently acceſſary to the Sins of Men, yet we our ſelves are the Authors of them; he tempts us many times to Sin, but it is we that commit it. His temptations may ſometimes be ſo violent as to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate our fault, but never ſo forcible as wholly to excuſe us; for we are ſo far guilty of Sin, as we give our conſent to it; and how powerful ſoever the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be to any kind of evil, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enough of our own will in it to render us guilty.</p>
            <p>I am far from thinking that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil tempts Men to all the evil that they do. I rather think that the greateſt part of the wickedne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that is committed in the world, ſprings from the evil motions of Mens own Minds. Mens own Luſts are generally to them the worſt Devil of the two, and do more ſtrongly
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:37482:241"/>
incline them to Sin, than any Devil without them can tempt them to it. It is not to be doubted, that the Devil does all the miſchief he can to the Souls of Men, ſo far as God permits him; and tho' the number of Evil Angels be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably very great, yet it is but finite, and every one of them hath a limited power; and tho' they be very active, yet they can be but one where at once; ſo that his malice at the utmoſt does only all the evil that it can, not all that it would; he plyes where he has the beſt Cuſtom, where he has the faireſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and the greateſt hopes; he leaves Men many times for a ſeaſon (as it is ſaid) he did our Saviour, becauſe he deſpairs of ſucceſs at that time; and it may be ſometimes when he is gone, theſe Perſons grow ſecure, and through their own ſecurity and folly fall into thoſe Sins, which the Devil with all his baits and wiles, whilſt they were upon their guard, could not tempt them to commit.</p>
            <p>Others after he has made them ſure, and put them into the way of it, will go on of themſelves, and are as mad of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and as forward to deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the Devil himſelf could wiſh;
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:37482:241"/>
ſo that he can hardly tempt Men to any wickedneſs, which he does not find them inclin'd to of themſelves. Theſe he can truſt with themſelves, and leave them to their own inclinations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, finding by experience, that they will do as ill things of their own moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if Satan ſtood continually at their right hand to prompt them, and put them on, ſo that he can go into a far Country, and employ himſelf elſewhere, and leave them for a long time, being confident that in his abſence they will not bury their Talent, and hide it in a Napkin, but will improve it to a great advantage. And I wiſh that our own Age did not afford us too many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind, of ſuch forward and expert Sinners as need no Tempter either to inſtruct or excite them to that which is evil. Now in this Caſe the Devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to other Perſons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves his Snares and Baits where he thinks there is more need and occaſion for them.</p>
            <p>So that we may reaſonably conclude, that there is a great deal of wickedneſs committed in the World, which the Devil hath no immediate hand in, tho' he always rejoyceth in it when it is
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:37482:242"/>
done; and that there is a great deal more reaſon to attribute all good to the Motions and Operations of the Spirit of God, than to aſcribe all Sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the World to the Devil; becauſe the Spirit of God is more powerful, and is always every where, and is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon his deſign, and as forward to promote it, as the Devil can be to carry on his work; nay, I doubt not but he is more active to excite Men to good, than the Devil can be to tempt them to Evil. And yet for all this, I think there is no great reaſon to doubt, but that good Men do many good actions of their own inclination, without any ſpecial and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate motion from the Spirit of God. They are indeed at firſt regenerate, and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, and are continually afterwards under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the ſame Spirit: but where there is a new Nature, it is of it ſelf inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that which is good, and will bring forth fruits, and do actions anſwerable. Much leſs do I think that the Devil tempts every Man to all the evil that he does, or the greateſt part. When the Luſts of Men, and the habits of Vice are grown ſtrong and confirmed, the Devil may ſpare his temptations in a great
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:37482:242"/>
meaſure; for after wicked Men are wound up to ſuch a pitch of impiety, they will go a great while of themſelves.</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as the Apoſtle acquits God from having any hand in tempting Men to Sin, ſo neither does he aſcribe the efficacy and prevalency of temptation to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Obſervation, That he aſcribes the efficacy and ſucceſs of temptation to the luſts and vicious inclinations of Men, which ſeduce them to a conſent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the temptations which are offered to them. <hi>Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn aſide of his own luſt and enticed.</hi> We have many powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but we are much more in danger of treachery from within, than of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults from without. All the power of our Enemies could not deſtroy us, if we were but true to our ſelves; ſo that the Apoſtle had great reaſon to aſcribe the efficacy of temptation, to the irregular deſires and vicious inclinations of Men, rather than to thoſe temptations which the Providence of God permits them to be aſſaulted with, and conſequently to lay the blame of Mens Sins chiefly upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:37482:243"/>
And that chiefly upon theſe <hi>two</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Luſts of Men are in a great meaſure voluntary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God hath put it in our power to reſiſt theſe temptations, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. Now ſo far as the Luſts of Men are voluntary, it is their own fault that they are ſeduced by them; and if God hath put it in our power to reſiſt and overcome temptations, we may blame our ſelves, if we be overcome and foiled by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Luſts of Men are in a great meaſure voluntary. By the Luſts of Men, I mean their irregular deſires, and vicious inclinations. I grant that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man is very much corrupted, and degenerated from its Primitive Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Perfection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but we who are Chriſtians, have received that grace in Baptiſm, whereby our Natures are ſo far healed, as if we be not wanting to our ſelves, and do not neglect the means which God hath appointed to us, we may mortifie our Luſts, and live a new Life; ſo that if our Luſts remain unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, we our ſelves are in fault, much more if they gain new ſtrength, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to habits; for this could not be, if
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:37482:243"/>
we did not after we come to Age, and are able to diſcern between, and to chuſe good and evil, voluntarily conſent to Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and by wilful and deliberate Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of known Sins, improve the evil inclinations of our Nature into vicious habits: but if inſtead of mortifying and ſubduing the evil propenſions of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which is no very difficult work to moſt perſons, if they begin it betimes) we will cheriſh and give new Life and Power to them, we forfeit the grace which we received in Baptiſm, and bring our ſelves again under the Power and Dominion of Sin; and no wonder then, if our Luſts ſeduce us, and make us ready to comply with the temptations of the World, and the Devil.</p>
            <p>Nay, and after this it is ſtill our own fault, if we do not mortifie our Luſts; for if we would hearken to the Counſel of God, and obey his Calls to Repentance, and ſincerely beg his Grace and Holy Spirit to this purpoſe, we might yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our ſelves, and <hi>by the Spirit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſts of the Fleſh;</hi> for tho' we have left God, he hath not quite forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us, but is ready to afford his Grace again to us, tho' we have neglected and abuſed it, and to give his Holy Spirit to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:37482:244"/>
thoſe that ask him, tho' they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited it; ſo that tho' our Luſts ſpring from ſomething which is Natural, yet that they live and have dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ion over us, is voluntary, becauſe we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it if we would, and make uſe of thoſe Means which God in the Goſpel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God hath put it in our power to reſiſt theſe temptations, and overcome them; ſo that it is our own fault, if we yield to them, and be overcome by them.</p>
            <p>It is naturally in our power to reſiſt ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y ſorts of temptations; and the grace of God, if we do not neglect it, and be not wanting to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſelves, puts it into our power to reſiſt any temptation that may happen to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is naturally in our power to reſiſt many ſorts of temptations. If we do but make uſe of our Natural Reaſon, and thoſe Conſiderations which are common and obvious to Men, we may eaſily reſiſt the temptations to a great many Sins. Some Sins are ſo horrid in their Nature, that when we have the ſtrongeſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to them, we cannot but have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural averſion from them; as deliberate Murder, the danger and guilt whereof, are both ſo great, as make it eaſie for any
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:37482:244"/>
conſiderate Man to reſiſt the ſtrongeſt temptation to it, even that of revenge. A plain act of injuſtice, whether by great fraud, or by down right oppreſſion, is ſo baſe and diſgraceful, ſo odious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred by humane Nature, that it is not difficult to a Man that hath but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon underſtanding, and common incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be honeſt, to overcome the greateſt temptation of gain and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; nay he muſt offer conſiderable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his Nature and Reaſon, to bring himſelf to it at firſt. Prophaneneſs and contempt of God and Religion is ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous a fault, and of ſo dreadful an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that every Man that will but uſe his Reaſon, can have no temptation to it, either from gratifying his humour, or pleaſing his Company, or ſhewing his wit, that can be of equal force with the Arguments which every Man's Mind and Conſcience is apt to ſuggeſt to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>Nay, there are many Sins much inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to theſe, the temptations whereto may by the ordinary Reaſons and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of prudence and intereſt, be baffled and put out of Countenance. To inſtance in common Swearing, to which I think there is no temptation, either from
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:37482:245"/>
pleaſure or advantage, but only from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and cuſtom. Now this temptation is eaſie to be conquer'd, by conſidering that every Man that profeſſeth to believe the Bible, muſt acknowledge it to be a Sin; and if any Man be convin'd that it is a Sin, I dare undertake to convince him that he can leave it. He that can chuſe at any time whether he will Speak or not (which it is certainly in every Man's power to do) can chuſe whether he will ſwear when he ſpeaks. If he ſays he does it by cuſtom and habit, and when he does not think of it; a very little Care and Reſolution will in a ſhort time cure any Man of that Cuſtom; ſo that it is naturally in every Man's power to break off this Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The grace of God puts it into our power, if we do not neglect it, and be not wanting to our ſelves, to reſiſt any temptation that may happen to us; and what the grace of God puts into our power, is as truly in our power, as what we can do our ſelves. God offers his grace to every Man under the Goſpel, for he has promiſed to <hi>give his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to them that ask him;</hi> and it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in every Man's power to ask it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Promiſe ſignifies nothing;
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:37482:245"/>
for if no Man can ask the Spirit of God, 'till he firſt have it, then to promiſe it to them that ask it, is to promiſe it to them who have it already, and then 'tis needleſs to ask it. And if God offer his grace to every Man, then 'tis every Man's fault if he have it not; and every Man that hath it, may by the ordinary aſſiſtance of that grace, reſiſt any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary temptation. And if at any time God ſuffers good Men to be aſſaulted, he hath promiſed in ſuch Caſes an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grace and aſſiſtance; and that either <hi>he will not ſuffer us to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what we are able,</hi> or, <hi>that with the temptation he will find a way to eſcape, that we may be able to bear it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>Second</hi> thing I propounded to ſpeak to from theſe words, <hi>That every Man is his own greateſt tempter. Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn aſide of his own luſt and enticed.</hi> And now the proper Inferences from what I have been all this while Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing to you, are theſe <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Not to think to excuſe our ſelves, by laying the blame of our Sins upon the temptation of the Devil. That the Devil tempts us is not our fault, becauſe we cannot help it; but it is our
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:37482:246"/>
voluntary compliance with his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our conſenting to that evil which he ſolicits us to, which makes us guilty. <hi>Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of his own Luſt;</hi> the Luſts of our own hearts give the efficacy to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil. Men many times Sin upon the motions and ſuggeſtions of the Devil: but tho' he be guilty of tempting us, we are guilty of conſenting to his temptations.</p>
            <p>Many times we are not ſure that the Devil tempts us to ſuch a Sin; but we are ſure that we commit it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that we are guilty of it. Nay it is certain, if there were no Devil, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would be wicked, and perhaps not much leſs wicked than they are. The Luſts and vicious inclinations of Men would yield to the temptations of the World, tho' there were none to manage them, and to ſet them on to the greateſt advantage; ſo that we cannot excuſe our faults upon this account, that we are tempted by the Devil. If this were a ſufficient excuſe for us, the Devil would take no pleaſure in tempting us; the whole deſign of his temptation being to make us guilty, and by the guilt of Sin to make us miſerable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:37482:246"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence we learn what reaſon we have to pray to God, that he would <hi>not lead us into temptation; i. e.</hi> not permit us to fall into it; for in the Phraſe of Scripture, God is many times ſaid to do thoſe things, which his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence permits to be done. The beſt of us have ſome remainders of Luſt, ſome ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular deſires and appetites, which will be apt to betray us to Sin, when power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temptations are preſented to us; ſo that it is a great happineſs to the beſt of Men, to be kept by the Providence of God out of the way of violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for our own ſtrength to reſiſt them is but ſmall, and we are apt to be ſecure, and to neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ct our guard; we are eaſie to be ſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ized, and in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual danger through our own weakneſs or careleſneſs. Our greateſt ſecurity is, if we be ſincere, and heartily deſirous to do well, and firmly reſolved againſt Sin, and do depend upon God for his grace and aſſiſtance, that his Providence will not ſuffer us to fall into the hands of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and violent temptations, which probably would be too hard for us; he who knows what our ſtrength is, <hi>will not ſuffer us to be tempted, above what we are able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="478" facs="tcp:37482:247"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From hence we may learn the beſt way to diſarm Temptations, and to take away the power of them, and that is by mortifying our Luſts, and ſubduing our vicious Inclinations. When this is done, (which by the grace of God may be done) Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath loſt its greateſt advantage upon us. 'Tis the Conſpiracy of our Luſts, with the Temptations that ſet upon us, that betrays us into their power. The true Reaſon why Men fall into Sin, is not becauſe they are tempted, but becauſe there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within them, which inclines and diſpoſes them to comply with the Temptation, and to yield to it. It is ſaid, when the Devil came to our Saviour to Tempt him, that <hi>he found nothing in him,</hi> and therefore his Temptations had no force upon him. The more we mortifie our Luſts, the leſs the Devil will find in us, for his Temptations to work upon. Every ſpark is dangerous, when it falls upon Combuſtible Matter; but tho' ſparks fly never ſo thick, there is no danger, ſo long as there is nothing about us to catch fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="479" facs="tcp:37482:247"/>
If we will not be drawn aſide and enticed to Sin, let us mortifie our Luſts; for ſo far as we are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, we are out of the power of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Men are apt to complain of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that they are too hard for them, and that they are not able to reſiſt them, tho' they pray to God continually for his Grace to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This indeed is one means very proper and neceſſary to be uſed; but this is not all that we are to do; we muſt break off habits of Sin, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our Luſts, and keep under our Inclinations, and then we ſhall find our ſelves able to reſiſt and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Temptations with more ſucceſs. And 'till we do this, in vain do we pray for God's Grace, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for ſtrength to overcome the Temptations that do aſſault us; for God's Grace was never deſign'd to countenance the ſloath and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Men, but to encourage and ſecond our Reſolutions and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of well-doing. If we expect
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:37482:248"/>
God's Grace and Aſſiſtance upon other Terms, we tempt God, and provoke him to leave us to the power of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to be <hi>drawn away and enticed by our own Luſts.</hi>
