            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be wondred at by many, and cenſured by ſome, that I to your Lordſhip ſo very a ſtranger, ſhould be ſo bold as to preſume this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; and your Honour may perhaps account it as ſtrange, if
<pb facs="tcp:111543:3"/>not raſh, that without pre-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting your Lordſhip, I ſhould ſo venturouſly undertake to do it. The wonder and cenſure of others I ſhall let paſs, as not eſteeming either the applauſe or cenſure of the vulgar, which is as uncertain and as changeable as the winde: But for your Lordſhips diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which I only imagine may be cauſed by this Dedication, from him who is meerly a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to your Honour; for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of that, let me only crave your Lordſhips patience, and I doubt not, but to give ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional excuſes of this preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as may reconcile your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (not offended, but perhaps ſomewhat amuſed) thoughts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:111543:3"/>your unknown, but cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honouring ſervant.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore let me aſſure your Lordſhip, that it was not my own motion, that incited me to preſent your Honour with this Tractate, (although the worth thereof may deſerve an honourable Patron) for I was ſenſible what boldneſs it might be eſteemed, for me ſo unknown to your Honour, to dare to engage (as I may ſay) your Lordſhip in my quarrel, by calling on your Honour to partro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize a Polemical diſcourſe; on which ground, and for which reaſon I intended to let it paſs without any Dedication, till at length I was perſwaded, by a good friend, one in command at preſent
<pb facs="tcp:111543:4"/>in the Army, to do what here I undertake, be convinced by his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid arguments of the conveniency of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Among which Arguments the moſt commanding was, when he upon his knowledge of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips inclination, having been long acquainted with your Honour, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me how great a lover of Ingenuity and Art he had ever known you, and by reaſon of your accompliſhed parts, how compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and able a Judge of the ſame: which was an unanſwerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to me, to take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of preſenting this to your Lordſhip, as to an able perſon to cenſure the ſame according to its worth and deſerts.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:111543:4"/>
            <p>Hereby (Right honourable Sir) I ſhall give a greater luſtre to the truth for which I contend, when I ſubmit and proſtrate what I have done, to yours Honours judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for cenſure, and at your feet for patronage; confiding ſo to the truth of what I have written, as to aſſure my ſelf, and promiſe your Honour ſuch a foſter childe, as will never ſhame its Patron; and doubt not, but ſo long as the Art of Medicine ſhall continue in eſteem, which will alwaies be, ſo long as it is of uſe, this ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will live with credit, and where-ever it is preſerved or kept, there it will make mention of your Honours worth and deſert, and will prove a more clear and laſting
<pb facs="tcp:111543:5"/>monument, then any ſtatue of braſs or Marble. For, My Lord, I am paſt doubt aſſured, that this ſmall Treatiſe will be in eſteem not in <hi>England</hi> only, but in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as being drawn out of the fountain of moſt undoubted expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: in which though I am ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in reproving common abuſes, yet is it not without cauſe, as if your Lordſhips moſt weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs will permit you ſo much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as to look into the Epiſtle following, and the Book it ſelf, you will ſee moſt evidently.</p>
            <p>'Tis not (my Lord) all our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (but only ſuch as are ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, according to what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove) that I tax, and ſeek to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim; for ſeveral among them
<pb facs="tcp:111543:5"/>(to my knowledge) are Chymically given, as namely Doctor <hi>Ridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gurdane,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goddard</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Dr. <hi>French,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bathurſts,</hi> Dr. <hi>Currar,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, who have choſen the Chymical for the true way, and would wholly reject the other, were they but <hi>(Arcanorum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depti)</hi> Maſters of thoſe ſecrets which are taught and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by true Pyrotechny, after which they ſeek ſeriouſly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulouſly: only ſome thinking all Art with them already, defend their Method, againſt their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience.</p>
            <p>My Lord, who can be a fitter perſon for this Dedication then your ſelf? whoſe office cals upon
<pb facs="tcp:111543:6"/>you, and whoſe power enables you to minde theſe things here within your Honours Jurisdiction, whoſe vigilancy and care in your place hath been already eminent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſeveral abuſes in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which by being ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed, could almoſt have clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med preſcription, (were it not that what is unrighteous cannot claim preſcription) but the ſubject of my enſuing diſcourſe is a diſcovery not of an abuſe of ſelling Beer, for which if a man give a halfpenny too much, he is only ſo much the poorer, and that is all, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the precious life of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and their health, a thing ſo much beyong eſtate, that ſkin for ſkin, nay all the world (if a man
<pb facs="tcp:111543:6"/>had it) oft times would he give for to ſave the ſame.</p>
            <p>This as it is of high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſick, ſo ought it to be the principal care of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to ſee that nothing be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under colour of Law, that may really prejudice, and indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the life and health of any. In vain are men ſecured from injury done to their goods, eſtate, credit, and liberty, while the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of all, their lives, are mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized, and by colour of Patent, bought and ſold. Our Doctors, (I mean the major part of them) maintain a method of medicine, which I impugn; the Controverſie concernes the way of reſtoring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ſafely, ſpeedily, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:7"/>in which your Honour, as a chief Magiſtrate, is nearly concerned; in vain are theeves and enemies provided againſt, if a Method be by authority confirmed and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which is of more dangerous conſequence as to killing of many actually and immediately, of more by not reſtoring ſuch diſeaſes, which may eaſily be reſtored, were but the right way of Medicine allowed and incouraged.</p>
            <p>What their Method performes is obvious to, and the by-word of the verieſt ruſticks in the Nation, and the reaſon why more cannot be expected from that Method, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is erroneous and defective, dangerous and impotent, partly lame and ridiculous, partly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
<pb facs="tcp:111543:7"/>and deſperate: To this Method as a remedy of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I have oppoſed the way of curing and reſtoring diſeaſes by powerful Medicaments, which are adaequate remedies to the cauſes of the ſame, and have hazarded the cauſe in hand, and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation on the trial, if they dare to take me up: But I expect a more churliſh anſwer (by club, or fiſt Arguments) that they will endevour to ſuppreſſe what they cannot overcome, againſt which violence I humbly entreat your Honours Interpoſition, in lieu of whoſe protection, in what on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is juſt, and Chriſtian, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that if they will contend with me <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:111543:8"/>I will ingage on theſe grounds, That whatſoever they ſhall agree to give me for every Cure, I will forfeit twice as much for every one not cured in the time agreed on; that is, in all Feavers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, Fluxes, and Pleureſies, in four daies; in Agues (not Hye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal quartanes) in four fits, in Hecticks and Chronical diſeaſes in thirty (at moſt forty) daies, (now under continual Feavers I comprehend Calentures, ſmall Pox, Meaſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are of that head) provided they will be upon the ſame lay with me in as many Patients as I have for my ſhare, which let them be divided by tens, they to divde one ten,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:8"/>and I another, and alway the divider to have the five Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents which the chooſer leaves; I will engage to perform all my cures without bloud-letting, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by any promiſcuous Purge, or vomiting by any promiſcuous Vomit, that is, which will work on all indifferently ſick or no, without Veſication, or Cautery, without making any iſſue, or curious rules of diet, without Clyſter or Suppoſitory, and let them perform their cures how they can, by chooſing one or more <hi>(nomine omnium)</hi> to maintain the conteſt; and if I wave the combate on theſe terms, let me be ſuſpended from ever
<pb facs="tcp:111543:9"/>practiſing, as a vain-glorious boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and if they win of me, I will recant my opinion with the greateſt both ſolemnity and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they can deviſe to enjoyn me to.</p>
            <p>This as a tryal of Art or ſkill is the true Touchſtone by which I ſhall ſtand or fall if they pleaſe, but I fear they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, ſome of them knowing this by my Medicaments (beſides my own practiſe) one in Town here cures more annually, then any of their Colledge, the man a known man for honeſty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſeveral others both in this City and the Countrey, whom I can call for teſtimonies

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Apologetical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſtudious and courteous Reader, muſt expect to meet with three ſorts of men, and will finde vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainment from each ſort of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this quarrel, and will think themſelves much enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by it; ſuch are thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:111543:11"/>are by this ſhort diſcourſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and will be apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that I am too invective and ſatyrical againſt them.</p>
            <p>To whom I anſwer, that the diſcourſe is indeed polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but the firſt that entred the liſt were themſelves, whom becauſe they bid defiance to the truth here aſſerted, with heaps of reproches on ſuch who were eminent in this Art (here defended) I was bold to meet, &amp; to ingage conflict withal, and let them not complain, if they meet with ſhot for ſhot, and blow for blow. 'Tis true, a midle anſwer puts away wrath, but that is wiſdome where the wrathful party and his anger
<pb facs="tcp:111543:11"/>is to be regarded, but where equal terms are, there I know no reaſon, but a fool may be anſwered according to his folly. <hi>Paracelſus, Baſilius, Valentine, Quercetan, Suchten, Phaedro, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, &amp;c.</hi> were men for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and worth as eminent as any the moſt eminent chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the adverſe ſide; and though of Artiſts I confeſs my ſelf the meaneſt, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to encounter, yet ſo far as concerns the controverſie in hand, I will not give back an inch for the ſtoureſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary party.</p>
            <p>Are they Phyſicians by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion? ſo am I, educated in the Schools as well as they,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:12"/>graduated as well as they, nor was my time idly ſpent, but in the Tongues and courſe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy uſually taught, in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and other Arts read in the Schools, though I will not boaſt my ſelf into compariſon with any, yet if any be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to aſſay what I am therein, I ſuppoſe I ſhall give ſuch an account as not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf the repute of an idle miſ-ſpender of my time and years.</p>
            <p>'Tis not becauſe I never read the uſual Philoſophy, that I do not embrace it, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am a ſtranger to the uſual Method of Medicine, that I ſpeak and write againſt it, and
<pb facs="tcp:111543:12"/>rather chooſe the true Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way then it.</p>
            <p>For the vulgar Logick and Philoſophy, I was altogether educated in it, though never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it; at length <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> Logick I exchanged for that of <hi>Ramus,</hi> and found my ſelf as empty as before: and for Authors in Medicine, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> were thoſe I moſt chiefly applyed my ſelf to, and <hi>Galen, Fuckſius, Ayi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,</hi> and others I read, and with diligence noted, what I could apprehend uſeful, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this practical knowledge a great treaſure, till practical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience taught me, that what I had learned was of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:13"/>and then was I to ſeek for a new path, in which I might walk with greater certainty, and by Gods bleſsing, by the tutorage of the fire, I attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned true Medicines taught ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained by labour and diligence in the Art of Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techny.</p>
            <p>And that I am a litle ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in reproving abuſes in the common way committed, I appeal to themſelves, if what I write be not rather too milde then to invective, if ſo be that what I reprove be true, and that it is true all the world knows, and my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prove by charge will
<pb facs="tcp:111543:13"/>ſtand firm, till by ſome of their champions overthrown, which I doubt will never be.</p>
            <p>I would ſome of their ſide would dare to enter into the liſts and maintain (if poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) their rotten building, their declaimed Method, to whom I ſhall give a ſhort ſurvey of his task.</p>
            <p>That all Diſeaſes (in kinde) are curable; that I affirm, and they deny.</p>
            <p>That the vulgar Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according as they are allowedly prepared; are not true Medicaments, for want of a right Philoſophical prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:111543:14"/>
            <p>That he that is a Maſter of true Medicaments, may cure any Diſeaſe, ſafely, ſpeedily, and certainly, without Veſications, Fontinels, Phlebotomy, Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Emeticks.</p>
            <p>That all Feavers continual may be cured in three daies, or four at moſt; and alſo Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; and he who cannot do that ordinarily, without bloud-letting or purging, is no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
            <p>That all Agues, yea though Quartans, may be cured in three Fits, four at moſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that ſome Hectical ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be, and make the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe harder of cure, or the extreme debility of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb facs="tcp:111543:14"/>make him not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſo ſpeedy recovery, and yet ſo in no long time may the Diſeaſe be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>That ſalivation in the Lues or Tubbing is a dotage, and that that Diſeaſe may be cured though old (in few weeks) without either.</p>
            <p>That Gonorrhoea's, though virulent, may be cured by killing the venome, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotary remedies, in few daies, without any purgation, ſave by urine and a gentle ſweat.</p>
            <p>That all Fluxes, though bloudy, may be cured in three or four daies, without any
<pb facs="tcp:111543:15"/>Clyſter, or Purge, or the like, by appeaſing the inraged Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus of the place, which is ſoon done, and the peccant occaſional matter, will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by urine, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſiege, as alſo by gentle ſweat inſenſibly.</p>
            <p>That the true preparation of all Vegetals, takes away all the purging virulency, and the vomitive quality of them, except only in Opium, whoſe deleteriall quality is turned into a ſtrong Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick, curing the Cough, and all Feavers, and Agues, except of the higheſt gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which require as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:111543:15"/>Arcana's, as the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Gout, or inveterate Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie.</p>
            <p>That Salt of Tartar volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or made into a ſpiritual Elixir, with any eſſential oyle, is an abſolute corrector of all vegetal poyſons (none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) and is therefore a key to command the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick excellency that is in any concrete of the whole vegetable family.</p>
            <p>That his Elixir alone is a better remedy for any either acute or chronical diſeaſe, then any preparable according to the common diſpenſatories, and therefore that way which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth its ſons with thouſands
<pb facs="tcp:111543:16"/>of other Medicines, muſt needs be the better way.</p>
            <p>That though Opium cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, after large ſweat, the next day cauſe vomit (with ſome only) yet it is not to be reckoned among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vomits, becauſe firſt it works certainly by vomit with none: and ſecondly the ſame Medicine takes away the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive quality in all other Medicines or Simples, as Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium, Hellebore black or white, Cambogia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the purgative venomes of Scammony, Zalap, Rhabarb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and having corrected them, loſeth its own vomitive quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty together with them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:111543:16"/>
            <p>That by mean of this key ſpecifick remedies may be had among the nobler vegetals (impriſoned (as they are) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cuſtody of their viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency) for all diſeaſes in kinde, though not ſo ſpeedy, and as univerſal, as by means of the great Arcana's, yet with care, diligence and induſtry, the cures may by as certain and ſafe, though (in the extremeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes) in a longer time perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>This is a ſhort ſummary of my following Treatiſe, which I ſhall maintain and defend againſt the moſt ſtout adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that either by polemical writings, or by actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:17"/>and he that will confute me, let him overthrow thoſe Aphoriſms by argument and by experiment, <hi>&amp; Phillida ſolus habeto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not unlikely but ſome captious Antagoniſt may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my Aphoriſms, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatory, becauſe many of them do lay down what I promiſe to be the effect of the Art by me commended, and many of them deſcribe Medicines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to their ſect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch which they neither do nor willingly would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to be in Nature, and therefore may think to put all off with a laugh, that I ſhould challenge any adverſary to fight
<pb facs="tcp:111543:17"/>on ground which for ought they know is only imaginary, like the ground in the Moon, and againſt weapons, which for ought they will believe, are as meerly Romantick as the Knights Errant enchanted ſpears, ſwords or ſhields.</p>
            <p>To ſuch a merry Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, I might (as ſoon as he hath done his laughing) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the known verſe, fit for the purpoſe:
<q>Per riſum multum facile eſt cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcere ſtultum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall forbear any ſuch aggravating proverbs, and come ſoberly to argue the caſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:111543:18"/>to give an account of my ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as to a man rational may be ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>Go too my friend, Is not the controverted queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true Art of curing diſeaſes? you ſay your Art is the right, and the Art profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont, &amp;c.</hi> and commended by me, is wrong: I maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſentence, which ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ours being contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry each to other, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be both true; I to make it appear that I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your way and method, oppoſe your Diaeticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions as foppiſh, your Bloud-letting, Scarifications,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:18"/>Veſications, Fontinels, either by cautery, or knife, to be cruel, needleſſe dotages, ſo far are they from being the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of true Art.</p>
            <p>I oppoſe your Medicaments as dangerous, provoking na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by their venomous viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency (as we uſe to ſay) <hi>ad reſtim,</hi> and forcing it to play one game for all, hoping that poſsibly (for it is no neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence) in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Archeus, by being put into ſuch eminent danger, it may forget its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anger, through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fear, and in labouring to expell ſo dangerous an enemy,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:19"/>may with it diſlodge its former troubleſome gueſt; this Art ſometimes takes effect, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it makes quick diſpatch of both diſeaſe and life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no more to be uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to true Reaſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, then a man or woman in an Ague or fit of the Gout is to be thrown into a river, becauſe fear of drowning, or a ſudden dangerous fright, hath been known oft to cure, one, and eaſe the other.</p>
            <p>I have rejected your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, Coolers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, (barely palat-pleaſing) toyes, and your diet-drinks, as non-ſenſical, fortuitous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:19"/>your Locks, Tablets, Species, Conſerves of Fox-lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as only mimical jugling feats, to multiply your Fees, and ſwell the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Bils.</p>
            <p>Had I done no more, I know you would have replyed like Oyſter-women, and ſung your Triumphs with contumelies and reproaches without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; therefore to cut your Combs before you crow, I have propounded the true ſtandard of being each of us judged by, and that is by our Work, the only true way of eſteeming each workman.</p>
            <p>For when I have ſpoken
<pb facs="tcp:111543:20"/>what I can in behalf of my way and Medicaments, and you declamed till your lungs be weary, in commendation of your Method, this at laſt will be the ſearching queſtion to both of us, What is the end of my Art, and your Method? and whether of both doth moſt good?</p>
            <p>The end propounded to, and promiſed by both, is curing and reſtoring diſeaſe; this if your Method can do better then my Medicines, it will be applauded notwithſtanding my contempt of it, and if not, it will fall, notwithſtanding your high commendation of the ſame.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:111543:20"/>
            <p>In the compariſon of way with way, and art with art, which is better it may be true, that both may be good, but I have proved your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to be erroneous, your Art untrue, and your Medicaments to be only nominally ſuch, but really poyſons; and yet if I had done no more, you would I doubt not have recriminated, (a poor way of anſwering a Charge) though without any proof.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe I did expect from you recrimination, I have to anticipate your objection, rejected all Mercurial and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial Medicaments, either
<pb facs="tcp:111543:21"/>Vomitive, Purgative, or Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, as being ſallets for your own Apparatus, Pigs of your own Sow, adopted ſons of your own Method, as alſo all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getals, (ſo long as either Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative or Vomitive) and their Oyles, ſo long as Oyles, and their Salts, ſo long as fixt; we renounce from our myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and leave them to you, finding them with you, <hi>[ut ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles labris lactucas].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of you ſhall ſay, that you know not any ſuch preparations as I mention, and therefore do not mention, and therefore do not believe the commendations of them: then ſay I, why do you judge and
<pb facs="tcp:111543:21"/>cenſure an Art you know not? why condemn you and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Artiſts, while you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe? for ſhame ceaſe imitation of the Fox, and condemn not thoſe Hens for lean, and Grapes as ſowre, which are too high out of your reach.</p>
            <p>We knew your Art both Theorically and Practically, before ever we diſliked it; learn at leaſt this candor from your profeſſed Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore according to what we know, we come to your own doors, and dare you to combat, we defie your Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:111543:22"/>as ridiculous, your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Vomits, and Bloud-letting, as dangerous; your Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, Cauteris, Bliſtering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as cruell and needleſſe; and in a word, your whole Method we have impugned.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe it may truly be replyed to what I have ſaid, That if a cure be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo deſperate, or uncertain, or cruell, yet it is good (if it may do good) to be uſed, provided no better way can be had, ſince (not only a little bloud) but skin for skin a man would be content to give to ſave his life.</p>
            <p>Therefore (and very ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably)
<pb facs="tcp:111543:22"/>did I lay down the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Medicines prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by that Art which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and have inſtanced in thoſe remedies which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my promiſe therein, which was an abſolutely required task, for the making good of my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
            <p>For if my Medicines would only do what your Method would perform, as ſpeedily and as ſafely, yet it were the better, as being more ſimple, leſſe chargeable, not tying the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to ſuch curioſity in diet, nor by far ſo cruel, as uſing none of all your martyrdoms and butcheries.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:111543:23"/>
            <p>But if my Medicaments will perform what your Method accounts impoſsible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dare not promiſe, nor give hopes of, as in the cure of the Palſie, Epilepſie, Gout, Agues, Kings-evill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo the Lues inveterate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tubbing, or Salivation, in Gonorrhoea's of all ſorts, without purgation or vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or detaining within doors, and will cure all acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as Feavers, Fluxes, and Pleureſies, Calentures, Small-pox, and Meaſles, at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in four daies, without Blouding, or Purging, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering the Small-pox to
<pb facs="tcp:111543:23"/>fill, but by an Antidotary kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the venome, attenuating and avoiding the peccant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the pores, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the venomous corruptor of the bloud, not ſuffering the Archeus to make any purulent matter; and in all this performance, not tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Patient with forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding drink (a common cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in the vulgar Method) but allowing good Beer, and Wine moderately, in the moſt deplorable Feavers; if I ſay this be made good, certainly, ordinarily, and ſafely, then it muſt follow, that your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is but a bloudy cruelty,
<pb facs="tcp:111543:24"/>and a tyrannous cheat, no more to be pleaded for or defended, then Baal was to be pleaded for by Iſrael, who were the people of God.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid of the Medicaments commended by me, I will hazard the cauſe totally upon making it good, and can give paſt inſtances if required; but if any ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to combate with me, we ſhall not go to rake up things paſt, for to finde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but <hi>Hic Rhodus, hic ſaltus eſto.</hi> If the Methodiſts dare to contend with me, if I do not ſtand conteſt, let me for ever be branded for a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
<pb facs="tcp:111543:24"/>boaſter, and till they do that, they muſt never expect victory.</p>
            <p>If their Method have done and can do what I promiſe by true Chymical remedies, known to me, and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by that Art profeſſed by <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont, &amp;c.</hi> let them take up the Cudgels and come forth; or if they will only try me, let them only give me as much for each party cured, as I will forfeit for each uncured of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in acute diſeaſes in four daies, that is, in Feavers, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Small-pox, Meaſles, Fluxes, Calentures, and Agues
<pb facs="tcp:111543:25"/>in four fits, not Hectical, or if Quartan and Hecticall, in four weeks, provided the ſtrength be not waſted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; and if I ſlink the proof of experiment, let me be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted what they pleaſe, and if I cure not ſix for one, I will recant what ever I have written publickly; let them do the ſame if they dare.</p>
            <p>And as for the dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my Medicaments, which I know they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate; that is but a meer Bug-bear, by which ignorant people are frighted without cauſe, or ground, as the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites are reported to affright
<pb facs="tcp:111543:25"/>their deluded Catholicks, by telling them that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ſince the caſting of the Popes Supremacy, are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Monſters, which thoſe who know our Nation ſee to be but an invention, to keep their people under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, from falling into that Religion, which they call and account Hereſie.</p>
            <p>I before adviſed the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that by the volatile Salt of Tartar all Vegetable poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſo corrected, as not to leave the leaſt footſteps of the ſame, and that without decoction, but only by dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in a heat anſwerable to
<pb facs="tcp:111543:26"/>the heat of the Sun, in which warmth, they in ſhort ſpace are turned into meer reall Salt, which will cryſtallize like Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-candy, tincted according to the concrete, and retaining ſo much of its taſte and odour, as the [<hi>Magnum oportet,</hi> or <hi>vita media</hi>] will retain.</p>
            <p>So far then are theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments from being poyſon, that my ſelf will take of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore, or Elaterium (two churliſh poyſons) or any other Vegetal, of the moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality, a dram at a doſe, and that on a faſting ſtomach, and faſt after it two, three, or four hours; and let any <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:111543:26"/>do the like, and I will lay down the cudgels.</p>
            <p>But I have ſung long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deaf men, I ſhall have done with theſe capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Readers, and ſhall come to ſpeak a word to thoſe who are better tempered, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have firſt given one word of admonition, to prevent a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
            <p>And that is, if that any faults chance to eſcape the Preſſe, my leiſure not permitting me to attend it, they be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their true cauſe; one (in peruſing part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as it was brought me by the Stationer before all
<pb facs="tcp:111543:27"/>was perfected) I obſerved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and that is a large Anachroniſm, which I cannot tell if or no, it were an error of the Printer, or a ſlip of my pen; this I am ſure, it is a fault about of the bottome of the 16. page, where in ſtead of (though he <hi>viz.

            <p>What I complain againſt in them, is no more then what ſeveral of their Apothecaries have ſeriouſly complained of to me, with proteſtations how they are tyred out with their Method, the effect of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines being ſuch, that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Apothecary dare ſcarce appear with his Bils, becauſe he ſo oft told that ſuch, and ſuch, and other things did not
<pb facs="tcp:111543:29"/>the leaſt good, and yet they muſt provide and adminiſter what the Doctor preſcribes, though he be aſhamed after to ask his money for it, and ſeldome receives it without grudging or imprecation. On which account ſeveral conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Apothecaries have been enforced through ſcruple of their trade, to renounce it, and live in the Countrey, on my knowledge; and ſeveral have lamented unto me the languidneſs of their method, and the burthen that lay on their ſpirits in the perſecution of the ſame.</p>
            <p>That Satyrically I call them
<pb facs="tcp:111543:29"/>ſometimes Mr. Doctors, as <hi>Baſilius Valentine (Domine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor)</hi> is not becauſe I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the impropriety of the ſpeech, but in imitation of the vulgar, and that not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently, knowing the rule <hi>ſentiendum cum Philoſophis, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendum ut vulgus;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoever will be critical let him ſpare his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there, ſince I have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him the pains, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I expect ſome Readers of the Hermetick fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who wil eſteem theſe lines, as true guides to noble Medicines, who I do not doubt will ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earneſtly

<pb facs="tcp:111543:30"/>volatile Sulphur though foetid, turn by a due circulation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eſſential Salt, and then have you a remedy for moſt deplorable diſeaſes, which may be further ſpecificated with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vegetals, as the Artiſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the ſtrong odor of it by rectification with ſpirit of Wine taken away.</p>
            <p>Yet the Spirit of Tartar thus volatized with Oyles, is the moſt languid of any, (there being ſeveral waies to perform the ſame thing) and each way giving more or leſs noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) but one is moſt noble, and is inferior to none, but the Liquor Alchaleſt, by which
<pb facs="tcp:111543:31"/>Mercury is ſo diſſolved as to be brought into a ſweet Oyle or Salt, and fragrant, on which though the diſſolvent be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated, yet it is ſo noble a preparation of the ſme, as may be truly ſuccedaneous to thoſe of the higheſt liquor; thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be made the anody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sulphur of Venus, and the glorified Sulphur of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or of <hi>Regulus Martis,</hi> or of the <hi>Metallus primus,</hi> or of any Metalline body under <hi>Luna,</hi> and yet on the perfect bodies alſo, it acts by diſſolution, and gets a virtue inferior to few Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's; of which operations I have treated in a peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe

               <p>WHen this queſtion was put to a certain Philoſopher, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? What is the beſt thing? It was his Anſwer, as is reported of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Light: an anſwer in my opinion no leſſe judicious then witty. Nor much unlike hereto, was that reply of him who being asked, wherefore he was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111543:34"/>born? made this return, <hi>Ad viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Solem,</hi> to behold the Sun. For verily there is nothing comfortable, but by reaſon of its participation of Light, Darkneſs being on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a priciple of dread and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>Now what viſible light is unto bodily eyes, the ſame is the light of underſtanding and knowledge unto the eye of the minde.</p>
               <p>As then there is no ſtate ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and deplorable, as to defect, then the want of light; ſo is there nothing more lamentable nor deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pity, then ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of minde: And of all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as thoſe were anciently reputed the worſt, which ſprang out of the corruption of thoſe things which were before the beſt; ſo when the light that is in a man once turns to be darkneſſe, how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe!</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:111543:34"/>
               <p>As therefore that light is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt deſirable, and the want of it the moſt miſerable, which concerns the ſoul or mind; ſo of all ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that is the worſt, which hath reference to the moſt noble object; &amp; by how much the ſubject of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is better and of more general uſe, by ſo much is the deprivement of that knowledge intolerable, and not to be reſted in. Therefore as he who (not being able to intercept the light) ſhall prevent mens injoyment thereof by putting out their eyes, is worthily accounted moſt wretchedly cruell; ſo he who ſhall with-hold, or obſtruct, or pervert the means of knowledge, in no leſs, if not far more condemnable.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary hand, he who ſhall endeavour to clear thoſe ſtreams of that rubbiſh and trumpery which hath not only mightily ſtopt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo notably pudled the waters of this fountain; as he attempts a work of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111543:35"/>more publick concernment, ſo if he actually perform any thing real here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he will deſerve no leſs of thoſe who are herein concerned (which all igenuous men are, or elſe ought to be) the <hi>Saul</hi> did of the <hi>Jabeſh-Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadietes,</hi> who delivered them from the inſulting Tyrant, who would put out every mans right eye for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now next unto that knowledge which is indeed life eternal, namely to know God the only true God, and whom he hath ſent Jeſus Chriſt; which knowledge is of everlaſting concernment: the moſt noble is that which diſcovers the Creators wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Creatures, ſo as to be able diſtinguiſh their natures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and to apply them to the uſe of Man, namely, to the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the defects of decaying Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the overcoming of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which even unto lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do waſte and deſtroy almoſt in all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111543:35"/>places the poor diſtreſſed members of Jeſus Chriſt, under which many periſh, being in extremity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair expoſed to a ſad ſpectacle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs to the patient, and horrible to the beholders.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſeaſes and miſeries, the fruits of ſin, inflicted moſt juſtly from the righteous Judge, are yet cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by remedies which the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath created, for which end the Father of mercies and God of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion hath alſo created the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, that he being an inſtrument of mercy, in the hand of a merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, might make whole and binde up thoſe whom the ſame God with his hand of juſtice hath wounded and broken.</p>
               <p>This in brief is the uſe of medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge, the ſubject whereof is in the firſt place, the Body and Nature of man, to know it both in its integrity and defects: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all Creatures without man, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111543:36"/>are to be conſidered, either more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; as they tend to the affording of mediciens, for remedying and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting defects; or Collaterally, as they ſerve to elucidate the nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of defects or remedies.</p>
               <p>This Art or knowledge of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary attainments is the higheſt, it is the laſt, and bringeth up the Reer, as I may ſay, unto all the reſt; ſo that though the <hi>Geometrician, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metician, Politician, Mechaniſt,</hi> and the like, are not to be deſpiſed, yet they fall far ſhort of that dignity which is due to the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> whoſe objects is the moſt worthy of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even Man (who is made little inferior to Angles, crowned with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour) under whoſe feer all things have been ſubjected; yet he for ſin is laid under vanity, of which no ſmall part are the diſtempers and maladies, which his frail life and weak body are ſubject to.</p>
               <p>This Art or Knowledge, as it hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111543:36"/>had continual, and ſhall have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſed among men, ſo God hath been pleaſed to diſcover it in ſome degree and meaſure in all Ages, that in no generation there ſhould be wanting a teſtimony as of his Juſtice, ſo of his infinite and tranſcendent Mercy, who is ready as with one hand to chaſtiſe and afflict, ſo with the other to ſuccour and relieve thoſe who are chaſtiſed and corrected.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have been endowed with this skill or ſcience, God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed alſo with a Heart communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative; ſo that they have out of compaſſion unto thoſe who are in miſery, been free in the diſcovering unto poſterity what they underſtood herein, ſo far to wit, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the ſtirring up of the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to a perſonal further inquiry, and alſo be a help to them in their ſearch to diſcover thoſe ſecrets, which they who were before them found bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the healing of this or that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:111543:37"/>
               <p>Among whom <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> one of the firſt and moſt eminent, who left any thing to us upon record of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experimental practice: whoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, as they were in reference to the rudeneſs of his Age, admirable; ſo his Candor in diſcovering the ſame was commendable: ſaving that what he left ſincere, hath (through the abuſe of times) been much corrupted with the placits and invention of ſuch, who not comparable to him in reality, would yet ſeem to excell him in appa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ency. The excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this man as it was alwaies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned by Satan (to whoſe malicious diſpoſition it is natural to envie thoſe things moſt eſpecially, which are or may be of greateſt concernment for the good of Man, either his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or temporal life) So through his policy it was ſoon forgotten by poſterity, and his renowned skill, for which he was not without cauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Divine <hi>Hipporates,</hi> after his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111543:37"/>death was ſo buried with him, that in a ſhort time there was nothing but the bare name thereof retained by his ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>And as nothing ſtrikes a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blow to vertue and verity, then a glorious ſhew thereof without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; ſo by this policy Satan, that he might, if possible, for ever keep in oblivion this ſo neceſſary a ſcience for the uſe of man, At length about five Ages or more from the death of <hi>Hipporates, Galen</hi> comes in upon the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſtage, who as if it were his deſign to rake up the glowing Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Art from under the aſhes of forgetfulneſs, wrote ample Tomes concerning this Art of medicine; and that the memory thereof might be kept from future periſhing, digeſted the ſame into a Method, whereby this Art might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be communicated by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball Tradition in Scholaſtick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and diſputations.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:111543:38"/>
               <p>Now had Satan brought his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign unto a full head, which being once on foot, he ceaſeth not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute with all poſſible craft and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. For as his chief aim is to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſhew from the ſubſtance, knowing that way to be of all other the moſt effectual for the fatal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing and ſmothering truth: ſo this empty ſhadow was ſoon had in high eſteem, inſomuch that being cryed up in the Schools it ſoon got footing all the world over, inſomuch that there was no civilized nation or people, how different ſoever in Laws, manners and cuſtomes, but with one accord they all ſubmitted to march under <hi>Galen</hi> his banner, and counted it the glory of their ſtudies, and the crown of their labours to receive his Badge.</p>
               <p>And to make this the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the Schools invented their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Titles, the more to allure Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to this their profeſſion, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111543:38"/>upon as many as had ſucked out by their ſtudies and diſputations <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> Marrow, and learned his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, ſo as to be able to read a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or make a Commentary upon him the title of Doctors: inſomuch that they drewmultitudes after them; all, partly through ambition, and partly through pride and ſloth, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeelding themſelves to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the common Error.</p>
               <p>By this means the pure fountains of true learning were miſerably pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and poyſoned, inſomuch that as many as drank of them being lulled into a deep ſleep, finding honour and riches in that ſeeming knowledge which they had drank in, were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly contented.</p>
               <p>Yea and to make their ſtation the ſurer, they decreed, that upon penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of loſs of their gradual titles of honour, nor man ſhould dare to ſtep a ſtep out of the rode-way of <hi>Galen,</hi> whoſe Volumes being by Scholaſtick
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111543:39"/>Authority confirmed for Text, they left it to the judgment of acute wits to build what they could or would upon this foundation. In the mean time <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> what of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were extant, are made uſe of in ſubordination to <hi>Galen,</hi> who among his many tedious prattles commented upon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> drawing him in what he could to his own placits, and where he could not he corrupted him.</p>
               <p>Yea and the <hi>Arabian</hi> writers, both ancient and modern throughout all their books, do all with one neck ſeem to draw in the yoke of <hi>Galen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length this noble ſcience being degenerated into idle ſpeculation, on which was built and edifice looking only to gain and popular applauſe, firſt being divided from the Truth, was afterwards rent into three divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of which each occupied a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtation. Firſt there was the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſlopher or contemplative Phyſician.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111543:39"/>Next the Phyſician or practical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. And laſtly, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Doctors Man, who was to minde things of an inferior rank, as namely, dreſſing of Wounds, ſetting of Bones, the cure or care of Ulcers, and the like; while the Doctor who for reverence and profundity of skil deſerved a better office, employed himſelf in the contemplation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes and inward Griefs: who in the mean time promiſeth not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Chirurgion in caſe of any Feaveriſh diſtempers, which outward miſeries and griefs do often cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thus at length finding this Trade to have many Clients, through the degeneration of times, the care of medicines and their preparation is judged too ſordid a work for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Doctor; and the Chirurgion his man, taking ſtate upon him by little and little, waves this work as too mean, or at the leaſt unneceſſary for him alſo: ſo between them the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111543:40"/>Apothecary is ſet up as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Shambles, to which both may reſort for medicines.</p>
               <p>The Apothecary (whoſe work is to be a ſervant both to the Maſter Doctor of Phyſick, and his Man Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Chirurgery, (who of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and wound-dreſſer which was judged too mean an employment for the Doctor) is by degrees now ſtept up even to his Maſters title. The Apothecary I ſay, who is to ſerve both theſe in preparing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Simples according to their direction by their bils, perceiving his cuſtome to increaſe, ſoon waves the one half of his work, namely, the providing of Simples; which gave being to another ſort of Retainers to this pompous magnificent Art, and thoſe are the Druggiſts.</p>
               <p>Thus this bleſſed Science, which in its primitive verity and uncorrupted ſincerity, was in great mercy given by a compaſſonate Father for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111543:40"/>of poor Mortals, whom he in his Juſtice had ſmitten, and which ought ſincerely to be exerciſed with the ſame ſpirit, and for the ſame end, by which and to which it was given, is contrariwiſe at length become the Engine of oppreſſion, cruelty, and butchery, the prop of pride, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, covetouſneſs and idleneſs.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher or contemplative Naturaliſt, who, as was before touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was made a Member of this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as he ſoon grew diſtinct both from the Doctor, and his Man the Chirurgion, yea and from his Mans man the Apothecary, whoſe work was (as in a hopſack) to catch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in ſome one ſyllogiſm or other of the three Figures; ſo alſo did he ſoon outſtrip both the one and the other in Academical eſteem, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his employment being ſublimed a degree higher then Art, is ranked a mong the Liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:111543:41"/>
               <p>For the Schools being indeed the bed of ſloth and idleneſs (yet ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many glorious and painted hangings) have this perpetual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, to eſteem thoſe things moſt highly which are fartheſt removed from reality, ſo that ſoaring into ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, their ſtation is evermore there, where imagination only hath its being: Medicine therefore being made too groſs for them by reaſon of the neceſſary dependency it hath on practiſe, they ſuckt out the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalities of it with the univerſalities of all other natural practical Arts, as Geometry, Aſtronomy, Uranoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Geography, Arithmetick and the like, which they moulded up into one aery lump of Natural Philiſophy.</p>
               <p>The ſtandard-bearer of this Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who though he in many places ſeverely carped at <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> yet foraſmuch as they agreed in the main, nemely in point of much apparency with little or no truth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111543:41"/>they were both accepted and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively read, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> as the Father of Philoſophy, and <hi>Galen</hi> of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
               <p>Thus this myſtery of iniquity had its full life and motion, being guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and graced with a many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, who though in ſome things they ſeem to differ, yet are they but like to <hi>Samſons</hi> Foxes looking ſeveral waies with their heads, are yet tyed faſt by the tails.</p>
               <p>This pompl of Phyſick and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, it is a wonder how far and how faſt it ſpread; for according to the Proverb, They muſt needs run whom the Devil drives; it in ſhort ſpace overſpread and the known world, ſo much of it as was in any meaſure ſo civilized, as to imploy themſelves in learning. Yea, and though naturally mens ambition he very great, and the glory of being an inventer of any new ingenuity be much thirſted after in the world,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111543:42"/>yet was this not able to prevail with any of the ſucceeding ages, but all with one accord were willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and gloried therein as in a notable deſerving Trophey.</p>
               <p>By how much then any one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in wit or parts, he was the more ingaged in the maintaining this poſt with Arguments and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms, alſo in Epitomizing, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating, digeſting and confirming <hi>Galens</hi> Text, which was accounted the height of Scholaſtick attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Thus poſterity being drawn along as with two Coach-horſes, with the authority of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of theſe was a badge of their Academical loyalty; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould dare to ſwarve from theſe, was branded with a note of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy; and ſo being looked upon as Heterodox, was the object of ſcorn and deriſion, and what was moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of all, was hereby <hi>ipſo facto,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:111543:42"/>incapble of degrees of honour and preferment, and ſo conſeqeuntly out of the rode-way of ſerving covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by ſqueezing money out of the purſes of the afflicted, who would willingly give not only their goods, but even skin for skin for the ſaving of their lives.</p>
               <p>For from the time that this ſcience degenerated unto the formality of a Profeſſion, the Schools have alwaies uſed all diligence to engage the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt wits faſteſt unto them; and for the attaining this end, they have wanted no manner of inviting allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as namely honour, reſpect, worldly eſteem, and gain.</p>
               <p>He then who inclines to ingenuity, ſoon after he hath ſome inſight in the Tongues by education at the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar School, he is thence tranſmitted to the Academy to be further culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. Where he learns Logically to diſpute according to the Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and withall, exerciſeth his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:111543:43"/>Oratorial faculty by declamations in turnes; after that he proceedeth to read Phyſiology according to <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> Doctrine, which is diſputed in publick <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> with a great deal of dexterity. Ethicks are added to theſe ſtudies at ſpare times, with the principles of Metaphyſicks and the Mathematicks in generall, and ſome things are performed in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Studies. Thus at the end of four years upon performing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick declamations, diſputations, and the like, the initiatory title of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor of Arts is beſtowed as a crown of their induſtry; from which time till the end of three years, they are to be employed in epitomizing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Liberal Sciences, and reducing them into Syſtemes and Synopſes, and then with a great deal of honour they are declared Maſters of the ſaid Sciences, and have liberty granted them to apply themſelves to the practiſe of any one or other of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111543:43"/>them, when ever called unto it.</p>
               <p>And now the youth ſtands as a ſtaffe ſet up, waiting which way it will fall: for this teſtimony concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them hath declared them to all the world to be fit to profeſs any thing.</p>
               <p>And (not to ſpeak of the abuſe of Divinity-profeſſion, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon theſe termes) if the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of this Arts maſter (who hath drunk himſelf drunk of liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) ſtand toward the profeſſion of Phyſick, (which he may begin to think of when he is Batchelor in Arts) then are there publick profeſſed Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers, whom he may almoſt daily hear declaming on that ſubject; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Lectures if he then attend diligently, and ſhall peruſe Anatomiſts, and read <hi>Galen</hi> over (at leaſt curſorily) and collect notes out of him and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicen:</hi> if he turn over the Herbals, and learn to know ſome plants by name and ſight, and in the mean
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111543:44"/>time in the publick Halls ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute concerning the uſe of parts, the generation of man, the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall quality of ſome things, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Camphire, Quickſilver and the like, (which two ſimples have, after the diſcharging of ſome hundreds, not to ſay thouſands of <hi>Ergoes,</hi> firſt and laſt, out of the Canons of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> more notably puzled the Antagoniſts, (who to this day know not on what ſide to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) then ever the Devil was puzled to finde the meaning of <hi>Ariſtotles Entelecheia</hi>) after I ſay theſe notable performances, he ſhall be licenſed a Practitioner, and dub'd a Doctor, provided he will make a great Feaſt, and give ſtore of Gloves. By which coſtly attainment they make ſure of theſe three eſſential things: firſt, that none ſhall be a Doctor who hath not ſo much money to throw away, and they as have, may be concluded to be fine-fingred chubs, who will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111543:44"/>be more ſcrupulous of fouling their hands with coals, then careful to keep a good conſcience. Secondly, that they will not readily deſpiſe that honour as trivial, which coſt them ſo dear, which therefore they will readily defend what they can. And thirdly, that upon this ſcore they ſhall have fat fees, upon which their minds are more ſet, then how to perform faithfully what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, for gain is the firſt and laſt of their intents. And therefore when a Phyſician is to be dub'd a Doctor and admitted a Brother, the elder Brethren to help him in his practice and skill, give him but one general Receipt, which is the only one which they have worth communication, and that is, <hi>Accipe Donum,</hi> Take your Fees. And as though Counſel in this were not enough, they binde them to it; and leſt they ſhould be out in their Receipt, they aſſign the moſt convenient time for getting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111543:45"/>the Ingredients, and that is, <hi>Accipe dum dolet,</hi> that is, Make ſure of your money while the grief is greateſt.</p>
               <p>This is part of the My ſtery, but not all: For to be ſure both from without &amp; from within, they have ſo far prevailed, as to monopolize the lives of men, (by which means they know they can command their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys) that ſo they might maintain themſelves, their Barbers, Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Druggiſts after a Lord-like way.</p>
               <p>Which Patents of Monopoly, I I conceive might hence have their Original: It may be ſome of theſe Maſter Doctors have in lieu of vaſt Fees condeſcended to be very offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about Kings, Lords, or great perſons, in the time of ſickneſs of a Wife, Husband, Brother, Son, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or ſome near acquaintance or dear friend, to co-work with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in the quick diſpatch of them in their miſery by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111543:45"/>who perhaps otherwiſe might have lingred long, and languiſhed in extremity, or elſe through the ſtrength of Nature, with difficulty recovered that diſeaſe, to have poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fallen into as bad or worſe ſome years after, bothwhich by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines they for ſecurity</p>
               <p>It may be alſo ſometimes ſome ſuch great perſons by the good hand of God eſcape both the diſeaſe &amp; their Doctors (yea ſometimes when many of them together have conſulted by their Medicines to make them fat pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture for the worms) and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all, God hath reſtored them from both dangers (of which that of the Doctor is the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, for he either adds load to, or elſe takes away ſtrength from foyled nature) and then the Phyſician cries out with the Man, who when his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiing friend was ſtruck in the face with a Bow (that he held walking
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111543:46"/>among trees) and complained of the blow, What a blow would it have ſtruck, quoth he, if I had not held it? So he, when he ſees his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably enfeebled Patient after the diſeaſe is gone, What would you have been, had not I let you bloud and purged you, and made you bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water and cooling Julips, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you Glyſters and Cordials to comfort and nouriſh you? but as the Bow would but have bruſht, had not the other held it and bent it, which being held, gave a foul ſtroke; ſo the Diſeaſe would have come off with leſs debilitation of the Patient, had the Phyſician been further off.</p>
               <p>Thus as well by the not ſucceding of their remedies, when the Patient recovers, whom their nature is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy; and the ſucceſs of the ſame when by them a quick riddance is made, credit is gained beſides large gratifications: by this means they get favour with Princes, of which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111543:46"/>one notable improvement hath been, that they alone in the world have the priviledge to murther innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, provided they do it according to a methodical way of Art.</p>
               <p>Two main grounds of this Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly are, firſt, the preſervation of their grain and credit, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gain and credit, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would much be impaired, were not this provident courſe taken; for even old Wives and Farriers, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks and the like, do with ſome ſimple or other, undertake and cure their deſerted Patients, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved confuſion.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, her by they ſhut the gate to all further ſearch in Nature, for as for any among themſelves they are ſure: for who knowes not the mighty force of education, which being once ſuckt in (<hi>a teneris annis,</hi> as we uſe to ſpeak) is ſo lodged that it is with much difficulty eradicated; yea, and although an opinion to an uningaged perſon ſeem never ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111543:47"/>yet to one whom education hath ingaged, it appears not ſo, yea acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes little to the diſcovering the weakneſs of ſuch an opinion, but rather ſupplies curious and ſpecious arguments to maintain it, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any contrary.</p>
               <p>Beſides in this myſtery there is not only a prepoſſeſſing of the phantaſie and underſtanding, but alſo a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation of the will, namely with things by which the will is intangled, as honorary titles of Maſter Doctor, your Worſhip, and the like, which together with Angels and Pieces can as powerfully huſh a muttering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſalve a ſcrupulous breaſt, when it is ſtumbled with the fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous event of the ridiculous method of medicine, as the ſame medicine can looſe a Lawyers tongue and make it rum glib, which would elſe ſcarſe wag in his Clients cauſe.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Truth is not to be catcht with gaping, but with pains
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111543:47"/>infatigable, and ſerious meditation, which they who are ingaged in many lucriferour viſits, cannot attend, they may only read of better things, and ſay, I would I could ſee them, but they not coming with a wiſh, they ſigh and ſay (<hi>Audio at vix Credo</hi>) and as for their own unſueceſſfulneſs they thus excuſe, I proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art, but the bleſſing is in Gods hand, the party was too weak to bear the Cure, or was too old, or I was call'd too late, or care was not uſed in following directions, or the diſeaſe was epidemically malignant, or incurable, or ſome ſuch thing or other is pretended, and ſo the earth covers their defects. And becauſe they kil not all they meddle with, God by his mercy preventing their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſome, therefore they are not diſcouraged with the multitudes they either kill or ſuffer to die miſerably under their faithleſs medicines, while they by their monopolizing Patent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111543:48"/>prevent, leſt any with better medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ſhould ſhame them.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſay they have the Trade wholly in their own hands, a Trade by which they never did nor can cure any, but kill many; but whatever they have that may do good, they have it from the accidental experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of old wives, and good folks, who have found or known much good done by this or that Herb or Simple, which did more good by far when it was ſimply uſed by ſilly women, then when the Doctors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had drawn it into Receipts, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating their virtue by confounding with many others in decoction, or otherwiſe according to their Idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>Whatever then they adminiſter or adviſe, that doth good, it doth it not upon account of any method or art of theirs, but would work the ſame effect if applyed by the hand of a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, as preſcribed by them.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:111543:48"/>
               <p>Yea and often their method of compounding, decocting, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring both in reſpect to the Doſe and time, do notably hinder, if not deſtroy the working and prevent the good of the applyed remedy, though the Doctor little minde that, when once his Fee is in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Even the moſt ſerious of them will confeſs, that all their Art conſiſts in experimental Receipts, which as not being minded by them, I mean the collecting Simples in their time, the keeping of them, and ordering in adminiſtration, expoſeth oft a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to ſcorn, which ſame Simples formerly had commended ſome well-meaning woman in curing a deſerted Patient, to the Doctors diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Whoſe Art, I mean of feeling pulſes, toſſing urines, and propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them, ſtirring of cloſe-ſtools, letting of bloud, (at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it to be done) preaching on the diſeaſe, ordering of diet, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111543:49"/>purgations and the like, is but a meer impoſture, a cheat of the world, a butchering of the ſick (which is even a proverb among the vulgar, yet the Doctor minding his ſees too much, will not perceive, at leaſt will wink at, being content to bear any thing ſo he may get money) for which a dreadfull account will at laſt be exacted by the juſt Judge, of them who pretending to take the cave of the ſick, devour families, and then expect a reward for deſtroying them.</p>
               <p>But this only being intended for an Introduction, and my propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſcope to diſcover nature, and withall to vindicate noble <hi>Helmont</hi> from unjuſt reproaches, I ſhall leave a while the Doctors to their Clients, and come to give a brief of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all let me ingenuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that I have no perſonal quarrel with any, nor do I upon any ſuch account write prejudicately.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:111543:49"/>
               <p>Secondly, That I purpoſe not to diſparage any thing that is good in them, to make what is bad on my ſide to appear good, or what is but indifferent to ſeem excellent, but ſhall deal as candidly with them as may be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That what I write ſhall not be out of a principle of <hi>(Jurandi in verba Magiſtri)</hi> but what I write ſhall be for explication and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, not for repetition ſake.</p>
               <p>Now concerning my ſelf it will be requiſite that I ſhould ſpeak a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, not out of any content that I take therein, but to give the Reader ſome ſmall ſatisfaction, in what he may, at leaſt as I conceive, be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced.</p>
               <p>For mine own part, I know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this my labour will be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, yet I will be ſure to reproach none, and though I merrily (and yet not without averſion of ſpirit) carp at ſome things, yet before the cloſe of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111543:50"/>this Treatiſe, I ſhall give Reaſons, I hope, ſatisfactory for this practiſe: for

               <p>If any be troubled at my ſporting jeſts now and then caſt, I muſt needs ſay there is in my Jeſts nothing ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous, immodeſt, or uncivil, nor any thing bad in them, except it be that they are true, I wiſh heartily they were not.</p>

               <p>AS touching the Art of Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techny and Chymiſtry, I muſt ſeriouſly profeſs, that of all Arts in the world it is to me moſt pleaſing, becauſe its principles to an ingenious man are demonſtrable by the fire.</p>
               <p>It was not conceit, nor novelty, nor
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111543:50"/>hope of gain, that allured me, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love and deſire of truth. For I found demonſtrably that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of common Philoſophy were totally rotten.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſuſpicion of them was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a diſpute of the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making Gold potable, which being by the Antagoniſt held nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, I, what out of Authors and what by ſtudy, did ſo evince the poſſibility of it, that my arguments were by him unanſwerable, and to my ſelf ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>The ſpeculation I confeſs pleaſed me well, who above all things in the world prized health, and as my mind was naturally propenſe to action, I deſired much to make it; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting my ſelf with the common Maxim, <hi>Dimidium facti qui bene coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit habet,</hi> He who hath well begun hath half done: And remembring that in Theory there were but two parts, namely, <hi>An ſit, &amp; quomodo ſit,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:111543:51"/>
               <p>That a thing may be done, and how. Alſo that the firſt-could not be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably proved without ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at leaſt in the latter, I collected (upon this confidence) out of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Logical Authors, what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I could touching the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this ſubject, whereof I conceived that I fully underſtood the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For alas I thought that the Logical heads of invention, eſpecially according to <hi>Ramus,</hi> would not ſail to unfold to me this whole myſterie. Hereupon concluding what I had proved that the thing was fecible, I wrote a Congeſt of methodical Arguments which might unfold how; and here I found my ſelf in a wilde labyrinth, for I was ſoon by theſe ſtudies brought to ſee the rottenneſſe both of Logick and Philoſophy, and found that he who ſought truth of things there, might ſoon loſe himſelf.</p>
               <p>This put me upon deſire of a more ſecure path, for now I apprehended
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111543:51"/>(before years and titles had engaged me) that beſides what I knew in Tongues, my skill in Logick and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was not worth contemning, yea nothing was in mine eyes more vile.</p>
               <p>I therefore rejected <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and all his fictions, againſt whoſe fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhew I wrote with a pen dipt in ſalt and vinegar, yet without gall, a Treatiſe called <hi>Organum novum Philoſophiae:</hi> but before I could pitch on what way to turn, (for knowledge I deſired too too immoderately) I wandred through many penſive hours, and waking nights, till at length I got ſom Chymical Authors.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then I peruſed and noted with much diligence, not ſo much out of deſire to rifle their Heſperian Garden, as to ſuck out of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſome ſolid truth; for truth I knew was uniform. Wherefore as many experiments as I could try I tryed, and took nothing upon any
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111543:52"/>mans truſt, ſo as to build any thing on it, or to draw any concluſion from it: I invented many ſorts of Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, procured what Glaſſes were poſſible, with all manner of Simples, Mineral and Metalline eſpecially (which I moſt eſteemed) in theſe I ſpent my time for ſeveral years, and I may ſay without boaſting, that if ever any in the world were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatigable proſecutor of experiments, I was one.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo far to be propitious unto my labours, ſtudies, and many watchings, that he let me ſee ſo much of truth, as to make it lovely to me; for which cauſe (next to the glory of God) I ſhall proſecute the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my life.</p>
               <p>Nor was this an imaginary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only, but real, for there is ſo great variety of objects in Nature which are exceedingly delightful to be underſtood, that the diſcovery of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111543:52"/>any of them (which is uſually the crown of ſerious ſearches) is more content, then finding of ſought trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure can be to him who in hopes of it digs the earth. And although the wiſe man by an unerring Spirit hath laid all theſe things under vanity, ſo that in much knowledge there is much vexation of ſpirit, yet withall, the Scripture teacheth us that the works of God are wonderful, ſought out by all that have delight in them; yea and if a mans heart be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly out of frame, a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold the excellencies of the Creature without a contemplation of the ſuper-tranſcendent glory, power, and wiſdom of the Creator, of which all things viſible are but Emblems. Yet do I not deny but that the ſpirit may be carried forth with too much eagerneſs after things of this nature, which I have often ſuſpected to be mine own fault, but this is the fault of us, that ſo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111543:53"/>affect outſide, as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the inward glory; and ſo much admire the apparent glory of things viſible, as not enough to adore him who dwelleth in light inacceſſible, of whoſe beauty theſe are but ſparks.</p>
               <p>There is then on unſpeakable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit may ariſe to a painful enquirer after the myſteries of Nature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the ſpiritualizing of the affections, ſince as <hi>civero</hi> ſaid of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that if it were to be ſeen with eyes corporal it would enamo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the beholders, it may moſt prioperly be applyed to this caſe. For who is he who when he beholds Gods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wiſdom, power, goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which all are moſt obvious in the ſtudy of Nature, which is one of the Books in which the Almighty is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that will not cry out with <hi>Job, I have heard of thee by the ear, but now mine eye ſoeth thee:</hi> and with <hi>David, O Lord how wonderful are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111543:53"/>thy works! the fool conceiveth them not, nor the unwiſe underſtandeth them, &amp;c.</hi> But conſidering, that God hath endowed us with a Body, in which our Soul, which is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image, is caged as it were, by means of which we have our place here among natural things. And foraſmuch as our life is laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vanity, of which our diſeaſes to which our body is ſubject, which are to us the Heralds of death, is no ſmall pirt.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſince man being by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ordaining made Lord of the other Creatures, and theſe are made to ſerve him; inſomuch that there is force concrete which hath not its immediate uſe applicable to man, either for this neceſſity or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. And therefore all things are given into his hand, that of them he may take for meat and drink what nature craveth, for raiment what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and modeſty and decency
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111543:54"/>call for, and likewiſe for the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the defects of decayed nature what is needfull therein: God like a tender Father having provided for man in every reſpect, and on every occaſion. I think it a great ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them who cannot ſee both the nobleneſs and uſefulneſs that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Gods works carrieth with it, inſomuch that he who ſhall neglect it, doth neglect in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion a great part ofthe task for which he came into the world, and is not to be pityed if he fall ſhort of the comfort, content or benefit that he might reap in the knowledge of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now that all creatures have in them a ſpiritual Celeſtial virtue, I ſuppoſe there is none moderately verſed in Philoſophy that will deny, and we ſhall in its place ſufficiently diſcover, which in concerete Bodies is more hidden, moſt of all in ſuch which are of the moſt exquiſite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:111543:54"/>
               <p>This Celeſtial Spirit is that which is the life, excellency, and perfection of all things in which it is, and though it have received in all ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficated ſubjects a determination, or bounding of its virtue, yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelf is free to operate upon other ſubjects, and its operations are received <hi>permodum recipientis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here is the grand fault or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of thoſe whoſe office it is more peculiarly to enquire into theſe things, that they ſupinely neglect the ſearch of the hiddent ſpirit, which is in all things by ſo much the more ſtraightly ſealed, by how much the more ſtraightly ſealed, by how much it is in virtue more noble and excellent.</p>
               <p>Contenting themſelves with an overly view of the ouſtide of things, although yet they have the care of lives committed to their charge, which fault as it is of high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo it requires a moſt ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
               <p>For there are in Nature moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111543:55"/>and powerful medicines, made by God for the uſe and relief of the afflicted, which yet are neglected by ſuch, who undertake the care and cure of them, and all becauſe they are not without pains and induſtry attainable. But go too, my good friends, hath not God laid this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon mankinde, that in the ſweat of his brow he ſhould eat his bread? muſt be toyle for his daily meat, and do you thing that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines do grow ready made to his hand.</p>
               <p>Or if the ground do of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord bring forth ſome fruits, as Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Cherries, or the like, ſee you not how ready they are to grow wilde if not cultivated? Nay, is not this vanity laid upon the Univerſe, and doth not the earth grone under this curſe, that thornes and thiſtles it ſhall bring forth, and all to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this ſentence which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt man, that in labour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111543:55"/>he ſhould eat his bread, and what is Analogical to bread, with induſtry he ſhould provide Medicaments; the one for ſuſtaining, the other for the reſtoring of nature.</p>
               <p>Ile grant that there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things which are to be found among Simples, but firſt of all their virtue is more preciſely ſingular, one being properly directed for one or two diſeaſes, and the number of Simples being ſo infinite, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them of little virtue, ſo many of none medicinal, but being deſtined for meat for man or beaſt; ſo many being ſo virulently deſtructive to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is no way ſafe in their crude ſimplicity to uſe them, all of them being reſtrained to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſtempers, and manner of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, a mans life would not ſerve him to be half a Phyſician, in the uſe of Simples, without preparation or correction. When it appears that the Art of Pyrotechny is indeed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111543:56"/>moſt uſeful, neceſſary, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which God willing in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe I ſhall fully diſcover.</p>
               <p>And to cloſe this Preface, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and promiſe to make good, that by the Art of Pyrotechny, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are to be made and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; of which one is of as much ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, as all the herbs, roots, trees and Animals in the world, all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, uſed in their naked ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p>Which Art moſt commendable in it ſelf, uſeful to mankinde, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the Artiſt, hath been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſlandered, reproached, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and gainſaid by the verbous rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Galeniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who yet profeſſing themſelves the only heirs of Medicinal Art, do promiſe that to the world by their method, which for theſe many cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of years they have found ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeleſs; and this notwithſtanding they do continue to maintain that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111543:56"/>by virtue of monopoly, which all the world diſcovers to be but a meer juggle.</p>
               <p>What diſdain and contumely have they not caſt upon <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> by traducing them and ſpeaking all manner of evil concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them? and this only is the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that theſe come to diſcover to the World the unſufficiency of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar medicines.</p>
               <p>This true light of Nature theſe Night-birds cannot bear, the true heir theſe uſurpers will not endure, but no ſonner eſpie they him, but they conclude, This is the heir, come let us kill him, and then the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall be ours.</p>
               <p>Therefore let not any marvel, if I now a little ſeverely carp at Errors, for this is the only way that is now left, all other means have been tryed, they by many have been moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called upon to awake out of the dead ſleep in which they are; but it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111543:57"/>were as good to call upon poſts or ſtones, for they only rub their eyes, and reproach ſuch who diſturb them, but ſleep again as ſoundly as ever; it is good then to ſcourge and prick them, whom jogging will not do good upon.</p>
               <p>And becauſe they have had a long time that knaviſh principle of calling whore firſt, it is not amiſs ſometimes to anſwer a fool accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his folly, leſt he be wiſe in his own conceit.</p>
               <p>Who knowes not how common it is for that Tribe to inveigh againſt Chymical Medicines moſt bitterly; ſometimes accuſing their virulency, ſometimes their acuteneſs in operation; and for proof they will bring all the Mountebanks, Empiricks, and raſh Pſudo-chemiſts on the ſtage, forgetting in the mean time that they do as much differ from what they would make them to be, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do from true Philoſophers,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111543:57"/>that is as much as light doth from darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Nay, rather the forementioned Rabble, as alſo the ſcum of Brothels, old Wives, Quacks, and the like, do but uſher in their own train: for who knows not, that one Apothecary or Mechanical Chymiſt doth ſupply both the one and the other?</p>
               <p>Let us not content about words, but come to the thing it ſelf, and we ſhall by it ſee to which houſe theſe villanies are retainers; &amp; when I have traced them to their own doors, I ſhall expreſs more candor then ever the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> in urging this Controverſie were guilty of: for although they make it their common practiſe to lay this ſpurious off-ſpring at the true Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts doors, and then to revile them as guilty of all their miſcarriages, yet we ſhall firſt prove this baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off-ſpring to be a <hi>Galenical</hi> Brat, of which the Father is (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe) aſhamed, unleſs it be that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111543:58"/>they oft at random hit the diſtemper, which the reverend Doctor by his bleer-ey'd, purblinde method could not do, and cure the ſame, though with a deſperate medicine which the other deſpaired of; and after the true father of this infamous genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is found, we ſhall not impute the blame of the children unto the fathers, but ſuffer every one to bear his own blame: which moderation of ours, I hope will for ſhame-ſake teach the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> for the future to endevour the like, in imitation of our candidneſs.</p>
               <p>And firſt I beſeech the impartial Reader to conſider how, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the followers of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> and their like differ from the followers of <hi>Galen</hi> and thoſe who ſubſcribe to him: is not this the main difference, nay the only, that one is the immediate follower of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of his Author, ſo far only as he doth bear faithful witneſs to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111543:58"/>her operations: the other is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate follower of him whom he makes the Captain of his Notions, to whoſe placits if Nature will not comply, he will either force her or adieu.</p>
               <p>Is not this evident in all our Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Doctors, and hath been ſo for ſeveral ſucceſſive Ages? Is not ſubſcription the top ſtone of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Art? Is not <hi>Galens</hi> method to this day retained and defended, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which all created Doctors are ingaged to go; and what I pray is this Method? but by Rules ſet down to finde out the diſeaſe Diagnoſtically, to diſcover the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it Prognoſtically, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the cure of it according to the precepts of Art, that is, according to the judgement of ſome approved Author, in which the Doctor readeth when to apply the cardinal remedies of bleeding, ſcarifying, veſicating, cauterizing, purging, or the like, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:111543:59"/>when to make uſe of Cordials either cooling or others.</p>
               <p>Now the practick part is that in which the Doctor is for the moſt part but an errand bungler, yet he hath at command his Chirurgion and Apothecary that can indeed effect what he by his Gooſequill ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
               <p>Now that Medicines ſoever are allowably uſed, they are ſet down plainly and fully in the Diſpenſato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with their preparations, uſe, and doſe.</p>
               <p>And for the regulating of ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men in finding out new receipts, the Herbals are compiled, in which the form, names, places of growth, and all the like circumſtances of Herbs, Plants, Roots, and Trees are ſet down, with their qualifications of temperature, virtues, preparation, and doſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as every practitioner is of a more happy, wit, ſome do concin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111543:59"/>the Theory, others the practick of the Art, ſo that the world is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt full of the multitudes of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes which are written concerning this Art, ſome ſhewing its Method, others its Practick, a third ſort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling volumes only ſtuffed with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch Books there is ſcarce a Language barren, ſo that whoever hath a minde to apply himſelf to the ſtudy of Phyſick, he need not want Authors; in whom he may fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the received Doctrine, finde the Anatomy of the Body with every part of it, the Syſteme of all diſeaſes, with a particular account of every one by it ſelf, and that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtically and Prognoſtically, with the Remedies of them, corraded out of the moſt authentick Authors, as <hi>Sennertus, Fernelius, Fuckſius,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>The true Chymiſt, is he who by an earneſt deſire of knowledge is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111543:60"/>carried on the ſearch of Nature, to the diſcovery of its defects, and the remedies thereof, and from an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of being profitable to thoſe among whom he lives, he is willing to undergoe any pains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the <hi>Adagy,</hi>
                  <q>Virtutem poſuere dii ſudore parandam.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He conſiders with himſelf the ſad ſtate in which Mankinde is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to diſtempers, of which being truly ſenſible, and withall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that the ſame God who had laid this burden upon the Earth, that thornes and thiſtles it ſhould bring forth to man all the daies of his life, untill he ſhould return to the earth from whence he was taken, who being duſt was to return to duſt, the ſame God I ſay had created a medicine out of the earth, which he that was wiſe ſhould not contemn: conſidering alſo how the mercies of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111543:60"/>the moſt High were over all his works, whoſe Juſtice reached to the clouds, but his Mercy unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; he concluded that God out of his infinite mercy had provided in Nature a Remedy againſt all infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and maladies, could but we be ſo wiſe as to finde it out.</p>
               <p>Hereupon he ſpareth not his ſoul from ſtudious ſearch and enquiry, but by knocking at the throne of grace in prayer, and ſeeking in the creatures without wearineſs or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy, he makes it his whole work to ſtudy and endevour the finding out of thoſe Medicines, which may effectually evidence out the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of them to be ſuch whom the Lord hath choſen for a Phyſician, and whom he hath appointed to be honoured for neceſſity ſake.</p>
               <p>The evidence of his call is not his Ladies hand with a ſmooth tongue, which is the uſual Diploma of a Goodſequill Doctor, who when he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111543:61"/>comes to viſit his patient, after a few methodical Queries, and upon them a Scholaſtick Declamation extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore upon the Symptomes; cals for his pen and ink, and writes a Bill to his Apothecary of a foot long, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Patient is in purſe: which being done he expects his Fee, and in the mean time is in fee with his Apothecary, (I know what I ſay) who annually allows the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſo much for packing in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of dear Simples into the bill, for many of which he hath an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand diſpenſation (upon the notice of a private mark) to ſubſtitute <hi>quid pro quo</hi> and ſome things to leave out: this is a pretty Cheat, but very uſual in that Tribe: but I paſs that.</p>
               <p>On the other hand this true Son of Art, he conſiders the vaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between the <hi>Galenical</hi> promiſes, and their performances, and pondering the Reaſon of it, he findes it can be no otherwiſe.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:111543:61"/>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe of their ſupine neglect of Nature her ſelf, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with turning over of leaves, and through lazineſs chooſing rather to ſubſcribe, then to undergoe the trouble &amp; pains of ſearch &amp; inquiry.</p>
               <p>Which alone defect, if it were not otherwiſe aggravated, were ſufficient to fruſtrate both their promiſes, and the patients hopes, and that in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold reſpect.</p>
               <p>For who it that is but moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verſed in the principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that knowes not that diſeaſes new and new do daily come upon the ſtage? God puniſhing, as I may ſo ſpeak, our unheard of ſins with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Judgements.</p>
               <p>Which the Doctors when they meet with, they are beyond their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and cry out of a new Diſeaſe, yet content themſelves with the old Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
               <p>Nay what more common, then to have a ſociety of Doctors, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:111543:62"/>called, of whom ſcarce two will agree together in the ſtating of the diſeaſe, and all at their wits end as to the matter of cure.</p>
               <p>And beſides this, conſider how the moſt of the ring leaders of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical</hi> rabble, are of different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and of different Ages in which they lived, in the which reſpect they can not be looked on as agreeing to thoſe times and places for which they are made uſe of. For in ſeveral cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, there is not only a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Simples as to their nature and virtue, but alſo the bodies of men do wonderfully alter according to the ſoyl they live in, according to the Adagy,
<q>Solo natura ſubeſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What then more abſurd, then to make uſe of the preſcription of a <hi>Grecian,</hi> who lived and wrote 1200 years agoe, and to apply it to an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh temper? eſpecially ſince new
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:111543:62"/>diſeaſes have appeared ſince which never were before, which once ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received admittance, never are extirpated (as to their ſpecies) but by their complication do not only aggravate, but alſo notably alter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſo that what formerly might eaſier have been cured, become now more obſtinate and unmaſterable.</p>
               <p>I may here take notice of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs and abominable neglect committed in the preparing of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, only what I before, touched, I would firſt more fully illuſtrate, namely, that it is not an exotical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that is or may be proper for an Engliſh conſtitution.</p>
               <p>And firſt I need not urge that God hath abundantly provided for mans wel-being, where ever he hath alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a place of being, ſince that only oppoſeth the neceſſity, not the efficacy of tranſmarine Simples; for a man may in any place of the world, if he pleaſe, and can get it, eat only
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:111543:63"/>what is of <hi>Englands</hi> growth, though he live in <hi>Spain,</hi> but it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; ſo he may uſe exotick Simples, although he be not bound to them: yet thsi I ſhall not doubt to inſert, that as no food, ſo no medicaments are ſo proper for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> bodies, as thoſe which <hi>England</hi> produceth. And ſo in other Countreys, as <hi>France, Germany, Spain,</hi> or any other Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, their native Simples are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as for the conſervation of their bodies in its integrity, ſo for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of its defects, if ſo that any were ſo wiſe as to be able to collect, and to apply the ſame.</p>
               <p>But as nothing that is excellent wants its difficulty, ſo the attaining of the skill of Simples is a work of no ſmall trouble; experience hath taught the world how great a maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece it is to gather and order To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco aright, not to ſpeak of the vaſt diſproportion which the difference of Climates addes to its goodneſs;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:111543:63"/>it is notoriouſly known to all that are experienced in it, that the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, manuring, gathering, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, and after the making it up and keeping it, may with a ſmal neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, make that which otherwiſe would be very good, to become lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth or quite naught. And let not any imagine, that medicinal herbs require leſs care in their choice, manuring, climate, ſoyle, gathering, ordering and keeping, then Tobacco doth. I ſhall not inlarge, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple brought, if conſidered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, will convince many whom it concerneth, of groſs errors commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this particular.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt, O Man, if good or bad Tobacco be brought thee, and canſt value it accordingly, though it concern only an unprofitable ſtinking vapour; but if any herb for thy health be to be procured, thou art in this wholly ignorant, and ſuch as ſhould provide for thee herein are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:111543:64"/>as ignorant as thy ſelf, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor that preſcribes it to thee is moſt ignorant of all.</p>
               <p>As for Simples, are they not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by women, where they can finde them, without diſtinction of time when, and ſeaſon in which they are gathered? and if any herbs grow in gardens, how are they ordered? is not the chief care by much watering to make them grow as rank as may be: which if for diſtillation, I mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it not much, for the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable flegm only is attained by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, without previous macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ferment, but as for dryed herbs, (the flowers ſet aſide) how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably are they gathered, (oft in rainy weather) and then how are they dryed oft in the Sun, until they be as dry that they may be powdered; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> drying, how much it prejudiceth the virtue, I appeal to ſuch as make hay, which if ſear-dryed in the Sun, is half in half damnified; but if cut in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:111543:64"/>rain is much the worſe; but if ſo the Sun be clouded &amp; the air moiſt, how oft do herbs mould or muſt before they de dried, either being laid too thick for want of room, or at beſt done on a duſty floor, where they lie ſo long untill they be as dry as powder; and yet if cloſe kept will grwo muſty, &amp; be tainted with wormes: therefore many keep their herbs when dryed in an open place, not only to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, but in ſhort time to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of their virtue.</p>
               <p>Yet the Apothecary who buyes them, muſt not ſtraightway reject them, when inſipid, but muſt put them away in the firſt place, keeping thoſe laſt which may be preſerved longeſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore to remedy and prevent many of theſe inconveniencies, the ſtupid Doctor, who will not ſtick to borrow his practick from a Farrier, with this pretence, that it muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed according to his method, learns

               <p>BUt to return to our matter whence we digreſſed, namely to compare a true Chymiſt with our modern Gooſquil Doctors, to ſee to which the Mountebank is neareſt of kin.</p>
               <p>Firſt it muſt be granted that the whole of a real or pretended Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, may be referred to theſe two heads, namely, the knowing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and finding out the Remedy: the latter of which is either theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111543:66"/>to know the medicine or, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically to provide and apply the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for the Mountebanks Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, it is uſually the ſame with the old Wives, or Quacks; but if it any whitexcell, it is gotten out of <hi>Galenical</hi> Authors, which are to be had in almoſt any language.</p>
               <p>But let their method ſpeak their original; is not their intent one, and their progreſs one, (only differ in the means) with the <hi>Galenical</hi> Tribe?</p>
               <p>They want the diſtinguiſhing marks of a true Phyſician, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they tread the ſame ſteps, though with a more rude and reſolute pace.</p>
               <p>In bloud-letting, purging, vomiting, cauterizing, veſicating, making carminatives, giving clyſters, ſcarify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cordials they allagree, only differ in the purges, vomits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And many of them uſe the very ſame things with the other Doctors, only differ in the Doſe, the one ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:111543:66"/>the harm in hope to do good, the other for credit ſake reſolving if he do no good, yet to do no hurt, which he doth notwithſtanding, only he that doth leaſt hurt is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende. What if ſome of the ſame Tribe, finding the inſufficiency of Vegetables, flie unto Minerals, as <hi>Saul</hi> to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> doth this ſtraight make them Chymiſts? Juſt as if a ruſtick weary of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhould reſolve to turn a Joyner, and endevour to plain his boards with a howe, his intention will not make him a Joyner.</p>
               <p>Tell not of Empericks, that is ſuch who prepare by the fire, for what is theordinary preparatiosn made with but by the fire: do not the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries decoct, extract, make Syrups, Conſerves, Lozenges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the fire? Or if you reſpect Diſtillation, are not waters of all ſorts diſtilled in the common way: Or is an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick he: Who deals in Minerals and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:111543:67"/>Metals, and calcined bodies? what are then your Steel Powder, Gold in Alchermes, Vitriol in Vomits, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony in Crocus, burnt Ivory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to make up a total reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt <hi>Empericks</hi> and <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> are not now all vulgar preparations of Minerals, proſtituted in every Apothecaries ſhop; and yet the Art of Medicine among our reverent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors reputed the ſame as of old? What then: O their method! their method! this is the hidden ſtone, and ſecret mark, which diſtinguiſheth them; where then the ſame method is uſed, there is the ſame way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed: but Mountebaks, Quacks, Old Wives, and all that rabble, uſe the ſame method in curing. If it be objected, that they have not skill to diſcern when this, when that remedy is to be applyed, this accuſes their ſufficiency, not their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>It is not then the materials uſed, but the preparation of the materials,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:111543:67"/>ſo as to be able to effect what the Phyſician promiſeth, and the Patient expects, ſurely, ſafely, and ſpeedily, that diſtinguiſheth a true Son of Art from pretending bunglers; of which ſome are more crafty and cautious, others more ignorant and raſhly venturous, yet both more diſtinct from true Artiſts, then from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If Nature had made true Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ready prepared to hand for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſeaſe, that it were no more then to pluck them as an Apple from the tree, then indeed a diſtinction might be made of profeſſors of the Art of Medicine, according to the materials wrought upon. But contrariwiſe it is ſadly evident, that very few Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are endowed with a medicinal virtue without virulency, and thoſe alſo have their excellency obſtructed with the groſs feculency, which growes together with the ſpiritual tincture, and as a ſhell doth hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:111543:68"/>contain the ſame, ſo that without ſome previous preparations few things are worthy the name of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.</p>
               <p>Now that preparation is uſual for vegetal Simples? only decoction, or infuſion, or conſerving with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or Honey whereby the good is not ſo ſeparated from the bad, but that ſeveral crudities remain: but of this <hi>Helmont</hi> hath at large treated, I ſhall not repeat.</p>
               <p>It would be a tedious Wild-gooſe chaſe to trace their medicines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, for that will be but to <hi>(agere actum)</hi> and I intend here an Apology, not a charge; a defenſive, not an offenſive conflict: I ſhall come therefore to ſtate our Caſe, for till that be done in is a vain thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in words.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all we differ from the Gooſquil Tribe in the Theoretical diſcovery of Diſeaſes, and ſecondly in our Practical cure of them.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:111543:68"/>
               <p>Now as to the Theory of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and the Philoſophical contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Simples, it is not eſſential to a Phyſician; for a man may know the remedies with which to cure all diſeaſes, and yet erre very much in the diſcovery of Cauſes; for the remedy being to the diſeaſe as water to fire, which will undoubtedly quench it, as a man may know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by water to quench fire, and yet erre in the Philoſophical appre-prehenſion of the ſame; ſo may a man by a proper remedy, rightly, and in due proportion applyed, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cure the diſeaſe, and be able to diſtinguiſh the ſame generally, though he be not able to finde our and apprehend the manner of its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, with its occaſional cauſes, progreſs and variations.</p>
               <p>Nor let this ſeem a Paradox, for it may eaſily be evinced againſt the moſt ſnarling gainſayer: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the forementioned example
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111543:69"/>of quenching fire by water, and it may be made unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p>What ruſtick that doth not know that water is for the quenching of fire, and will give a very near gueſs how much water will quench ſo much fire, and yet how many of owr School Philoſophers can aſſign the true cauſe of that effect? it is now water as water, for milk, whey, wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinegar, &amp;c. will do the ſame; nor yet as cold, for hot water, and other hot liquors will perform it as well as cold; nor yet as moiſt, for oyl and oleaginous moiſtures, being thrown on fire in one meaſure encreaſeth it, and in another meaſure will quench it; as a week of a candle or lamp may be drowned with too much tallow or oyle. So that in very deed the Philoſophical ſpeculation doth follow practical knowledge, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience denominates that ſcience, which elſe would be but bare opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But of this I ſpeak ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:111543:69"/>in my large Treatiſe called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganu Philoſophiae novum,</hi> and ſhall not in this place repeat, what there is ſufficiently proved and confirmed.</p>
               <p>Therefore the effects of diſeaſes ſo far as they are obvious to every obſerver, can inſtruct any who make it their work to be converſant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that are of capacity, ſo as to be able to judge and diſtinguiſh one diſeaſe from another, and by the Symptomes to diſcover if or no it do proceed in the ordinary courſe of the ſame malady, or if by complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it doth alter, and how this is as much as is abſolutely requiſite for a Phyſician in the knowledge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, for this knowledge doth eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conduce to the cure, but to be able to unfold the quiddity of it, its efficient and continent cauſes, the material and occaſionate, with other curioſities which a Philoſopher doth contemplate upon, and in which the intellect is occupied, this adornes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111543:70"/>but doth not conſtitute a Phyſician.</p>
               <p>So then the abſolute things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in one who would conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly undertake the lives of the ſick, are firſt to know how to unlock thoſe medicines which the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath created, and to prepare them, and after how, and when, and to whom to apply them, and how to order and diſpoſe the Patient ſo, as them which by careful adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them is expected.</p>
               <p>Miſtake me not, I do not deny, nay I confidently affirm, that he who is endowed with wiſdom from above, to be ſo curious and ſo diligent in his ſearch, as to attain the noble me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which the Lord hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for mans relief, and unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort, he, if he prove but ſo obſervant in the adminiſtration as he was acute in the preparation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſo far be mightned from Natures light in theſe obſervations, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:111543:70"/>to apprehend the cauſes of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and their whole quiddity or being, which may by arguments <hi>(à poſteriori)</hi> be collected from their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as likewiſe he may be able to demonſtrate <hi>(à poſteriori)</hi> the cauſe and manner of cures wrought by medicines (a work moſt worthily performed by noble <hi>Helmont</hi>) which contemplation will wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light a true Son of this Art; but yet as I ſaid before, this doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and adorn, not precede and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Phyſician.</p>
               <p>And this I ſhall adde, that the ſoul, which is a I may ſay <hi>ipſe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine homo,</hi> when once an effect is apparent, and ſo known, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mechaniſm, doth no farther any more reap content from it, unleſs it be in reference to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction it gathers from it, to the finding out of ſome new hidden truth; nor doth the ſoul ever feed on it more as upon its object, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:111543:71"/>directly, and in an abſolute conſideration, no more then in the knowing how to make a fire, or that the fire will burn, boyl, dry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, juſtly ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>that in much knowledge is much vanity and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> but this only as a digreſſion.</p>
               <p>To return therefore, we conclude that to a true Phyſician is required to know if a diſeaſe be probably curable, and if ſo, then how: as for inſtance, the plague-tokens appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are rightly judged mortal, and ſo may any ſuch ſtate be reputed in which nature will admit of no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor death accept of any truce.</p>
               <p>The careful obſerver of theſe things will by experience learn to diſtinguiſh between dangerous and deſperate caſes, and ſo may order himſelf accordingly, but in impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſes he ſhall not meddle.</p>

               <p>ANd here me thinks I ſee a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſt</hi> beginning to frame a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, who after a few courſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, doth thus out of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gravity, ſeek to defend his own faction. Do not we (quoth he) the like in effect? for we by our Art di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between eaſie, dangerous, and deſperate diſeaſes, which we therefore undertake or leave accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. For if there be only a light diſtemper, as foulneſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or bad humours clogging or obſtructing the liver, or the like; we then by an uſual purge, or vomit, and by bloudletting, and glyſters remove the ſame; but if the diſtemper be more violent, then by our Method we help that, for that is our myſtery, which the prating Chymiſts not knowing, cannot therefore do that by their medicines, which we can
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:111543:72"/>by our method, which is the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of our Art; for we are like to skilful workmen amid a number of tools, we know our work, and ſo can, as cauſe preſents, and as Symptomes do move, call in for this or that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and as occaſion requires we can uſe external artificial helps, when Nature is not in fit caſe to be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by a violent proceſs. This is the good old way, and it is the ſafe way. But theſe furnace-mongers would perſwade the world, that by medicines prepared by their Art, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes may be cut down as it were with a ſithe, which for all their boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting will not be. Theſe with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other things are pretended by them to conceal their ignorance in ſo blinde progreſſes. But as it is an eaſie thing to lie hid in the dark, the mantle of the night hiding that which the Sun diſcovers, it will not be amiſs to proceed to the true courſe of curing diſeaſes, and by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111543:72"/>it our adverſaries will be eaſily quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Beſilius</hi> and <hi>Suchten,</hi> both no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy Artiſts, adviſe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as have given their name to Art, to be doing, and not to contend in bare words, for it is as impoſſible to convince the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> with words without works, as it was for Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles to have convinced the <hi>Jewes</hi> by preaching without mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; therefore I ſhall firſt give you the Character of a true Phyſician: and ſecondly, ſhew you what his work is.</p>
               <p>A true Phyſician is he whom God hath qualified with a longing deſire to know nature in her operations, her integrity and defects, and how they may be amended. For the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of which he doth ask, ſeek and knock with diligence, patience, and conſtancy, till it be given and opened unto him, his heart is not ſet upon gain, but out of charity to the diſtreſſed he doth perſiſt in this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:111543:73"/>of knowledge, and the merciful God hears him, and gives him what he ſeeks for: then having received his talent he doth not bury it in a napkin, but doth improve it, untill with it he gain two, and with them five, and with them ten talents. He knowes that diſeaſes are all in their kinde curable without exception, death only being out of the power of any man or means, the definitive ſentence being paſt irrevocable.</p>
               <p>He laments the ſad Catalogues of poor mortals (the diſtreſſe members of Chriſt Jeſus) who flying from the Lion of ſickneſs, meet with a Bear in ſtead of a true Phyſician, who in ſtead of bread gives them a ſtone, and in ſtead of fiſh a ſerpent, and yet theſe are the fathers of the ſick, ſo pretended to be, but like old Saturn they devour and make a prey of their children.</p>
               <p>He alſo that is a true Phyſician doth not ſeek fame and honour ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111543:73"/>much as the good of thoſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, nor doth he ſtartle at the ſad catalogue of incurable diſeaſes which the School Doctors have moſt ſhamefully compiled, which he by his Medieines is able to overcome as the vlaiant champion is reported to have conquered the dovouring Monſter.</p>
               <p>His work is not to ſpend his time in turning over of leaves; but he makes uſe of Authors ſo as not to conclude any thing upon bare reading with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trial. In a word, he ſo behaves himſelf as if his great conteſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed were, whether to be more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous in diſcovering nature, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in conquering diſeaſes: of which the latter is the main end he aims at in the former.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall briefly diſcover the objections, made by <hi>Galeniſts</hi> againſt this way of medicine, and ſhall ſo fully anſwer them that there ſhall be no ſcruple left.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:111543:74"/>
               <p>Firſt of all they accuſe Chymical Medicines as virulent, too hot, and therefore unſit to be given, as oft in ftead of curing encreaſing the diſeaſe; they are (ſay they) a little too ſtrong for our conſtirution, being for the moſt part mineral and metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, or eleſe they are faline, which are very ſharp and corroſive, or of a fiery ſulphurous nature, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſtead of cooling and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do inflame the body inwardly: therefore ſay the ſuch medicines are dangerous and deſperate, which if they were not, they would (as they make their patients believe) uſe them themſelves. In ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes you ſhall have them run at random, and their aim in all is to make the ſick believe, that their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicameable to nature, the other forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble violent, and deſperate, which no man but a mad man would take.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:111543:74"/>
               <p>This is, to ſpeak the truth, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly main objection which <hi>Galeniſts</hi> uſually produce againſt Chymical medicines; and this they varniſh over with many ſpecious colours to make the patient believe, that to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with a Chymical medicament, is no other then to caſt out the Devil by Delzebub, or according to the old proveth, to cure a deſperate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe by a deſperate medicine.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall briefly, yet fully anſwer this cavil, and ſo anſwer it, that it may appear to the eye of any judicious man to be but a meer Morino which the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to ſcare the rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with, as nurſes uſe to affright children with tales of Robin Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, Raw head and bloudy bones, and the like.</p>
               <p>And firſt as to the point of iru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, which is a very great Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and enough to deterthe moſt confident Patient, if once you can
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:111543:75"/>perſwade him the remedies he is to take to be of an exquiſite virulency, for ſo a very ſmal error in the doſe, will hazard the life in ſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the diſtemper: Poyſon I grant is a dangerous, nay a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thing to deal with, nor is it good to admit of it into the body upon any pretence, but that Chymical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are ſuch, that is the point in controverſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Preface to the King of <hi>France,</hi> in which he defends his Religion from the foul aſperſions laid on it by Papiſts, hath this moſt juſt plea, namely to call for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varsaries Reaſons, before he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by their Criminations; for if it be enough to accuſe, who may or can expect to be found inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent?</p>
               <p>So ſay I, our Antagoniſts raiſe a great duſt concerning poyſon, vuru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leycy and malignity, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is Chymical Medicaments,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111543:75"/>and with this calmour they have filled the world, and buzzed it into the ears adn hearts of as many as by their impudent confident railing they could incline to embrace this opinion, whoſe aſperſions now I ſhall endevour to wipe off.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall entreat the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders candor in pondering the weight of Arguments on both ſides, before he proceed to cenſure: for which end I ſhall minde thee of one general rule which is in the urging of all Controverſies, to obſerve the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of each party, and then you will confeſs, that what ever is ſaid on either ſide and not proved, ſavours of paſſion, not Of Reaſon,</p>
               <p>Conſider that the <hi>Galenical</hi> Tribes credit, honour, reputation, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do all depend on impugning this way of Chymical preparations: no marvel then if you hear from them <hi>Demetrius</hi> his ourcry, Great is the <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:111543:76"/>ſince the moving cauſe is the ſame, namely, Sirs you know that by this Art we get our wealth, our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and all, and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves to oppoſe that upſtart Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which will (if it once be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted into the world) make us to be as contemptible as common Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae.</hi> Hence it is that you hear ſuch terrible newes concerning this Art of Pyrotechny; for this Art requireth (in a ſenſe) a new birth or regeneration: as then it was an irreſoluble riddle to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> that a man when he was old ſhould enter into his mothers womb, and again be born, ſo is it an inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable task for an old Putationer, who hath by preſcription attained the repuration of all this his imaginary skill, and to employ his time, pains, ſtudy, and moneys, in the attaining of that which he either neglecting or ſlighting in his youth, is in his age
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:111543:76"/>as capable of as an Aſſe is to play on the Harp; thereis therefore no way left for him to uphold his own reputation, then by caſting durt on that Art which is ſo diametrically oppoſite to his former way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any thing of weight that he urgeth his as the old way, and condemns the other as new; for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror wants but a few hours of the Age of truth, nor was this old way elder then error, and therefore to pead its antiquity is a fallacious argument of its authority and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Yet could I (if it made to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe) trace this noble Art of true Chymical Philoſophy to a far more ancient pedigree then <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates</hi> either, although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was as incomparable different from the other, as truth is from error.</p>
               <p>But as I ſaid before, here lies the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:111543:77"/>very knot of all, the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have a Trade which is ſupported by Garru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligy, performed with eaſe and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and accompanied with riches, credit, eſteem and honour, their work is not attended with any pains, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they come to practiſe, and then that only conſiſts in viſits, which pains is the key of their wealth.</p>
               <p>As for the preparation of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Doctor little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints himſelf with it, his Theory conſiſting only in turning over of leaves, and his Practiſe in toſſing of Piſſe-pots and writing of Bils: this, O! this is their <hi>Diana</hi> they ſo much admire, and propound to the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous world to be adored.</p>
               <p>But now a true ſon of Art he is not ſo binſſed, for his intereſt doth not hang on ſuch a hinge, but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the workman to be judged by his work, nor can there be too many endowed with this true skil, for in the ſearch of nature there are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:111543:77"/>infinite ſecrets, and thoſe lucriferous to the Artiſt, ſo that he need not gape after the practiſe of medicine for gain, God in mercy diſpenſing his gifts for the uſe of mankinde, gives ſuch to whom he imparts this skil, an heart to improve it, without the ſordid by-ends of again and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>But admit that every <hi>Galeniſt</hi> were indeed a true Chymiſt, what diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage could accrew thereby to any true Artiſt? for every one would have ſufficient imployment, ſo many are the ſad diſeaſes to which mortal man is ſubject.</p>
               <p>Experience ſheweth that the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> envie not Chymiſts as Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, but as Chymiſts; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they can with patience bear the daily ſwarming of their own Tribe, ſo fruitful is that profeſſion of its Clients, that it is incredible what a number there is of them in and about <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:111543:78"/>
               <p>Now is is not to be doubted, but all or moſt of them get a living by their Art, beſides old Wives, Quacks, Mountebanks, Barber ſurgeons and their men, Apothecaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who all as confidently pretend to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony in the Art of medicine, as if they were the natural ſons of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Yet ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth teach, that for all this rabble of Phyſicians, there is not a third part of diſeaſes cured, nor a tenth part by the skill of the Doctor.</p>
               <p>If then ſo many get a living by pretending to that they know not, and undertaking what they cannot performe, this livelihood would not be diminiſhed, but rather encreaſed if all were holpen that are underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and thoſe moreover who in numberleſs ſwarmes lie up and down in Hoſpitals and Spitles, and many who languiſh at home in private both hopeleſs and helpleſs.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:111543:78"/>
               <p>But if once true Artiſts were countenanced and embraced, ſcarce the tenth pretender but would be thrown under the board: for true medicine is not proſtituted in formal receipts, to be prepared by the hand of any blundering Apothecary, but it is one of the choide ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſhe hath with great care locked up, nor will ſhe open them to any who have not the true keyes.</p>
               <p>It is not an overly reading of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, Avicen, Galen,</hi> that can enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a man a Son of this Art, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a mental man, patient, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and one who is not niggardly in expences, ſuch a man muſt toyl with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weariſomneſs, and although af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral years ſearching, with the expence of many pounds, he hit not what ho aims at, yet muſt he ſtill partiently proceed, which task is more than <hi>Herculean</hi> for a lazy Piſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophet.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>BUt to come to the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, namely concerning poyſons: of which aſperſion I ſhall acquit the right Chymicall Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
               <p>Poyſon properly is that which by an over powering activity in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, doth deſtroy the vitals, and is of divers ſorts; ſome are putrifactive poyſons, others corroſive, others nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This in general concerning their Nature, but in particular they are all found either in the Animal, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, or Mineral Kingdome. Not to ſpeak of thoſe endemical malignant vapours, which infect the air oft-times; nor of the virulency of the Peſtilence, Leproſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which oft doth ſeat it ſelf in the very wals of houſes, cloth, paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:111543:79"/>
               <p>But although there are ſeveral ſorts of malignities, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called poyſons, yet in the common acceptation of the word, it denotes ſuch a thing by which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or beaſt is deſtroyed, and that either by the eating of it, or by its odour or touch, not to mention that poyſon of the Baſilisk which ſome authors affirm to kill with the ſight. So that though a man die of the Peſtilence, or of the Leproſie, Pox or the like, which all have their ſpecificated poyſons, yet do we not uſe to ſay that ſuch died of poyſon, the ſpecificateneſs of the name of the diſeaſe ſwallowing up the generality of the denomination of poyſon in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch things which are reputed poyſons, ſome as the biting of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, the biting of mad dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are remote from this our purpoſe, ſuch poyſons being only in the power of that angry beaſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:111543:80"/>it, and ſuch venomes uſually die with the creature, according to the Adagy,
<q>Mortuâ, moritur venonum.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that in vain ſhould we get the teeth of dead Serpents, or the ſting of dead Bees or Hornets, all their virulency being then extinct.</p>
               <p>Other poyſons are which infect man and not beaſt, others both man and beaſt.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort are Spiders and Toads, which Apes, Hens and Ducks will eat familiarly, yet without any effect of poyſon: other poyſons there are which will not kill Dogs, Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet will kill men, not becauſe they are not alſo, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to beaſts, but the Dog or Cat finding the operation, being able to vomit at pleaſure, eſcape the danger; W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> man wanting that faculty, fals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Hereto agrees that by Sallet oyl
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:111543:80"/>given copiouſly in time, and vomit by it provoked, many poyſons are happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped, which otherwiſe would be lethal.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which are mortal poyſons in their proper nature, do not ceaſe to be mortall, becauſe they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, accidentally eſcaped, but are ſo to be reputed notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed any farther into this diſcovery, I ſhall lay down a few certain and infallible Rules, which may make very much to the informing of the candid Reader, of the Truth in this controverſie.</p>
               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">Rule <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> That nothing which is not of its own nature poyſonous, can by any true Chymical operation be made a poyſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> Nothing which is of its own nature poyſonous and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, can by any true Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration have its virulency advanced, but rather diminiſhed.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:111543:81"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Nothing is ſo poyſonous, but by its true Chymical preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth wholly loſe its virulent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without the leaſt footſteps of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe three Rules, though at firſt they to many may |appear paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, yet I ſhall ſo explain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them, as that they may evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear true.</p>
               <p>The firſt Rule at firſt ſight may appear untrue, land may by our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern putationers (who think they have ſufficient inſight even in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical ſecrets to ſerve their turn, and to denominate them Artiſts) be thus impugned, Do not, ſay they, your beſt Authors in the Science of Chymiſtry, <hi>Baſilius, Valentinus, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus, Quercetanus,</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> all confeſs that by the Art of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry many things in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not virulent, are exalted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dangerous poyſons: inſtance in Aqua fortis, Aqua regis, Mercury
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:111543:81"/>ſublimate, oyl of Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which of things at leaſt not poyſonous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt dangerous, and lethal.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer two wales, firſt of all, that it is a miſconceit that the forementioned things are become poyſons by ſuch a preparation: for as for Aqua fortis, Aqua regis, Oyl of Vitriol, and Spirit of Salt-peter, or of common Salt, they are not poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but Spirits eminent in activity, on which (being diſtilled with the extream fire of Reverberation) the fire hath inſtamped a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fiery quality, which therefore if given alone, burn and mortifie where ever they touch any thing that is vital, (ſo far as their activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reacheth) yet mingled with wine, beer, or water, may be taken in the ſame, nay a greater quantity (then alone would be mortal) without the leaſt effect of danger, nay rather they become wholſom and medicinal, as namely Oyl of Vitriol and Sulphur
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:111543:82"/>for the extinguiſhing the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural heat and drouth in Feavers, the Spirit of Salt for the ardors of the urine is an incomparable remedy: ſo Aqua fortis is not venomous but diaphoretick, if given in wine ſo min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled that it may only be made acide by it: Spirit of Salt-peter is much of the ſame virtue with Spirit of Vitriol, yea and Vinegar it ſelf, may be ſo rectified from <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> feces, as in a ſmall doſe given alone to become morval; ſo Hony, Sugar, and almoſt what not? But if they were really and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſmuted into poyſons, they could not be ſo diffuſed, but though without any taſte or perceptible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they would certainly be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. It appears then that many diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Spirits made by a ſtrong fire, as alſo many fixed Salts, <hi>viz.</hi> Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being ſtrongly calcined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come really deadly, that is, by being made corroſive, but not venomous, which therefore diffuſed in ſufficient
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:111543:82"/>liquor may without prejudice, or rather with much profit be taken, which elſe would be hurtful, yea and if their activity be by any object on which they will work ſatiated, they may then be taken alone, as Oyl of Vitriol mixed with a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of Salt of Tartar or any other Salt becomes almoſt inſipid, and may be taken in ten times the doſe, which would be mortal in their ſimplicity. So Aqua fortis if it be poured on Silver or Iron, and boyled with it ſo long as its diſſolving vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue laſts; then the metal preciptated, and the liquor boyled up till the Salt be dry, it becomes a medicine, though not comparable to many Chymical preparations, yet not ſo contemptible as the <hi>Galenical</hi> drugs.</p>
               <p>As for Mercury ſublimate, which may be thought to bear the greateſt ſhew of Reaſon to the contrary of this Rule, foraſmuch as a whole
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:111543:83"/>pound of Argent vive crude may ſafely be taken when as 3 or 4 grains of it ſublimed is immediately mortal.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, that there is a great error in the experiment, which well conſidered, will carry a clean di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct face from what it at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears withall.</p>
               <p>For we know the nature of Argent vive to be ſalivative, and of a ſtrangling quality, affecting eſpecially the throar, jawes and head of him that takes it, yea though ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by doſe, or by fume, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unction, yet it ſtill betraies it ſelf by that infamous operation, taking its recorſe to thoſe parts forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea though it be precipitated, or dulcified vulgarly, or diſtilled into a Spirit or Oyl according the Art of common Chymiſts, by which it hath ſome other operation, as vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, purgative, or ſudorifick, yet as, the Devil is fabled not able to hide his cloven foot, ſo Mercury will
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:111543:83"/>ſtill be betraying its ſalivating qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>As for the corroſiveneſs of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that is to be attributed to the Saline Spirits, which ſublime up with the Mercury, by which it is not at all intrinſecally altered, and if it have any quality of operation more then its own, that is to be attributed to the Salts.</p>
               <p>As for the large doſe of Mercury which may be given without any danger, it is to be underſtood that being a very ponderous body, and fluid, if it be given in ſo great a doſe, it ſtraight paſſeth all the bowels, and ſoon voids it ſelf at the ſiege, and is accounted the laſt remedy for the twiſting of the ſmal guts. So that its nature in operation is not to be judged by ſuch a curſory experiment, for otherwiſe if a few grains unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, be mixed up in any pill and given, or a ſmall quantity mixed in an oyle and applyed by inunction,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:111543:84"/>it will ſhew in a ſhort time its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural operation, and the ſame is the operation of Mercury any other waies vulgarly prepared, only the corroſiveneſs of ſome preparations above others are to be attributed to ſome Saline Spirits that are joyned with it, by which the Mercury is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into ſmall atomes, and the true operation of the Mercury is hidden under the operation of the Saline Spirits that do accompany it.</p>
               <p>Nor yet can Mercury by his or any other preparation whatſoever be brought to become a reall poyſon, for Sublimate being diſſolved in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Mercury ſeparated from the Salts with which it was ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by precipitation, or revificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (as any trivial Chymiſt knowes how) the Salt then decocted to the conſiſtence of Oyl of Vitriol or dry if you pleaſe, is ſo far from poyſon, that it excels the beſt Medicaments the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have, as I ſhall declare in its due place.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:111543:84"/>
               <p>Hereto agrees, that the moſt corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſublimate, being reſublimed with other crude Mercury, loſeth its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive quality, and becomes <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius dulcis,</hi> commonly given to the quantity of two ſcruples, the eighth part of which before dulcification were ſuddenly mortal.</p>
               <p>This is my firſt anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection made againſt the firſt rule before laid down. <hi>viz.</hi> that by no Chymical preparation that which in it ſelf is not poyſon, will become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous: which I ſhall briefly ſum up, and ſo paſs to my ſecond and more ſatisfactory anſwer. I yeeld that by ſome preparations many things become corroſive, but not venomous, the one by dilating in any liquor being extinguiſhed being no way dangerous; the other although infuſed with never ſo much liquor, yet ſtill is mortal notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, ſuch operations fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are not properly Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:111543:85"/>preparations, nor the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing badges of the Son of Art; for the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have raviſhed them into their ſhops, and uſe them as commonly as any, nay moſt of all, for a true Chymiſt very ſeldom uſeth any of them, ſome of them never, the Spirits of Salts he uſeth as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offers, as alſo of Sulphur, but for any of the vulgar preparations of Mercury he abhors them. We deny not but the Spirit of Vitriol is a noble Medicine, but not that which is ſold commonly, which is totally adulterated, which a very eaſie trial will diſcover: for example, take of it about an ounce, leſs or more, and rectific it in a glaſs, you ſhall ſee how much is mixed of flegm, and that the tincture of wholly ſophiſticate, which will therefore remain in the bottom of the glaſs &amp; diſcolour it of a black colour, but all that diſtils over will be clear and white like fountain water. The occaſion of which adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:111543:85"/>is becauſe ſome true ſons of Art have uſed a Spirit of Vitriol which is made by cohobation, (a work too laborious for a Renegado Chymiſt) which is of a pure golden tincture, and fragrant, which being a noble Medicine, and having by proof been found more effectual then <hi>Galenical</hi> ſlops, the Doctors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willing to get that Spirit, have employed Mercenary Chymiſts, ſo ſtiled, to draw both that and ſuch other Medicaments, fooliſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that every one that was a furnace-monger was ſtraight a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Apoſtates I ſay are no more to be accounted what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, then the Doctors themſelves, becauſe they have been dub'd in the University, are to be accounted Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me not be miſtaken, to be thought to plead for ſuch vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar preparations of Chymical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:111543:86"/>for they are no more Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical then any other Decoctions, Syrups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>Galenical</hi> Cooks prepare.</p>
               <p>For as I ſaid before, it is not the ſubjects wrought upon, that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh true Chymiſts from the Gooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quill tribe, for they uſe Minerals and Metals as confidently as any, and I doubt not but they would ſcorn that any Simple, either Animal, Vegetal, or Mineral, ſhould be accounted alien from their Art.</p>
            </div>

               <p>COnſider then their method of preparations of Animals and Vegetals, and then ſee if the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar preparation of Minerals hath not the ſame ſtamp.</p>
               <p>Some Vegetables they ſtamp to powder and ſearce, and this they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:111543:86"/>make into ſpecies, as they term them, others they decoct, conſerve, infuſe, candy, or make into Tablets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Animals, as the inward of Hens Gizard, Sheep and Gooſe dung, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum graecum.</hi> Fox Lungs, Canthari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and many Inſects which they uſe as Cochineel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome are powde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſo given, others in Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Loch Sanum,</hi> and boles.</p>
               <p>So Minerals, ſome are uſed in powder, as <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> ſteel powder, Gold in Alchermes, white Vitriol for vomits, Bezoar-ſtone, Iriſh ſlate; others made into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, as Mercury for inunctions, <hi>Ceruſſe, minium, &amp;c.</hi> others beaten up with other ingredients, as Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick in one <hi>Alexipharmacum, &amp;c.</hi> others are calcined barely, as <hi>vitrum Antimonii</hi> without Borax, burnt Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a medium between an Animal and a Mineral: others
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:111543:87"/>are ſublimed barely; as <hi>flores Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Antimonii, &amp;c.</hi> others are diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led barely, as <hi>Spirit.

               <p>And as the <hi>Galenists</hi> may and do uſe Minerals, ſo we do uſe both Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables and Animals, only we differ in our preparations, and in our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in application. But of this in its place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Rule may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted and oppoſed, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the flowers and vitrum of Antimony, the ſublimate of Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:111543:87"/>are no more to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted truly Chymicall, then the actions of an Ape are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted acounted humane; for it is not every operation indifferently made that is to be accounted Chymicall: What hath the ſublimation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Arſenick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in it more then vulgar? the Arſenick is the ſame it was; beſides in the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Arſenick, though it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more corroſive, yet is it not more venomous, but indeed leſſe; for though it kill with a leſſe doſe, yet not with that drought and ſwelling as it doth crude; which frequent ſublimation will make more evident. But as I ſaid, ſuch operations are empirical, but not truly Chymical; which I ſhal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to avoid all miſunderſtanding, define.</p>
               <p>Chymiſtry is the Art of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Simples, Animal, Vegetal, and Mineral, ſo as their craſis or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> That all Diſeaſes are in their kinde curable.</head>
               <p>WEE have in our Preface touched in general the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a true Son of Art, and a School Doctor, which ſo long as we infinited in generals, could not ſo well be pondered, nor the difference weighed, for <hi>(In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularibus
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:111543:90"/>demonſtratur generalis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiati veritas).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to the thing in particular, and by it let the cauſe be judge, as by the other it was ſtated.</p>
               <p>Our work at preſent is to explain Nature, by which we ſhall eaſily diſcover which are the true witneſſes of Nature, and which falſe, the one is a true Artiſt, the other a Putati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner.</p>
               <p>For every Artiſt is to be judged by his work, which the way of judging all profeſſion; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is meerly notional, I account but a vain Chymera, unworthy for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man to buſie his time in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leſt he embrace a cloud in ſtead of <hi>Juno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the miſery of our School and Academies, that the one teach barely words, the other bare notions, which indeed are nothing, and in application prove but empty ſhadowes; for he that ſeeks to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:111543:90"/>them to practiſe, beyond vain diſputations can proceed no farther. But of this in my <hi>[Organum Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiae]</hi> I have largely ventilated, to which I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>It is a noble ſaying of <hi>Cicero, Virtutis omnis laus in actione conſiſtit,</hi> Away with all thoſe fooliſh (though ſpecious) curioſities, by which a man is never the nearer any uſeful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal verity.</p>
               <p>The pratical end of Theoſophy is living to God, of Geometry, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirecture, Gunnery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, ſumming up of ſums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Philoſophy, Agriculture and all Mechanicks, for the uſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde as to the conveniency of life; and Medicine, which is the laſt and nobleſt of all earthly Arts, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian being, as I may ſay, a ſecond parent to a ſick man, giving him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God his life ſometimes, and ſometimes eaſing him of ſuch griefs, which though not mortal, or not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:111543:91"/>ſpeedily, yet make the life uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
               <p>The nobleneſs of this Art may hene appear, for that all other things inaſmuch as they only ſerve conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, yet this Art is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>Though Agriculture be a noble Art, ſo priezed by the Ancients, that the inventors of each part of it were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with divine honors, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Agriculture, the <hi>Indians</hi> live as long, as contented, and as healthy as any that abound with the variety of thoſe rarities which that Art produceth and multiplieth. So Policy, Grammar, Rhetorick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do adorn, not conſtiture man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, they keep them in a civil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum, but not in their being; for where this is wanting they live, and take a great deal of pleaſure from what nature without Art affords, not grieved for the want of what they know not.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:111543:91"/>
               <p>Nay rather they delight in their Barbarouſneſs, and prefer it to the affluence of all things, and order which civilized people enjoy.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to inſiſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all kinds of Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with this of Medicine, which any man may do at his leiſure, ſince it is plain, that skin for skin oft times a man will give for his life.</p>
               <p>No Nation, no People, no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey without diſeaſes and caſualties, this being part of the curſe; and as man at laſt is to return to earth whence he was taken, ſo he never wants the Harbingers of death, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time one, ſometimes another ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or caſualty warning him of his mortality.</p>
               <p>So that the moſt ſavage nations are enforced to uſe this Art, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is more lamely taught and learned, the more is their misfortune; for no nation or people in which many do not often want the moſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:111543:92"/>abſolute helps of Nature, for want of which they oft have recourſe to the Devil, to heal them of more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult diſeaſes, which makes Wizards and Sorcerers in great price among the barbarous people, and ſo much the more by how much the Art of Medicine is leſs known.</p>
               <p>How great honour did the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> to <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> and his ſons, ſo that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did account them as gods, and all on the account of their dexterous ſcience and skill in this Art.</p>
               <p>But leſt I ſhould ſeem to inſiſt too long on things not to the purpoſe, I ſhall come to the matter: And firſt to ſpeak of Medicine, what it is in general, and then to deſcend a little more particularly into the enquiry of it.</p>
               <p>Medicine is an Art by which all the defects and diſeaſes to which mans nature is ſubject, are ſo known as to be cured and reſtored.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:111543:92"/>
               <p>It is I ſay an Art of knowing, curing, and reſtoring all thoſe defects which are accidental to man. Not that I do exclude other Animals, but becauſe man is the proper ſubject of this Art, I do name him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or for dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſake.</p>
               <p>It includes a branch of the Art of Chymiſtry, which being of a larger extent, I do not yet define it by it as its genus, becauſe that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is alſo employed about Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, many of which are uſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preparation, and many are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with preparations not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chymical, yet the nobleſt of all Medicines flow from this fountain; I therefore define it by the genus of Art, and that properly, for Art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both Theory and Practick, and the knowledge of diſeaſes is required to their cure, as well as the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicines, which knowledge doth help an Artiſt, firſt in choice of Medicines, and ſecondly in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:111543:93"/>of the ſame, which is more then the word Chy miſtry doth include.</p>
               <p>Yea whatever it is that makes to the Art of healing diſeaſes is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Medicinal, yea though it be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, yet it is the giſt of healing, or medicine, or infernal and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, it is a Satanical impoſture in medicine; both which I exclude from the Art of Medicine; the one as being above Art, the other as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Art.</p>
               <p>But that I refer to this Art, which by a natural couſe doth perform cures, whether by <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> or by Sympathetical remedies, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicaments, either ſpecifical or univerſal, whether ſimply uſed as Nature by the Art of the Phyſician, and that either Chymiſtry doth alſo comprehend the moſt abſolute and perfect Medicaments, beſides
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:111543:93"/>which nothing can be defired for any diſeaſe or defect, either inward or outward, except thoſe accidents which neceſſarily require the work of the hand, as Fractures, and Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and pulling out of any thing violently thruſt into the body, of what kinde ſoever it be.</p>
               <p>So then we need not any Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Chymiſtry doth not ſupply, yet the Art requiring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration as well as the prepare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nobleſt Medicaments; it followes that Chymiſtry is too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Genus to comprehend the whole of Medicine; which Art doth, being equally referred to theory and Practick.</p>
               <p>And yet Chymiſtry is larger then to betotaliy comprehended by the Art of Medicine, for by it are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Diapaſmes, (which are in a ſort medicinal) and ſundry curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſome not at all referring to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as the making of Jemmes,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:111543:94"/>malleable glaſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Medicine, and alſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend it, as the Elixir of the wiſe, the white reſpecting only riches, the red both riches and health.</p>
               <p>Yea and this ſupreme Medicine Both tranſcend the bare Art of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftoring defects of nature; in as much as it doth lengthen life won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, although I know few do believe it.</p>
               <p>So then the Art of Medicine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains theſe branches, firſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of diſenſes, and ſecondly, the way of their cure. And this alſo contains two parts: firſt the choice and preparation of Mediqines: and ſecondly, their adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>their adminiſtration includes a true knowledge of their virtue, and ſo a proporitionable and convenient application of them in reference to the cauſe of the diſeaſe and the ſtate of the Patient.</p>
               <p>And this is univerſally to be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:111543:94"/>noted, that the more languid the medicines themſelves are, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſagacity is required in the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part, and care joyned with dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in the practick. I know that according to the received Doctrine of the Schools, I ſholuld now unfold many very unproſitable queſtions, but intending the reality of things, and not reſpecting the empty bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Aerical notions, I ſhall not meddle with them, I mean queſtions in reference to the deſinition, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and ſubdiviſion of this Art.</p>
               <p>To proceed then to what I intend, I ſaid that Medicine is the Art of knowing, curing and reſtoring all diſeaſes and defects to which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde is ſubject to in reference to the body, as Theoſophy doth the ſame in reference to the ſoul, ſo that next to it, this Art hath the firſt place.</p>
               <p>I expreſs knowing, curing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring not without cauſe, as i ſhall by and by explain. Knowing I ſay
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:111543:95"/>becauſe without the knowledge of diſeaſes a man may be a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, but not a Phyſician; which knowledge of diſeaſes is as it were his line and plumment by which he works. By this he judges the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or improbability of the cure, for though no diſeaſe in its kinde, yet many particular diſeaſes are incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as in my Preface I touched and explained, nor ſhall I here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>
               <p>There alſo I did clearly diſcover what knowledge was abſolute, and what accidental to a Phyſician, the one conſtituting, the other adorning him; the one to be required, the other to be deſired in him; I ſhall alſo paſſe that as already ſpoken ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to.</p>
               <p>Curing is as much as to ſay, taking care of, and imploying diligence about them; nor any diligence is not enough or any care promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, for the nurſe and cook, &amp;c.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:111543:95"/>docarefully attend the ſick party; but by cure or care, (which is all one, being but the English of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine word <hi>Cura</hi>) of the Phyſician is that which is intended to the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Patient, and that with as much ſpeed and ſaſety as may be.</p>
               <p>I add reſtorng, as the grand mark of a real and true ſon of Art, it is his diploma by which he appears to be one created of God, and not by the Schools; for their creatures they adorn with titles, God graceth his with real abilities.</p>
               <p>His knowledge is not ſuch as he ſucks from the Schools, but ſuch as is applicable to action, the other being but empty ſhadowes of which in its place.</p>
               <p>His cure and care is not conſiſting only in reiterated Viſits, ſeeling of Pulſes, and toſſing of urines, Stirring of Cloſe-ſtooles, and appointing Purges, Vomits, Bleeding, Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, Bliſters, Scariſications, Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:111543:96"/>and ſuch enſeebling Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, nor preſcribing Syrups, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Waters of green Herbs, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenges, Electuaries, and ſuch foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, and what is more ſordid, he doth not overſee the Kitchin, to make this Gelly, or that Broth, or this Glyſter or the like, but like a valiant <hi>Achilles</hi> or <hi>Hercules,</hi> he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayles the Diſeaſe with powerful and prevailing Medicines, and for the o preciſe, provided alwaies meat be not taken immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately of any ſort, and ſtomack which is of eaſieſt concoction: but of this by the way, we ſhall inſiſt larger on it in its place.</p>
               <p>He doth not cowardly ſum up a Catalogue of incurable diſeaſes, ſo that as the ignorant Academians of old had their <hi>(Gracum eſt, nec poteſt legi)</hi> ſo the School Doctors have a very large roll of maladies over which they only put this inſcription
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:111543:96"/>
                  <hi>(Incurabiliaſunt)</hi> and ſo leave them with a ſad recommendation to God. But as the valiant <hi>Hercules</hi> ſought againſt Giants and Monſters and ovencame them, ſo a true Son of Art makes it appear that all diſeaſes are in their kinde curable.</p>
               <p>And now may Reverend Doctors, who perhaps ſome of you have read <hi>Galen,</hi> at leaſt curforily, and ſome have read <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> but never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him; ſome have turned over <hi>Fernelius, Sennertus, Avicen</hi> and others both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern writers, to you I ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The Art that you think your ſelves maſters of, ſo that you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelves to be the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sons of <hi>Aſculapius,</hi> what is your Art? let us weight it in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, let us conſider it and compare it with this Art which we commend and admire; and I dobut not but as a ſhadow before the Sun, ſo your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Art before true Art will paſs away.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:111543:97"/>
               <p>Can you cure the Gout? ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps haps of you will finde impudence enough to affirm it, to whom I ſhall only object, <hi>Fiat experimentuam.</hi> The people deny it according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagy,
<q>Neſeit nodoſam medicus curare poda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How then? You can cure you will ſay the running Gout, ſpeak ſoſtly I pray, leſt ſome of your patients heart you, and object this: And why then did you not cure me? 'Twill be a ſerious check.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe you much miſtake the name and nature of the running Gout, the Gout properly and truly is an Arthritical pain affecting the joynts immediately, and ſome nerves ſometimes by a Deuteropatheia, a nd according to the ſituation it is called <hi>Podagra, Cheiragra,</hi> and <hi>Iſchiatica;</hi> to theſe I ſhall adde two other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:111543:97"/>to wit <hi>Cephalagia,</hi> and <hi>Odon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talgia,</hi> which are reall branches of the ſame diſeaſe: the Head-ach af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Meninges of the brain, and the Tooth-ach the Roots of the teeth which are in theſe two grieſt equlvalent to joynts.</p>
               <p>The Head-ach if tedious and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is called commonly a Megrim, the Tooth-ach retains alwaies its name.</p>
               <p>Now all thſe kindes of griefs are either habitual or accidental, habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al either hereditary, or gotten by ſome diſorder or other.</p>
               <p>The Accidental ſorts of theſe grieſs are of their own nature tranſtent, as having no fixed root, and are cauſed by unuſual cold, or fals, or ſtrokes, of ſtrains itſ healed, or diſlocations ill ſet and reſtrored, or ſtactures ill conglutinated, or elſe through ſome or other intemperance in meat or drink.</p>
               <p>For the Remedy of the Tooth-ach
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:111543:98"/>if it come to extremity there is one only capital remedy of pulling them out, which oft proves but an inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, alwaies a lame remedy, but our age hath found the way of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the teeth, which makes the loſs appear the leſs. For the Tooth-ach there are a thouſand (not to ſay more) applications and tricks uſed to heart and abate the preſent pain, and thoſe ſometimes effectual, ſometimes, not at all, for they are only topical, and therefore at the beſt do but eaſe for the time; others uſe Spels, Charmes and Magical enchantmens for this end, and yet for all this how many thouſands there are who in their youth have their Teeth moſt rotted out and corrupted with this grief, and all for want of help,</p>
               <p>Well and what ſaith the Doctor to this? In very deed he is as contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible as a Bag-piper, every old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and nurſe hath as many and as good Medicines for it as he. Fie on
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:111543:98"/>your worſhip good Doctor, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to your gravity be it ſpoken, are you not aſhamed of your own craft, which know not how radically to cure the Tooth-ach?</p>
               <p>You will ſay it is a thing too mean for your gravity, which therefore you leave to every Barber, he being the only man when all is done; for what with oyl of cloves, Origanum, Peper, Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he cannot mend, with his inſtrument he can end.</p>
               <p>But good Mr. Doctor, why is your worſhip ſo ſqueamiſh, and yet it is not below your worth to toſs a piſs-pot for a groat, and to tell the Patient a long tale of you know not what your ſelf, when perhaps the grief is far of leſs concernment then the Tooth-ach?</p>
               <p>What them? Even this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, here the cauſe is apparent, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knowes it as well as your ſelf, here is not room to juggle, but you muſt come to action, which you
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:111543:99"/>are as willing to as <hi>Hocus pocus</hi> is to act a Puppet-play with the curtain drawn open. In caſes that are not evident, you can adviſe them to bring their water, and this you will view as a Fortune-teller the palm of ones hand, and then you have your tale as ready as a Jugler that ſhews his ſights in Bartholomew-fair, and a Bill to the Apothecary you can give them if need be, or they deſire it, or ſome good counſel you have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, which if the caſe were your own, you would think on it twice ere you would take it once. But in ſuch caſes which oft experience hath made as notorious to others as to you, there the Urinal muſt be thrown aſide, and then you are at your wits ends, according to the Adagy,
<q>Stercus &amp; urina medicorum fercula prima.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How then? Marry thus, The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies

               <p>Coughs, Colds, Murres, Hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Head-aches, Tooth-aches, and the like; nay oft-times the ſimple Itch and Scab, doth reproach you at home, and outdare you abroad, and what is your excuſe? they are trivial caſes.</p>
               <p>By which it appears, that if other diſeaſes ſhould become as common as theſe, they would all be too mean for the Doctors reverence; and good reaſon, becauſe they are above his abilities.</p>
               <p>Though you name Mountebanks
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:111543:102"/>with contempt, yet you differ from them obiefly herein: They pretend skill in notorious diſeaſes, obiefly there where they are leaſt or not at all known; You in a place where you are moſt known, are moſt deſirous to deal in hidden unknown maladies.</p>
               <p>How often ſhall a man finde the Doctors worſhip himſelf tormented and at his wits end with the Tooth-ach, or Head-ach, muffled up for a Hoarſneſs, often coughing at every breath? to whom if you object the common Proverb, Phyſician heal thy ſelf, he will thank you heartily as much as if he did, but he knowes he cannot do it, but it muſt wear away, he will take perhaps ſome old wives Medicine; and what is the cauſe? If another come to him for the ſame grief, he is ſtraight at his rules of Art, the Cough, ſaith he, is cauſed by a Catharr, and therefore firſt you muſt purge, and then make an iſfue, and uſe Conſerves of Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lungs,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:111543:102"/>and ſuch like remedies; why doth he not uſe theſe tricks himſelf? this is the reaſon, he knows it is a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for theſe remedies are invalid, yet be it as it will, he that hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſhall have his counſel which he will not take himſelf, becauſe he wants ſome body to pay him for it, and other good he expects none, but the Patients confidence he hopes will help out the inſufficiency of the Medicament, which therefore he will confidently preſcribe, and count this his Counſel worth a Fee to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which to himſelf would not be worth taking.</p>
               <p>Well, be it ſo, that according to the Proverb, <hi>Aquila non capit mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcas,</hi> the Doctor is above theſe pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imployments, which are too vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, which might be the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved if he were free from them himſelf, yet I then deſire to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, what they ſay to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Gout, is not that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:111543:103"/>worthy their care and cure?</p>
               <p>Yes without doubt, for it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that often followes great men, and Heroes, whom it ſo affects, that he ſhould not be unrewarded and that highly, that could perform that, here the Doctor hath proved his skill and method <hi>(ad nauſeam)</hi> and at laſt he concludes it to be incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Perhaps upon ſome diſorder of the body by ſudden heat and cold, there may be cauſed a running and very ſharp pain, which as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is accidental, and therefore tranſient; the Doctor is adviſed and conſulted with, he adviſeth fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, unguents, plaiſters, ſcar-cloths and ſcarifications, then he purgeth the body once or again as the fanſie takes him, perhaps he will cauſe bliſters to be drawn, and after them cauſe iſſues to be made; then he preſcribes a Dietory, and perhaps cauſeth him to ſweat, the pain goeth
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:111543:103"/>away ſometimes, he uſeth bathing of the part in hot Bathes, either wet or dry; then the Doctor ſtrokes his beard, and perſwades himſelf he hath cured the running Gout. <hi>Neſaevi magne ſacerdos.</hi> Oft times a good old woman ſweating a party ſo taken ſoundly with Carduus &amp; Camomile-flowers, &amp; batching the place affected with Brany Wine warm, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the like: <hi>Amplaſpolia!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, O this is the Doctors Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, this is the Art they ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, in reſpect of which a Chymical Phyſician in contempt is by them termed an emperick, and a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, and what not?</p>
               <p>We have ſeen their myſtery in common maladies, which are too vulgar for them, a gallant excuſe, and in moe difficult caſes in which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced by daily experience, and opportunity of being more fully convinece, ſtill preſenting it ſelf, hath extorted a confeſſion of their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:111543:104"/>herein, yet palliated with a ſhameleſs falſhood, that ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes are incurable, which cenſure they give on a multitude of other diſeaſes, as the Phthiſick, Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Strangury, Palſie, Epilepſie, and many others, which it would be tedious to relate and hame.</p>
               <p>But a true Phyſician acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges none of thoſe ſhameful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, of trivial and conſiderable diſeaſes, nor that falſe diſtinction of curable and incurable; but by his Art with Gods bleſſing he is able to cure and reſtore to their integrity all diſtempers of what kind ſoever, which I ſhall briefly yet fully clear up and demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>This task may ſeem to ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult, eſpecially to a Piſſe-Prophet, who I ſuppoſe are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to hear it demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but many of the Gooſquill Tribe hope the contrary, having this confidence, that what
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:111543:104"/>ever is beyond their capacity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond poſſibility whom therefore I ſhall principally aſſail in this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p>If any of you deſire to know how I prove all diſdaſes to be curable, who am ſo conſident to affirm it, I ſhall aske you how you prove any diſeaſes to be incurable, which you ſo confidently affirm to be ſo.</p>
               <p>I know that what ever you will anſwer, though by much circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution it will all tend to this, becauſe you never could certainly cure ſuch diſeſes, there fore you ſo judge them. In very truth Gentlemen, if you from negative experience are ſo bold to collect a poſitive Maxim, and confidently pronounce that incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable which you cannot cure: I hope you will give the like liberty to a Son of Art, to affirm thoſe diſeaſes to be curable, which he hath oft and certainly reſtored.</p>
               <p>Worth deriſion was that of an
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:111543:105"/>Ideot, who being asked how many even and ſeven was he counted it on his fingers and could tell the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; being asked how many four times ſeven was, his finger Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick failing, he could not tell; but being asked how many ſeven times ſeven was, he ſaid, No man could tell: he thought ſome men might poſſibly count up 4 times 7, but 7 times 7 God only knew. So you, ſome diſeaſes you think you can cure, others though you cannot, yet ſome more experienced in your Art can, but the knotted Gout, Stone, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury, Epilepſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God only can cure. This is your ſentence; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Things often ſucceed in our hands, and ſome, though rarely, yet ſome-times, therefore they are curable; others never ſucceed, therefore they are incurable.</p>
               <p>This Logick would make almoſt all Mechanicks to be impoſſible, if what ever you cannot do muſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:111543:105"/>ſtraight be unfecible. Can any of you, or all your Colledge together, make the Tyrian Purple? Can you make that refined C<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

But what need I propound ſuch hard Caſes to you? Can any of you make a Sword, or a pair of handſom Shooes? I hope you will not therefore conclude it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>Is all wiſdom with you? Is nature limited to your knowledge? Shall that skill not be accounted true which you have not? Fie on all ſuch arrogrance, and fie on all poſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions drawn from negative expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which is indeed but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for what is negative experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but want of experience, and what is that but ignorance?

Or do you think that this is needleſs for a Phyſician to know? Do you think that diſeaſes will be ſcared into confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity by the vengeance of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity? Or what is the matter? for ſhame confeſs the truth, and ſay, it is a refuge only for your ignorance and lazineſs that you have compiled that Catalogue of incurable mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and if you be not paſt all grace and ſhame, attend to him who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to inform you better, If the cure of the ſick be your aim, and the good of mankinde, do not envie a profitable truth becauſe it is fallen
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:111543:106"/>out of your lot, which you might have ſhared in, had you been induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in your time and youth.

               </p>
               <p>The truth is, what you affirm to be impoſſible that I will yeeld to be very difficult, which difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects not the cure, (for all diſeaſes are alike to a noble Medicine) but the preparation of the Medicines; but you know the proverb,
<q>Difficilia ſunt quae pulchra.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But though they be difficult, yet they are not to be deſpaired of, according to the Poer,

               </p>
               <p>Do you think that Science and Art will drop down on you without pains and diligence, as <hi>Diana</hi> is fabled to have fell from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired miraculouſly, as <hi>Danae</hi> was fabled to be impregnated by <hi>Jupiter</hi> coming down into her lap in a ſhowre of Gold? know you not that <hi>vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere dii ſudoribus Artes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not reading of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that will make a Philoſopher, or of <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Avicen, Meſue,</hi> or <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, Sennertus</hi> or the like, that will make a Phyſician. It is not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over of Herbals, or learning the form and hiſtory of plants that will make a true Son of Art. No verily, it requires a far greater diligence. There are Medicines to be made that will cure all diſeaſes, none excepted, which if the health of men and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:111543:107"/>performing of your duty were a thing you made conſcience of, you would ſeriouſly attend, and not ſuffer ſo many to languiſh and periſh hopeleſs, and helpleſs when God hath appointed means abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for their recovery.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, if we could be ſure that there were ſuch remedies, we would not ſpare for any coſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, but we cannot beleeve any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>But why cannot we beleeve it? Doth not the Scripture ſay, that Gods mercy is above all his works: it is a great diffiding in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to think that there are ſo many diſeaſes left incurable, and yer this is one of Chriſts Attributes, that he took our infirmities and bare our griefs, he went about doing good and curing all manner of diſeaſes among the people, therefore it is a good thing, that all diſeaſes ſhould be cured, and is any good thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible?</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:111543:108"/>
               <p>The ſaddneſt affliction of all that befals mankinde, as to this life, and the moſt deplorable, God hath not left without a remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of the body by the Devil, which is prayer and faſting. And is it likely that he hath left any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral malady deſtitute of a remedy.</p>
               <p>Again, doth not the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that he doth not willingly grieve nor afflict thé children of men, which would be a paradox to believe, if there were no remedy for ſuch and ſuch diſeaſes, when the Lord by the moſt deplorable diſeaſes would ſet out the ſaddeſt afflicted State of the Church for their ſins ſake, askes this queſtion, <hi>Is there no balm in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead? is there no Phyſician there?</hi> it were a very unapt ſimilitude, if there were ſuch a catalogue of ſores for which there is no balm, and ſuch a roll of diſeaſes for which there is no Phyſician.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:111543:108"/>
               <p>Tell me, dis you never read of a medicine created out of earth, which he that was wiſe ſhould not deſpiſe? But according to your Doctrine, If this wiſe man were either afflicted with the Gout, Strangury, Palſie, Epilepſie, or the like, he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that Medicine, and that juſtly, if it would do him no good for his diſtempers. It muſt needs follow, that that which no wiſe man ſhould deſpiſe, that is, unleſs he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover folly in ſo deſpiſing, muſt needs be or virtue to cure all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes or any, or elſe if a wiſe man may be ſubject to any diſeaſe which that Medicine could not cure, he could not without folly but deſpiſe it in reference to his own behalf.</p>
               <p>Did you never read that the ſick have need of a Phyſician? To what end I Pray thee? to entreat God for him, and to prove one of <hi>Jobs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters, that is to tell him that his ſickneſs was incurable, if then the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:111543:109"/>ſick indifferently (not this ſick man and that ſick man excluding ſuch and ſuch) need a Phyſician, it muſt needs be that the Phyſician hath or ſhould have remedies to help ſuch an one, or elſe he hath little need of him to take his money and to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him with his Rules of Art, which are to no purpoſe, if he be incurable.</p>
               <p>Did you never read that God had created the Phyſician for neceſſity, and appointed him to be honoured for neceſſity ſake; either then ſuch caſes which you ſhameleſly account uncurable, are caſes of neceſſity, and ſo the Phyſician is created of God in ſuch caſes, or no: what honour think you is Phyſician like to receive, that when he is called to ſome Partient, hath this ſhameful ſubterfuge (it in not to be done)?</p>
               <p>Nor do there want examples ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince the truth of this, if you were but as careful to minde

               <p>And in our Age the noble <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> did perform the ſame to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:111543:110"/>and hath ſo ſatisfactorily written of the whole Art in his large volume every where extant, that though many ſharl and bark at him, yet hitherto none hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that durſt take up the buckler againſt him.</p>
               <p>What can you ſay to theſe men good Mr. Doctors, are their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies true or no? I ſuppoſe this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will prove to you as Chriſts in the like caſe did to the Phariſees and Scribes, concerning the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> when he asked them if it were of heaven or of men. If you confeſs it to be true, then I aske you why you do not follow them, why do you not beleeve them, why do you reproach the Art ſo ſignally teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If you ſay it is not true, the people will condemn you, your own Chieftains-will convince you, <hi>Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Fernelius,</hi> and many others have been forced to confeſs that of this Art in its commendation, which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:111543:111"/>would make your ears glow to hear it in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to deal in good ſadneſs, How come you know any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Art of Medicine? Have you it not from teſtimony? Are not Authors authorities your main pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? ſuppoſe your ſelves to be as you were before you had any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, yet you were dub'd Doctors; and what was all your skill then but on credit? are not the Herbals but ſo many collections of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch Authors as have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the ſubject? And are the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſome men that you fancy, to be believed before the abſolute teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of others? What partiality is this? What had <hi>Galen</hi> to induce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit more then <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont,</hi> Count <hi>Treviſan, Valentinus, Querce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and thoſe of his Art, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were noble, whoſe learning not contemptible, and who wrote not their placits, but their experiences;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:111543:111"/>not what they thought, but what they had done, and could do. Is a negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be accounted as an oracle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a poſitive affirmation? Away with this madneſs! If you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a reaſon for the curableneſs of all diſeaſes, I anſwer, the effect is to be the proof of the cauſe: I ſuppoſe you are ſo good Logicians as to know that cauſe and effect do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally argue each other. If then all diſeaſes in kinde have been, are, and may be cured, then they are curable. The aſſumption is proved by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſufficient, by experience, and no obſcure grounds from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The inſufficiency of vulgar Medicines is the cauſe why many Diſeaſes are judged inourable.</head>
               <p>BY the Catalogue of incurable Diſeaſes it may appear what and how many diſeaſes there be which the Doctor confeſſeth are without the reach of his medicines and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. We ſhall take them at their word, who grant indeed that they cannot cure them, but that they are not therefore cureable, that we have upon good ground denied.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider the efficacy of their method and medicines in other caſes, which they do account curable, and examine what they do perform there.</p>
               <p>But firſt I ſhall adde a word or two of ſerious reproof to them in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:111543:112"/>to the former number of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maladies, in that they to me ſeem not a little culpable.</p>
               <p>If they would candidly wave the cure of ſuch griefs, and deal ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with the ſick Patient, it were commendable in them as honeſty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhould much diminiſh their reputation thereby.</p>
               <p>But yet though they (I mean the ableſt of the ſect) do confeſſe their unſufficiency to cure ſuch and ſuch maladies, yet this notwithſtanding, if any through ignorance of their abilities come to them, in any ſuch caſe, they will not turn him away, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying therein the ſordid ſaying of an unworthy Emperor, <hi>Dulcis odor lucri ex re qualibet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet for this they want no a ſhift, and a poor one too, Although ſay they were know not certainly to cure it, yet we know the cauſes of it, what breeds it, and what feeds it, theſe we cannot totally remove, but
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:111543:113"/>we can ſo diminiſh bad humors which is as fuel to it, that it ſhall not be ſo dangerous, nor ſo troubleſom as elſe it would be, alſo we can apply reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to abate Symptomes, and this Art will do.</p>
               <p>Theſe are good words, which if they knew not how to give, it is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but they had been turned to plough when they had been firſt ſent to the School. But as good words alone will never ſatisfie a hungry belly, ſo will it leſs profit in ſo difficult a caſe.</p>
               <p>What our Doctors can do in aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Symptomes of the Gout, the Stone, the Epilepſie, the Palſie, I deſire to know and learn, nay in a leſs caſe then thoſe mentioned, in the Quartan Feaver.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, that in the time of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Patient oft times will admit of any help real or only promiſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that old ſaying, A drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man will catch at a ſtraw. But
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:111543:113"/>the Doctors ready affording to them their help and counſel when called, in ſuch and other the like caſes, and performing nothing in lieu of great fees, doth make them juſtly at laſt ridiculous, ſo that the name of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is as contemptible to many of the moſt vulgar, as a Pupper-player; and juſtly, for who ſees not how ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly in theſe caſes he behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Let a poor man be taken Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytical, or Epileptical, or Leprous, or with a Cancer, Lupus, or the like, they will very friendly adviſe them not to ſpend their money, for it is in vain; nay Hoſpitals are not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch perſons as being out of hope of cure; and yet if a great He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe be taken with any of the like caſes, no Ravens will ſlie more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to carrion then they to him, in this acting very impudently and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtly.</p>
               <p>It is not my purpoſe here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the particulars of diſeaſes,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:111543:114"/>this being only an Apology, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſewhere largely inſiſted upon many diſeaſes in particular, ſuch to wit which are more common and truculent, which I did, that ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men which have not the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to attain to the greater arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes, may yet have a Succedaneum to them, which being of a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, nature, are to be uſed in ſome caſes only, not ſo commonly, and univerſally in all.</p>
               <p>To return therefore to the thing propoſed, namely to conſider and take a view of the Doctors perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in other caſes which they count curable, namely Feavers, Fluxes, Pleuriſies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And firſt to begin with the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; is that I pray you certainly by you cured? No verily, nay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Truth, there are very great varieties of Feavers, ſome are diary, and of their own accord end in a fit for the moſt part, here perhaps
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:111543:114"/>the Doctor is called, and preſcribes a ridiculous medicine with a ſevere diet, and the party recovers of the diſeaſe, which of its own accord would have ceaſed, or at moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being holpen by a Sage or a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus poſſet, and ſweat provoked thereby.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of theſe Feavers being a light error in the firſt digeſtion, and not affecting the ſpermatical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the ſtomack with any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant impreſſion, is eaſily avoided by one, and that oft no tedious fit, and not rarely is expelled by vomit, and looſneſs, but moſt often by ſweat.</p>
               <p>When the Doctor comes to ſuch a Patient, finding him very ill at ſtomack, reſtleſs, and oft with much pain in the head, very thirſty, and with a thick pulſe, he for the time appoints him ſome cooling Julip, and perhaps ſome ſimple Cordial, and by this means hindering natures indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:111543:115"/>the party who after a ſound ſweat would the next day be pretty well, is like a ſea-ſick man, though the rigor of the former day be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yet he is untoward, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected appetite, and ſomewhat Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh; then the Doctor preſcribes a purge, to carry away (as he ſaith) the peccant matter, and in a word handles the caſe ſo artificially, that he will make a fortnights cure of it, ſometimes twice as long.</p>
               <p>This then he accounts a great cure, and to make it the more eſteemed, he will make it coſtly enough, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries Bils oft times in ſuch caſes riſing to five, ſometimes to ten pounds, and the Doctors Fees to as much, when as the diſeaſe at the firſt taking in hand was but a plain Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though before the Doctors ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an end, it be by his rules of Art changed into a Synochus.</p>
               <p>Nor may this ſeem a falſe imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for I have known the like done
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:111543:115"/>where no Feaver hath been before, yet the Doctor by his Art of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting diſeaſes, hath not only cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diſeaſe, but alſo promoted it ſo far, that by it all furture maladies have been certainly prevented, and the grave hath covered his error.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of my acquaintance in <hi>London,</hi> ſome three years paſt, in the Autumn, was asking me what I would adviſe him for the purging of his body to prevent diſeaſes, (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feavers being then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) I demanded of him what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to deſire Phyſick; he told me indeed he found no diſorder in his body, but thought it were good to uſe Phyſick notwithſtanding for prevention ſake. I told him that Chriſts rule therein was not to be contemned, <hi>viz.</hi> That the whole need not a Phyſician, but ſuch who are ſick; and adviſed him if he were well, to keep himſelf well; but he would needs take the adviſe of a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:111543:116"/>Doctor, and ſome gentle thing to cleanſe his body, hoping by it to be the leſs ſubject to the diſeaſe of the time.</p>
               <p>He adviſed with one, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of as great fame and note as any in <hi>London,</hi> who hath heaped up riches out of the ruines of ſeveral perſons and families, and for doing it with a grace, hath with them got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a name: he adviſeth him to a gentle Purge, which being taken, wrought little or not at all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the next day finding himſelf little the better, the Doctor preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him a Purge ſomewhat ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for, ſaid he, the humor is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick, and ſo not eaſily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: this purge wrought throughly, ſo that at night he had little reſt, and the next day was Feaveriſh, which the Doctor handled ſo well, that in ten daies he rid him both of his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and his life.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:111543:116"/>
               <p>Another Doctor of no leſs note, about two years ſince, came to a Gentlewoman of good quality, who had formerly been his Patient, and was at that time in good health, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous for prevention ſake to purge, which he directed her to do, preſcribing a Purge, which working not at all, he adviſed another of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force; this wrought about 16 or 20 ſtools, and in the night began to work afreſh, nor ceaſed (the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors skill notwithſtanding) till in three dales it fully cured her of all infirmities preſent and to come. No marvel then ſince they are ſo dextrous in cauſing diſeaſes where none were, and managing them till by them is made an end of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſeries, if they being called to a diary can articially turn it into a Synochus, according to the Adagy,
<q>Facilius inventis additur, quàm nova inveniuntur.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:111543:117"/>
               <p>If I were minded here to inſiſt on inſtances, I might ſpend more time then this Apology will admit; I ſhall therefore paſs on to the matter in hand, namely that the Doctor with all his medicaments which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhops afford, and his ſo much adored method to boot, is not confident of the cure of any one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, nor can he aſſure his Patient thereof.</p>
               <p>So then if there be any acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diſtemper befallen a ſtrong man, or woman, there he will tamper like a tinker, who ſeldome mends a hole till he makes it twice or thrice as big, that ſo he may account ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the more nailes; ſo the Doctor will not ſpare to play booty between Nature and the diſeaſe, till it be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated to what height it is poſſible for nature to bear, and then he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes his hand, and expects the Critical day, to wit, to ſee what end nature will make, in the mean time
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:111543:117"/>to the diſturbance of her as much as he can, he forbids all meat and drink but his cookery, every day peeping in the urinal, and feeling the pulſe, and preſcribing this or that ſlop for a Cordial; if the Patient die, then he takes himſelf excuſed, for he proceeded according to the Rules of Art, if he recover (as God in mercy doth recover many, though far leſs then otherwiſe through the Doctors help) then he reckons this for a cure, and prides himſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whoſe folly we ſhall diſcover ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Impartial Reader.</p>
               <p>'Tis a ſhameful excuſe that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors uſually make when many die under their hands, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the Rules of Art, if this Art be worſe then the Art of a Tinker or a Cobler: For let any of theſe be called to do any job of work that is in their Trade, they will tell you ſtraight, if or no it be to be done, and undertaking will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:111543:118"/>it, only the Doctor if called to a ſick patient, will in lieu of a large Fee tell you what the diſeaſe is (as leaſt what comes into his minde at the time, which he thinks will ſatisfie an ignorant patient) and what is this? The ſick man needs a Phyſician, not a witneſs of his miſery. Well, aske him concerning the cure, he will tell you that he can promiſe nothing, for the bleſſing is only in Gods hand, but he will do his endevour, A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Anſwer, and as he will gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, to the vulgar ſpecious, but it is is but a viſard to hide a grievous impoſture.</p>
               <p>For as our life, ſo all our actions are in the hand of God; 'tis he that buildeth the houſe, elſe in vain is the work of the workman. the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-mans breaking up his ground, fowing his ſeed, and managing his ground: even this ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) is of the Lord; He teacheth him, and helpeth him, elſe he could
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:111543:118"/>do nothing. So in God we live, move, and have our being: and when we ſpeak of ordinary natural things, to be ſo cautious in ſpeaking as not to promiſe any thing without mentioning God, is not diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, bur rhw contrary; yet as it may be uſe, or rather miſuſed, this may ſeem not only ridiculous, but in a manner an affected taking Gods name in vain: as for inſtance, if a man being deſired to make a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould promiſe not abſolutely, but with proviſo, if God permit, and give life, it is Chriſtian-like; but if he deſire Gods bleſſing as to the effect, the cauſes being granted, that is ridiculous; as if he ſhould ſay, I cannot promiſe to make you a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I wil uſe all the skill I have and my endevours, but it is in Gods hand whether it ſhall become a garment or no. So of a ſervant ſhould be bidden to kindle a fire, ſhould ſay he could not promiſe to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:111543:119"/>do that, but he would do his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour, but Gods bleſſing muſt give the ſucceſs; how ridiculous were this? but much more if for fuel he ſhould take ſtones, and for fire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a different nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, as having done what was on his part but Gods bleſſing not concurring, the effect did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to deſire.</p>
               <p>Not unlike is it in this caſe: a Doctor is called to a Patient taken with a Feaver, and firſt orders him to be let bloud, then purged either upward or downward, or both waies; the diſeaſe yet encreaſing he gives his cooling Julips, pectoral Electual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Conſerves and Syrups, withall he preſcribes Clyſters, or Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiters, Lotions for the mouth, and ſuch fooleries; if notwithſtanding the diſeaſe continue, and grow more violent, he then expects the criſis of Nature, only he will perhaps apply pigeons or the like to the feet, or
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:111543:119"/>veſicate the external members for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion ſake, and yet if the Patient die, he holds himſelf excuſed, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving followed the rules of Art, and done what was to be done, only the ſucceſs, as he ſaid, being in Gods hand, he therefore could not help it, if God did not ſee good to make the medicines applyed, effectual for the mans recovery.</p>
               <p>But as it is a ſad thing that the grace of God pretended, ſhould be uſed as a pander unto wantonneſs, ſo it is no leſs hateful, that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ſhould be miſapplied as a cover-ſlut of idleneſs, ignorance, and unconſcionableneſs: for who knowes not that our life is ſo in Gods hand, as it is ordinarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ro loſt by the uſe or want of things proper thereto? even hunger if ſelf would be certainly mortal, if not appeaſed by meat appropriated thereto by the appointment of God. And if ſtones were uſed for food, no
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:111543:120"/>man would doubt to impute death in that caſe to the want of food, as the immediate cauſe ſubordinate to the providence of God: ſo is it in this caſe. And in truth God can, but rarely doth work miracles; a man rarely is ſarved to death amidſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of victuals, nor pined for thirſt where drink is plenty, much leſt where he both may, and doth eat and drink at pleaſure. So then as to the ſtarving of a man is required want of meat &amp; drink, or either of them, ſo to the periſhing of a man under a Feaver is required the defect of a true medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, or want fo timely application.</p>
               <p>It is not every ridiculous ſlop that is a Medicine, nor any promiſcuous care of the ſick that is the true. Art of cure; that is a Medicine indeed, and the Art of cure indeed, which hath a power to perform what the Phyſician promiſeth, or the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent expecteth. Sothen the Art and Medicines which are required for
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:111543:120"/>cure, and not for pretence, are to be related unto actual recovery as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe to the effect, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly effectual.</p>
               <p>'Tis as naturall and certain for a right Medicine to cure a diſeaſe, as it is for fire to inflame combuſtible things, for the Sun to give light, for water to quench fire, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary would be ſupernatural, yea I am bold to affirm, that it would be as ſtrange for a true Medicine rightly applyed to miſs the cure of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſeaſe, as for the flame not to conſume a conbuſtible object.</p>
               <p>So that for Doctors to pretend that they uſe the means, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reles of Art, but Gods bleſſing not concurring, the effect did not anſwer expectation; is as much as if they ſhould ſay, that God to render their labour and care fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, doth work miracles daily, in denying the natural effect to an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:111543:121"/>
               <p>And if ſo, they may juſtly fear themſelves to be highly out of Gods favour, if he will croſs and pervert the ordinary courſe of nature, and that daily and commonly to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their endevours; or elſe they muſt confeſs the truth as it is name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that their method and medicines are not to be eſteemed as an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate cauſe to the effect of cure of diſeaſes; and then what is their Art, but a ſhalmeful impoſture and cheat of the world?</p>
               <p>I Would gladly any of the <hi>Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Tribe would ſalve this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by reſolving the world to what diſeaſes their Art, Method, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, are adequated cauſes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of cure and reference to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, if to any, then in ſuch diſeaſes they may as confidently warrant the effect, as a Gunner to fire a Gun that is charged with good powder, and he with a lighted linſtock in his hand; nor is it preſumption in the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:111543:121"/>one more then in the other, but alas is it not evident, that if a Doctor be called to a ſick man, though at the beginning of the diſeaſe, and in his full ſtrength, yet he can promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to do his endevour, as the man doth who according to the man doth who according to the Proverb, threſheth in his cloak? whence it appears, that when ever any one recovers he doth it only through Natures benignity, and not by any art of the Doctor, who could not warrant the cure, much leſs how ſoon it would be effected.</p>
               <p>Fie on that Art, which alone of all Arts in the world can not, dare not, will not warrant to perform what it undertakes, when as the most hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Art of all Agriculture, and the Mariners Art, are uſually warranted, yet we know that the winds which are the directors and accompliſhers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God of the Mariners deſign, blow where they liſt, rarely trade, and the crop of the husbandman (if the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:111543:122"/>early and latter rains do but fail, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impared, or elſe quite fruſtrated, yet both one and the other are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the undertakers, on penalty of loſs of all their labour and coſt, at the leaſt; and oft times a voyage by Sea is warranted by Merchants for a ſmall inconſiderable gain to be paid to them at adventure, in lieu of which they will repay the whole if loſt, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Doctor is of another minde, for he will be paid at adventure, nor will he warrant any thing in lieu of his payment, but to do his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which is a ridiculous cheat of the ſick, both of their money and lives.</p>
               <p>If a Taylor when cloath is brought him, ſhould demand, pay at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet not promiſe to perform his work, but only to do his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, even the Doctor himſelf would think him as well deſerving his wages, as they in Lubberland de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve twelve pence by the day for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:111543:122"/>ſleeping, but eſpecially if ſuch a Taylor ſhould ſpoyl the cloth ſo brought him by cutting it into ſhreds, in ſtead of making it into a garment, and do thus ten times for once making a garment, and yet exact his pay how like a knave would his acting be and yet how like a Doctor, who never doth otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe a Son of Art, he confidently undertaketh a diſeaſe and as certainly performes what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh; he comes armed with powerful Medicaments, and not with a ſimple impotent method, which are as effectual to the perſon that is ſick for his recovery, as water would be for the quenching of fire; not that he attempts any thing without the bleſſing of God, for he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it a great mercy of him, firſt to have provided ſuch Medicines in Nature for ſuch maladies, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in revealing them to him for the help of mankinde: and laſtly, in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:111543:123"/>bringing him to thoſe who finde help by him, for otherwiſe where God intends a diſeaſe ſhall be fatal to any, he with-holds the means from him, either totally, or ſo long till it be too late to recover him.</p>
               <p>For although the conſequent which is drawn from the cauſe to the effect be ceitain and undeniable, yet the cauſe amy acidentally be truſtrated of its effect, by accident, yet ſo that the cauſe doth not ceaſe to be a cauſe notwithſtanding. I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in all generations, which by accident may be hindred: the fire may not burn what is combuſtible, if by accident that be made too wet; ſo water will not quench fire, if the quantity be too little; ſo a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured by a medicine, if already death be poſſeſt of the principal parts, or if the party be not ſenſible and ſo will not take it, otherwiſe it cannot be but that a medicine indeed muſt work its effect, alſe it is no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:111543:123"/>
               <p>But here it will not be amiſs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a cavil, I doubt not but ſome adverſaries will object to me as of old was objectd to <hi>Paracelſus:</hi> Do you cure all? Do none die of your Patients? To theſe I ſhall anſwer, that indeed all do not recover, and yet the truth of what I ſay nothing infringed; for againſt all diſcaſes there is a remedy, but againſt death none, that only is out of the reach of all medicines. Now if God hath numbred a mans daies, and finiſhed them, it is not to be objected to the diſgrace of a Medicine, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail againſt the irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decree.</p>
               <p>If that were all that were to be objected againſt the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and practiſe, we ſhould never finde fault with them; for it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to all men once to die, and all our daies are numbred, every man is not to live <hi>ad aetatem decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitam.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:111543:124"/>
               <p>But with all this we ſay, that thought our Medicines cannot triumph over death; yet againſt the miſeries of life. They will prevail over the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe even there where recovery of life is impoſſible: and therefore a true febrifuge will refreſh, abate Symptomes, compoſe, and bring to quiet, even there where the ſeat of life is poſſeſſed by death, which is a <hi>(levamen)</hi> thought not a <hi>(Reſtanra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the ſtroke of death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes with the face of a diſeaſe, at leaſt ſhewing ſome of the common uſual ſymptomes of a Feaver, not eaſily to be diſcerned, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is as we ſay <hi>(preter ſpem)</hi> Not hoped for, and ſo not ſo eaſily beleeved according to the Adagy,
<q>
                     <l>(Facile ſperamus quae fieri volumus,</l>
                     <l>facilius quod ſperamus credimus).</l>

               </p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:111543:124"/>
               <p>And ſo on the other hand what a man would not have, he is not apt to believe. Adde to this the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration we have to thoſe that are afflicted and in ſickneſs, which would make us deſire to be inſtrumental in any thing which is for their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And laſtly, if a man do doubt the worſt, yet it is not good to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the Patient with his jealouſies, which leave a deep impreſſion on his ſpirit, and make the hope (if any were) oft times deſperate. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, as nothing is without a cauſe, and therefore diſeaſes are curable becauſe Medicines are endowed by God with ſuch a virtue, ſo that ſome particular diſeaſes are excepted from the rule of the generals there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes, of which it is moſt true,
<q>Faelix qui poterit rerum dignoſcere cauſas.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:111543:125"/>
               <p>Yet a Son of Art by his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines is able to cure what is curable, (which all diſeaſes are in their kinde) though ſometimes the diſeaſe being heightned almoſt to its utmoſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod before he is called, ſo that death having conquered the chief places, will not accep of any truce; ſometimes the party is ſtruck with deaths ſtroke at firſt, which cauſing a commotion of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to be ſo overmaſtered by its adverſary, doth appear like unto an ordinary acute diſeaſe, yet without poſſibility of cure, unleſs by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who can raiſe the dead; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the patient hath undergone ſo much of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Tribes metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Butchery, that he hath not ſtrength left to help the Phyſicians Medicines, nature having been ſo exhauſted, that for want of ſtrength it faints under its load; nor hath it ſtrength ſufficient left to co-work with the Medicine, and ſometimes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:111543:125"/>the defect of the higheſt <hi>Arcana,</hi> which every true ſon of Art cannot command, doth make many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary diſeaſes, and ſome chronical, which are raiſed to a more then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al height, to be out of his Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reach, which otherwiſe would be cured by a powerful Arcanum.</p>
               <p>And here is the goodneſs of the moſt High, that no man can truly boaſt himſelf to be a real ſon of Art, but he hath at command Medicines to cure the moſt common and trucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſeaſes, as for inſtance, Feavers, Pleuriſies, Flixes of all ſort, Agues of all ſort, ſmall Pox and Meaſles which are indeed but a branch of Feavers, Calentures, alſo which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſame head, the Jaundies, Head-aches, Tooth-aches, with all running pains, Hypochondrical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, affections of the Mother, and obſtructions of all ſorts cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing indigeſtion, Palpitations, Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copes, Convulſions, Vertigoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which a true ſon of art can confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:111543:126"/>undertake and cure: and though ſome are paſt recovery of life as is before ſaid, yet even to ſuch his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments will be effectual for eaſe and comfort, and abating of raging Symptomes, which is an effect not to be deſpiſed, where more cannot be attained.</p>
               <p>That therefore may well and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be account a Febriſuge, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, ſpeedily and powerfully cures Feavers of all ſorts, at firſt or ſecond doſe oft times, but never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds four daies in continual Feavers, if adminiſtred in the beginning, and Agues oft at one fit, never miſſeth in three or four at moſt, perfectly to cure: and although ſome Feavers which have been neglected too long ere remedy be ſought, do miſcarry, yet of ſuch not one of five, of thoſe that are taken in time not one in a hundred, which doth not diſprove the virtue or efficary of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:111543:126"/>
               <p>I know what will be ſaid in calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt me, though not in anſwer to me, namely, that I am an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and by an Emperick they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally would have underſtood, one who practiſeth by fortuirous receipts, without the knowledge of the cauſe of the diſeaſe, or nature of what he adminiſters, and therefore ſhoots his ſhafts at randome.</p>
               <p>This hath been an old reproach of <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont, Quercetan,</hi> and all Chymical Phyſicians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not wonder if it be caſt upon me. But as a worthy friend of mine, when a great Doctor of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical</hi> Tribe, very paſſionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me to him as an Emperick, and Mountebank, asked him the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between ſuch a one and a dub'd Doctor? The <hi>Galeniſt</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the one ſhot at random, the other wrought according to Art and Method: to which my friend replyed that to his knowledge I cured not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:111543:127"/>ſpeedily, but certainly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, thoſe diſeaſes (namely A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues) which the other Doctors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies failed in curing, now if this were the difference between an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perick and a Colleague of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the firſt at randome (as he objected) never or very ſeldom miſſed, but ſuch as himſelf by Art never or very ſeldom hit the cure, he had rather have an Empirical cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſtant and ſafe cure, then an artificial miſſing of the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is known to the moſt vulgar and ignorant, that not only Chronical diſeaſes are out of the Doctors reach, but all acute diſeaſes alſo, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not of his own accord cure, which may appear by the effect; How many Feavers do they cure? certainly none, if we judge that for a cure which is indeed ſo to be judged, where the Criſis is prevented by the efficacy of the Medicine; but how many in a year outlive the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:111543:127"/>many daies through the ſtrength of Nature, and yet die meerly through the Doctors taking part againſt nature by phlebotomy, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who is hited by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to oppoſe the diſeaſe, againſt which their Medicines are as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as the Prieſts holy-water is againſt the Devil, or the ringing of Bels, and mumbling a <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> on their heads; to both of whom I may ſay that of the Satyriſt,

               </p>
               <p>I have oft ſeriouſly wondred how it ſhould come to paſs that theſe ſilly Juglers ſhould ſo long ſhuffle out, ſince there is ſcarce one in the whole Nation that ever made uſe of them, who in health hath not a flout ready in his bag to throw in a <hi>Galeniſts</hi> diſh, and yet in ſickneſs they deifie in a manner thoſe very men whom
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:111543:128"/>in health they ſcorned: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but aſcribe it to the juſtice and wiſdom of God, who is pouring forth his plagues all the world over (I mean among Chriſtians) by which the third part of the world ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and I think in my conſcience, that few leſs periſh by the Doctors craſt. 'Tis a ſad conſideration, that Chriſtians only ſwarm with theſe Caterpillars, the Heathens not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor owning nor following their method; witneſs the Turks, Moores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then began it to grow to this head of eſteem, when the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſtians provoked God to the pouring forth of his plagues, of which the moſt truculent of all, is the Doctors Art. The ſword and all diſeaſes put together deſtroy not ſo many as they, namely ſuch as by Natures ſtrength would recover, but are deſtroyed by the Doctors Art. Without theſe the <hi>Romans</hi> flouriſhed 500 years, nor found any
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:111543:128"/>want of them. Now <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> ſwarmes with them, and never did diſeaſes raign there as now; and of all places where are the yearly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials comparable to thoſe places where Doctors are moſt numerous? How do they ſwarm in <hi>London?</hi> and yet not a year in which many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands dye not of curable deſeaſes. 'Tis ſad it ſhould be ſo, and yet who ſees it not? Let a diſeaſe be but epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical, the Doctor cals it a new diſeaſe, although no other then an epidemical Feaver, and here he is the by-word of every water-bearer. In Agues, eſpecially Autumnal and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, who more ridiculous, and yet the people though they ſee and know this, nevertheleſs ſubmit to them, and adore them in neceſſity, to the cheating them of their money, and the loſs of their lives.</p>
               <p>By all which it is moſt moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that their Medicines are but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, ſo named, <hi>a medendo,</hi> as

                  <hi>Lucus a lucendo (quod minimè mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur)</hi> which may ſcarcely paſs as metaphors to true Medicines, nor can any good be predicated of them without an Irony.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould take a particular ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of all their Medicines, we ſhall finde them all partly ridiculous, and partly deſperate, univerſally anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their denomination; as the rude painters draughts of old did the things they repreſented, under which if it were not written, this is a Dog, this is a Cow, this is a Stag, this a Man, this a Cock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no man by the draught could tell what the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture repreſented; ſo if thoſe were not called Medicines, a man ſhould never by the effect know that they were ſo. Firſt, are their Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Emeticks, next their Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks, then their Diureticks, then their Carminatives, and next their Cordials, which are either Hypnotick, or Pectoral, or Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:111543:129"/>or cooling. Theſe are indeed magnificent names, let the things be what they will. And here I cannot but take notice of their artificial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of names, in that they call their laxative Medicines which are of milder operation Lenitives, thoſe of ſtronger <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:111543:130"/>
               <p>Now of this fort ſome work pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely one way, others work both waies, both upward and downward; of the latter ſort are, Elaterium Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogia, otherwiſe called Gurta, Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, Cen<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>n, Houſleck, and many others; of the firſt ſort, are Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb. Scammony, Colocynthis, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vomitories, becauſe they hear but ill in Engliſh, they likewiſe call by a Greek name <hi>Emeticks,</hi> which the common ſort not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, do think that in the name ſome reverend myſtery is contained; and truly ſo there is, for as a Thief, or Seminary (with us) to avoid ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, hath a new name for a refuge, ſo theſe having deſerved but ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Vomits, be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Emeticks, and will get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment under that name, which would be abhorred under their own denomination.</p>
               <p>So that if a Patient ſay, Oh good
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:111543:130"/>Doctor give me not a Vomit, for ſuch a time I took one which had night killed me; no ſaith he ſtraight, I will only give you an Emetick, but not a Vomit: if the party reply, And what do you call an Emetick? ſaith not a Vomit: if the party reply, And what do you call an Emetick? ſaith he, a Medicine that worketh very gently, perhaps once or twice if need be, and thus the Patient accepts of an Emetick who abhorred a Vomit.</p>
               <p>And the like cauſe gave Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Colocynthida and Combogia, the ſurnames of Diagridium, Alahandal, and Gutta Gummi, as having by their churliſhneſs deſerved ill ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that they are aſhamed of them. So <hi>Succus cucumeris agreſtis,</hi> is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Elaterium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to leave the names, and come to the thing, what are all theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments but poyſons? if any be deſirous to make experiment, let it be on himſelf firſt or none, let him I ſay but treble the Doctors Doſe to himſelf, and I dare almoſt warrant him death.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:111543:131"/>
               <p>But you will ſay they are corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Apothecaries Art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctors preſcription, if ſo, let the effect ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The wilde Cucumer is to be ſliced with a bone knife when green, and the juyce to be received in a clean platter, which precipitates a light ſedimen, this is to be ſevered from the other juice by decantation and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is their Eleaterium, and is then fit to enter their compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Can any thing be more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous? in the juyce indeed is the whole virtue or Craſis, and the moſt eminent in that part which ſtils out of it ſelf from the Apple being cut in ſlices by degrees over a diſh, ſo far they are right: ſo Opium is the beſt which diſtils out from the ſcape of the Poppy ſo wounded, and may reſemble the bloud of the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>But why the juyce when clarified (by precipitating the powder that is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:111543:131"/>light and feculent) ſhould be caſt away, and the dregs (themſelves call it a fecula) be only ſaved, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe the true ſincere juice would be too ſtrong, a gallant correction. So Hellebore, Hyoſcyam, Aconitum, and all may be corrected, if being ſtamped green, and ſtrained, and then filtred, that only be ſaved which remains behinde in the filtring bag, or it dry, macerated by decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then ſtrained ahd filtred, and the light fecula ſaved. The groſs apple is rejected, as being too groſs a feces, the ſubtle juyce alſo, as being too efficacious a poyſon, only the light, fecula (which being not waſhed retains a little of the virtue of the juice) is ſaved, and it is a proper corrected Medicine for a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſt,</hi> and yet of this half a ſcruple would be as effectual as a two-penny halter.</p>
               <p>But why ſliced with a bone knife? It is a good proviſo for the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:111543:132"/>Wife, and younger Apprentice, the one a weak woman, the other a knaviſh boy, very apt both to cut their fingers, and the Doctor not knowing what work the juice of theſe Cucumers would make in a cut finger, provides for them as a nurſe for a childe with a bone knife. So Colocyntida is corrected by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two years or three in the air on a ſtring. If loſs of virtue may be called correction, I am ſure Tobacco that is of as ſtrong a compoſition as Colocyntida, by the ſame Art may may be corrected fitly for the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, which before was of value; ſo Colocyntida, Briony, Hellebore, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum Roots, Aconitum, Aaron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by this Art become fit drugs for a <hi>Galeniſt,</hi> becauſe ſcarce fit for ought elſe but the dunghill.</p>
               <p>As for the confection of poyſons in Receipts, becauſe many ſimple people believe, that this compoſition of the Apothecaries by the Doctors
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:111543:132"/>direction is a correction of venomes, ſo as to alter their name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into medicine, it is a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; for they only compound them with hony or ſugar, and confound them with other things in ſuch a proportion, that a doſe ſhall contain of the poyſon a leſs quantity then may prove mortal, which they might as well adminiſter alone, nor with ſo much pains confound thoſe things in compoſition which are of themſelves of little or no virtue.</p>
               <p>Thus Opium is confounded with a many Simples into a ridiculous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, of which let be given as much as doth contain 6 grains of the Opium, and ſee if the effect be not the ſame or worſe then if ſo much crude Opium were given. Theſe tricks then are but toyes bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confound Simples by beating them together with honey or ſugar, into an Electuary or a Conſection, without previous preparation and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:111543:133"/>ſeparation of the good from the bad.</p>
               <p>Medicine is a ſerious, and hidden thing, I had almoſt ſaid ſacred, nor doth it come to the knowledge of any, but by the ſpecial gift of the moſt high. It is he that hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Phyſician and hath ſet him up to be honoured for neceſſity ſake. Nor is it to be thought that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe myſteries of this Art lye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in every Apothecaries ſhop, according to the Adagy,

               <p>Thoſe who were the firſt Heroes of this Art, did hide the ſecrets of it ſo from the conuſance of the vulgar, that they had a Divinity aſcribed unto themſelves in reference to their hidden and ſecret skill; only <hi>Galen</hi> to get a name, made a great noyſe about the world, taking upon him to unveil Medicine, and expoſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:111543:133"/>her naked to the eye of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily ſordid, covetous practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Art: but as he who did but dare to gaze upon <hi>Diana</hi> naked, was crowned with horns, and made a prey unto his dogs; ſo he who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed ſuch violence to this chaſte and moſt retired Nymph, is worthily rewarded with <hi>Midas</hi> purchaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a pair of Aſſes ears.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who know and ſee, how ſtudiouſly any of their own ſect doth hide any one Receipt or Medicine which the finde ſingular, ſo that many of them have never revealed it dying, who would imagine them to be ſuch Animals, that whatever they read they ſhould ſtraight believe (provided the Author have but had the luck to die famous) and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to draw it into their Diſpenſato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be put in practiſe by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary. As though many who do write, (aiming at pomp and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe) do not write meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:111543:134"/>which they account ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>Adde to this Natures ſimplicity, which doth that with one or two things duly prepared and applyed, which would not be done by all the Doctors pompous receipts, which by hap ſome or other lighting of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conference with ſome good old woman, or having by ſucceſs found the reality of the thing, which the Doctor willing to advance by his method of extracting, candying, or conſerving, or compounding; he finds it to anſwer his expectation worſe in compoſition, then in its ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, with a due preparation, which therefore he keeps to himſelf as a ſecret, and perhaps gets much credit by it, (for that is the Doctors craft, that what a good old woman ſhall do by natures ſimplicity, ſhall be judged not worth thanks, yet the ſame done by him ſhall be enhanced within a degree of a miracle) two
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:111543:134"/>or three ſuch trivial experiments, yet more effectual then the ordinary ſlops perhaps he accounts his myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he will not diſcover, till at laſt dying he is won to impart them to the world, which he knowing to be ſo ſimple, that if told ſincerely, would be received with this of the Poet,
<q>Spectatum admiſsi riſum teneatis amici?</q>
               </p>
               <p>He therefore garniſhes out the naked ſimple truth with addition of many things, which he hopes or thinks will be but as herb John in Pottage, of which ſome by reaſon of their dearneſs, ſome for the hardneſs of procurement may raiſe a reverend eſteem of that ſecret ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his life, and which he fears (if nakedly declared) would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible after death: and thus what to him was effectual, being by his direction clog'd and perverted
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:111543:135"/>with a fortuitous medley, becomes fruſtrate; hence it is that ſo many things which were famous to the Inventor, are at this day but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſlops.</p>
               <p>Thus the Counteſs of <hi>Kents</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſince her death brought into uſual receipts, which I rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is a ſpurious Receipt forged by others, then left by her; yet in that ſhe wanted not her coſtly additions, which added to the price, but dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the virtue of the Simples: the like may be ſaid of <hi>Gaſcoines</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is by ſome accounted the ground of the other.</p>
               <p>But what I particulariſe theſe things for I do to this end, that it may appear how ſottiſhly Doctors take for granted what ever they read in a book written by any man who was famous in his life, which muſt needs be believed, and taken thus on credit, is ſo tranſmitted unto the Apothecaries to be accordingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:111543:135"/>when as their ſecrets which they ſo eſteemed, they concealed in their life what they could, and might have many reaſons not to leave can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly written after death. Partly leſt the naked ſimplicity of them ſhould bring them into contempt, but it may be chiefly becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſome friends under colour of friendſhip they have enviouſly given wrong Receipts, which they muſt not alter at death leſt they ſhould brand themſelves with a black note of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy by ſo doing, or for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which it is not my deſign to reckon up or to endevour to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; only the grand reaſon I doubt not, is becauſe when a Doctor gets ſuch a ſecret, how ſimple ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, he values it to the Patient richer then if made of Gold and Jems, which therefore when ever publiſhed to the world, muſt have ſome coſtly additions, to make his price ſeem conſcionable, leſt after
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:111543:136"/>his death by his own confeſſion, all that ever have uſed his Medicines ſhould judge him an unconſcionable cheat, and ſo poſterity falſly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſingularity of the virtue of the Medicine to the moſt coſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, come at laſt to leave out or neglect at leaſt the due care and choyce of the moſt effectual ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
               <p>Not that I do judge, or think, or contend for, that a Phyſician is to ſell his Medicines at the rate they coſt him, allowing ſuch or ſuch gain for his pains as a Merchant or Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper takes. No verily, for firſt Medicines are not every mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the whole need them not, and for their own uſe (ſo long as healthy) would not value that at twenty pence which might coſt twenty pound. The ſick only needs them, and to ſuch they are precious, if effectual and applyed in ſeaſon. As then I do not value Ambergreece the leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:111543:136"/>it is oft found by chance, and ſeldom coſts the finder more then his pains to take it up, (the like may be ſaid of Jems in their firſt finding) ſo I do not value a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine by what it coſts, but by what it will do, and according to the party to whom it is applyed. As then a poor mans credit is as dear to him as rich mans, yet a defamation which to one may not be valued at ſix pence, may to another be valued at ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound; ſo a Medicine which will cure both rich and poor, though given to the poor for nothing, yet doth not argue that it coſt the maker of it nothing; and though the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it coſt not above five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, yet this doth not hinder but it may be valued to a rich man at five pound, if it really do him more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then perhaps he would be without for five hundred pound.</p>
               <p>A Phyſician then is bound only to the rules of true Charity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:111543:137"/>given of God to help and relieve the lives of many that are endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he may, and that piouſly, ſo take of the rich, as to be able to help the poor freely, and yet as cordially and as truely affording to them his beſt help and remedies, for nothing, as he doth to the rich for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Yet is it not fit that any reward ſhould be accounted due where the diſeaſe is not cured; for the Patient doth not want a Doctor for to tell him a tale of his diſeaſe, nor yet to pray God for his recovery, but to adminiſter to his diſeaſe, what may be effectual: a Saylor though he take never ſo much pains, yet is not paid that performes not his voyage; yea and all callings whatever are paid for their pains, only with proviſo, that they do what they undertake; only a Doctor is paid for his pains though never ſo little to the purpoſe, which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:111543:137"/>is unconſcionable; I confeſs that if the Patient finde him to be carefull and diligent he may order him ſome reward for his good will where he wanted in skill, but this the Doctor cannot challenge. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor on the Patients trial (where his remedy is fruſtraneous) learns (if he be honeſt) not too confidently to truſt that Medicine in that caſe again; but what gets the Patient but only his labour for his pains in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it? and this hurt at the leaſt, that ſo much time is loſt and his cure never the nearer (if not the farther off by the diſeaſes having had ſo long the more time on him) for which it is moſt unreaſonable, that he ſhould be accounted in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors debt.</p>
               <p>I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that as I alwaies reckoned a Doctors. Art not to be bound to the ordinary rules of merchandiſe, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the lives of men not to be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:111543:138"/>bought or ſold for money, ſo I could not but alwaies judge it unreaſonable for a reward to be there demanded where no good is done: for the Art of Medicine is a myſtery in which the common people have no skill, and when they are ill they want not a Doctor for his reverent looks, nor do they deſire any thing promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for a Medicine, much leſs any dear thing, but only what may be good for the diſeaſe, If they knew a thing were not good for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, or that it were appointed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a wilde random, they would be loath to buy it for themſelves, though they might have it for half the worth of it, much leſs would they give ten times the price for it that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary gives for it at firſt hand, which is the uſual profit which ſome Apothecaries (on my knowledge) make of ſome, nay many of their ſtops).</p>
               <p>Are they the fathers of the ſick?
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:111543:138"/>And do they when the childe wants and asks bread, give a ſtone; when fiſh, a ſerpent; and over &amp; beſides ſell theſe prepoſterous intruſions at ten, nay oft at twenty times the rate they are worth? The God of mercy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all honeſt men from the hands of ſuch devouring Caterpillers!</p>
               <p>When I firſt gave my ſelf to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal practiſe, I confeſs I was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ask a price for a Medicine I had not tryed, however commended by Authors. I knew it either muſt anſwer the patients expectation or no. If ſo, it then deſerved a gratuity above its price; if not, the Patient could not in conſcience be charged for that, which might have been equalled, if not excelled, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of ſome old wife gratis. My uſual word then to them was, that they ſhould prove the effect in the firſt place, and then as the operation did ſucceed to be thankful.</p>
               <p>And I muſt proteſt, that mine ears
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:111543:139"/>were ſoon dulled with the uſual pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linode of, It did me no good, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the promiſes of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and their method of cheating, their allowed Diſpenſatories.</p>
               <p>So that I was (as <hi>Helmont</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) almoſt quite out of conceit of the Art of Medicine, accounting it and judging it to be but a cruel cheat, but at laſt I found that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelf a number who had not bowed the knee to the <hi>Baal</hi> of profit, covetouſneſs, idleneſs, and ambition, whom therefore I ſeriouſly ſtudied, and gave my ſelf in imitation of them to the ſtudious ſearch of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>At laſt God was pleaſed ſo to bleſs my ſtudies, and hear my prayers, as to grant me the true keys of Chymical preparations, who gives to whom he pleaſeth, and with-holds where he liſteth, to him be glory for ever.</p>
               <p>Then I could not but contemn the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:111543:139"/>uſual vulgar preparations, as being groſly fooliſh, their compoſitions ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, their corrections Ironical, in a word, the whole Art of vulgar Medicine, I found to be as if it had been invented by ſome <hi>Timon,</hi> or <hi>Miſanthropos,</hi> on purpoſe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Mankinde.</p>
               <p>They who deſire to read more particularly concerning the folly and futility of vulgar Medicaments, I recommend them to the noble <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> his <hi>Pharmacopolium ac Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatorium modernum,</hi> where this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is handled <hi>ad nauſeam uſ<expan>

               <p>This I ſhall only ſay, that it is an unworthy thing that a Doctor ſhould adminiſter things which he knowes not by ſight, and yet bleſs himſelf that he hath the knowledge of them, when what ever he knoweth of them
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:111543:140"/>it is but upon credit by reading, the Author perhaps being a <hi>Grecian, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Frenchman,</hi> or <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and yet he as confidently applying his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to men in <hi>England</hi> (where both Simples and conſtitutions of men are notably altered) as if no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at all between place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were.</p>
               <p>'Tis an abuſe likewiſe worthy the moſt biting and ſharpeſt Satyr, that a Doctor ſhould undertake the cure of lives, and yet commit the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Medicaments to an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, and he to his Apprentice, not conſidering into what hazards they caſt, and in what dangers they involve the Patient by this courſe; for who is ſo ſtupid as to think, that it is the Doctors name that will ſcare a diſeaſe into conformity? no veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it muſt be the Medicine that muſt effect the cure, in the preparation of which conſiſts the greateſt ſecret, and in it a ſmall neglect is of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:111543:140"/>now what can be expected from an Apothecary, whoſe skill for the moſt part is no more then what an apprentiſhip hath gotten him, it is to me I confeſs ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a thing of ſerious conſideration. This I know, that the care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ought not to be lightly ſet by; yet what Mechaniſt is there, who prepares venal drugs, that can be confided in, but that he will either buy the cheapeſt and moſt raſcal ingredients, or ſubſtitute <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> with a thouſand deceits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the neglect of his apprentice, to whom in the concluſion, the care of the preparation is committed.</p>
               <p>Thus I have not very largely, yet I hope fully Apologized for the Art of Pyrotechny: and ſuppoſing a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſt</hi> for Moderator, I conceive that I hear him diſcharging me with a <hi>[Satisfeciſti officio tuo]</hi> ſuppoſing an unprejudiced and judicious Reader, me thinks I hear him deſiring after
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:111543:141"/>this Apology, a diſcovery of ſuch Medicaments, which may actually convince, and maintain, what is here argumentally proved and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. The deſire to me ſeems reaſonable, and my ſpirit to anſwer the ſame is much inclined, which God willing ſhall be performed in an enſuing Diſcourſe, which ſhall fully and faithfully diſcover the more ſecret preparations of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Arcana's with their true keys, in which I ſhall be ſo candid as to leave nothing undiſcloſed which a Son of Art may deſire, yet ſo as not to tranſgreſs the lawes of Nature, and to proſtitute her my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious and ſecret operations to the eye of every Reader, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſtudious ſearch and diligent inquiry, I ſhall be a faithfull guide to ſuch as by God are elected here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but to the reſt I ſhall be obſcure enough.</p>

               <p>HAving in the two foregoing Chapters, on good grounds rejected the vulgar way of Medicine, and convinced it (notwithſtanding the brags of our Gooſequil Doctors concerning it) to be inſufficient and dangerous, intended againſt (inſtead of the diſeaſe) the life of the patient, in its Purgatives, Phlebotomy, Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Scarifications, Fontinels, and ſtarving Julips, and barly Broths, under the pretence of cooling the Body, and giving but ridiculous
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:111543:142"/>hope of cure in its Dietical preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and Cordials ſo called, made of coſtly things ridiculouſly blended together, their Clyſters, Conſerves, Syrups, Lochſana's, diſtill'd waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſo notorious as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Proverb to the vulgar all the world over, although this foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh method be embraced and hugg'd by our Methodiſts (as they call themſelves, or more truly, Gooſquil Piſſe-prophets) who by long jugling have gotten reputation, which they have improved to what height is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the getting of money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to either Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or honeſty.</p>
               <p>It will now be convenient to come to the diſcovery of true Medicaments, which may perform that for the cure of thoſe diſeaſes to which mans frail nature is ſubject, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the boaſts of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Tribe they could never perform, and yet to ſee how craftily they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:111543:142"/>for mnny ages upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous world, (not in trifles, but in great and vaſt ſums of money, and their lives oft times to boot) would amaze any judicious obſerver of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Yea ſo confident are they in this their Art of jugling, as to glory therein, as in a notably deſerving at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlevement: inſomuch that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of my acquaintance, of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed learning, and of ſo much conſcience therewith, that he hath for nigh ſixteen years through great difficulties, lived in defiance of the vulgar way of practiſe, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of the ill will and reproach of all or moſt of his friends, and conſequently to the involving of himſelf in many pinching ſtraights, which yet he chearfully underwent, and undergoes, rather then to get a living by an Art, which he plainly diſcovered to be a frivolous cheat, though a cruel butchery to the ſick;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:111543:143"/>he then fearing the judgement to come, (although, without exception, a man of as able learning as the moſt cryed up Gooſquil Piſs-prophet in <hi>London</hi>) refuſed utterly the practiſe of Medicine in the vulgar way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for a livelihood, &amp; although as abſolutely accompliſhed for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the ſame, as the ableſt of them for learning, (and whom the deaths of two or three hundred men would have brought to the ſame experience with them) nor was he then a Maſter of nobler ſecrets, and therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe an abſolute contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life, then to be imployed in ſuch a barbarous butcher like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. This man one day hapning to diſcourſe with one of the Colleagues of our <hi>London</hi> Colledge, whom he reported to me, that he found a vain empty bladder, puft only with wind, and who beſides his <hi>Hocus pocus</hi> Rhetorique applicable to his Art of jugling was a meer inſipid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:111543:143"/>their conference being concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aſtral Medicines, a thing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our reverend Doctor, that the name ſeemed to him to ſound like the title of an Exorciſm; he therefore able to ſay nothing to him either in way of oppoſition or for confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that he neither knew nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved any ſuch thing; at laſt (leſt he might ſeem able to ſay nothing to the purpoſe) concludes his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with this Rhodomontado, that he was able to get fifteen hundred pounds a year by his way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, tacitly quipping the other, in that he by his Aſtral Medicines (commended) was not able then to get one hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> To whom his Gentleman by way of reply objected, But how many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients do you cure for this money? was ſnapt up with a frowning check, as though that were an impertinent queſtion to be demanded of him that could and did get money, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:111543:144"/>to the Logick of that Tribe is to be the meaſure of mens attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and abilities.</p>
               <p>And that it may not ſeem beyond belief, how ſo much money may be diſtilled our of mens purſes in lieu of a ſmooth tale; the ſame Gentleman told me, that a Kinſman of his (an Alderman of this City, and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) had both told him, the one by way of complaint, the other by way of boaſting, that in ſhort time his Apothecaries Bill came to three hundred pounds, (to whom this fifteen hundred pound Doctor had been and ſtill is Phyſcian) and this in ſhort time, and in the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon no conſiderable diſtemper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken either himſelf, or Lady, or any of his family: now by the Apothecaries Bils, few men but can judge ſhrewdly at the Doctors Fees, &amp; if he be not a verier idiot then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his brethren, one of them three hundred pounds will come into his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:111543:144"/>pocket, which his Bils well deſerve for a trick that he both knowes, and probably practiſeth, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſome of his brethren do, and I know the trick likewiſe, and have hinted it elſewhere, and therefore ſhall leave it now.</p>
               <p>And we ſhall come to the true Art and method of Medicine, which although (through the ingrate ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the time and this Age to true diſcoveries of Nature) it prove not ſo lucriferous as the other, yet is it ſuch an Art, which is followed with wealth ſufficient for a Son of Art.</p>
               <p>True, the higheſt of a Son of Arts ambition and deſire is, to be able to attend future ſearches, and in the mean while to live as becomes a Philoſopher in mediocrity, (not ſuperfluity) and this without diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: whereas a Gooſquil Doctor, (accounting himſelf only a fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for Ladies) muſt go arrayed in choice ſilk, pluſh, and velvet, with
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:111543:145"/>a Ladies hand, and his Coach to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, if he but ſtir our of doors, and therefore muſt have larger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes to maintain this pomp.</p>
               <p>Yet I know that although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and ſpend whatever moneys I can borrow from my bare neceſſity, or at utmoſt my moſt abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, in Furnaces, Coals, and Glaſſes, with the Bee making Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but not for my ſelf, yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which through Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this induſtry hath brought, doth and will bring me, will make my name live, when the names of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, that bark and ſnarl at me, and load me with unworthy reproacher, ſhall lie buried in perpetual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.</p>
               <p>Let not then any think to ſcare me with the Rhodomontado of our forementioned fifteen hundred: pound Doctor <hi>(per annum)</hi> for when both we: ſhall come to give up our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to the great Judge, I know
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:111543:145"/>it will not be objected there as a crime to me, that I cure in a year al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, (if not altogether) as many Patients that are poor gratis, as he hath for his fifteen hundred pounds; that to others that are rich, I give both Medicins and counſel, asking nothing till the cure is performed, and then by ſome put off with little, and by ſome with nothing, becauſe my Medicaments are but little in quantity, and the cure (beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation), ſpeedily effected, and yet what ever I do get I lay out in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſcoveries, and all to do good to an ungrateful generation: oft times running in debt for conveniencies, and neceſſaries, and ſparing out of my belly to finde out new experiments in Medicine; and yet for all this get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on one hand hatred &amp; oppoſition, and on the other hand, contempt for performing cures ſo ſoon and cheap: yet I know that my reward will be a good name when I am gone, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:111543:146"/>from God hereafter, whereas they that expect no reward beyond their Fees, it is no marvel if they be ſo ſordid in raking them out of even the bowels of their diſtreſſed clients, in lieu of which they give them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmooth and fallacious language, and yet are highly eſteemed becauſe they cheat them with a grace, and put a high price upon their butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This! O this! cryes them up for brave fellowes, and makes them admired &amp; adored by the ſimpler ſort.</p>
               <p>And to ſay the truth, there is one thing which as ordered by them, and mude uſe of to their advantage, they blinde the eyes of the common poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple withall, and aſcribe very much to themſelves on that ſcore: and that is in Feavers, which diſeaſe, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly threatning the life, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mortal to very many, and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflictive to all that are viſited therewith, being accompanied with many ſad and perplexing accidents,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:111543:146"/>very grievous and troubleſome to be undergone, as violent thirſt, a tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heat and burning of the body cauſing reſtleſneſs, with pain or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the head, an oppreſſion at the ſtomack, with a dejected appetite, and a loathing of all meats, a diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh both of meats and drinks, with many other troubleſome and dangerous ſymptomes, rendring the life weariſome to the Patient, and in great hazard to the beholders.</p>
               <p>Theſe Symptomes though not alike troubleſome to each affected party, are ſcarce in the courſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence mortal to the third ſick feaveriſh man, ſince two in three Feavers, if wholly let alone, and the party attended only with careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would after the Criſis, end uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in health, though accompanied with much debilitation; but becauſe that this diſeaſe is not to be truſted, proving each year really mortal to many, by its exceeding troubleſome
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:111543:147"/>ſymptomes threatens death unto all, and therefore (becauſe experience hath taught the world for many Ages that there ia cure for diſeaſes attainable by Art) each ſick party taken ill in places where Doctors may be had, conſulteth with them, in hope of cure, though in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Villages, with far greater ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, they give parties that are taken ill, either a Roſemary, or a Carduus Poſſet, and ſo provoke ſweat, yea and in Cities, the poorer ſort, who cannot reach unto a Doctors Fee uſe the ſame courſe, by which means many Feavers very violent in ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes, thought not ſo deeply roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are ſpeedily extinguiſhed, but where the diſeaſe with this old wives Medicine will not be abated nor cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there the party, if poſſible, will make any ſhift, to get one of the more conſcionable Doctors, that is one who being of leſs note and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, will be content with leſs Fees,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:111543:147"/>rather then not be imployed, who going in the ſame rode with his cryed up Brethren, will be tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Cordials as the calleth them, and cooling Julips; by Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Veſications, Scarifications, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or the like, till he make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Feavers prove mortal by his Art, which otherwiſe attended only with care to keep them from the cold, and giving orderly meats and drink in ſeaſon, would be extinguiſhed of their own accord after the Criſis, and thoſe few Feavers, which by all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are not enraged even to death, nor yet by their cruel forbidding of Beer, and almoſt all drink, whereby the diſeaſe waſts the radical humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for want of due moiſture, yet are they made ſo dangerous that death is oft expected each hour, not only at the firſt criſis, but after, even to the twentieth, many times to the thirtieth day; during which time, the mouth being very foul, and oft
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:111543:148"/>ſore, the tongue black, the breath ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorous, the viſage repreſenting rather a ghoſt then a man ordained to life; the Doctor is attendant (if a rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient) twice, at leaſt once every day, and each time with an affected pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs appointing this or that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, or Lotion, or Julip, or Cordial, or Lenitive, or what elſe his phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie dictates, and in the pitch of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity ſliced Pigeons or Herrings are laid to the ſoles of the feet, and a preciſe diet commanded upon ſigns of mending: thus maugre the diſeaſe and the Doctor, through the good hand of God, and the benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature, the party eſcapes death, yet ſcare able to go boldly abroad in two, three, or four moneths, and perhaps through this ordering in cure, for an epilogue of his Feaver, contracts a Chronick diſeaſe, which leaves him not during life; this then is a cryed up, and a very notable cure, for which perhaps the Doctors
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:111543:148"/>(if a rich man) many being called to conſultation, ſhare an hundred or two pounds of his money, and the Apothecaries Bill amounting to half as much.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch a reputed cure as this (of which had they any grace, they ought to be as aſham'd as a School-boy of playing the trewant) they will boaſt much, and oppoſe themſelves by way of contempt againſt any Artiſt, as never having any ſuch cure.</p>
               <p>Truth, I grant that I never had any ſuch cure, and am therefore bound to give eternal thanks to God, who hath choſen me to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then that fordid, ungodly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable, butcher-like practice, by which I certainly, and ſafely, and ſpeedily cure that diſeaſe, with the Pleuriſie, and all Agues, even Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and Autumnal, yea Hyemal, without bloud-letting, or purging, without forbidding drink, nay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing both ſtrong Beer and Wine
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:111543:149"/>with moderation in Feavers of all ſorts, in Agues and in Pleuriſies, with ſmall curioſity in ordering the diet, and yet my patients ſoundly cured, without danger of relapſe, often at a doſe or two, moſt of all in three or four daies; Pleuriſies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured as ſoon; and Agues in one, two or three fits, in the ſpring and ſummer; and in the autumn or winter ſeldome exceeding five or ſix fits, and through Gods bleſſing the cure never miſſing, unleſs the Patient prove unruly and not ſubmit to, or fickle and ſo not abide in my dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Yet can I confidently affirm and make good, that I yearly cure more Feavers, Agues, and Pleuriſies, then any one in the <hi>Galenical</hi> way have in nigh twice the time; but my cures are too contemptible for the rich, Counſel and Medicine in almoſt two thirds of my cures ſcarce exceeding, ſometimes not amounting to a
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:111543:149"/>Crown, not one in forty riſing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an Angel.</p>
               <p>For many hundreds know and can teſtifie for me, that beſides my own cures, many both in City and Countrey practiſe by my medicines, to the cure and relief of ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands yearly, mine own practiſe in ſome years reaching to nigh two hundred Agues, as I can make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, with many more Feavers, Pleuriſies, Fluxes, and vomitings, of all which ſcarce five in a year not perfectly cured, and thoſe only ſuch who hearing of the ſudden effect of my medicines, ſend for ſome of them, and without obſerving the difference of ſeaſon of the year, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſame ſpeed in cure with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not finding the cure perfect, (although notably abated) are diſcouraged, and leave off, whoſe error herein is not to be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Medicine.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any thing to me of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:111543:150"/>or ought it to be to any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious man, that <hi>Galeniſts</hi> raſhly and impudently rail and crie out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chymicall Medicaments, and yet the moſt deſperate of all in that Art preparable, they have raviſhed into their Apothecaries Shops, and have accepted, and do own them, as ſworn ſervants to their method.</p>
               <p>Which charge if they deny, <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith Minerale, Mercuirius dulcis, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi> praecipitate ſeverall wayes, <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus metallorum, Antimonium Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticum, Stibium,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall be ſummoned in, to give teſtimony to their very faces, which are medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines unfit for an honeſt man to uſe, all ſave <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum,</hi> which is a trifle, being ſo oft burnt with Salt Peter, till it become an inſipid Calx, of very little vertue, in compariſon to wit, of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent virtue, and noble excellency which we boaſt of in <hi>Antimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:111543:150"/>
               <p>Therefore, courteous Reader, do not think, that we in commending the noble true Chymicall Medicines, do mean theſe raſcall, virulent, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribel Medicaments, but leave them to the Galenicall Tribe, <hi>(ut ſimiles labris lactucas)</hi> that with them they may fill up the meaſure of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and do here atteſt the ſupreme Judge of Heaven and Earth, that we both abhorre the uſe of them, and dehort all that are wiſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them, as dangerous poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>For we intend here abſolute inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, to ſpeak of Profeſſors, and of Medicines as they are, and not to plead for this ſpurious venemous Brat, becauſe it may ſeem to be a Chymicall Baſtard, but we diſown it wholly, as an off-ſpring of <hi>Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado,</hi> and fugitive Apoſtate Chymiſts, Mimicks adn Apes to true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, but not her legitimate Sonnes, the diſgrace of Art, and therefore
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:111543:151"/>fit to be marked with a black note of infamy.</p>
               <p>O fooliſh Doctors! who hath bewitched you, that you will not ſee, nor abide the truth? O ſilly and blind followers of theſe perverſe blind guides! how long will you be deceived? attend I pray you for your own good, to him who is ready to teach you better.</p>
               <p>Strange! Certainly a deep ſleep from God hath beſotted the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our wiſe men, ſince our Princes of <hi>Zoan</hi> in this one thing are fools, though in other things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute enough, whom ſo many loſt lives as yet cannot make wiſe, ſufficiently to diſtinguiſh between reality of truth and an Impoſture.</p>
               <p>Wo is me, that I am and muſt be in this thing a Sonne of Contention, and muſt contend with almoſt all the earth: ſure it is not for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward caſe and contentment, but it is even as a fire to my bowels; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:111543:151"/>ſince it is truth that is to be defended, to betray which in a cauſe of ſo high concernment (as the lives of thouſands) were ſo high an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to God, who hath diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the myſteries of nature to me, (bleſſed be his name) that I might juſtly fear not only the deprivement of this Talent, but the other doom of the unprofitable Servant, the dread of whoſe exemplary puniſhment doth compell me thus to bring my Talent in to the Bank, and expoſe what God hath diſcovered to me, to the view and cenſure of a captious gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of whom I expect reproach, diſdain and contumelie full meaſure, and heaped, yet is there a certain number of the ſonnes of Wiſdom, from whom I ſhall receive both thanks and encouragement.</p>
               <p>For whoſe information and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction fake, we ſhall in a brief diſcourſe, ſo elucidate the nature of true medicine, as to make it appear
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:111543:152"/>to any one whom paſſion or folly, or ſelf-conceitedneſſe hath not blinded, to be a moſt ſafe, ſpeedy and certain way of curing diſeaſes, which three things are required in all Medicines, promiſed to be in the Galenicall and Pſeudochemicall, but to be found only in the true Pyrotechnicall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</p>
               <p>So then, by this our art of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which we commend, we know, and promiſe the cure of all diſeaſes accidentall to the body of man, ſpeedily, ſafely, and certainly, and do affirm our Medicines to have an adaequate virtue in them to this end, which we ſhall make good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the mean time our adverſaries in oppoſition to ſnarle till they crack their ſpleen.</p>
               <p>And for the Readers information, I muſt give him an account, that my purpoſe is here to give things as in a ſmall Mappe, and to repreſent them as it were in a Land-skip, very can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:111543:152"/>though conciſely, very lively, though as at a little diſtance.</p>
               <p>Firſt then let no man expect from me linear receipts, for that would be fooliſh in me to perform, and therefore fond in them to expect; for I ſhall not write of trifles, but of commanding <hi>Arcanaes,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be diſcovered in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Magi,</hi> leſt fools and Mechaniſts, bring theſe ſo noble ſecrets into common Shops, to be adulterated as all their Chymical fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries are.</p>
               <p>Which pitiful hotch-potch had its roiginall from rare ſecrets of Art, although through ignorance and miſapprehenſion of dult, lazy heads, and ſearchers, they are under the ſame names with thoſe renowned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come raſcally venemous dangerous ſlops as they are adulterately, and knaviſhly prepared for ſale, and according to the allowed Receipts of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:111543:153"/>vulgar <hi>Tyrociniſts</hi> and <hi>Pharmacopaa's,</hi> they are at the beſt either dangerous, as having only a mock (in ſtead of a due and true) preparation, as the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, Salivative, and purgative preparations of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> or trivial, as the commonly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirits of Salts, the <hi>Alcalies,</hi> waters and Oyls of Concretes vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: to which may be added the newfound ſilly dotages of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sophiſters, as the <hi>Ignis vita</hi> of one, the univerſall Medicine of another idle <hi>Scioliſt;</hi> the one, the product of Soot, the other of Mens bones rotted, whoſe raſh ventoſities and aery promiſes we reject as apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <hi>Renegado</hi> cheats in Art, under the viſard or mask of Chymiſtry, as <hi>Allen</hi> the notable Theef, is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have rob'd in a Coach with his Complices, under the diſguiſe of a Biſhop with his Attendants.</p>
               <p>Of this I have given caution, and ſpoken ſufficiently, in a Treatiſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:111543:153"/>concerning this Art of Medicine, intituled, <hi>The Art and myſtery of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotechny, taught, and illuſtrated.</hi> Then which Tractate the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſaw a plainer, and only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the fountain of experience, which I purpoſe to beſtow as a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon the Sons of this Art, as I finde this gets acceptance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not repeat here what is fully delivered and made plain there.</p>
               <p>However as I hinted, our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venal <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> is a Fairy changeling intruded upon the world, for the ſweet oyl or Ladanum of Mercury, fixt as gold, and ſweet as hony (in its firſt fixation) which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollated, is <hi>Paracelſus Arcanum Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallinum,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Mercurius proecipitatus dulcis,</hi> which by coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation with the fire of Hell, (that is, the Alchaheſt) becomes volatile, and ſweet like hony; and withall being anodynous, is called <hi>Ladanum Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii,</hi> and not ſeldom <hi>Mercurius dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:111543:154"/>which can never be revived to Mercury again, but by the ſame Art which would revive gold, and diſcover its central Mercurial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity.</p>
               <p>I need not inſtance in other mock mimical preparations falſly obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the world, for <hi>Paracelſus</hi> never ſufficiently to be commended Secrets, as <hi>Mercurius vitae, Aurum vatae,</hi> Magiſteries of Pearls and Jemmes, their quinteſſences of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which comparing their either deſperate efficacy, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous languidneſs, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Arcanaes of thoſe names, he may ſay with the Poet,
<q>Spectatum admiſsi riſum teneatis amici?</q>
Being a true embleme of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains travel, or the ſhearing of hogs, the one after infinite expectation, producing a ſilly mouſe, the others.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:111543:154"/>after the Proverb, making a foul ſqueaking for a little wool.</p>
               <p>I know that the <hi>Galenical</hi> Tribe will whine and hone pitifully, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then loſe to be reputed Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts; nay if we may believe them, they have prepared for them the choiceſt of Chymical preparations, and ſome pretend to very great ſhare in the skill of this Art them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If ſo, I am glad, for to ſuch I may addreſs my ſelf, as a Brother, and without vanity let me ſpeak it, ſuch a one of whom the beſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſed in that way of Pyrotechny, may not be aſhamed of: for though I am low and vile ſufficiently in my own eyes, yet when I muſt give a true teſtimony concerning my indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, my ſearches, and my attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the glory of God may it be ſpoken, I have learned practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand both <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> and know what they write to be true; and though I am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:111543:155"/>nothing, yet when the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> come to vie their mock Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, with that which God hath made me to underſtand by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> through the tutorage, and under the ferula of the fire, then as <hi>Paul</hi> when conteſting with the falſe Brethren and Pſeudo-apoſtles, would not give way to them one jot; no more ſhal I, foraſmuch as I do contend and ſtand up for truth it ſelf, and do not fight nor am engaged in any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal quarrel.</p>
               <p>Thanks be to God then, that I fall not ſhort in mine underſtanding of ought of the Arcanaes of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> through the bleſſing of him who choſe me before many who excel me far in parts in the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> Tribe: in which reſpect, not tranſgreſſing the bounds of modeſty, confeſſing what ever I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have been from above, I ſhall yet be more confident, and do affirm
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:111543:155"/>that the Chymiſtry of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Tribe is a ridiculous partly, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous Empericiſm, in ſtead of ſo commendable a Method and Art, as they with confidence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence ſufficient boaſt it to be; and thought I am ol my ſelf a weak and unworthy perſon, to combate with ſuch an army of Philiſtims, yet as they once fell before <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armourbearer; ſo ſhall as many as oppoſe me, fall before the truth which I ſtand up for, but they have forſaken, and now perſecute and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. When it was firſt told me that very many of our Colledge Doctors did pretend to Chymiſtry and to Furnaces, think you that I envied them for my own ſake? No verily, but I did then, and do now wiſh, that not only ſome, but all of them might equall, nay exceed both <hi>Paracolſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> ſo would much good be done, yet would not I be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of bringing ſuch a thing into
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:111543:156"/>practice, far be it from me (even to think ſo) for God will be the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of theſe Talents to the worlds end, nor hath he left my ſpirit free but abſolutely bound up in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whereby I know that yet theſe things ſhall be hid, and that concerning theſe things between me and the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> will be many ſharp conflicts, but I ſhal and muſt prevail, and ſhall both by argument and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, batter down not only their old way, of which I ſpake in my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetical part ſufficiently, but alſo this new way of Mimical Chymiſtry, which they preſume (being added to the other) may prove to their ſafe ſtanding, as an high wall about a Caſtle or Town, I ſhall lay flat to the ground, and the ruine of this rotten (though patcht up, and gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly garniſhed) fabrick will be great.</p>
               <p>The various providences of God and diſpenſations toward me, are a ſure earneſt to me, and confirmation
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:111543:156"/>of my ſpirit that I am reſerved to, and preſerved for more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imployment in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>Let us come then to the true Art of healing, which is the right and only teſt for comparing, and trying our skill, it being the beſt way, to have the workman judged by his work.</p>
               <p>How long will the world hang be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two opinions? If the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> way be the truth, let it be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, if not, let it fall, and be brought to ruine.</p>
               <p>Some mightily addicted to the common way, and withall, my very good friends, have ſpoken to me from the dictates of ſome <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> how eaſily my way might be reconciled to the other, to the making up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, that which is defective in each, my Medicines, to wit, with an able <hi>Galeniſts</hi> Method, being judged a mixture convenient to make up a moſt admirable Art of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:111543:157"/>
               <p>This hath been ſpoken aloud to me by many who were cordial friends to me, as a wiſe courſe to be taken; which counſel proceeded (as I ſaid) from ſome <hi>Galeniſs,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Tribe of Gooſquil Piſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophets, who finding my Cures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond cavil, and my Medicaments ſo ſafe, as to admit of no jealouſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, uſed this as a crafty way of leſſening my repute, to make as though they had an Art, by which they in their method (as they call it) could do much more then I did or could do, with the ſame things, as for want of method being to ſeek of the moſt ſafe and effectual uſe of my own Medicines, which without Art, were accidental with me (as ſometimes choice ſecrets may be found with old women). This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion having faſtned upon the ſpirits of my immovably favouring friends, to others they pretend no difference between my medicines and theirs,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:111543:157"/>but that theirs are the ſafer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or at leaſt that my Medicines are no others then ſuch as all of them know, and uſe.</p>
               <p>So then they who (where they cannot allow me leſs) will only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me (habnab) experimental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, caſually gotten, without Art, for methodical applying the ſame, they to others will allow me nothing but what may be common to any Mountebank, or Emperick, and ſo they confidently, and (would ſeem to think) conſcionably ſtyle me.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore come to take a brief view or ſurvey of Diſeaſes in their right way of natural cures, that ſo we may opportunely make an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly eſſay of Medicines, ſuch to wit, which deſerve that name, and are not Ironically, or Antiphraſtically named ſo.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> (ſo cryed up) Method, we ſhall diſcover it to be a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi> a groundleſs opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:111543:158"/>which to the coſt of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lives hath gotten reputation in the world, through the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and the penal blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this particular of moſt (if not all) of the wiſe men in all Nations, and civilized (eſpecially Chriſtian) Countreys.</p>
               <p>For Medicine is ſo named (<hi>a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> from healing) and imports as much as that it is an Art ſhewing Medicaments that have ſufficient effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy for the ſubduing and taking away any diſeaſe or diſtemper to which the life of mortal man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their inabilities, have ſince the invention of the cheat of their (eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where declaimed) Method, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the name (<hi>medendi,</hi> of healing by Medicines) to the notion (<hi>curandi,</hi> of taking care of the ſick, or uſing their trifling diligence) by their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore boldly ſet foot to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:111543:158"/>foot, and fairly come to Corniſh-hug with the Gooſquil champions, and let us ſee whether of us two will be the ſtrongeſt, nor doubt I before I have done to give them a fair fall.</p>
               <p>Is our Art (as I have declared) in its primitive verity, and reality, <hi>Medicinae Ars,</hi> the Art of healing, <hi>non curationis,</hi> not of taking care only of the ſick? (as our modern Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have found out a new word) then let us ſee how each of us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this, and this we ſhall inſtance firſt in the moſt common and ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly tranſient, and then in the more unuſual Chronick diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the Feaver in its ſeveral kinds, of which I gave even now a brief touch, and ſhall here more largely inſiſt, and yet in as few lines as may be, becauſe I intend this only as a ſmall map of many things, to repreſent them together here in a brief Chapter, which in diſtinct Treatiſes I have handled ſeverally,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:111543:159"/>and largely enough in ſeveral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters elſewhere, all which Tractates, (being troubleſom enough to me to digeſt into that method they are in, but more troubleſom, nay toylſom and chargeable to me to get that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience out of which I then wrote, and do here write) I ſhall God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting make publick, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſuch who have given up their names to Art, ſo ſoon as I ſhall finde what entertainment this little Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate ſhall finde in the world: For after this Apologetical Diſcourſe hath brought me word what recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it finds, I reſolve <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſend out ſeveral Eſſays upon <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi> diſcoveries, and in particular upon that concerning Feavers, the Gout, and the Dropſie, that ſo the common whine may be taken away from the <hi>Galeniſts, (viz.)</hi> that the <hi>Helmontian</hi> Sect only beat down but do not build up; labour what they can to ruine the old way, never
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:111543:159"/>taking care to introduce a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>To proceed at preſent with our begun diſcourſe concerning the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a ſad, comfortleſs, truculent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, then which there is none more mortal, inſomuch that according to the common Adagy, <hi>Nemo ſine fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri moritur:</hi> which to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is a poſition more ſubtle then true; yet it ſpeaks aloud, the ſad univerſal afflictive nature of that diſeaſe; of which it is truly ſaid, that it is an epidemical diſeaſe, no Nation in which yearly (at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year) there are not ſad examples of its mortal rigor and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and therefore ought much to employ the ſtudies of ſuch who have given up their names to Medicine, to finde out certain remedies for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſaddeſt of all Feavers, the Peſtilence (called by a general name, the Plague among us) as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:111543:160"/>and not without cauſe, the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of temporal plagues: that I ſhall paſſe over at preſent in ſilence, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having (to my knowledge) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in that diſeaſe, though of Feavers commonly known by the name of peſtilential Feavers, and judged to be a degree of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence it ſelf, I have known and cured many, and thoſe with as much eaſe, ſpeed and certainty as any other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feaver; nor ſhould I doubt, if it ſhould ſeem good to God to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit us with that waſhing calamity, (which my daily prayers ſhall be againſt) but to reſtore it ſpeedily, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and ſafely, provided the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe had not prevailed unto deſpair before I took it in hand. But from the opportunity of trial what my Medicines, will do in this particular, I deſire God would ſtill be pleaſed to keep me, yet ſo confident I am in ſuch medicines that I know I ſhould not fear (if occaſion were)
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:111543:160"/>to adventure the viſitation of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as I could poſſibly relieve by my preſence and help.</p>
               <p>Next to the peſtilence under this head of Feavers may be reckoned the ſmall Pox, which are indeed no other then a very malignant ſort of Feaver, ſo reckoned by <hi>Fernelius</hi> as able a Doctor as ever the Academies afforded, and <hi>Sennertus</hi> alſo of no leſs fame and repute.</p>
               <p>This kinde of Feaver ſo baffles Phyſcians, that Nurſes and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives are more generally conſulted with and relied upon in this caſe then Doctors, and they when ever conſulted herein, become at the beſt ridiculous, and deſervedly; nor are they often made uſe of in ſuch caſes, unleſs where the beauty of ſome young Nymph or Adonis lies at ſtake, there is the Doctor adviſed, though able to perform leſs then an ordinary Nurſe, which common people know, and therefore never
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:111543:161"/>trouble the Doctor in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>Bloud-letting, and purging in this condition are deſperate dotages, and ſeldome expiated with ought but death, on which ſcore Sir <hi>Theodore Mayherne</hi> is reported unwittingly to have kill'd his Son-in-law intended, a juſt reward for a butcherlike Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomiſt.</p>
               <p>Severall upon my knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blouded by the Doctors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the the beginning of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe (being miſtaken by them for an or dinary Feaver) have paid the price of the Doctors folly with their lives.</p>
               <p>And as for purgatives, the Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-pipe family themſelves dare not not preſcribe them after two or three daies in any violent continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till the febrile matter be digeſted, that is, till nature hath overcome the diſeaſe, and then they come after all with the <hi>Iriſh man</hi> to kill a man by cutting off his legs, becauſe his head
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:111543:161"/>was cut off before; but as for the caſe of the ſmall Pox, it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known to every Midwife and Nurſe, that a lask is therein lethal, that upon the appearing thereof, they do give over the party for loſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by reſtrictives, the looſneſs may be ſtopt, and unleſs that be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (if the party affected be full of thoſe <hi>variolae,</hi> which the Pox ſends forth) certain death follows. The ſame in peſtilential Feavers is evident, where phlebotomy &amp; purgatives are very dangerous, nay deſperate, by w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>h it may be ſtrongly concluded, that if in the Plague, the Smal pox, and Peſtilential Feavers, phlebotomy, a looſe belly, and cooling drinks are of very bad conſequence, ſo to wit, as to cauſe death in many, to indanger life in all, that then the ſame things can not in reaſon be of good effect in any Feaver, which brings me by the hand to the diſcovery of my method and Medicines for the cure of this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:111543:162"/>diſeaſe, the better to compare it with the way commonly practiſed, by which both of them the better may be judged of, and cenſured.</p>
               <p>For Feavers are of ſundry ſorts, either continual or intermittent. The continual are various, of which the ſaddeſt is the Plague, next the Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, next the peſtilential Feaver, next the malignant, which is ſcarlet, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which may be reckoned the Pleuriſie, which is a real ſort of Feaver, more violent by reaſon of an Apoſtemated matter threatned in the ſide, of which it hath its denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, this accompanied with a cough, and ſpitting of bloud, with a tormenting pain, is thought incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without Phlebotomy, and ſo the vulgar are perſwaded by Doctors and Chirurgeons, though very falſly.</p>
               <p>Intermittent Feavers are of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts, either Ephemerial, or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, or Quartan, of which the two
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:111543:162"/>laſt ſorts are either ſingle or dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: and laſtly there is the Erratick intermittent Feaver, called by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus (Febris extranea)</hi> of all which are ſo many appearances, that it would require a large Treatiſe to deſcribe all the kinds of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>But as for the cure, (or rather the way and means of reſtoring this kinde of diſeaſe) therein the <hi>Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Tribe and I differ very much, we only agree in the names and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes of the ſame, concerning which, let it not be objected that I leave out the names of Feavers Hemitritean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince it is not my deſign in this place to make a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anatomy of that diſeaſe, in its kindes, according to its various Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes (performed both learnedly, and acurately by many <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> as <hi>Fernelius</hi> and others, who being profeſſed Methodiſts, were yet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourers of Chymical Medicaments
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:111543:163"/>as their writings do teſtifie) which were a work of a peculiar Tractate to perform.</p>
               <p>And to ſay truth, the diſeaſe is ſufficiently known, being ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſo truculent, that not only a Doctor, but each ordinary Nurſe can tell when a man or woman is Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, although to know certainly the kinde of each Feaver is a task ſometimes too hard for a profeſſed Doctor, and yet that may be known and the diſeaſe as far from cure as before; therefore well ſaid he who ſang thus:
<q>Non opus eſt morbi teſtibus, at medice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To the certain, ſafe, and ſpeedy cure of which malady I ſhall now come, and that not perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great expectation, which I ſhall do my endevour to anſwer to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous readers ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>In order to which task, I ſhall
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:111543:163"/>premiſe ſome poſitions by way of Aphoriſm very true and certain, however contrary to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed way of the Schools.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the heat which appears in ſome, nay moſt Feavers, is not originally from the nature of the Feaver.</p>
               <p>This appears firſt in intermittent Feavers, (commonly known by the name of Agues among us) in which the cold fit in each acceſs, is oft the moſt afflictive part of the diſtemper, and torments with a violent thirſt, yet without any ſenſible heat. But nextly, all malignant Feavers, (ſome more, ſome leſs) begin with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible internal cold, and a quivering or ſhaking withall, after which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes burning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Caſtrenſian</hi> or Camp Feavers (a kinde of Feaver but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known among mankind) from the beginning of them to the end of their Tragedy, are without either
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:111543:164"/>thirſt or heat, and yet as truculent as any malignant Feaver whatever.</p>
               <p>Adde to this, that all Feavers when they draw towards a concluſion abate of their heat, although the diſeaſe be more violent then as draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to death.</p>
               <p>To which agrees that the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of old perſons, and ſuch who are of very weak decayed bodies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt far leſs heat and burning, then far milder Feavers do in ſtrong vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous bodies, and luſty conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that leads me to the ſecond concluſion or Aphoriſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the more ſenſible the party affected is of heat, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the more ſtrength he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to have, and the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of his recovery.</p>
               <p>For it is the Archeus of the life, whence this rage proceeds, being provoked by ſome accidental mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whence the firſt offence doth ariſe, or from ſome Ideal character
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:111543:164"/>inſtamped upon the ſeat of life, or ſome near adjoyning ſympathizing part, either by mean of a virulent endemical fume, or exhalation, or of ſome paſſion of the minde, which by its tyrannical impreſſion doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the ſeat of life, that is its own original habitation, (the ſoul and life being originally ſeated in one and the ſame part) whence is cauſed this or that diſeaſe, according as the paſſive part doth receive the injury.</p>
               <p>For it is not neceſſary that a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould finde alway an occaſional matter ready prepared, ſince it is evident, that grief, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have power to give originall being to this diſeaſe, and ſo an eminent cold (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after being throughly warm) which without controverſie only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Archeus, by inſtamping an unuſual Character on its place of habitation, and ſo conſequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low febrile excrements, which had not being before.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:111543:165"/>
               <p>The vital Archeus, is that Vulcan in man, which doth ſtir up and feed that heat of life, which from the firſt hour of life till death goes never our, which in health is orderly and regular, but being provoked, rageth according to the known rule,
<q>
                     <l>Idem agens laeſus edit actiones laeſas,</l>
                     <l>qui ſanus, edit actiones ſanas.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Proportionable therefore to the proviſion for life, is the virtue and ſtrength of the Archeus, whoſe rage in burning in Feavers, is nothing elſe but a gathering together its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to expell its adverſary, that is, to blot out that character, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold or virulent fumes, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the minde have inſtamped on its place of habitation, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the ſtrength of nature is the burning in ſuch caſes, and this leads me to my third concluſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That bloud-letting and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cooling drinks, are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:111543:165"/>waies to be uſed by him that pretends to cure Feavers.</p>
               <p>For Nature only is the immediate helper both of Feavers and all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which aſſail the life primarily and in their firſt intention, now if the proviſion for life, be the ſubject cauſe of heat in Feavers, what ever is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded primarily againſt heat, muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn the ſubject principle of life, and this is the maſter-piece of the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> method, namely to take part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature to whoſe help alone they are called by the ſick Patient.</p>
               <p>That the life is in the bloud is moſt certain, and by how much of it is taken away, by ſo much is the vitall Balſam waſted, and therefore very unwiſely taken away, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe may be cured without: and that leads me to the fourth Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all Feavers, Agues, and Plureſies, may be cured without Phlebotomy.</p>
               <p>In the Plague, Small Pox, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:111543:166"/>peſtilential Feavers, the queſtion by our Antagoniſts will be yeelded, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year affording ſad preſidents of <hi>Galeniſts</hi> dotages in this kinde, as I inſtanced before in that great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Sir <hi>Theodore Mayherne,</hi> and could inſtance in above forty, that my ſelf have known and obſerved, and that very lately, but in the Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie it will be a great controverſie, becauſe without bloud-letting that diſeaſe is commonly reputed dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without hope or help, although that opinion be altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and falſe.</p>
               <p>Truth, the Pleureſie is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Feaver, with a Spaſmus or Convulſion of the ſide (eſpecially the left) among the ribs, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the heart, this accompanied with the Cough, doth make a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible dilaceration in that place, and that cauſeth extravenate bloud, and that threatning apoſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, indangers the ſuffocation of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:111543:166"/>party affected, without a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, foraſmuch as extravenate bloud in ſuch a heat, will not be long uncorrupted, but that the proper, ſpeedy and adequate remedy of this grief is bloud-letting that I deny.</p>
               <p>That by bleeding in the beginning this diſeaſe findes mitigation by mean of the revulſion or diverſion made thereby I grant, and yet this notwithſtanding phlebotomy is a dangerous often, deſperate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, alwaies a prejudicial preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption (be the preſcriber who he will) which hath its abſolute inſeparable inconveniencies annexed to it, and following it, on which ſcore it is not a remedy for an honeſt man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply or preſcribe.</p>
               <p>That an eminent fright will take away not only Agues, but other more deeply rooted and Chronick diſeaſes, is a thing very well known to many, and would be believed by more, yet the practiſe of that way of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:111543:167"/>cure hitherto hath not, and I preſume never will prevail in the world.</p>
               <p>At that ſad fire by Gunpowder in Tower-ſtreet, I heard of many cured of rigorous maladies, by being put in a ſudden fright to run for their lives, and many on the fright ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and there firſt took the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of thoſe diſeaſes which after proved mortall to them, and many mothers miſcarried, and many women fell into uterine (and thoſe terrible) paſſions: the like in other frights may be inſtanced, as in taking of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns, unexpected alarms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which caſes, many have riſen from their ſick beds, and come from their ſick chambers, and fought ſtoutly for their lives, and loſt their diſeaſe they knew not how, others contracted diſeaſes of which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before were ſenſible, and of which afterwards they have never been rid.</p>
               <p>For to ſay truth, a diſeaſe is moſt
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:111543:167"/>of all the fury of the indignation of the Archeus, which finding a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual character impreſſed on its place of habitation, ſtraight rages, and acts in its fury beyond all rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (this is the diſeaſe) whereas that fury being pacified, the product Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can finde waies to evacuate with eaſe, and the character impreſſed (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but tranſient) would abide but a ſhort time (as the ſmell of garlick in the breath of him that eats it) only the Archeus growing mad, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its habitation unfit to be indured with that odious Idea, ſets all on fire, producing a real miſery (from it ſelf effectively) on apprehenſion of a conceived injury ſo verifying the Proverb, <hi>Nemo laeditur niſià ſeipſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the life dwelling in the bloud, and the balſam of life being contained therein, the taking of this away doth threaten ruine to the life, and ſo conſequently to the Archeus, which is but its immediate ſervant,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:111543:168"/>by which fear it is oft taken from its fury, to the abatement of Symptomes ſpeedily, after which ſometimes the <hi>Archeus</hi> repents of its former fury and madneſs, and ſo by accident this evil of the loſing bloud produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth health, ſometimes when the danger threatned by loſs of bloud is over, the Archeus returns to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fury, and afflicts, though not altogether with its former rigor, (the principle of life being waſted) yet ſo as to delude afterward the vain Art of the Doctor, and for its Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue ends in a Tabes, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> who laies down for a maxim, <hi>Pleuretici niſi reſtaurentur intra qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragenarian fiunt Tebifici.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But admit the cure were certain, by bleeding (as it is not) yet is it not to be practiſed by an ingenuous man, ſince at the beſt it cures only by accident, and that by fear of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger, drawing or rather forcing the Archeus out of its rage and fury,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:111543:168"/>by which means the threed of life is cut ſhorter, by waſting its ſubject in which it is kept, and by which it is maintainied, eſpecially if it may be certainly, ſpeedily, and ſafely cured and the bloud preſerved, which is a thing promiſed by <hi>Paracelſus, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, &amp;c.</hi> and performable by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that are preparable by the Art of Pyrotechny, of which I ſhall by and by give an account to the ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and judicious Reader. I ſhall have don in this place with Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, becauſe elſewhere I ſhall have occaſion to ventilate it, only this I ſhall ſay, that it is an inhumane bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous butchery, becauſe ſo much bloud as is taken away, ſo much is cut off from the threed of life, and ſo the Doctor becomes Journeyman to <hi>Atropos,</hi> cutting ſhort the life of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by the rules of his Art, or at leaſt impairing their ſtrength, which art ſo magnified is at the beſt but a dotage, becauſe that where ever it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:111543:169"/>is uſed with ſhew of gooth ſucceſſe, and colour of neceſſity, there I know the cure may be performed without loſs of one drop of bloud, and ſo I come to examine purgatives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I ſhall propound a fifth Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That no purge (<hi>quatenus</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging) is an intentional remedy againſt a Feaver, or Pleureſie, nor Vomiting (as a vomit).</p>
               <p>For Purges (properly ſo called, or rather improperly) are abſolute ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomes confounded by the Art, (ſometimes with a little knavery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) of the Apothecary, and ſo preſcribed ignorantly by the Doctor, and taken unſucceſſefully by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p>Theſe in the Plague, Small Pox, and malignant Feavers, after the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Symptomes with rigor, are like fiends that muſt be conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down till another ſeaſons, that is, till the matter be digeſted, or rather
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:111543:169"/>in other words, till nature hath foiled the diſtemper, then comes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to play both the fool and knave with his rules of Art, and preſcribes his lenitives, &amp; gentle purges, for fear leſt the party ſhould ſeem to recover without his help, &amp; before this (white purges are too deſperate) he diviſeth a Clyſter, which trade almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old wife hath got from him, who now a daies, can preſcribe Clyſters as confidently, and as wel as the Doctor.</p>
               <p>Here the Apothecary, who in this caſe is groom of the cloſe ſtool, is as buſie as a cut purſe, on which ſcore I heard of one, who had his holiday face and band ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by one of his Patients, for want of a better retentive faculty in his hinder parts: I could wiſh all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior-fumblers ſo ſerved, to teach them a little more wit, while they pretend to ſo much judgement and skill.</p>
               <p>Purges then (and juſtly) we reject as dangerous febrile medicaments,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:111543:170"/>at ſome times, or rather deſperate, alwaies (as purges) intended to the deſtruction, rather of the man, then of his diſeaſe, of which not without cauſe ſaid the noble <hi>Helmont, Reus ſim coram Deo, niſi prorſus ſuaſero à purgantibus abſtinendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for Clyſters, they are the filly <hi>Non plus ultra's</hi> of our Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prognoſticators, a dotage that it is enough to name it, when to wit, the Doctor by his information, findes a diſtemper in the head, ſtomack, ſpleen, or kidneys, of the ſick or ill affected Patient, he by his profound Art findes out this remedy: The Apothecary is ordered to make a caudle for the Arſe-gut, this luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm is tyed up in a bladder, not without ſome ſuperſtition, for fear ſome wind be tyed up with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and ſo through a ſmall pipe it is conveyed up at the fundament, with promiſe in ſome caſes of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful efffects. O brave Doctors! O
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:111543:170"/>ſweet Method! This, O this! is one of the maiin pillars of your ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red method, and as univerſal a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription as any next to diet, to which it is not in ferior for its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general application, whence you may worthily the ſtiled the Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-pipe family or tribe.</p>
               <p>In defence of Purgatives, I know much may and will be ſaid, and that partly from experience, and partly from be writing of the <hi>Adepti;</hi> I ſhall therefore not paſs over that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many ingenious men may be concerned in the Reſolution of it.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the <hi>Arcanum Coralli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which is <hi>Paracelſus Diacelta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſon,</hi> and is Mercury precipitated by mean of the Liquor Alchaheſt, and corallated by the water of whites of Egges, and is purgative by ſiege, and a moſt certain cure for all Feavers, Agues, Pleureſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea the Hectique it perfectly reſtores, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Dropſies, with all Ulcers inward
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:111543:171"/>and outward, and the venereal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, with the Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and its operation is purgative, and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and conſtantly, ſo long only as the patient is ill, and no longer.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that firſt it cures not (<hi>quatenus</hi> purging by ſiege) for the Horizontal gold, which is the ſame eſſentially with the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corallated, cures all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned diſtempers yet without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by ſtool, and the ſame doth the <hi>Ladanum</hi> or ſweet oyle of Mercury (which is <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> true <hi>Ladanum</hi> without <hi>Opium</hi>) which is only Mercury cohobated ſo oft and long by that fiery liquor, till it be all made volatile, and then the ſweet oyle or tincture of the Sulphur ſeparated from the ceneral Mercury, is the <hi>Ladanum</hi> of Mercury curing univerſally all diſeaſes (<hi>in tono uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſono</hi>) as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſpeaks, yet without purging by ſiege. So then this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative virtue that is in this, <hi>(Coral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:111543:171"/>Mercurii)</hi> is a ſpecifick power given to it from God, by which it looſeth the belly, not promiſcuouſly, but only to ſick parties, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo long as the diſeaſe remains, but it is not on that ſcore that it cures the Gout, Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by virtue of its reſolutive power, by which it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates all the digeſtions which are capable of excrements, &amp; reſolves all preternatural Coagulation, in what place ſoever it is, as alſo all extrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated bloud, which after by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar priviledge, it cauſeth to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by ſtool, and ſometimes by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which is accidental to the cure.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Panacaea, which I know, and is a certain cure for Agues, Feavers, and Plcureſie, and is only purgative by ſiege; for obtaining which, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that I am acquainted with have been long courting Nature in vain, the effect of curing ſuch and ſuch diſeaſes is not to be attributed to the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:111543:172"/>purgative quality, but that is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent following the effect of cure, not neceſſarily as its cauſe; for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative virtue may be taken away in this Panacaea, and it made an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Diaphoretick with no leſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, (rather greater) then while it had a ſolutive virtue.</p>
               <p>Yet here by the way take notice of a true or right Purge, it is not like to Scammony, Colocynthida, Jalap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>(intuitu veneni)</hi> work promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly on all that ſhall take them (diſeaſed or no) for a true Purge, of which a Son of Art need not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, will never purge ought from a ſound body, but work only on ſuch as are diſeaſed, and that only ſo long as the diſeaſe laſts; ſuch is the <hi>Diaceltateſſon</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and ſuch is this Panacaea of Antimony of which I now ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the purging vegetable poyſons, commonly known by the name of Purges, their
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:111543:172"/>name contains a meer impoſture, and their manner of working deceives many (and thoſe learned and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) men.</p>
               <p>For they by their fermental viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency do infect the bowels, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of their hoſtility, do weep forth their nutritive moiſture, together with the Latex (alwaies at command on ſuch an occaſion) which receiving the venemous impreſſion, are by the heat of the body cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verated, and caſt forth in various colours, according as the nature of the poyſon is. This with gripings of the bowels, and a nauſeous ſickneſs at the ſtomack, is the effect of the commonly named purges, or rather poyſons (for ſo they are indeed) and this is a main pillar of the pompous fabrick of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſo adored Method.</p>
               <p>For it is natural, not only to the bowels, but to all the exquiſitely ſenſible parts, if offended to weep
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:111543:173"/>forth a large quantity of moiſture, to waſh away that character or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made, as the eyes by ſmoke, the noſe by ſternutatories, the mouth by Pellitory, and ſo the ſtomack and bowels by Aſarum, Colocyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thida, Jalap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which moiſture is partly the Latex (ready at call) and partly the alimentary humour of the part offended, and the judgement gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the excrements ſo rejected, is as ſottiſh as if a man ſhould throw pepper or ſalf into a mans eyes, and then bleſs himſelf to ſee how they water, which if let alone would have been well enough.</p>
               <p>So that the matter caſt forth by excrement, is not what was before in the body, but what was at the time made by the poyſon; and if ought chance to be avoided which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excrementitious, it is by meer accident, it being he nature of the poyſon given, to work only on what is vital, with which of ought that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:111543:173"/>was offenſive be caſt out, let not the Doctor boaſt of that, for being but accidental, and ſo hazardable, ſo great miſchief as is threatned by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poyſon into the body, is not to be adventured, in hopes of a caſual good.</p>
               <p>But moreover I ſhall give the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Reader to underſtand, that in many vegetable Simples under the mask of virulency, great and noble virtues are hidden, which are kept by the poyſonous appearance from raſh hands, as the apples of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperides</hi> were feigned to be kept by a watchful Dragon; or as the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Tree of life, was guarded by a flaming ſword in the hand of Cherubims.</p>
               <p>Thus in Hellebore under the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh vomitive poyſon cauſed with convulſion both of ſtomach and nerves, is hidden a moſt noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Hypocondriack melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, the Gout, Epilepſie, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:111543:174"/>and quartian or third day Ague, which ſo baffles Phyſicians, that it is grown to a proverb,
<q>Quartanam neſcit medicus propellere febrim.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So in Colocynthida under the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xative venome is hidden an excellent febrifuge: ſo in Aſarum roots, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remedy for ſlow lingring Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and ſo I could inſtance in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um and many other Simples.</p>
               <p>But he that thinks that the vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, laxative, or deleterial qualities in theſe ſimples, are the effective cauſes of the good done by them, is miſtaken, but they are only as a clog to a maſtiffe, or as a ſheath to a ſharp ſword, by which their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is not only held back, but alſo notably perverted by this dangerous companion, inſomuch that nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring the malignant virulency, doth not admit oft times of the remedy
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:111543:174"/>although ſomething in ſtrong conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, where the poyſon cannot make that impreſſion, which in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker bodies it would, the vertue of the concrete through the cloud of its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, doth yeeld ſome irradiation of its ſpecifick benignity, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing a diſeaſe, which through Gods mercy ſometimes fals out, but little to the Doctors credit, who gives the bad with the good, being penally blinded with ignorance, only by means of pride and ſloth.</p>
               <p>What is ſaid of purges or laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, may in their kinde be ſaid of Vomits, which <hi>(quatenus talia)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only a violence to nature, which ſenſible of their hoſtility, rages and cals for help as I may ſay, from its neighbours (that is the Latex, and the alimentary humour of the part affected) which are oft time prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſpent, ſometimes by vomit, ſometimes by ſiege, ſometimes both waies, to waſh away that odious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:111543:175"/>impreſſed, maugre which dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Archeus, the impreſſion ſometimes perſeveres till death, which is effectively cauſed by this Medicine (falſly ſo called, being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reall poyſon) while the poor butchered Patient thinking to have a diſeaſe only purged away, loſeth his life, either by an obſtinate vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or an unconquerable looſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus the other day I heard of one in <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> a luſty man, who for ſome diſtemper took a purge, which (when it was thought it had done working) had left ſuch a venemous tincture in the bowels, as was not waſhed away with fewer then about three hundred ſtools, in about three daies time, and ſo he had like to paid for the Doctors folly with the price of his life, beſides his money. Yet this muſt be a brave Art, and he that cannot do thus in conſcience, muſt <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> be termed an Emperick and Mountebank.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:111543:175"/>
               <p>To conclude this venomous vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and laxative ſubject, we yeeld, that vomits and purges (as ſuch) may by accident remove a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; inaſmuch as they inrage the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, by their venome, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad by reaſon of ſo odious a gueſt, rages to and fro without order or reaſon, falling out with what ever comes in the way, and (as in caſe of a fire in the City, the Pipes are broke up) ſo here the next alimentary moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is made uſe of to blot out this tinsture of venom, the ſtomack turned up &amp; down, the bowels torn and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for moiſture, and in this general hurly burly, perhaps ſomething that before was offenſive, is caſt out, and thus is the devil caſt out as it were by Beelzebub, or as if a man ſhould rid his breath of the ſmell of Onions by eating garlick: this is the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> which is little better then the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:111543:176"/>
               <p>A Patient is troubled perhaps with an Ague, and the Doctor in the firſt place (ſome I am ſure do) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders bloud-letting, that is, by ſtriking a terror into the Archeus, through loſs of the bloud, which threatens, and ſtrikes at the root of life, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to cauſe it to leave its rage, (which ſometimes it doth on the ſcore of terrefaction) but if this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not, then is either a vomitive or laxative poyſon given inwardly (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the impoſed name of a medicine) and by this the Archeus is brought as we may ſay <hi>(adreſtim)</hi> and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to play one game for life and all, hoping that in this commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is made, the Archeus with the poyſon, may caſt out what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inraged it, and by being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a greater danger, may forget or neglect what before provoked it to fury; as a man in imminent danger of his life, will forget or neglect the loſs of his goods, which otherwife
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:111543:176"/>would trouble him ſufficietly. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all ingenious men, if this be not a notable performance, and yet it is the whole of the Doctors craft; beſides which he hath nothing but Juleps, and Lozenges, and ſuch trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, of which every Confectioner and curious huſwife is better ſtored then he.</p>
               <p>Whoſe method waves ſtill from one extreme to another their potions, and doſes (which they call Phyſick) being ſo curſedly loathſom, as if they were made to poyſon <hi>Cerberus,</hi> inſomuch that the ſight of many purging potions is enough to make moſt men and women vomit, to ſweeten which, their method ſtores them with cordial fopperies, of which may truly be ſaid that of the Poet,
<q>Spectatum admiſsi riſum teneatis amici?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Syrups of Clove gelly-flowers,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:111543:177"/>with all ſorts of Conſerves, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, Marmalads, Quiddenies, and the like are of this liſt, which with Diaſcordium, Methridate, Alcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and Theriacle, diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the like, ſerve (if to nothing elſe) yet to multiply the Doctors Fees, and to enlarge the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Bils, and that is enough for them who care for nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Well then, if this be not the way of curing diſeaſes, what is? may a ſtudious and ingenious Reader ask of me: I have hinted it before, and ſhall more fully inſiſt upon it: I ſay adaequate remedies are to be ſtudied for the cure of diſeaſes, and by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they are to be found, ſuch I mean, which will be to the extinguiſhing a diſeaſe, as water will quench fire.</p>
               <p>And this I ſhall be bold to adde, that all the tricks that are uſed by the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> (as they ſay according to their Method) <hi>viz.</hi> Bleeding, Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Scarifications, Fontinels,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:111543:177"/>Cauteriés; Diaetical preſcriptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but ſilly poor ſhifts analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical to <hi>Adams</hi> fig-leaves to hide his nakedneſs: childiſh fopperies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their abuſed Patients, and to make themſelves appear diligent <hi>(cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo)</hi> while they want adaequate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies that might be <hi>(morbum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo:)</hi> therefore my brethren, as many of you as will be <hi>(medici)</hi> and not <hi>(ouratores)</hi> ſtudy and you will attain ſuch Medicines as will get you both credit and honor, as alſo gain, and honeſt rewards from your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. God hath not been wanting in bounty, if you will not be wanting in diligence: all his works are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and truth, and according to theſe attributes are the Medicines by him created and appointed, they are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful remedies, which will reſtore, not cruel drugs, which will only torment the body, and rob the ſick party of their money, and ſometimes their lives, they are true Medicines, which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:111543:178"/>will actually perform what the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent expects, and the Phyſician pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, land not faithleſs remedies, which are only like a broken ſtaffe not only to cauſe him that leans on it to fall, but alſo to hurt him with its ſplinters, this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe which I commence, and the common medicines.</p>
               <p>And as I inſtanced in the Feaver, ſo in this diſcovery of Medicines, I ſhall have eye to that inſtance, which is indeed a true touch ſtone to try any Phyſician by, continual Feavers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing analogical to the moſt violent ſpontaneouſly tranſient diſeaſe, and the Quartan being analogical to the moſt obſtinate Chronical diſeaſe, (eſpecially if Autumnal, and Hye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad) inſomuch that a medicine that will out all Feavers, continual land intermittent, at all ſeaſons of the year even in the weakeſt conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea although Hectical, will with the like eaſe cure all Chronick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:111543:178"/>
               <p>Such affinity is between the Feaver and the Gout, that the latter is never without the former, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Febricula either preceding or accompanying any rigorous Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xyſme of the Gout; and few malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers, without pain in the head, back, or limbs, which is analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall to the pain of the Gout.</p>
               <p>And indeed what are all diſeaſes, but ſo many and diſtinct furies of one and the ſame Archeus, which is variouſly provoked, according to the varieties of the occaſionate peccant matter, or impreſſed Ideall chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; on any of the viſcera, from whence by irradiation of the anger of the Archeus, various parts are variouſly tormented, as the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall occaſionate matter ſhall give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
               <p>Therefore the higheſt and nobleſt way of medicine, is by pacifying the Archeus, to bring it to abſolute quiet and reſt, whereby it neglects
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:111543:179"/>that provocation by which it was incenſed, and ſo the furious Idea being totally blotted out, it repents (as it were) of its former madneſſe, and do Nature diſpoſeth of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious product inſenſibly.</p>
               <p>The preſerving therefore in health, conſiſts not in taking of poyſon, to the end the Archeus, being another way more enraged, by an eminent danger immediately threatning the life, may be put into a hurly burly, in hopes that its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with the poyſon taken, it may throw out what ever was peccant before, but in keeping it from fury and rage if not already provoked, or otherwiſe appeaſing it. And I appeal to all ingenious men, which of the two is the better method.</p>
               <p>But this is the height of medicine, and is performable by the glorified, ſpirituated, and perfected <hi>Sulghurs,</hi> which by their eminent purity and perfection, and by their fermentall
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:111543:179"/>irradiation, at once mortifie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is malignant in the body, by which the Archeus finding ſuch powerfull aſſiſtance, begins to repent of its madneſſe, that it ſhould ſo diſquiet it ſelf and its whole habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, about a thing ſo quickly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and with the joy and jubile conceived upon its ſpeedy help found, it cheers up all its parts, which ſeem revived, as the earth when after winter it begins to ſmile with buddes and flowers, and ſo the ſtrength that a while before ſeemed decayed, appears in ſhort time renued, this is the noble effect of theſe (truly Aſtral) medicines.</p>
               <p>But to ſuch who cannot attain to this height of Aſt, (as truly all are not elected hereto) I ſhall adviſe other (more eaſily attainable) medicines, leſt I ſhould ſeem only to deſire to Tantalize, and not really to benefit and profit the Reader.</p>

               <p>The noble <hi>Helmont</hi> on ſuch a queſtion propounded, that if by purgations and by vomits, cures are not to be expected, how then they may be performed; makes this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his own queſtion, to wit, that the ends are to be promoted. If ſaith he, any filth be in the firſt rooms or places of digeſtion, then Abſterſives only are to be uſed, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eaſily and very ſafely perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt. But if any filth be lodged more deeply, then volatile Alcalies are to be uſed, which cleanſe the the body throughly, juſt as Sope cleanſeth Linnen. The ſame advice I give to ſuch as would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come true Sonnes of Art.</p>
               <p>There are noble Arcana's in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preparable by the great Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the liquor Alchaheſt, which are not for every one to command; although the liquor when prepared be of infinite vertue, yet would I not adviſe a young Artiſt ſo to dote
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:111543:180"/>on that ſearch, as to neglect more eaſily attainable ſecrets, eſpecially, ſince by ſuccedaneous ſecrets the ſame diſeaſes may be reſtored, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not with the ſame ſpeed or univerſality, (one of the grand Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's curing equally all diſeaſes) yet in a little more time, and with greater care, as certainly.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore here not ſpeak of any Alchaheſtical preparations, that liquor being difficult to prepare, and rarely poſſeſſed, but ſhall come to the ſuccedaneous Keyes of this Art, which any ingenious man may with induſtry (with Gods bleſſing) eaſily attain.</p>
               <p>Although I muſt ingenuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that my mind was ſo fired with eagerneſſe after that ſecret, that I did for nigh ten years make it my main ſearch, which ſo ſoon as I knew, and could prepare, my ſpirit was ſtraightway ſo ſatisfied with the knowledge thereof, that I never bitherto prepared it.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:111543:181"/>
               <p>For the way as I made it was very tedious, and it in making and uſing ſubject to chances, ſo that although it be (when made) incorruptible, yet the breaking of one Glaſſe will loſe that which otherwiſe is immortall, nor can it well be uſed without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate furnaces both for digeſtion and diſtillation, which required to the preparation of medicaments which are to be obtained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>Of this Subject I have ſpoken largely in a peculiar Treatiſe on that only Liquor, and in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, entituled, <hi>The Art of Pyrotech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opened and diſcovered;</hi> and in a Treatiſe entituled, <hi>Truth aſserted and maintained,</hi> or a Chymicall and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall reſolution of certain que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ſent me by one veyling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the name of <hi>Philalethes Zeteticus.</hi> All which Tractates I purpoſe ſpeedily to ſend abroad, ſo ſoon as I find what entertainment
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:111543:181"/>this Tractate will find in the World.</p>
               <p>To which Arcanum if you cannot attain, learn ſaith <hi>Helmont</hi> to make <hi>Alcalies volatile,</hi> that by mean of them you may perfect or make your ſolutions of Bodies.</p>
               <p>For fixed Alcalies according to <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Doctrine are of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertues, inſomuch that he equals them in vertue to the great Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's, as being ſo penetrative, that wherever they will not reach, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will: whoſe Doctrine I ſhall not repeat, but rather illuſtrate.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhall I here ſpeak but only briefly of this Subject, having in a peculiar Treatiſe entituled, <hi>de myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis Alcalium,</hi> ſpoken largely of the ſame, to which (as which I intend ſpeedily to make publike) I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſtudious Reader for full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>However I ſhall in this place diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo much (though very briefly) as may ſerve for direction to him
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:111543:182"/>that is induſtrious, by what he ſhall find here, to unlock many ſecrets of Nature, and thoſe very noble as to the Philoſophy of them, and uſefull as to the application of them unto mankind.</p>
               <p>Know then that Alcalyes are the the fixt Salts of combuſtible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, fixed by the activity of the fire, which were (before burning) volatile, and meerly fixed in this act of conflagration. In theſe Salts the ſeminal vertue is totally extinct, (which is the proper operation of the fire, on whatſoever it can maſter and overcome) ſo that they have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Saline, Diuretick and abſterſive vertue, which withall from the fire borrowes a fiery corroſive quality, in which reſpect it contains a little hoſtility and reluctancy toward the ſtomack.</p>
               <p>Truth, I know many Chymiſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſentence of <hi>Quercetan,</hi> do hold that the ſeminal principles
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:111543:182"/>are kept and preſerved uncorrupt in the fire, but I rather Jean to the contrary judgement of <hi>Helmont,</hi> which experience hath often and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily convinced me of.</p>
               <p>I grant that Alcalies do differ one from the other <hi>(per genera &amp; ſpecies)</hi> ſince the operation of each Agent is received by the Patient <hi>(per mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum recipient is)</hi> and ſo the uniform Act of burning in ſtones produceth one ſort of Calx or Alcaly, in Oyſter-ſhells another, in Trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, in Herbs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> another, and yet this diſtinction doth not lie in the formal, ſeminal, Balſamick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Concrete, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quality, or other qualities, which are determined by the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficated forms, although themſelves in this act of determination expire, and leave the Salt, as to the firſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calizate intention of kinne to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salts, than are made effectively by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> yet diſtinguiſhed from all
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:111543:183"/>others according to the capability of reception of the Agents activity in the Patient, whoſe ſpecificated form gave the Alcaly a certain diſtinction in determination, although to its own extinguiſhment.</p>
               <p>All then that remains in the Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li of the former Concrete, is but a very ſleight modicum of the <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num oportet,</hi> and ſo Alcalies do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer each from other, although all of them in their primary intention, are of one and the ſame nature and qualities. Hence it is that the Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Tartar hath deſerved and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the name of <hi>Reſpub. Alcalium;</hi> ſince whatever vertue is to be found in any Alcaly, may be found in and demonſtrated from the <hi>Alcali</hi> of Tartar.</p>
               <p>For the fire having no ſeminal power, it makes what proceeds from it effectively, though not efficiently, for the Salt to ſpeak Philoſophical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth in this act of <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s fury,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:111543:183"/>lay hold on its neighbouring Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and both being before vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, they of their own accord melt together into a Salt, and ſo fix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into an Alcalizate Body.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that Alcalies are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly volatized, ſince their generation proceeds not from ſeminal begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but is a ſpontaneous Larva, which part of the Salt and Sulphur of the Concrete aſſume, the better to withſtand <hi>Vulcans</hi> fury, as <hi>Mercury</hi> by bare circulation in the fire, will ſpontaneouſly aſſume the larva of a red (and ſomewhat fixed) Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
               <p>This is the proceſſe of this Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous Generation; yet is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct very noble, if eſpecially this fixed body by art brought back again to a volatile ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Which is to be done very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefully by mean of vegetable eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Sulphurs (that is diſtilled Oyls) to which Alcalies have a very
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:111543:184"/>neer, nay an intimate affinity, which may appear firſt, by the unctuous Apperineſſe of Alcalies. Secondly, by their ready mixture with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Oyl, between both which is made a Sope, being a neuter from both. Thirdly, by the greedy mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them with Sulphurs minerall, which are known to be unctuous, and of neer kin to Oyls.</p>
               <p>Alcalies being thus volatized, become noble medicines, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe both in their own nature, and to the making of other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, of which I ſhall touch briefly, and ſo draw toward a concluſion.</p>
               <p>Concerning this operation, <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> hat given more light the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that went before him, yet hath he written darkly enough, (although wondrous Philoſophically,) which as many as underſtand him with me, will don eſſe</p>
               <p>I muſt ſeriouſly profeſſe, that for night ſeven years I made about two
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:111543:184"/>thouſand experiments to this intent, but was always unſucceſſefull, till pondering the words of that old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher concerning this Subject, I found my errors and the truth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>And I do ſuppoſe that ſcarce the hundredth Artiſt will attain this ſecret, unleſſe it be from him only who is the giver of every good and perfect gift, to whom alone be all glory and everlaſting benediction.</p>
               <p>For it is a rare thing to have any of theſe ſecrets communicated in form of receipts, or if communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet ſo that much be left out in the direction, which, without pains, ſtudy, and ſedulity will never be attained, ſo I did, and ſo all have done, who have been maſters of ſecretes, and ſo I advice each deſirous ſtudent in this Art to do. And for the help of ſuch, I ſhall be as candid, as the Lawes of this art wil permit and allow.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:111543:185"/>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the vindication of noble <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and the explication of Nature according to thoſe principles which eperience in the fire had taught him, I ſhall from my own experience alſo further illuſtate what was obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down by him, in reference to the preparation of noble medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And as the fire taught <hi>Helmont</hi> to underſtand <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> ſo it hath alſo taught me to underſtand them both, and by it muſt every one that would underſtand Nature truely, and not notionally, have his Philoſophy regenerated.</p>
               <p>Concerning Alcalies, the noble <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, that being volatized, they equall the vertue of the moſt noble Arcana's, inaſmuch as being indued with an abſterſive and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive vertue, they paſſe even to the fourth digeſtion, and reſolve all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturall excrements and coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:111543:185"/>in all the Veſſels. That they take away all filthy reſidence, which is in any of the veins, and that they do reſolve all (though never ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate) obſtructions, and ſo cut off the materiall cauſe of all apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ulcers both within and without. That their ſpirit is ſo penetrative, and efficacious, that whitherſoever, it will not reach, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will. And in a word, that as Sope cleanſeth linnen, ſo they cleanſe the whole body, and cut off, and cleanſe away the material cauſe of all diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Their ſpirit is of an admirable diſſolving quality, inſomuch that it will diſſolve any ſimple Concrete Body, and diſſolving will be coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated upon it, and borrow from the diſſolved Body a ſpecificated vertue, which having entrance into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, will actually cure deplorable and chronick diſeaſes, as well as all Feavers.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:111543:186"/>
               <p>This is the ſumme of his Doctrine concerning Alcalies, which is very true, and in which I can be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſe with him, that he hath born true teſtimony unto Nature.</p>
               <p>Of which operation he gives ſome hints in two or thee places, one, where ſpeaking of the Oyl of Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, how it may be made into Slat, he ſaith, that if that Oyl be mixed with its own Alcali, without any water, being circulated three moneths with an occult and ſecret circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is wholly turned into a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt; of which elſewhere he ſaith, that it is a noble remedy for the Palſy, Epilepſy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in another place, where he teacheth (in defect of the Alcha-heſticall preparation) to ſever the Sulphur from <hi>Paracelſus Metallus maſculus</hi> (that is Spelter, and is the Sulphur <hi>Glaure Augurelli</hi>) and to cohobate it with Oyl of Mace, Aniſe, or Therebinth, till it all come over
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:111543:186"/>the Helm in a fetid Oyl, and then to circulate it with an Alcali (as it ought to be) till it be turned into an Elixir of volatile Salt, and after to take away its fetor by rectifying it with good Spirit of Wine, this he commends, and juſtly, for a cure of very many (if not moſt, or all) chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>For explication of which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, let me admoniſh the Reader, that Salt of Tartar, or any Alcali, may be made ſeverall wayes volatile, and each way yeelding noble medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, yet one way far nobler then other.</p>
               <p>Now of all wayes, that is the moſt inferiour, which is done by Oyls, as <hi>Helmont</hi> well notes, that of all Salts, thoſe are moſt languid which contain the <hi>vita media</hi> of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, which he oalls <hi>(Sulphurum proſapiam)</hi> cap. 3. <hi>de Duelech,</hi> and therefore theſe Elixirs do follow the name of the Oyl by which they are
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:111543:187"/>made, and are called <hi>Sal volatile,</hi> or <hi>Elixir volatile, Cinamoni, Macis, Nucis Myriſticae, Therebinthinae,</hi> &amp;c. according as the Oyls are by which the Alcali is made fugitive, and though they are noble medicines, yet are they Specificks ſubordinate much to univerſall Arcana's, to which <hi>Helmont</hi> equalls, and that juſtly the Spirits of Salt of Tarrar, which are by a far more ſecret Art preparable.</p>
               <p>Such are the volatile Salts made of Cephalike Herbs, as Roſemary, Sage, &amp;c. which are commended by that Philoſopher only, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular remedie in Feavers, yet ſuch, that if given due time before the fit, in itermittents, on a faſting ſtomach, or at any time in continual Feavers, and ſweat be provoked, they will never put a faithfull Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to deriſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore I give all ingenuous Artiſts to underſtand, that Alcalies
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:111543:187"/>are noble Bodies, ordained by God for great uſes to mankind, and may be handled as the artiſt pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Many ſimple Mechaniſts know to take Oyl expreſſed, and with the Lixivium of Alcalies to boy it into a Sope, which is a <hi>(Tertium neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum)</hi> from both the Oyl and the Alcali. But when they have done this, they know not how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further with it, nor do our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Philoſophers, although they think themſelves wiſe men.</p>
               <p>This is the loweſt and moſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour way of preparing Salts, <hi>viz.</hi> with expreſt Oyls which contain much heterogeneity in them, and are full of fuliginous vapours, (as may appear by their ſpeedy growing rancid, eſpecially if once heated) yet notwithſtanding, in their union with Alcalies, there may be much of Philoſophy learned, if it were but duly conſidered, and the effect pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with its cauſes. Yet this I muſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:111543:188"/>ſay, that though the making of Sope be the utmoſt of the Sope-boylers work, it is but the firſt ſtep of the Philoſophers work, and indeed is but an Abortive in Philoſophy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by violent decoction, by which the Oyl and the Salt enter each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſome meaſure, but do not radically penetrate each others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity, as I ſhall by inſtance make to appear.</p>
               <p>For let the beſt Sope be diſtilled, with an acute water ſtinking of an Empyreum, will diſtill of an high coloured fetid Oyl, of a greeniſh ceruleous colour to view in a glaſſe. The <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> being elixated by warm water will give an Alcali, fixed as before (though giving an high coloured Lixivium) but the quantity both of Salt and Oyl, leſs then what was taken to make the Sope, and therefore conſiderable part of both, in this decoction into Sope, are turned into an Aqueous
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:111543:188"/>Liquor, which being rediſtilled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Helmont</hi>'s preſcription, from a fixt body, becomes inſipid like to elemen all water, leaving the volatile Salt that was in the Spirit coagulated upon the fixt Body.</p>
               <p>By which it is evident that the Oyl and Salt had not ingreſſe to each others profundity, and therefore part of each are ſeparable from the other, the Salt in its Alcalizate, and the Oyl in its unctuous nature: by which may be concluded, that a centrall ingreſſion was not made of each into other.</p>
               <p>But as for eſſentiall or diſtilled Oyls, as of Therebinth, Mace, Nutmeg, &amp;c. they by reaſon of their volatility, not abiding deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are with difficulty made into a Sapo, although by Cohobation upon a Lixivium, they will yeeld a Colloſtrum like to Tarre in colour, which will have the whole taſte and ſmell of the Concrete, and the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:111543:189"/>Oyl that diſtills over will be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vertue, being thus robbed of its ſpecifick odor and taſte, this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſtrum will diſſolve (in part) either in water or ſpirit of Wine, leaving part that will not diſſolve, much like to Shoo-makers waxe: of this operation ſome make a ſecret, but it is only triviall, for though by it diſſolved in Spirit of Wine, a good medicine may be made againſt wind in the ſtomack, yet it is not the Elixir of volatile Tartar, but a certain ſubſtance of the Oyl made by the fretting of the Lixivium in decoction, and ſwims upon the Lixivium, nor will be made by any induſtry to mixe with it; the Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um then is highly tincted, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by long cohobation there might be made an union, but my patience would never ſuffer me to perſiſt to ſee the utmoſt of that operation, eſpecially when I knew a better way.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:111543:189"/>
               <p>For to be ingenuous, I tryed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes in purſuance of volatile Alcalies, which upon <hi>Helmont</hi>'s commendation, and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> alſo, I highly valued, and next to the great Diſſolvent made them my ſearch, which I aſſayed to make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes, which would be tedious here to tell of.</p>
               <p>'Tis enough for the Reader, that he know that it is not ſufficient for him to be able to make a Sapo with Salts and Oyls, for that is eaſie in expreſt, harder in diſtilled Oyls, and at the beſt but trivial, foraſmuch as the beſt Sapo, being diſtilled by a graduall fire, will give, beſides a Spirit ſmelling of an Empyreum, an Oyl of a ſtrong ſent, and a Salt (in the <hi>caput mortuum</hi>) Alcalizate and fixt, which ſhews that this operation is but an abortive birth in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, nor is the ſpirit thus got by diſtillation that noble ſpirit of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, of which <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:111543:190"/>glory, but it is a ſpirit, in which is very little of the nature of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali, and that but very languid, the nobler parts of both Oyl and Salts, being for want of union each with other, ſeparable in their former na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and qualities.</p>
               <p>There is therfore a way far more ſecret, by which is made not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po, but a Salt in form of Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy, liquable in water or Wine, and volatile, in which are theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and very remarkable things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that one parts of Alcali will turn two or three parts of Oyl into meer Salt, without any the leaſt ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginity, ſave only a very ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Oyl will be turned into a reſinous gumme, diſtinct from that which is ſalificate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This diſſolves in a liquor, not as Sope, which makes a troubled ſuddy water, but as any other Salt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This being boyled to a Cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, will ſhoot like to any other
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:111543:190"/>Salt, tincted according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes colour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſharpneſſe of the Salt is totally mortified, and it becomes ſo mild, as not to offend the mouth, though taken alone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Oyls, though hot and of a very acute taſte, yet they retain only ſo much raſte and ſmell, as is inſeparable from the <hi>vita media,</hi> ſo that the medicine is temperature, diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and inſenſibly Diaphoretick.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Salt thus made is totally volatile, without leaving any fixed Salt in the <hi>Caput mortuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This may be done perfectly in ten weeks or leſſe, in very great quatity, provided it be according to <hi>Helmont</hi>'s order, done <hi>(ſine aquâ, occuliâ &amp; artificioſâ circulatione)</hi> or to ſpeak plainly, that the digeſtion be made <hi>(in cintro profunditatis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiria.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The heat required ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to exceed the heat of the Sunne
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:111543:191"/>in the Spring, that is according to the manner of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Eſſences, in which heat alone, by Art, the Salt receivoth a fermentall determination from the Oyls, and they on the other hand receive the ſame from the Salt, and ſo is made of both a volatile temperate Salt, of the vertue of each patent. For from the Alcali, it receives a vertue Diuretick and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſive and from the Oyl a Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Nature, by which it reacheth ever unto our Conſtitutive princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and in the way reſolves what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever preternaturall coagulation it meets withall.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Salt thus elixerate is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſo, as that it may be diſſolved in water, and boyled up again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſſe of vertue, in manner of Cremor, Tartari, Sal Ammoniack, Sugar, Sugar-Candy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By this means the Sulphur of any metall or minerall (that may be ſeparated from the Mercuriality and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:111543:191"/>diſtilled with Oyls eſſentiall over the helm) may be made into the form of an eſſentiall Salt; and that by being rectified with ſpirit of Wine (or with clean water) will loſe its ſtrong odor, and thus may be obtained a Medicine for moſt (or all) Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="11">11. This Elixir thus made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a communicable ferment to any other Herb, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted with it (diſſolved in Wine) is by it turned into a volatile Salt, (except only the Faeces of the true vertue of the Concrete.)</p>
               <p n="12">12. This Elixir is an abſolute Corrector of the venome in all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, which it mortifies imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, inſomuch that Hellebore, Aconitum, Hyoſciam, Elaterium, &amp;c. by bare mixing with this Elixir of volatile Tartar, become gentle ſuddenly, and this done, without any heat ſtronger then for the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Egge, and by this Elixir
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:111543:192"/>in a ſhort (but very artificiall) deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be made volatile Salts of ſuch Herbs, which will not yeeld an Oyl by diſtilling with water, that is an eſſentiall Oyl, ſuch as Hellebore, Jalap, Briony, Enula Campana, &amp;c. which are noble Medicines thus corrected, having beſides their own excellency the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vertue of the Elixir, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is a balſamicall Ens of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble efficacy in deplorable caſes.</p>
               <p>Whoever then thou art that wouldeſt be a true Sonne of Art, learn to uſe Salts according to the true Philoſophicall preparation of them, not as the fooliſh fort of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts do, by giving them as they are extracted out of their aſhes, thinking no other work to belong to them, then by repeated filtration to make them as cryſtalline and pure as may be; for although they are noble Subjects, yet their Lixiviate Acrimony is ſomewhat hoſtile, and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:111543:192"/>beſides this they are unable in their fixt corporeous nature to paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Veſſels of the ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and are caſt forth by ſiege partly, but chiefly by urine.</p>
               <p>But being volatized, they become balſamical tinctures, and familiar to our natures, and ſo are eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have entrance even to our conſtitutive principles, (according to the nature of the Concrete, whoſe Craſis in its volatility it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) and in their paſſage they clear the Organs of all offenſive excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by their gratefull odor they refreſh the veins, and blot out all forain Idea's that are impreſſed on any of the <hi>viſcera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now among all fixed Salts, there is none of greater vertue then Salt of tartar, whence it hath deſerved to be called <hi>Alcalium Reſpublica,</hi> and among all Oyls there is none for its abſterſive nature excells Oyl of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebinth, which is a limpid Oyl, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:111543:193"/>penetrative, and of its own nature eminently diuretick.</p>
               <p>By means of this Oyl the Salt of Tartar is made into a volatile Elixir, Cryſtalline very pure, and temperate, retaining ſo much taſt and odor of the Therebinth as doth follow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily the <hi>vita media,</hi> ſo as that it may be barely diſtinguiſhed, and that by an acute palate, this Elixir is mild without ſharpneſſe, cryſtalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing like to any other Salt.</p>
               <p>And note, that in making this or any other Salt of an eſſentiall Oyl, when the digeſtion is compleat, and the Salt without the leaſt oleaginity, will diſſolve in water, that then the water which is firſt drawn off will ſeem a notable ſpirit, which yet is not the ſpirit of volatile Tartar; for that water being ſaved ſo long as the eminent taſte remains, and when the Salt is nigh drie, put on it again, leaves all its taſt behind, and is left inſipid, and ſo at laſt diſtilled away
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:111543:193"/>without taſte, then is that Salt to be diſtilled or ſublimed for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s noble ſpirit, by him and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſo highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And thus courteous Reader, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining your ſelf to be Maſter of theſe clixerated Oyls, and eſſencifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Salts (for all are made by one rule, and therefore learn one and learn all) you may deſire to know what excellency is to be found in theſe beyond what is and may be ſeen in common medicines.</p>
               <p>To anſwer; firſt, the way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Salts is rather a common place then a ſingle receipt, for make one, and make all the ſorts of Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Salts, ſo that thus you may commend Salt of Cinnamon, Mace, Nutmeg, Cloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Palſy, Epilepſie, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and many other rigorous and Chronick diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>But by firſt cohobating Sulphurs
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:111543:194"/>of Antimony, <hi>metallus maſculus,</hi> &amp;c. with an Oyl, till they come over the Helm, and then circulating theſe Oyls with an Alcali into an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Salt, will behad Medicines truly ſuccedaneous to Alchaheſticall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana's.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, thus have you a Key by which you may enter the Cloſet of the moſt noble vegetable, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending its virulency, digeſting its crudity, beſides which there is no preparation comparable to that of the Liquor Alchaheſt, to which this is truly and may be adjudged ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous.</p>
               <p>But that is moſt ſolemn, to wit, when the whole Concrete is totally and perfectly reduced into a liquid form, with diſtinction of all its he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneities, in their ſeverall colours, among which is alway one liquor, eminently diſtinguiſhab'e from the reſt in colour, which is in ſubſtance but little, yet contains perfectly the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:111543:194"/>very Craſis of the Concrete: this is the higheſt of vegetable preparations, eſpecially where the body is reſolved in a gentle tepidity, and the Oyl (in ſuch Concretes which yeeld Oyl) ſeparated from the Mercuriall liquor, and both from the Diſſolvent, and be after in the ſame heat decocted into a Salt, which is their firſt Ens. However, this preparation made by means of elixerated Salts and Oyls, although as to the Craſis of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, it advance it not to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that Eſſence which is made by mean of the Alchaheſt, yet the medicaments thus made are no whit inferior in vertue, excelling them in generality of Energy. For the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor Alchaheſt in its preparations is ſeparated from the body diſſolved, and ſo the Medicament expreſſeth only the vertue of the Concrete whence it was taken, which is more preciſe and ſingular, but here the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir of volatile Alcali, together with
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:111543:195"/>the Balſamick tincture of the volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Oyl, is united with the Eſſence of the added Vegetable, (as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, hellebore, black or white, Aſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Opium, Zalap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whereby it is not only endowed with the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick endowments of the additionall Concrete, but alſo is ennobled by the admirable Abſterſive, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner univerſall power of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Elixir, by which it is enriched with moſt excellent medicinal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and becomes penetrative and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive as Balſamick and volatile, abſterſive, reſolutive, and diuretick, and gently Diaphoretick, as ſaline and Alcalizate, and beſides this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically intended and directed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the particular vertues of its other compounded ſimple, (out of which it forms a reall Salt, void of all virulency, without any loſſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) by and from which it receives a more peculiar determination.</p>
               <p>For between the Oyls eſſentiall
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:111543:195"/>and Salts Alcalizate, there is a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall appetite, whereby they cloſe each with other radically and in the Centrall profundity each of other, which give not a Sapo, nor a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſtrum, (which are the triviall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of erring operators) but a reall Salt, mild without Corroſiveneſſe of the Alcali; and temperate without the heat of the Oyl, which then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of kin to Vegetalls, and thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, becomes a due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Agent to ſalifie or bring to a Sacharine Salt any Vegetall with which it is mixed and Philoſophical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decocted, that is in a Solar heat or rather an an mall warmth, wherein in about ten dayes or more as the quantity is, the whole ſubſtance will be tranſmuted into a reall Cryſtalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Salt, in which the <hi>media vita</hi> of the Concrete only remains, retaining the whole Craſis or vertue not in the leaſt diminiſhed, and ſo the efficacy of the <hi>Species</hi> or Concrete contracts
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:111543:196"/>an intimate union with the Salt or Elixir of Tartar volatile, and both conſpire to the performing of really wonderfull Cures.</p>
               <p>Theſe tincted Cryſtalls if you put into pure ſpirit of Wine, and digeſt them in a gentle heat, the ſpirit by reaffuſion, and powring off, as oft as it is tincted, will extract the whole tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Vegetable, leaving the Salt behind robbed of the tincture, by which it may be gathered that the Salt and the tincture are centrally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, though they have centrally wrought each on other, yet not ſo as to contract an union each with other.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of Wine then diſtilled off in a gentle heat, the tincture will remain, and is the whole Craſis of the Concrete, which is a noble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for ſuch Concretes, which are Balſamicall and odoriferous, where the tincture is deſired free from the mixture of the Salts, as to wit, in ſuch caſes, where bare refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:111543:196"/>without Abſterſion is deſired and required.</p>
               <p>Thus is made the moſt noble A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roph of <hi>Helmont</hi> out of <hi>Satyrion,</hi> and may be uſed either the tincture alone, ſeparated from the Salt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction with ſpirit of Wine, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Elixir, which I rather approve and chooſe, unleſſe in caſe where the Back is to be ſtrengthned in women afflicted with waſting, otherwiſe the Abſterſiveneſſe of the Saline Elixir promotes the cure for the Nephritis and Stone, or gravell of the bladder, wonderfully.</p>
               <p>And now my decocting Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, where are you? Come in upon the Stage with your decoctions, Syrups, Electuaries, Lochſana's, Boles, and the reſt of your Trinkets, and bring your Maſters the Doctors with you to plead your cauſe and to mantain and defend you.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſay of me that I am a Mountebank, and want method, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:111543:197"/>I ſay of them, that they are Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts, and want Medicaments. Not that you want drugges or ſlops, you are confeſſed by all to have more then enough, but yet for all that, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to true Medicaments, you have nothing that truly deſerves to be named ſo.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be God that I am igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant when it is a ſit time to let blood to preſerve health, when to take it away to reſtore health, when to give poy ſons to purge, in expectation that Nature being forced to play a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate game, and reduced to a forc't put, may winne that by adventure, which you by all your Art cannot aſcertain her with ſafe and ſpeedy remedies. But this I know, namely, to cure thoſe diſeaſes by moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpeedy, and ſafe Medicaments, which you by your method deſpair of.</p>
               <p>Your method only teacheth you when your Medicaments are put to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:111543:197"/>a Non-plus, to have recourſe to ſuch things which my judgement diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and therefore my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence abhorres: my method teacheth me what diſeaſes ſuch and ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines will reſtore, and where the diſeaſe is more deeply rooted and obſtinate, it furniſheth me with more commanding Arcana's.</p>
               <p>If the peccant occaſionall matter be only in the Concave of the firſt Veſſels, as the ſtomack, Pylorus, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odenum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes be never ſo violent, yet with Abſterſive things I undertake the Cure, and perform it; ſuch is the forenamed Elixir, either <hi>per ſe,</hi> or ſpecificated with any Abſterſive Simple.</p>
               <p>The moſt Abſterſive Simple that I ever knew among the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Vegetalls, is <hi>Opium,</hi> which of it ſelf is a Narcotick deleteriall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, but by means of this elixera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Salt it loſeth all thoſe odious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:111543:198"/>and is a moſt powerfull ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſick, anodynous eminently and cures all Feavers though never ſo acute, and all Agues, yea, although Quartans and Autumnall, which it helps by continued taking, in no long time.</p>
               <p>In the correction of which it is obſervable, that only a feculent ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſeparated, and the reſt is total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned into a volatile Salt, which is not to be excelled in the whole ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Family. So corrected, it is moſt ſafely adminiſtred to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of 20 grains, &amp; is ſo far from cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſleep, compulſively, that it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds from ſleep, eſpecially where the party affected is troubled with a Cough, but againſt a Cough it is ſo powerfull, that very well wrote <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> concerning it. <hi>Felinem illum Medicum qui novit lethalia ab Opi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſeparate cum retentâ poteſtate agendi in Duumviratum.</hi> Happy is that Phyſitian who knowes how to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:111543:198"/>the deadly qualities which are in <hi>Opium,</hi> ſo as that it may retain its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of acting upon the Duumviratus.</p>
               <p>For this Simple thus corrected, by its innate ſpecificated quality doth work on the ſeat of life, pacifying the Archeus without the leaſt ſtupefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather keeping the Patient awake, and provoking ſweat either moderate or more ſtrong, as the ſtrength of the party is, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Thus it extinguiſheth all defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (called catarhs) and on that ſcore is a certain remedy for fluxes, either bloudy, or not, all Coughs (not brought to their higheſt exaſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or moſt intimate rooting) in a word, it reſolves by ſweat and urine the cauſe of many diſeaſes, which are not too deeply fixed, and where it will not reach, only a great Arcanum will.</p>
               <p>To be brief, many diſeaſes, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the face of an Ague, or the like
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:111543:199"/>diſtemper, may ſometimes be beyond this Medicines cure, yet even in ſuch it will give eaſe, and where it will not throughly extinguiſh the malady, there let higher Arcana's be uſed.</p>
               <p>Of all Vegetable remedies correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this only that I know works by vomit, which (with ſome only) it cauſeth the next day after its taking, I uſually adviſing it after a very light ſupper to bed ward laſt, (becauſe it is Diaphoretick) and the next morning it cauſeth a ſpontaneous vomit, with little ſickneſſe or nauſeouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>It binds the body for moſt part, and ſo not at all times to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, but with other adviſe added, to ſupply what is defective in it, 'tis ſple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick in operation, and an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remedy againſt wind in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack or bowels, as alſo againſt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriatick melancholy.</p>
               <p>The ſome way Hellebore correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is a noble remedy againſt ling ring Quartans, and ſo I could inſtance in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:111543:199"/>very many Simples, but that time will not permit my enlargement here.</p>
               <p>Only this for a cloſe I ſhall admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, that this Key being had, the noble Energy of all Vegetables will be at command without the leaſt footſteps of virulency, and ſo a man may be his own experience (with very much ſafety) trie and ſatisfie himſelf, of what my experience will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to write, nor will my time allotted allow me to mention ſo far as my experience hath gone.</p>
               <p>And by the way as an admonition to our wiſe Maſters of this ſcience, I ſhall mind them, that in the whole Vegetable Family there is not a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple comparably ſo Diaphoretick as Opium, which they account of all Vegetables the moſt cold, in which let them learn from me, that the Narcotick virulency may be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, without altering the ſpecifick vertue in the leaſt, and then it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynous with much pleaſure to the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:111543:200"/>Patient, and a help for great mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, giving caſe and comfort in moſt, but prejudiciall in none, (ſave only an obſtinate coſtiveneſſe) it being the ſpecifick quality of that medicine to bind the belly, which it doth in moſt, yet ſo as to appear like a purge to ſome, but thoſe very rarely.</p>
               <p>In Zalap, Rhabarb, and all purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines ſo called (or rather vegetall poyſons) it takes away the virulency totally, without the leaſt remain of the ſame, and is then either Diaphoretick or Diuretick, or rather both, without any moleſtation to the Patient, and thus a certain remedy for all acute, and many Chronicall (not too highly graduated) maladies.</p>
               <p>If any then demand of me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my myſtery and method, I anſwer: By the Symptomes I judge of the diſeaſe, and according to the ſtrength of the Patient, and the rigor of the diſtemper I order my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines accordingly.</p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:111543:200"/>
               <p>Acute diſeaſes, and many Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall not too highly graduated I cure by the Elixir of volatile Tattar alone, given in Wine, or elſe ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with ſome Vegetable, as I ſee occaſion. And with the bleſſing of God can promiſe the Patient cure to their comfort, and perform it to my own credit.</p>
               <p>But where either the diſeaſe is too high, or Nature too ſuccumbent, there I volatize Sulphurs by eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Oyls, and make them into Elixirs, and after given them a ſpecification from reſtorative aromatick Balſoms.</p>
               <p>And yet beyond this there is a way to make ſuch a ſpirit of Tartar which is ſecond to none but the great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent, of which I ſhall not ſpeak here, having already tranſgreſſed the bounds prefixt to this Treatiſe, and beſides in my other Treatiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Art of Pyrotechny, it is fully handled, and with as much can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor as can be expected.</p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:111543:201"/>
               <p>I ſhall at preſent conclude, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Captious Reader either to mend what I have done, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear his cenſure; and the ſtudious Artiſt I ſhall adviſe to go on in his begun task with cheerfulneſſe and diligence; for true Medicine is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and weighty matter, according to the Poet,
