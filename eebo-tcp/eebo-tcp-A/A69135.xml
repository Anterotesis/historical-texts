         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE DIVINE IVDGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in the death of the <hi>Marquis</hi> d'Ancre.</head>
                  <p>OH the iuſt iudgements of God! oh profound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible counſell of the Almightie! oh ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne decree of the diuine prouidence! That man is vnhappilie periſhed, that ſought to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme vs in miſerie. He that with a diſloy all heart would haue procured a tragicall end to France, hath tragically ended his daies by the hands of true-hearted Frenchmen: and hath buried himſelfe in his owne pride, that would haue buried the greatnes of Princes, and built an abſolute power in the ruines and decay of this perpetuall Monarchie. But what do I ſay, buried; O wonderfull prodigie, O prodigious wonder! That ſame man hath bin by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9060:3"/>
vnburied, and depriued of the ſweete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the dead, who in his life time had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued France of a peaceable tranquillitie, hath bin ignominiouſly hung vp as a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and calumniating <hi>Haman,</hi> on the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected gallowes, which his owne naturall cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and art of wickedneſſe had ordained for ſuch good <hi>Mardocheoſes,</hi> as vndertooke to complaine of his tyrannie, or to diſcouer the many practiſes of his treaſons and diſloyaltie againſt our King. Moreouer, they hung him with his heeles vpward, as if his head ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly culpable, durſt not ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heauens; was with great diſgrace and infamie ſhamefully dragged through the ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king puddles and dunghils of the Citie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris; he that long ſince had drawne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelf the cords and ſnares of the diuine iuſtice, and who had infected France with the ordure, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and ſtinking ſauour of his vices; hee which ſought to diſmember the body of the State, himſelfe was diſmembred and torne in peeces; was burned and conſumed in the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, who would haue burned and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the libertie of the people with the fire of his violence; his aſhes were ſcattered in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9060:3"/>
winde, to ſhew the puffe of his own ambition, which was ſo ſuddenly turned to aſhes. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that the bright skie of his authoritie was free from any cloudes, the cleere ſunne of his dominion without eclipſe, the lightſome day of his glorie voyd of darkneſſe, the vaſt ſea of his greatnes without tempeſt, the roſes of his good fortune grew without pricks, and that all the felicities of the world were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to ſhine vpon him: But hee ſuddenly found his authoritie loſt, his dominion ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, his glorie extinguiſhed, his greatneſſe troden down, his good fortunes changed, and felt that his former proſperities, were but a ſweete impoyſoned baite of fortune, turned into the gall and bitternes of all miſhaps.</p>
                  <p>Hee was put to death by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that would haue commanded the King; hee ended his daies with violent death, that violated the reſpect due vnto his Maieſty, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Iuſtice, violated the lawes; and hee that was indeed altogether nothing but violence it ſelfe, hauing climbed ſo high, that hee could not well be brought low, but by death it ſelfe; which Iuſtice confirmeth, the Law approueth, and equitie commandeth, Right counſelleth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9060:4"/>
Reaſon ordaineth, Hiſtories allow, and that precedents teach; and that cannot be taken in euill part, without contradicting the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, authoritie, commandement, counſell, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, confirmation, and teaching of the whole world; and to accuſe of iniquity, Iuſtice, law, equitie, right, reaſon, hiſtories, examples, and all that may be termed vprightnes in the whole vniuerſe. The infection of his life, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been moſt iuſtly, but yet with too much honour mingled with his bloud, in the midſt of his (as I may terme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) Court-gally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues; who did inconſideratly adore the blind Idoll of his greatnes. Whence may be learned, that vice neuer goes vnpuniſhed; although to be vicious, of it ſelfe is puniſhment ſufficient. Mounſier <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itry,</hi> moſt faithfull to the King, hauing brought both his heart and hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the execution of ſo heroicke an act, that Hiſtories ſhall perpetually record to the memorie of men, and ſhall flow from the pen of the moſt learned within the Temple of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie.</p>
                  <p>No, no, it was not earth, but Heauen had the greateſt ſtroke in his death; it was the hand of Angels more then men, and the ſentence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9060:4"/>
his tragicall end was firſt pronounſt in Gods counſell, before the King decreed it. By which it may be gathered, how neere this good and wiſe Monarke is vnited vnto the eternall God in his minde and ſoule; ſeeing that the will of the moſt High, who holdeth the harts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his hand, agreeth ſo well with the Kings; and that the Protector of the whole world, hath been well pleaſed with the deſires of this great King, thereby to manifeſt his conſent vnto his wiſhes. Hee ended the courſe of his life entring into the Louure, where he thought himſelfe ſo firmely <hi>anchred,</hi> that hee was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to depart thence; and felt the icie ſtroke of death by piſtols and fiery weapons, who in the midſt of his froſtie cowardiſe and temeritie, was the kindler and flaming fire-brand of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; who with an ardent appetite greedily longed to trouble all France with the fire of Ciuill warre.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the skie had bin long before (euen in the faireſt moneth in the yeere) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with a gloomie darknes, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly touched with remorſe of our ſenſible griefes which aſcended thither; ſeemed to mourne at our ſiniſter miſhaps, and to mingle
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9060:5"/>
its continual drops with the bitter teares which ouerflowed the eyes and hearts of all true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Frenchmen, who could not without extreame griefe vndergoe that vnreaſonable tyrannie; or as if it would ioyne its moyſture together with the bloud, which the ouerruling of this execrable Tyrant cauſed to be ſpilt, by a furious and more then Ciuill warre: euen at this inſtant bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to re-aſſume the brightnes of its countenance, and to cheriſh the earth with its ſeaſonable mildnes, euen at the fearfull image of this mans death, neerely reſembling that <hi>Herennius</hi> who was ſtrook with lightning, the skie being without cloudes, and the ayre bright and cleere; as if by the calmenes of the weather, the calme of Peace would be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto vs, which France is ſhortly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, by meanes of this long wiſht for death; and that with his bloud he was to extinguiſh the flames of warre, which his ambition had vnhappily kindled; a warre that fought againſt the publike peace, the vnion of ſubiects, the ioy of friends, the Kings authority, the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of Frenchmen, and the good of France; a warre that was the motiue of many wars, and ſuch a warre whereof his Maieſtie deſired as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9060:5"/>
much to ſee an end, as of a warre that turned good things into bad, ſo a peace would haue turned bad into good.</p>
                  <p>Hee ended his life in the beginning of a week, as if therby the heauens did preſage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that his end was to be the beginning of our happineſſe. Before moone, in token that we were to re-behold the Eaſterne part of the Sonne of Iuſtice, which was eclipſed by the earth of his auarice, and now began a new to peepe out vpon the Horizon of France, in the Orient of the happie raigne and Empire of our good King: whoſe admirable vertues ſhal neuer bee ſeene to ſet, and is to raigne in all prudence and abſolute authoritie; hauing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his head on his Crowne, then his Crowne on his head, and his hand rather within his Scepter, then his Scepter in his hand: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer to gouerne himſelfe by the graue aduice of his beſt and principal Officers, and ſo much the rather, for that by bad counſell, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a great King is made a little one; and contrariwiſe by good counſell a pettie King is made a great one.</p>
                  <p>He is confined to the centre of death rather in the moneth of Aprill then March, in regard
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9060:6"/>
that hee had no thing in him that was martiall or generous; and could better lay his hands on the Kings coffers and treaſure, then on a ſword: and to conclude, was conſtrained to giue vp the ghoſt in the midſt of the ſpring, in the flower of his age, who was altogether thornes in his heart, as if the ground were not able to beare any longer, among thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant flowers and faire Flower-deluces, which are diſplaied in this milde ſeaſon, this Cantharide and mortall poyſon of the Flowers of France.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9060:8"/>
I be thought me, Might not this bee ſome one of the Conchinies ſeruitors; for they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed in fighting to arme themſelues with Cittadels. Thereupon I reſolued to draw neere vnto him, and tooke a long pole in my hand; which I had no ſooner done, but in a broken voice I vnderſtood theſe words, <hi>Stirre not, my friend, ſtirre not I pray thee, wilt thou twice kill me?</hi> By his voice I knew the coward, and ſaid, Behold, this luſtie Champion, who being the other day ouerthrowne, is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnd againe, it boads him no good lucke; I came neere him and he retired, (ſo much are thoſe kind of men vſed to turne their backes), and would haue ſhooke off his vnweeldy cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe, that compaſſed him round about, to bee ſo much the lighter; I ranne after him, being aſſured hee was ſome poore diuell of very little courage, that would thus runne away. Then began hee to cry aloud, Downe with your weapon, downe with your weapon, I threw away my pole that ſerud me for a ſword, and being neere him I ſaid, Whoſoeuer thou be, thy humour is but baſe and cullion-like to feare death, hauing no life at all in thee: but in a trembling note he anſwered me, It is the
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:9060:8"/>
nature of cowards, eſpecially of rich ones, to feare blowes, and auoid quarrels: but ſaid I, let's leaue this talke, and tell mee wherefore thou commeſt hither: is it to reuenge thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters death?</p>

                     <p>No, but he hath armed me as thou ſeeſt, and ſent mee to the Pariſian Gentlemen, to giue them notice, that hee hath made them Executors of his laſt Will and Teſtament.</p>

                     <p>Somewhat more couragious then my ſelfe, for hee is perſwaded that being once dead, he can be ſlaine no more; therfore was he not very valiant, but hee reſerued himſelfe to giue the laſt ſtroke for Soiſſons, if others
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9060:9"/>
could not haue compaſſed it, and had very ſhortly beſieged it, had not the riuer preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9060:9"/>
all France with troubles: my maſter truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he indeed began the troubles, but if that himſelfe had not for many yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried a great hand in the buſineſſe, the peace had ſoone returned; and though he had not giuen ſuch a blow, yet his heart was good enough to doe it; for it plainly appeared that he &amp; the King could not raign together: with other ſuch reaſonings that were by <hi>Rhadamant</hi> thus determined, that it was to bee confeſſed, that if <hi>Rauaillack</hi> were taken for the maſter, his apprentice would in the end ſurpaſſe him.</p>

                     <p>O my God, how I feare his return being baniſhed out of hell! which if it happen, on my faith I'le ſell all I haue, and goe to hell, for I eſteeme nothing ſo great a hell, as to be ſubiect to the power of that Tyrant. Theſe things are deteſted by all good-minded French men: I pray thee let vs there leaue them, &amp; returne we to the cauſe of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: and firſt of all let vs heare a word of the eſtate and fortunes of thy Maſter.</p>
