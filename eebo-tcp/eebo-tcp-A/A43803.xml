         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>Becauſe for want of ſuch Expedients, whereby Induſtry, and the Woollen Manufactory may be effectually promoted, our Wooll is fallen from 12 <hi>d.</hi> to 6 <hi>d. per</hi> pound, by reaſon that the number of the people at preſent employed therein, are not able to convert our Wooll half ſo faſt as it grows; ſo that it ſeems very unreaſonable to prohibit the Exportation of unwrought Wooll, whilſt the Expedients by which it may be converted at Home are rejected.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe, that as our Clothiers and Merchants do infallibly demonſtrate, that the Exportation of unwrought Wooll, hath deſtroyed our Forreign Markets for the Sale of our Cloth; ſo it is as eaſie to be demonſtrated, that had not ſuch quantities of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll been exported, as at preſent there is in abundance, it would have fallen from 12 <hi>d.</hi> to 3 <hi>d. per</hi> pound; becauſe as the Stock of Wooll increaſes, the Price muſt decreaſe. So that there is no way to raiſe the Price of Wooll, nor yet to keep it up where it is, but either the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be brought to extreme Poverty, or made to encreaſe mightily in Wealth and Power, <hi>viz.</hi> either we muſt Export
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34639:4"/>
our Wooll, asdaily (eſpecially within theſe laſt nine Months) we do to thoſe that deſtroy our Trade thereby, or bring all idle, poor people to Induſtry, to convert it at Home as faſt as it grows; by which means only, our Wooll will ſoon mount to 12 <hi>d.</hi> yea, 18 <hi>d. per</hi> pound, which will alſo quickly remove the occaſion for the Exportation thereof. This being done, the Woollen Manufactures of <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. will ſoon be deſtroyed to that degree, as not to hinder the Sale of ours, ſeeing they cannot make Cloth without a Mixture of our Wool, but on very unequal Terms (as our Clothiers have affirmed before a Committee of the laſt Long Parliament.) Wherefore as the ready way to deſtroy the Wealth and Trade of our Nation, is to export our Wooll, and maintain our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of Poor in Idleneſs and Debauchery: So the moſt certain Expedient by which we may revive and regain the Woollen Manufactory, is to proſecute theſe Expedients that will bring all the people aforeſaid to Induſtry. By which we may raiſe the price of Wooll at Home, and afford our Cloth and Draperies cheaper than our Supplanters, in Markets A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; which is not to be done, but by the Expedients pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be objected, That if our Wool ſhould be raiſed to 18 <hi>d.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per</hi> pound, then other Nations will under-ſell us with Cloth they make of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wooll.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, this cannot be, becauſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wooll is ſo ſhort and fine, and the <hi>French</hi> ſo ſhort and courſe, that they will neither work together, nor yet apart, without a Mixture of ours, but upon very unequal Terms. The Truth of this is well known and affirmed by Perſons of good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Experience.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe in ſuch Houſes a Multitude may be inſtructed in Art and Skill in ſhort time without Difficulty or Charge: For beginning upon the very courſeſt: Wooll there can be no Loſs, but rather Advantage, becauſe, as the courſeſt Cloth is as ready Money as the fineſt, ſo the greater Quantity is made, the greater will be the Conſumption of our Wooll.</p>
                     <p>But if it be doubted, That by reaſon of our double encreaſe of Clothing, there will be want of Market for our Cloth. My Anſwer in ſhort, is, That if all the Wooll in <hi>Europe</hi> were converted in <hi>England,</hi> there would no more Cloth be made than what was before: For what Wooll is not converted here, is converted elſewhere; therefore the Trade for our Draperies will be as good as ever, and much better, ſeing by the Expedients and Methods propoſed, we may make and ſell our Cloth cheaper than our Supplanters. That we may under-ſell them is plain, becauſe we have greater Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than any of them; we having <hi>Fullar's Earth,</hi> they have none: Our Wooll is the kindeſt in the World to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without mixture of other; but they cannot convert theirs without ſome mixture of ours, unleſs upon coſtly and unequal Terms, for the Reaſon before-mentioned.

                     <p>Becauſe without theſe Expedients, the Wealth and Strength of the Nation will unavoidably be invaded and deſtroyed at the pleaſure of thoſe that are our Supplanters, becauſe the Woollen Manufactory is the grand Support of our Trade of Merchandize: For 'tis affirmed by ſome of very good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Judgment, that if all the Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> that are exported, were divided into Thirteen Parts, the Woollen Manufactures would make Ten of the Thirteen. So that if the Expedients which may promote and uphold the Woollen Manufactory be rejected, and our Supplanters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Trade, as of late years they very much have done, then of neceſſity, our flouriſhing Trade of Merchandize, which alone encreaſed our Wealth and Treaſure muſt be deſtroyed, together with our Seamen and Navies of Ships, to the Hazard and Ruine of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>But were it ſo, that we were upon equal Terms with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in reſpect of Induſtry, it is eaſie to be demonſtrated, that <hi>England</hi> would excell all Nations in the World in that Trade, which is the only Mother and Nurſe to bring forth, and encreaſe Riches, Seamen, and Navies of Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, if we conſider, that the United <hi>Netherlands,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Proviſions for Bread, Beer, Fleſh, Clothing, Timber, Iron, Materials for Manufactures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with their vaſt Expence to maintain their Land againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

ten times more than the Natural Product of their Land is worth; yet we know, that for Trade, Fulneſs of People, Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neys, Treaſure, Seamen and Shipping, they are more famous than any Nation in <hi>Europe.</hi> But now put Caſe their Induſtry were as little as ours, and that they alſo were to breed up and maintain their Poor for Begging, &amp;c. as we do in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> might we not then infallibly conclude, That within one Age, nay in twenty years they would be the pooreſt, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt deſpicable people in all the world. Wherefore we having all ſorts of proviſions for Food and Rayment, as it were for nothing, ſeveral hundred thouſand of people to be employed, and Materials enough of our own likewiſe for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to make the richeſt Manufactures. Our Induſtry, were it but proportionable to that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Wealth three times more and faſter than theirs. So that moſt plain it is, that <hi>Induſtry,</hi> not Money, is the Life of that Trade which encreaſeth both Money, Treaſure, Seamen, and Shipping.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, as theſe Houſes are the Mother of Induſtry, ſo 'tis moſt certain, That for want of the ſame Expedients, in every 100 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Wooll exported unwrought, there is 1000 <hi>l.</hi> loſſes to the Nation, our Wooll being at 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 8 <hi>d. per</hi> pound, as now it is; of which, if any be not ſatisfied, they may thus demonſtrate it to themſelves: A yard of Fine Broad-Cloth of 16 <hi>s.</hi> or 18 <hi>s.</hi> price will not exceed a pound in weight and the like for fine Worſted Stockins of 6 <hi>s.</hi> price will not weigh ſix ounces. So that put Caſe two pounds of Wooll ſhould be allowed for one pound, yet ſtill every Shilling in Wooll will amount to more than 10 <hi>s.</hi> in Cloth and Stockins, which is what was to be demonſtrated. Thus all this which might ſo have been got by Workmanſhip, &amp;c. being ten times the value of the Wooll is clearly loſt to the Nation, whileſt thoſe that might do it are maintain'd for Begging, &amp;c.</p>

                        <item>2. Wherefore there being as much more <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll to be converted, as is now converted by the preſent Courſe of Trade (as moſt certainly there is.) Then if all the people aforeſaid (being double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that are now Imployed therein) were brought to Induſtry, as by theſe Expedients they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and ſpeedily might, it as certainly follows, That a double quantity of Woollen Draperies would be made.</item>
                        <item>3.

                     <p>But put Caſe we have not Wooll enough to imploy all the people aforeſaid, yet the Expedients ſtill remain unſhaken, becauſe we may imploy them in making of Linnen with great Advantage; For as the firſt will bring Treaſure into the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; ſo the other will preſerve it from going out, (and then whether our Dead be buried in Woollen or Linnen it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not.)

                     <p>Nor may any Member that wiſhes well to the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> oppoſe it: For as for the Landlord, he above all men, ought to promote it, becauſe the Charge properly belongs to the Tenant or Poſſeſſor, who is accuſtomed to contribute to the Relief and Maintenance of the Poor.

                     <p>We know, that God always had a Nation, Church, and People in all Ages, (although in every Age ſubject to Error in an high degree) ſo alſo there was a <hi>Babylon, &amp;c.</hi> as a Rod in the Hand of God, to correct them for their wilful Failings and Offences. <hi>Litteral-Babylon</hi> in the time of the Law, and <hi>Myſtery-Babylon</hi> in the time of the Goſpel.

appointed; ſo that Miſery, Deſolation, Death, and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cruelties, do (as it were) ſtare in our Faces, and nothing remains for our Comfort but this, namely, That this Reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Bloody Rod, is in the Hands of a Gracious and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, who will aſſuredly throw it into the Fire before it ever hurt us, if the Crying Sins by which his moſt Holy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is moſt highly provoked and diſpleaſed, be put away, whereof this ever was, and now at this time, is one of the moſt intollerable and provoking Evils, namely, The lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Condition of thoſe many Thouſands of Poor People, Widdows, and Fatherleſs Children, the many Thouſands that have been, and are bred up in Ignorance, Idleneſs, and all manner of Debaucheries, unſerviceable to the Nation, unfit for Church-members, and that live and die moſt miſerably. And for this very thing which the Moſt High could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, God was offended, and his Wrath kindled againſt his own People, their Kings, and Nation, to that Degree, that he abhorr'd their moſt Solemn Services and Worſhip which himſelf had commanded. Yea, when by Faſting, Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they cried unto him, he would not hear, nor regard; it was Iniquity, even their Solemn Meeting, until this intollerable thing was effectually reform'd.</p>
                     <p>Which is an infallible Demonſtration, that God hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Regard to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than he had to the External Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Worſhip which himſelf commanded: And for this inſufferable Crime, he delivered his People into the Hands of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who worſhipped Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that the Sum of this is true, <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And that the ſame Love and Care for the one, and his Indignation againſt the other, remains and continues to this day, is alſo as certain. Witneſs our Saviour's Parable of the Rich Man and the Beggar; when the Rich Man, for being regardleſs of the Beggar's Condition, lift up his Eyes in the Flames of Hell, and finding it impoſſible to obtain Eaſe or Relief, made earneſt Requeſt in the behalf of his Brethren, That a Meſſenger might be ſent to teſtifie the Verity of the matter, that they might repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But behold the Anſwer

from Heaven was <hi>(No, let them alone) they have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> viz. their Sayings and Writings) if they will not hear them, neither will they be perſwaded if one aroſe from the Dead. Which doth plainly ſhew, that the Will and Mind of God, delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets in this matter, ſtill remains ſo unchangeable, that if a man ſhould keep all the Commandements of God beſides, and offend in this matter, it will profit him nothing: As is poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Chriſt, when upon this very occaſion, he turned himſelf from the hopeful Rich Man, whom he loved, and ſaid, <hi>How hard is it for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God: It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that for a Nation or Perſon to have more Love or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Worldly Wealth, than to the low and deſpicable Poor, though Beggars, or to defer the relieving them, appears to be one of the higheſt provoking Sins for which God will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd; and to ſum up the whole, it amounts to this, that although we worſhip no falſe God, nor bow to any Image, but do worſhip, the true God, according to his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do Faſt, pray, and humble our ſelves before him, and keep all the reſt of his Commandments from our Youth up; yet if we judge not the Cauſe of the Fatherleſs, and the Right of the Needy, ſhall not I viſit for theſe things, ſaith God?

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Scope or End aimed at, and promiſed by my former Propoſals, is, That all the Wool of <hi>England,</hi> and what <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have to ſpare, may be Manufactured in <hi>England,</hi> as faſt as it grows and ariſes, on ſuch Terms as that all the Cloth we have to ſpare, being exported, may find quick Markets as faſt as 'tis made.</p>
                  <p>The Expedients or means to Effect All this; are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt in General, To bring all poor People and idle hands to Induſtry.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in particular, as the only effectual Way or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to do this to the beſt advantage it is propoſed, <hi>That two or three, or more, Publick Work-houſes be Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in every County, where all ſuch poor people and idle hands may under good Government be conſtantly employed in that Manufacture,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which having been peruſed and conſidered by ſeveral Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirited Perſons, known Promoters of the Nations wealth and ſafety, they have generally very much approved and encouraged the ſaid Expedient, as moſt certain, feaſible, and effectual to accompliſh the great and good ends aforeſaid; If I could but propoſe ſuch a Method of Government in theſe Work-houſes as the Nation may be ſecured of theſe four things, <hi>viz.</hi> The Country from being cheated of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney raiſed for erecting and furniſhing ſuch Houſes; the Poor from being abuſed; unfit Perſons kept from being Officers and bearing Rule in them; and Juſtice from being wreſted ſo as not to redreſs Grievances and puniſh Offenders.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (with all ſubmiſſion to better Judgments) I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer ſuch a Method of Government, as far as concerns the preſervation of the Stock raiſed, and prevention of Frauds and Corruptions in Officers, as will, I conceive, remove all Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of any the before mentioned miſchiefs, that ſo all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <item>2. That theſe Overſeers, being Aſſembled, may have full Power to elect Governours, preſcribe Rules and Orders, chuſe Truſtees, appoint Officers, enquire into the Welfare of their reſpective Poor there, hear and redreſs their Grievances, ſee that they be not abuſed or diſcouraged, reform all diſorders, call each Officer or Truſtee to an account, turn them out, and elect new ones as often as they think neceſſary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which purpoſe they may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divide themſelves into ſeveral Companies, and diſpatch much buſineſs in little time.</item>

                     <item>3. That all Beggars, Vagrants <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have no habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor will earn their Livings in any lawful Imployment, be placed there.</item>

                     <item>2. As for that Houſe, 'tis nothing ſtrange that it did miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, rather it would have been ſtrange if it had not; ſince the perſons governing ſuch Houſes ought to be inferior to thoſe by whom they are intruſted, that the latter may ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily bring them to account, and if they find any one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, correct and turn him out of doors; whereas the Governors of <hi>Clerkenwell</hi> houſe were great men, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to raiſe money at pleaſure, not to be corrected, but by Act of Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that their quality, and buſineſs, or want of honeſty, hindred them from uſing that inſpection over inferior Officers as was neceſſary, and when money came into their hands, and was diverted who could force them to an account?</item>

A perſon intruſted in a Spin-houſe in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> was publickly whipt and turn'd out of doors for being partial, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe by his connivance a young woman, who was ſent thither to work for her living, made her eſcape. Another Officer was whipt and committed to the Raſp-houſe, for diminiſhing what was allowed for the comfortable maintenance of the Poor. At <hi>Leiden</hi> I ſaw a fellow moſt ſeverely whipt upon a Scaffold, erected for

                     <item>4. If becauſe that Houſe, meerly for want of right method, and perſons of fit qualifications to govern it, miſcarried, therefore no ſuch Houſes muſt be made uſe of; may not our Merchants as well conclude, that becauſe ſome Ships, for want of an honeſt fit Maſter or skilful Pilot, have been caſt away; therefore tho there be men enough whoſe qualifications and integrity are ſufficient, yet they will never venture to ſend forth any more Ships; If you ſay the caſe is different, for tho the Houſes have failed, yet we know moſt of our Ships return ſafe, then I may return you the ſame anſwer; In <hi>Holland</hi> none of theſe Houſes fail, therefore if we take right method of government, our Houſes will not fail ſo often as our Ships, and will become as profitable to the Kingdom, for if the Houſes proſper, to be ſure our Shipping will increaſe, therefore whoever is an enemy to theſe Houſes, is as great an enemy to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our Ships and Seamen, and conſequently an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the true, Wealth, Safety and Intereſt of the Engliſh Nation.</item>
