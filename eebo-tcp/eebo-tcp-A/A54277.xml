            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon the 28th day of the Month called <hi>July,</hi> 1670. I being required by the Lord, to pack up all the Books, of what kind or ſort ſoever that I had, with an intention to have had them carried to a Friends of mine in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> near the <hi>Exchange;</hi> it was ſo ordered, That as I was going through the ſaid <hi>Exchange,</hi> it was with me to ſit down and reſt me, and accordingly ordered the two Porters to reſt themſelves; the one of them had two great Bags full of Books, and the other had one Bag filled much with old News-Books, eſpecially at the top; for I ſaw no other in it, when I opened it; which I did there, having ordered one of the ſaid Porters to carry a little parcel to my ſaid Friends, (where I purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have carried the ſaid Books) and deſired him to bring me a Candle; againſt which time I had taken out two or three waſte papers in my hand, and withal bid one of the Porters bring that Bag after me; ſo going to the middle of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> (I bid the Porter pour out the Books) and having put fire to the papers in my hand, with two or three of thoſe News-Books, the man that was ſweeping the <hi>Exchange</hi> was ordered to put it out, there being (ſo near as I could judge) not the quantity of a quarter of a ſheet of paper burnt. Now whereas it is imagined, and ſaid, that I would have burned all thoſe Books, I have this to ſay, That if they would have given me a Candle to have burned all, or any one of them there more then what was already done, I would not; I ſay, I ſhould not have done it to have gained the Treaſures of the whole World.</p>

               <p>This following being a Copy of a Letter, which I writ to a Kinſman, who I heard had been the occaſion of putting one in Priſon for the Teſtimony of his Conſcience towards God, I am willing it ſhould be thus publiſhed for the ſatisfaction of all ſuch that deſire to know the truth in this matter.</p>

            <p>I Underſtand that thou haſt been inſtrumental to put one <hi>Abraham Bonnyfield</hi> in Priſon, for the teſtimony of his Conſcience towards God; the which if he ſhould violate, yea, I ſay, if he ſhould violate in the leaſt, it had been better for him he had never been born: Now if the caſe be ſo, what will become of thee, and all ſuch as thou art, who as much as in you lies, endeavour to force men to violate the Law of the Living God, written and implanted in the heart? O take heed, and turn to the Lord before it be too late, and the things belonging to thy everlaſting peace be bid from thy eyes; for yet a little while, and the Voice ſhall be, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi> O! whilſt it is called to day, take heed, for the day of viſitation (from the Lord) is come; bleſſed and happy, yea for ever happy will they be that can receive it. Yea, the day is come, that many that have been firſt, ſhall be laſt; and many that are laſt, ſhall be firſt.</p>
            <p>I am now a Priſoner in the Priſon at <hi>Biſhops-gate;</hi> and the rumor is, That I would have burned the Bible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concerning which, I have this to ſay, That rather than I would burn that Book, (or the leaſt Leaf thereof that might be ſerviceable) I ſhould rather chuſe, had I as many lives to loſe as I have hairs on my head, yea, and every life to be taken from me by the exquiſite torment that the wit (and wickedneſs) of man could invent; I ſay, rather than wilfully (or by the command of any mortal) burn that Book, I ſhould rather chuſe to be ſacrificed in the ſaid torments.</p>
