         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>NGLANDS</hi> Intereſt and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conſiſts chiefly in the increaſe
of ſtore and trade.</p>
            <p>Store comprehendeth all ſuch
commodities,<note place="margin">Of ſtore and trade in ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neral.</note> as either the ſoil, or people of
this nation are capable to produce, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſefull at home, or valuable abroad.</p>
            <p>Trade is the means; by which a nation may
procure what they want from abroad, and vent
to the beſt advantage, what ever may be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of their own increaſe at home.</p>
            <p>Of ſtore there are properly two ſorts, natural
and artificial.</p>
            <p>Our natural ſtore may alſo be divided into
three parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt the annual increaſe of the ſoil, which
conſiſts chiefly in corn of all ſorts, and all the
beſt ſorts of cattel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the product of our mines, of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58647:6"/>
lead, tin, iron, coal, allum, and the like.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the great plenty of fiſh our ſeas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
afford, of which we might reap un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
advantages, were our fiſhing trade
rightly improved.</p>
            <p>Our Artificial ſtore conſiſts in the manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and Induſtry of the people, of which the
chiefeſt in this nation are the manufactures of
woollen clothes, and all other ſorts of woollen
ſtuffs, linen cloth, ſilk, ſtuffs, ribbandings,
ſtockings, laces, and the like.</p>
            <p>In trade there may be likewiſe ſaid to be
two kinds.</p>
            <p>The one trade at home, one with another:
the other our trade, or traffick abroad with
ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>And in each of theſe particulars, by the
bounty of nature and divine providence, this
nation doth not onely equal any neighbour
countrey, but far excels in all the moſt profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
advantages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> we know to be a nation,<note place="margin">Of the trade of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> rich, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and plentifull; and this onely by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of its own ſtore, raiſed both by the fruit
of the ſoil, and induſtry of the people; conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in corn, wine, and many ſorts of fruits, and
great manufactures of all ſorts of ſilks, linen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes,
laces, and many other rich commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which do not onely ſtore them at home,
with what they need, but by the overplus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58647:6"/>
for all things elſe, they neceſſarily want
from abroad; with plenty of money to boot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> hath not much of its own ſtore,<note place="margin">Of the trade of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>
eſpecially not anſwerable to ſupply the wants
of that nation; and yet by their induſtrious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in trade, they are not onely furniſhed
with whatſoever the world affords and they
want, but by the profit of their trade they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
in plenty and riches, all their neighbour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Two things therefore appear to be chiefly
neceſſary,<note place="margin">Riches and people neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the greatneſs and power of a nation.</note> to make a nation great, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
which is to be rich, and populous; and this
nation enjoying together all thoſe advantages,
with part whereof onely, others grow great and
flouriſhing; and withall, a Prince, who above
all things delights and glories in his peoples
happineſs: this nation can expect no leſs then
to become the moſt great, and flouriſhing of
all others.</p>
            <p>But private advantages are often impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of publick profit;<note place="margin">The preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice private Intereſts often are to publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</note> for in what any ſingle
perſon ſhall be a looſer, there, endeavours will
be made to hinder the publick gain, from
whence proceeds the ill ſucceſs that commonly
attends the endeavours for publick good; for
commonly it is but coldly proſecuted, becauſe
the benefit may poſſibly be ſomething remote
from them that promote it; but the miſchief
known and certain to them that oppoſe it, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58647:7"/>
Intereſt more then reaſon commonly ſways
moſt mens affections.</p>
            <p>Whereby it may appear, how neceſſary it is
that the publick profits ſhould be in a ſingle
power to direct, whoſe Intereſt is onely the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the whole.</p>
            <p>The greateſt thing therefore that any Prince
can aim at,<note place="margin">How to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the people of this nation.</note> is to make his dominions rich and
populous, and by what means it may be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this nation, beyond all neighbour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate: People
and plenty are commonly the begetters the
one of the other, if rightly ordered.</p>
            <p>And firſt to increaſe the people of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
permiſſion would be given to all people
of foreign countreys, under ſuch reſtrictions as
the ſtate ſhall think fit, freely to inhabit and
reſide within this kingdom, with liberty to buy
or ſell lands or goods, to import or export any
commodities, with the like priviledge and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that <hi>Engliſh</hi> men have.</p>
            <p>This would quickly increaſe the number of
our people, and multiply our riches: for thoſe
people that would come from other countreys
to inhabit here, would alſo bring their riches
with them, which if they laid out in the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of eſtates, or improvement of our trade,
or were onely their perſons rightly employed;
it might very much increaſe, both the riches
and power of this nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58647:7"/>
But it may be demanded why we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that people ſhould leave their own native
countreys to come and inhabit here,<note place="margin">Why forei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deſire to inhabit here.</note> when
they enjoy already as many priviledges as here

            <p>Theſe reaſons may be given,</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> that this countrey in it ſelf is as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,

others, and ſuppoſe it onely equal with the
reſt; yet in humane prudence it is moſt eligible,
and to be preferred by the Prince of this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before all others.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> becauſe thereby, he remains the onely
Supreme, under God, in theſe dominions; and
controllable by none: whereby his power in
government is much confirmed, and the peace
of his people ſecured; when if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(as in ſome it is) that mens conſciences
were at the diſpoſe of others; who uſe their
power onely to the advancement of their own
wealth, pride and greatneſs; it cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that the Princes Intereſt and theirs may
often differ; which can never happen but to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58647:8"/>
Princes great hazard, and peoples ruine; of
which truth, there hath been already too many
ſad examples in this kingdom; ſo as I conceive,
there needs little more be ſaid to perſwade a
Prince, to prefer his own peace, ſecurity and
freedom, above the perſwaſions of any, that
onely ſeek their own private Intereſt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon.</note> for the Prince of this nation, to
profeſs the reformed Proteſtant Religion, is a
matter of greateſt policy and prudence, for the
advance of his own power and greatneſs: For
as it is ſaid before, conſidering how deſireable
the countrey is in it ſelf, and the onely chief in
<hi>Europe</hi> of this profeſſion; and the hazardous
and dangerous condition of thoſe in other
countreys, and the power that the perſwaſions
of mens conſciences have, to prevail with them,
he may always be aſſured of this, that where
any of this profeſſion in other countreys, ſhall
happen to be perſecuted or injured, by a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
party of a contrary belief, their refuge will
certainly be to him, either to be received as his
Subjects in his own countrey, or elſe to offer
their ſervice to help him to become Lord of
their own; or otherwiſe, if quarrels or differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhould happen to ariſe between this Prince
and the Prince of any other neighbour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
if they ſhould make war upon him, he
would be aſſured of friends abroad to help to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58647:9"/>
divert them, or if he ſhould finde it fitting to
attach others, he cannot want confederates
and aſſiſtants in the proſecution of his deſigne,
eſpecially if there be any thing of pretence of
Religion in the caſe: which is ſeldom wanting,
where it is any ways ſerviceable to advance a
deſigne.</p>
            <p>But by the way it is to be obſerved, that as
this may be of certain advantage to this Prince
againſt others, ſo would it be of like miſchief
to himſelf or worſe, ſhould he ſuffer the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of any other Prince to have the like advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
againſt him; and in this kinde there is but
one profeſſion which is ſo conſiderable, either
amongſt our ſelves at home, or in countreys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that is worthy the taking notice of, and
it is ſo Catholick as I ſhall not need to name it.<note place="margin">The danger for the Prince of this nation to tolerate any other Religion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And though Chriſtians ought not to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
one another, and that onely for ſmall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
in opinion, when what is right or
wrong for the moſt part remains a doubt and
uncertain; whil'ſt the evils are onely certain
that ſuch diſputes produce.</p>
            <p>And as it may be truly ſaid, morality may be
ſhort of true Religion, yet it is moſt certain,
that no Religion can be pure that wants true
morality; I ſhall onely therefore make this
ſhort obſervation, That that Religion which
ſhall endeavour to advance it ſelf by all immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and wicked ways and means, muſt needs be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58647:9"/>
in that particular much defective. And though
this be commonly practiſed by moſt, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the danger is greater from that whoſe
profeſt principle it is, then from ſuch others,
who (though often guilty) yet wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
it. And what Prince, or ſtate is likely to
eſcape miſchief, or be ſecure; when opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is offered to thoſe, who by ties of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are obliged to ruine it: and have Intereſt
and ſubtilty enough to contrive the ſame? all
which being rightly weighed and conſidered,
it is evident, how perilous, and deſperate a thing
it might prove, if it were onely on account of
policie, and ſelf-preſervation, for a Prince to
admit or countenance ſuch things, which have
not the leaſt ſhew or appearance of good, or
advantage, but in all likelihood, of moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hazard and ruine, both to himſelf and
State.</p>
            <p>But granting what is ſaid to be true, yet
what can be objected againſt the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
or at leaſt toleration of all ſuch other ſorts
of Chriſtian profeſſions, who pretend they
have not the will, nor probably can have the
power, to contrive or act any thing conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the damage, or diſquiet of the Prince
or State.</p>
            <p>It may be anſwered, that the toleration of
all ſuch in it ſelf doth not appear altogether
ſo dangerous to the Prince, or State: But if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58647:10"/>
nature of man be rightly conſidered, together
with the common zeal in matters of Religion,
you ſhall finde, that commonly things of the
ſmalleſt conſequence make the greateſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and as the ſame faith and belief, doth
very much increaſe love and affection, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe
difference in opinions, do onely beget
and engender contempt, &amp; animoſities towards
one another; by which means the Prince ſhall
at no time be either quiet, or ſecure. For ſhould
the Prince ſuffer all indifferently, and not elect
ſome one which ſhould always be countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and maintained as the chief, and moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
profeſſion of his kingdom: the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would be ſo great, and the Princes Intereſt
ſo ſmall amongſt them, for want of any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
on him; that a kingdom ſo divided
againſt it ſelf, could not ſtand.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, ſhould the Prince
firſt ſettle a government in the Church, as it is
at this day, and then give toleration to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
the miſchievous conſequence would not
be much leſs; for firſt, all ſuch as would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
would not without grudging pay their
dues to parſons, from whom they receive no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
nay rather, whom they contemn
and hate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, upon all invaſions from abroad, or
rebellions at home, the Prince ſhall be ſure to
have all ſuch for his enemies, as ſhall be ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58647:10"/>
Firſt, becauſe of their certain hatred to the
preſent Church-government: by which they
conceive, that they receive many injuries, and
oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in hope every one to advance
their own party, could they remove the power
in being; each imagining their own opinion as
the moſt worthy, would firſt take place.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, where ſuch advantages are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to ſtrengthen any diſcontented party, no
Prince can hope, or expect to be long quiet or
ſecure.</p>
            <p>Theſe miſchiefs and inconveniences, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of long time been ſo obvious; it hath been
thought by ſome, that a ſtrict uniformity in
Church-government, is the onely means to
prevent all the aforeſaid inconveniences.</p>
            <p>I conceive it cannot well be denied,<note place="margin">What is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in ſettling a ſtrictt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</note> but then
care would be taken, that what is ſo impoſed,
be onely ſuch things as are barely neceſſary
and ſuch as may agree beſt with the quiet and
preſervation of the State. And in this alſo
good regard would be had, to the moſt ſober
way of the ſame profeſſion in other countreys;
which would much advance the deſigne afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
and in all likelihood would preſerve the
Princes power more entire, and his people in
greater fidelity, love and peace.</p>
            <p>Bnt to return to the cauſe that firſt moved
this diſcourſe, as a means to multiply people,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58647:11"/>
and enrich the kingdom, it may be objected;</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Objections againſt the ways and means to multiply people.</note> that it doth not appear that people
are wanting, but rather that we have already
too many, if we conſider the number of poor
people that are found in every place; and it
might be prudence, firſt, to employ theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we endeavour to multiply more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that to give the like liberty and
priviledge to foreiners, that <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> have,
might be a means to undo the natives; for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners
by their Correſpondents abroad, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
at home, will gain all the trade to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and alſo by purchaſing of eſtates, will
make our land much the dearer.</p>
            <p>It is anſwered firſt,<note place="margin">The Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> it is true conſidering our
preſent condition, how trade is decayed, and
the little encouragement people have to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
we have already more people then are
well employed; but I conceive, it is ſo much
the greater damage to the Prince, to have his
people both few and poor; but if the manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and other profitable employments of this
nation, were rightly improved and encouraged,
there is no doubt but the people, and riches of
the kingdom might be greatly increaſed and
multiplied, both to the profit, and honour of
the Prince.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that any <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> of the like
ingenuity as a ſtranger, will have the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of trade, as any ſtranger can have, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58647:11"/>
to the exportation or importation of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
for they may have their correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
abroad as well as the other, yet ſuppoſe
they could not, it would be no damage to the
kingdom, but an advantage, if the Subjects by
this means be more plentifully and cheaply
provided with all forein commodities, and may
gain a better price, and vent for their own, and
the number and Intereſts that can pretend to
ſuffer hereby, are ſo few, and inconſiderable,
that it bears no proportion with the advantage.</p>
            <p>And further, by this liberty to foreiners, we
ſhould quickly attain to the perfection of thoſe
manufactures, which now we ſo highly value
and purchaſe ſo dear from abroad: for many
of the beſt Artiſts of other countreys, no
doubt in ſhort time would be tranſported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
perhaps no leſs to the benefit of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then the like encouragement hath been
in former times, by the improvement of our
art of clothing; and by which practice the
<hi>Hollander</hi> at this day reaps unknown advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And as for raiſing the price and value of
our lands, or of any thing elſe that is our own;
it is of ſo great an advantage, that it might be
wiſhed, nothing were cheap amongſt us but
onely money.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in order,<note place="margin">Of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtore.</note> and firſt of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſtore, and annual increaſe of the ſoil, the
annual profit and increaſe of the ſoil of this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58647:12"/>
kingdom, conſiſts chiefly in corn of all ſorts,
flax, hemp, hops, wooll, and many more ſuch
like; and alſo the beſt ſorts of cattel, as bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,
horſe and ſheep, and the greater our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
is of any of theſe commodities, the richer
may we be; for money, and all forein commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
that come hither, are onely bought by
the exchange of our own commodities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by how much our own ſtore doth exceed
thoſe neceſſaries we want from abroad, by ſo
much will the plenty of money be increaſed
amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Our care ſhould therefore be,<note place="margin">Thoſe things to be chiefly increaſed that are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at leaſt charge, and are of greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue abroad.</note> to increaſe
chiefly thoſe things which are of leaſt charge
at home, and greateſt value abroad; and cattel
may be of far greater advantage to us, then
corn can be, if we might make the beſt profit
of them: for that the profit we can make of
any corn by exportation, is much hindred by
the plenty that neighbour countreys afford of
that commodity, as good or better then we
have any. Wherefore, could we employ our
lands to any thing of more worth, we could not
want plenty of corn, though we had none of
our own; for what we ſhould increaſe in the
room of it of greater value by exportation,
would not onely bring us home as much corn
as that land would have yeelded, but plenty of
money to boot.</p>
            <p>Of cattel, the moſt conſiderable are horſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58647:12"/>
ſheep, and bullocks, in all which we do not
onely excel in goodneſs all other countreys,
whereby we can vent the profits of them at far
greater rates, but we may alſo by our ſingular
advantage, in the increaſe of thoſe cattel, have
the ſole trade, being able ſo far to exceed our
own wants, as to furniſh all our neighbours,
who muſt be forced to good rates, no other
countrey affording the like for goodneſs, or
ſcarce ſufficient for their own uſe.</p>
            <p>And might we freely have the liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them, or ſo much of them as may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
we ſhould need no laws to hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of corn; for we ſhould finde thereby
a profit, ſo far exceeding that which might be
raiſed out of every acre, that we might better
afford to give a far greater price to buy it, then
we can now ſell it for. For the profit of one
acre of paſture, in the fleſh, hide and tallow of
an ox; or in the fleſh, wooll and tallow of a
ſheep; or in the carcaſe of a horſe, is of ſo
much greater value abroad, then the like yeeld
of the earth would be in corn; that the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of this nation might be at leaſt double
to what it is, if rightly diſpoſed. Wherefore it
is to be wiſhed, that the Supreme power would
ſo far tender the publick good, in which it is ſo
much concerned, as to remove all impediments,
and promote all endeavours, which tend to ſo
great and publick an advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58647:13"/>
The greateſt impediments in this Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are chiefly theſe.<note place="margin">The impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt men cannot make the beſt of their own
lands.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when they have, they cannot
fell the increaſe of it to the beſt advantage.
And theſe may be thus amended.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">How to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, and firſt by incloſure.</note> by a liberty for every man to enjoy his
lands in ſeveralty and incloſure; one of the
greateſt Improvements this nation is capable of;
or want whereof,<note place="margin">The damage that happens for want of incloſure.</note> we finde by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the profit of a great part of the
land and ſtock in this kingdom, as now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
is wholly loſt. And this appears, in
that the land of the common fields, almoſt in
all places of this nation, with all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that belong unto them, will not let for
above one third part ſo much, as the ſame land
would do incloſed, and always ſeveral. And on
the great commons, a houſe with commoning,
will not let for one quarter ſo much, as it would
do were its proportion ſeveral unto it. And all
this by reaſon of the many ſeveral Intereſts:
whence it is, that men cannot agree to employ
it to its propereſt uſe, and beſt advantage:
whereby much land is tilled with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and ſmall profit; and much land fed,
to the ſtarving of the cattel, and empover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing
the inhabitants; to the increaſe of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but beggery in this nation; all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58647:13"/>
would by incloſure be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected,<note place="margin">Objections againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures.</note> that many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
would happen by incloſure; and
chiefly, it would cauſe great depopulations and
ſcarcity of corn, as hath been conceived by
former Parliaments; which appears by their
oppoſing, rather then advancing of it; upon
this opinion, that incloſure would convert the
land to paſture; one hundred acres of which,
will ſcarce maintain a ſhepherd and his dog,
which now maintains many families, employed
in tillage; and by experience it is found, that
many towns, which when their lands were in
tillage had many families, now they are inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
have not ſo many inhabitants in them.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that incloſures would not have been
oppoſed, had it not appeared, that moſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
endeavoured it; which is a greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Improvement; for did not the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
ſuppoſe it would improve his land to a
higher value; he would never have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to do it; and the reaſon why it would
have been of greater advantage to the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
is becauſe the tenant could make more
profit of it, or elſe we ſhould not finde them ſo
greedy after paſture, at ſo high a rate, when
they may have arable enough for half the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;
and this proves incloſure is profitable,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58647:14"/>
ſince the ſame land is thereby raiſed to a far
greater value.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as for corn, it would be nothing
the ſcarcer by incloſure, but the rather more
plentifull, though a great deal leſs land were
tilled: for then every ingenious husband would
onely plow that land that he found moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for it, and that no longer then he found it
able to bring him profit: ſo as he would out of
one acre, raiſe more corn then in the common
field can be raiſed of two, whereby one acre
would be ſaved for other uſes, beſides the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of mens and cattels labours; whereas in
the common fields, where the tenant doth not
plow, the profit of the land is loſt; whereby
he is forced to a continual plowing, though to
the ruine and damage both of the land, and of
himſelf: ſo as that land, labour, and charge
is loſt, which otherwiſe might be employed,
to the profit and advantage of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as to depopulations by incloſures,
granting it increaſeth plenty, as cannot well be
denied, how increaſe and plenty can depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
cannot well be conceived: nor ſurely do
any imagine that the people which lived in
thoſe towns they call depopulated, were all
deſtroyed, becauſe they lived no longer there;
when indeed they were onely removed to other
places, where they might better benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and profit the publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:58647:14"/>
Certainly they might as well think the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
undone, ſhould they obſerve how <hi>London</hi>
is depopulated in a long vacation, when men
are onely retired into the countrey, about their
private and neceſſary employments; and the
like might they think of the countrey in the
Term time, yet a man is not thereby added,
or diminiſhed to the nation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as many or more families may
be maintained and employed, in the manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the wooll that may ariſe out of one
hundred acres of paſture, then can be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a far greater quantity of arable; who
perhaps do not always finde it moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for them to live, juſt on the place where
the wooll groweth; by which means cities and
great towns are peopled, nothing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then if by incloſure the land it
ſelf is raiſed to a greater value, and a leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
capable of a greater increaſe, and if really
it cauſeth no depopulations, but at moſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of people thence; where without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the publick, or profit to themſelves,
they laboured and toiled, to a more convenient
habitation, where they might with leſs pains
greatly advantage both: And if the manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and other profitable employments of
this nation are increaſed, by adding thereto
ſuch numbers of people, who formerly ſerved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58647:15"/>
onely to waſte, not to increaſe the ſtore of the
nation, it cannor be denied, but the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of incloſure, where every mans juſt right
may be preſerved, would infinitely conduce to
the increaſe and plenty of this nation, and is
a thing very worthy the countenance and care
of a Parliament.</p>

us of ſo great a treaſure, and therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worthy the publick care to maintain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage;
but the concernment of this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſo well known to every one to be ſo

            <p>In the next place,<note place="margin">Of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures.</note> our manufactures are to
be conſidered, on which chiefly depends both
the wealth and proſperity of this kingdom; for

            <p>The chief manufactures amongſt us at this

of all ſorts, ſtockings, ribbandings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome few ſilk ſtuffs, and ſome other
ſmall things ſcarce worth the naming; and
theſe already named ſo decayed and adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Our manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures very much decayed.</note>

            <p>And this will more plainly appear, if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

the vaſt ſums of money the <hi>French</hi> yearly

above ten hundred thouſand pounds a year.
By which it appears that our trade with <hi>France,</hi>
is at leaſt ſixteen hundred thouſand pounds a
year, clear loſt to this kingdom:</p>
            <p>Whereby the King of <hi>France,</hi> finding it
would prove to his loſs, to forbid the trade with

raiſed the cuſtoms of ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi>

hindred.</p>
            <p>Hereby it may appear how inſenſibly our
treaſure will be exhauſted, and the nation beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd,
whil'ſt we careleſly neglect our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and ſtrangers abroad are diligent to make

            <p>But moſt of theſe evils would be eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,<note place="margin">Means to redreſs this miſchief.</note>
if onely his Majeſty would be pleaſed

               </gap>o commend to his people, by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the eſteem and value he hath of his
own commodities, in which the greateſt Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
may be as honourably clad, as in the beſt
dreſs, <hi>Paris,</hi> or a <hi>French</hi> Taylour can put him
in; beſides it ſeems to be more honourable
for a King of <hi>England,</hi> rather to become a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
to his own people, then to conform to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58647:18"/>
humours and fancies of other nations, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when it is ſo much to his prejudice.</p>
            <p>This alone, without further trouble, would
be at leaſt ten hundred thouſand pounds a year,
to the advantage of his people; for the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
always endeavour to imitate the Prince,
being deſirous to obtain his favour, which
they can no way better do, then by approving
his actions in being of like humour: and the
Court being the copy that the Gentry ſtrive
to write after, and the reſt of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
follow; it appears of what great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
and advantage the good example
of a Prince, is to the benefit of his people.</p>
            <p>And whereas it ſometimes hath been thought
prudence in a Prince,<note place="margin">Expence in apparel to be countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under ſome reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> to forbid and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the exceſs of apparel in his Subjects;
whereby many of the nobility themſelves have
ruined their families, and moſt of the Gentry
have been impoveriſhed; whereby the great
expence, and waſte of treaſure in that vanity
doth appear: yet I conceive, in a convenient
manner it rather ought to be maintained, and
encouraged, onely obſerving theſe rules.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the vanity of the expence do
not depend on ſuch commodities, as have too
much of the ſubſtance of gold, ſilver, or ſilk;
whereby the publick treaſure is waſted and
loſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that we impoveriſh not our ſelves
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58647:18"/>
to enrich ſtrangers, by that unnatural vanity,
in preferring forein commodities though worſe,
before our own, that are better.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the exceſs of this expence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
chiefly in the art, manufacture and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
of the commodity made in our own
countrey; whereby ingenuity would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
the people employed, and our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
kept at home, ſo as the Prince would be
nothing damnified by the exceſs: for the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of one would raiſe as much another of his
Subjects; and money would thereby be more
moving, which would be a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſatisfaction to the people.</p>
            <p>To name the particulars of ſuch commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as would hereby be increaſed, would be
endleſs and needleſs, when in a word it is,
whatever at preſent we purchaſe from abroad,
which we might as well raiſe of our own at
home. But ſome perhaps may ſay, that this
would deſtroy our trade abroad, for many of
our commodities are vented, by the exchange
of them for other commodities we bring home
in return.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it is no prejudice to loſe that trade,
which is a loſs to keep; and if our importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of forein commodities be of far greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
then our own exportations, our treaſure
muſt needs be waſted to even the balance; and
ſo our own people remain idle and poor, for the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58647:19"/>
vent of one thouſand pounds worth of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
abroad, is of little advantage to the
people, if thereby they are hindred of the vent
of two thouſand at home.</p>
            <p>Wherefore theſe particulars conſidered,<note place="margin">The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Prince, to increaſe the manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and trade of his people.</note> it is
evident of what great concernment it is to a
Prince, to encourage and increaſe the trade, and
manufacture of his own people. And ſo much
concerning trade at home.</p>
            <p>In the next place concerning our trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
with ſtangers,<note place="margin">Concerning our trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and what is freely to be exported.</note> and this would alſo be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and increaſed by all means poſſible,
and when any commodity is raiſed to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
height it is capable of, it ſhould be free for
exportation, under ſo reaſonable cuſtoms, that
the Merchant may afford his commoditie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
as cheap as others, or elſe he would not
be able to vent it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">What freely to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</note> all forein commodities that are
uſefull, to improve our own manufactures and
trade abroad, and cannot be raiſed here, ſhould
be brought to us under eaſie cuſtoms, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to enable us at an eaſie exchange, to vent
our commodities abroad.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">What to be hindred and prevented.</note> all forein commodities whatſoever,
that are onely uſefull to be ſpent within the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that have already all their perfection,
as fruits, ſugars, wines, linen cloth, laces, ſilks,
and what elſe can receive no addition here, and
are not to be again tranſported; ſuch commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58647:19"/>
ſhould pay extraordinary cuſtoms, but
ſhould not be forbidden to be brought in: For
by this means, theſe commodities will be ſo
dear to the people, that it will much wean
them from ſo laviſh an uſe of them, as might
otherwiſe be, and for ſuch things as we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to raiſe, it will much increaſe it of our
own; whereby the State will raiſe a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and the countrey ſave their wealth,
that would be waſtfully ſpent abroad, and ſo
increaſe our own manufactures at home.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the increaſe of our land in any
kinde (except ſheep alive and mares) that
have already all the perfection that we can add
unto them ſhould be free for exportation,<note place="margin">The expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of horſes of greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
reaſonable cuſtoms; and of all things this
nation is capable to raiſe, there is not any one
of ſo great profit, as the exportation of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which of all commodities is of leaſt charge
to be raiſed at home, and of greateſt value
abroad. But to this may be many objections.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Objections.</note> that it will make horſes dear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the exportation of ſtone-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
may be prejudicial, by furniſhing others
with our breed.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it may enable our enemies who
may invade us, and we ſhall alſo weaken our
ſelves by ſending away our beſt horſes; with
other ſuch like objections.</p>
            <p>But to theſe it is anſwered,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58647:20"/>
Firſt,<note place="margin">The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> as for the dearneſs of any thing we
ſell to ſtrangers, the more money we get for
it by how much the dearer it is, and the onely
way to be rich, is to have plenty of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
to vent, that is of greateſt value a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
for what the price of any thing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, whether dear or cheap it
matters not; for as we pay, ſo we receive, and
the countrey is nothing damnified by it; but
the art is when we deal with ſtrangers, to ſell
dear and to buy cheap; and this will increaſe
our wealth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to vent ſtone-horſes, would be
of far better profit then to vent geldings; for
that a ſtone-horſe will give far more money,
with the ſame charge to us, beſides the loſs of
many horſes in gelding; and as for any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to our breed, I conceive it no danger, if
mares be not tranſported; for one horſe will
cover twenty mares as well as twenty horſe may
do: wherefore the increaſe of the horſes do
nothing increaſe the breed; and in <hi>France</hi>
where we ſhould beſt vent our horſes, they
have always horſes enough, and of very great
value and goodneſs, ſufficient for ſtallions; but
they have neither mares nor conveniency to
breed; for the countrey generally is all cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
corn-fields, and vineyards, and alſo ſo
unſafe to venture any cattel of ſuch worth
without ſtone walls to guard them, that ſcarce
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58647:20"/>
all the ſummer, either horſe or cow is left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the night, without a guard; beſides,
if they could breed, the breed of it ſelf would
prove degenerate, and ſoon be loſt, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
being naturally improper for it.</p>
            <p>As for enabling our enemies to invade us,
I conceive there is but little danger in that. At
preſent we have amity with all thoſe countreys
that deſire our horſes, and if at any time it
ſhould be found fitting, to forbid the tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of them, the prejudice that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by thoſe already tranſported, would ſoon
be paſt; for of five hundred horſes that ſhould
be tranſported, I verily beleeve in leſs then
five years, there would ſcarce be five remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Yet further, it doth not concern us to fear
any ſuch power in our neighbours, we having
no frontiers ſubject to ſudden incurſions; but
our defence conſiſts chiefly in another ſtrength,
which is our ſhips at ſea, which ſhould they
be inſufficient to guard us, I doubt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
want of our horſes would be but ſmall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>And as to the weakning of our ſelves, by
ſending away our beſt horſes, whereby we
may want for our own uſe, this I conceive is a
groundleſs fear, and wholly miſtaken; for
the good profit we ſhould make by a free vent
of this commoditie, would encourage every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58647:21"/>
husband, to be well provided with
what is ſo profitable; and every man would
endeavour, not onely to increaſe his breed,
but alſo to be curious in the goodneſs of them;
ſo as it will rather be a double advantage to us;
for as by the profit of thoſe we ſend abroad,
we ſhall greatly increaſe our wealth, and far
more by this means then by any other this
countrey is capable of, out of its own ſtore; ſo
we ſhall alſo have more choice, and plenty of
this ſo ſerviceable and profitable a creature,
both for uſe and pleaſure.<note place="margin">Concerning the return of money by exchange.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By the improvement of our trade as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
both at home and abroad, whereby our
exportations of commodities would exceed our
importations, a very great and ſignal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
would accrue not commonly taken notice

our returning money,<note place="margin">The preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> by bills of exchange,
in which at this preſent we ſuffer an unvaluable

muſt needs be waſted to even the balance,
and conſequently more money drawn by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
out of the countrey then is returned
back again; whereby we are forced to give far
more then the intrinſick value of the thing, to
receive our moneys beyond the ſea, to ſupply
our occaſions, the number being greater of
thoſe that deſire to receive moneys abroad,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58647:21"/>
then of thoſe that want it at home: for it is
in this as in all other commodities, where the
commodity is ſcarce, and the vent great, the

reaſons aforeſaid;<note place="margin">Our gold tranſporttd, and the reaſon.</note> and our gold being of leſs

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore to make laws to hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of coin or bullion, I conceive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe it doth nothing prevent it
where it is intended, and Secondly, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
caſes it is moſt advantageous to do it. For
in ſome countreys, ſome commodities are no
way to be purchaſed at cheaper rates, then
by money <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and if by the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and diſpoſing of our trade, our expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
did exceed our importations, in value,
our coin and bullion would be dayly increaſed;
there being no other means to even the balance
of trade.</p>

And here it may not be altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,<note place="margin">Concerning our money and coin.</note>
to ſpeak ſomething concerning our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58647:22"/>
Thirdly, our coin is not equal to the true
value of the ſilver, the coinage onely dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
for by the imperfection of our mint
the pieces of the ſame value are made ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that ſome ſhillings will weigh fourteen
pence, and ſome not above eight pence;
which afterwards, being new weighed over,
and culled by the goldſmiths, through whoſe
hands, moſt of our bullion paſſeth, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
ones are picked out, and onely the light
ones, and thoſe of under value, paſs for currant;
which is a moſt eminent abuſe and wrong to
the publick.</p>
            <p>Wherefore laſtly, in prevention to theſe
inconveniences, Firſt, our gold would be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in proportion to ſilver, at leaſt equal with
what it bears in <hi>France,</hi> and other countreys;
and if it be deſired to increaſe, chiefly that
<hi>ſpecies,</hi> a ſmall addition to the value will ſoon
do it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our mint and abaſes here at home.</note> the allay would be made the
ſame, with that in other countreys of <hi>Europe,</hi>
with whom we chiefly traffick.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the abuſes happening by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of our mint, as light and falſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in abundance;<note place="margin">How to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our mint ſo as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent moſt of theſe abuſes and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</note> any ill-favoured and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
falſe ſtamp, being hardly to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from the true, might eaſily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
by a more exact and curious ſtamp,
as may eaſily be made by the way of milling;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58647:23"/>
whereby not onely the coin will be more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
but alſo more equal in weight, and
much more difficult to be clipped and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited:
eſpecially if care be taken, to make the
pieces large and thin; which will not onely
ſhew more great and noble, but will many
ways be more eaſie to be diſtinguiſhed from
falſe, as by the ſound, ſtiffneſs, weight and
colour: it being both ſo difficult, and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to counterfeit money ſo formed, as few
will hazard to undertake it.</p>
            <p>Next,<note place="margin">Concerning our ſhipping and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> in order to our trade abroad, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at home, our ſhipping and navigation is to
be conſidered; the increaſe and preſervation
whereof, is of great concernment to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
ſafety, and well-being of this nation;
for which the late act for trade, by the late
pretended Parliament, did wiſely provide, by
ordering that no foreiner ſhould bring any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
hither, but what was the growth of
their own countrey; Whereby the <hi>Hambur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
and <hi>Flemming,</hi> that run hackney all
the world over, were a little ſtayed from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
hither crowding ſo thick, with all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
commodities as they were wont to do;
whereby little, or no employment could be
found for our own veſſels; every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo plentifully brought hither by them; and
at cheaper rates, then we our ſelves could
fetch them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58647:23"/>
But ſome perhaps may object,<note place="margin">Objections againſt it.</note> that ſure,
it was an advantage to us, to be ſo cheap and
plentifully ſtored with forein commodities,
when we cannot be ſo cheaply furniſhed by our
own ſhipping; for that we are at far greater
charge, both in goodneſs of ſhipping, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our men, and chargeable maintaining
of them more then others.</p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> it is true, that the ſame commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
brought hither in any of our own veſſels,
cannot be afforded ſo cheap as what might be
brought by others; by reaſon indeed, that
our ſhipping is much more chargeable, and
better manned then any other; but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly conſidered, it is rather an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
then a prejudice to the publick; for, if
commodities be thereby any thing the dearer,
here at home, yet, we buy them as cheap
abroad as any other; and all that others would
have gained of us by the carriage, will now
be earned of our own people; and whatever
it coſts the dearer to the purchaſer here, is no
prejudice to the publick, when our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
receives the profit of it; eſpecially it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the increaſe of that, in which conſiſts
the greateſt honour and ſafety of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Some might therefore think, that it
might be of no leſs advantage, to forbid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations to fetch any of our commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but to keep to our ſelves the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58647:24"/>
of the portage of them by our own ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, ſhould we do this, we can expect
no leſs, but that other nations would do the
like towards us, whereby we ſhould be very
much prejudiced.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that we ſhould then loſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
which now we have, in bringing fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
commodities home; and beſides, we ſhould
perhaps, want the vent of our own commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
which certainly will always ſell beſt,
where moſt chapmen are found to buy them;
ſo as by how much the cheaper they can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them, ſo much the more they will be
contented to give us here; moreover, the
greateſt part of our manufactures, are of ſo
great value, and ſo light of carriage, that a
ſmall advantage in the price, or a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vent, will ſoon compenſate the loſs of the
portage of them; but indeed, if the <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burger</hi>
and <hi>Flemming,</hi> were prevented in the
carriage of ſome of our more ſluggiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
as ſea-coal, lead, iron, allum, fiſh,
or the like where the charge of the carriage
many times is greater, then the whole va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the commoditie it ſelf, this might
poſſibly increaſe ſomething our navigation,
and yet hinder nothing the vent of thoſe
commodities, which others cannot at all be
without; and we ſhall not much need to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58647:24"/>
fear their requiting us in the ſame kinde;
for neither the <hi>Hollander,</hi> nor <hi>Hamburger,</hi>
have any ſuch commodities of their own;
as we need care to fetch; who are the onely
nation, that employ themſelves in this kinde
of trade.</p>
            <p>It may not alſo be improper,<note place="margin">Of fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>I conceive,<note place="margin">What chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and preſerving them.</note> no forein Plantation ſhould
be undertaken, or proſecuted, but in ſuch
countreys that may increaſe the wealth and
trade of this nation, either in furniſhing us,
with what we are otherwiſe forced to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
from ſtrangers, or elſe by increaſing
ſuch commodities, as are vendible abroad;
which may both increaſe our ſhipping, and
profitably employ our people; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
it is always carefully to be avoided,
eſpecially where the charge is greater then the
profit, for we want not already a countrey
ſufficient for double our people, were they
rightly employed; and a Prince is more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
that hath his ſtrength and force united,
then he that is weakly ſcattered in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But to deſcend to particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> what
commodities are moſt deſireable and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
advantage, and what countreys and climates
are moſt proper to increaſe them, would be too
tedious to treat of here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:58647:25"/>
There yet remains ſomething to be ſaid
concerning Merchants,<note place="margin">Concerning Merchants aſſociating themſelves in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> aſſociating themſelves
in companies, the benefit or prejudice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hath been often controverted, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
difficult to determine.</p>
            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Objections againſt it.</note> it is oppoſed by many, conceiving
the free liberty of trade,<note place="margin">The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> would be much more
advantageous in the general, becauſe theſe
companies, keeping the trade to themſelves
onely, will have what commodities are to be
vented abroad at their own price, and at an
under value; none having occaſion to buy
them but themſelves; whereby the workmen
are many times diſcouraged, and ſometimes
undone; and on the contrary, what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
are brought home in exchange, they
ſell at what unreaſonable rates they pleaſe,
the whole commoditie remaining in their
hands; whereby the people in general, are
very much damnified, and the companies
onely enriched; whereas, if the trade were
free, our own commodities having more chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
would ſell at better rates, and what is
brought home in return, would be diſtributed
at much cheaper prices amongſt the people.</p>
            <p>This is for the moſt part a truth, yet rightly
conſidering the thing, it rather ſeems an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in the whole, then the leaſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;
for indeed, as they make their profit at
home, ſo they make no leſs advantage abroad;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58647:25"/>
for the whole commoditie being in their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they will make the moſt that can be made of
it; none having the like commodities to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſell
them; and the like advantage they
have again in what they buy; whereby in
truth our own commodities are ſold the dearer
to ſtrangers, and forein commodities bought
much the cheaper; when both would happen
contrary in a free trade, where each will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſell
the other, to vent moſt, and alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
at any rates, to prevent the reſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
many times the trade is wholly loſt,
particulars being often too weak to maintain
and undergo it, and there is nothing leſs of
a commoditie vented by a company, then by
ſingle perſons; for they will always furniſh,
as much as the trade requires; the more they
vent, the more being their profit. Whereby
it may appear, that companies, both vent our
own commodities to the beſt advantages and
buy cheapeſt what we want from ſtrangers;
and the prejudice that may happen by them to
the workmen, or home chapmen, is fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
by the clear profit they return to
the publick; of which they are members, as
well as others. But if their particular profits
be thought too great, it may be ſomething
moderated by a free liberty, that every one
that pleaſe, may be admitted of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
on fit and reaſonable terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58647:26"/>
In the laſt place,<note place="margin">What In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt moſt proper to be allowed for the uſe of money.</note> concerning the uſe of
money; which being the life and ſinews of
trade, it hath been the opinion of ſome that
the greater uſe were allowed for money, the
more would be the profit of the publick; for
that ſtrangers, finding a greater benefit to be
made of their money here, then other where,
would ſend it hither; whereby money would
be much more plentifull amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I ſhould be of their opinion, if as
ſoon as by this means, great ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
were tranſported hither, all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſhould be confiſcate to the publick; but
if otherwiſe, ſure it cannot be denied, but
the greater the uſe the more the profit to
the uſurer, and loſs to the debter; ſo as in
a few years, we ſhould finde our ſelves ſo
little enriched thereby, that when the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ſhould be again recalled, we ſhould finde
but little money left; all our own being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in uſe: wherefore indeed the true bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to the publick is, to ſet the uſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as low, or rather lower then in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour
countreys it is; for then they would
make no profit out of us, by that means;
but rather we on them. And it is the clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that we get of our own, that will make
this nation rich; and not the great ſums we are
indebted to others.</p>
            <p>Many particulars more might ſeaſonably be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58647:26"/>
diſcourſed of, and this already touched, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by ſome other might be more exactly and
amply treated on; but theſe being the moſt
material things that I could call to memory,
and moſt conducing (in my opinion) to the
emprovement and proſperity of the nation,
and conſequently to my preſent deſigne; I
ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf with this eſſay; hoping
the ſubject being ſo worthy, ſome other more
skilfull and knowing pen, may be provoked
to enlarge it further.</p>
