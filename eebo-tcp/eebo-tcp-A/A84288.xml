            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EXHORTATION and ADMONITION OF THE Friends and Brethren OF LONDON CHIEFLY, To all MAID-SERVANTS (who make Profeſsion of the Pure Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel of Peace and Salvation) as are, or may be Servants in the Families of Friends or Others, in and about this CITY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE are come to the Morning of that Day which ſhall never have an End; and the Bright and Morning Star is Riſen in our Hearts, which ſhall never Set again; the True Everlaſting Light now Shineth; the Grace which bringeth Salvation is now Appeared; and the Kindneſs and Love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts, and we are made Partakers of it, whereby we are Conſtrained to Love Him again, and to Walk Worthy of all his Mercies, and to Watch over one another for Good; that all things may be done to the Praiſe and Glory of him, who is God Bleſſed forever and ever.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath Pleaſed God, after a Long Night of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, to Cauſe his Everlaſting Goſpel to be Preached again, and to ſpread the Knowledge thereof, and that now many are the Profeſſors of it; There is a Deſire in us, and a Care upon us, That all that Profeſs it, might Live the Life it requires, in all Holineſs of Converſation, as becometh the Church of God; and that nothing be done, that may be of Evil Report to them that are without.</p>
            <p>So Friends, You that are Maid-Servants, and make Profeſſion of the Truth of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; We deſire you to receive the Word of Exhortation, which we have in our Hearts for you, as followeth.</p>
            <p>Be Faithful in your Services and Places wherein you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: And be not Eye-Servants; but perform all things relating to you, as in the Sight of the Lord (whoſe Eye is over you) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Murmuring or Diſcontent: And ſhew forth a Meek and Quiet Spirit, Ready and Obedient to thoſe that have the Rule over you in all that is Good; whether you dwell with thoſe that are Partakers of the ſame Faith with you, or with thoſe that are Strangers to it: For we aſſuredly know, That if you abide in that which giveth you a Feeling and Enioyment of the Love of God, and thereby are made Partakers of the Vertue of his Truth in your Hearts, whether you dwell with Friends or Others, as Servants, you will be Engag'd by it, to uſe your Utmoſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and to be Careful and Circumſpect in all things you take in hand; that you may Adorn the Holy Truth you profeſs: And Excel thoſe that are Ignorant of it; and ſo be good Patterns and Enſamples, and a Good Savour, and Preachers of Righteouſneſs in your Places to all that behold you: So will the Bleſſing and Preſence of the Lord be felt in your Hearts, and make your Services Eaſie, and Miniſter a Reward of your Faithfulneſs into your Boſoms.</p>
            <p>And further, Friends; Our Exhortation is, That you Abide in your places, and not Move from Place to Place upon Sleight Occaſions; nor to count it Burthenſom, and Inconſiſtent with <hi>Chriſtian-</hi>Liberty, to be Servants; and ſo let in a Deſire after Eaſe, and Liberty to the Fleſh; and then incline to leave your Places, wherein is your Service for God, his Truth and People: and then take Rooms or Chambers for your ſelves to dwell in at your Own Hands; from whence many Inconveniencies and Evils have enſued, to our Grief and Trouble: Beſides, It is not of a Good Report to them that are without, That Maid-Servants, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Truth, ſhould leave their Services, and take Rooms to live by themſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore our Exhortation is, That as you tender the Precious Truth, and Us the Friends of it; Let none of you, for the time to come, (that have not ſerved Apprentiſhips to ſome Trade) Leave, or Depart from your Services, to Dwell by your ſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Pretence whatſoever; untill you have firſt obtained the Conſent and Approbation of the Monethly Meeting of Friends of that part where you dwell (who will be tender towards thoſe as are or may he Aged, or otherwiſe uncapable of going to Service) that things may be done in the Unity of the One Everlaſting Truth, in which our Fellowſhip ſtands, where we cannot lay hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Burdens upon one another, nor Grieve one another. But every one, in their Places, ſerving one another in that Bond of Love which cannot be broken, which brings all Relations into their Right Order; as, Maſters and Miſtreſſes to their Servants (not Turning them away Haſtily, but Patiently Inſtructing them) and Servants to their Maſters and Miſtreſſes; Parents to their Children, and Children to their Parents; the Elder and Strong to the Younger and Weak, and the Younger and Weak to the Stronger and Elder. And as this Bond of Love and Heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is Felt and Enjoyed by you all, it makes you Tender, and Eaſie to be Entreated to that which is Good.</p>
            <p>So, hoping We need not multiply more Words, to perſwade in this Matter, but that you will Obey and Fulfil this our Exhortation and Admonition; which is according to Sound Doctrine; We commend you to the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which hath Appeared in your Hearts, and is Ready and Sufficient to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to every Good Word and Work: In which Grace we remain.</p>
