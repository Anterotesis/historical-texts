            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and of the new Creature, is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in all places, and for all aſſemblies. This doctrine is fit for all perſons; it is fit for men of high degree, to cauſe them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke
<pb facs="tcp:21223:3"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. It is fit for men of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to cauſe them to know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. It is fit for the true iudicious hearer, to cauſe him to adde practiſe to his knowledge. And it is fit for the itching care or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearer, to teach him the true vſe of hearing Sermons, which is, not to haue his vncircumciſed eare carnally plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but rather to haue his poore ſoule regenerated, edified, and refreſhed. With <note place="margin">Ioel 1. 2.</note>this doctrine was <hi>Ioel</hi> ſent vnto the old men, and to all the inhabitants of the land. With this doctrine was <hi>Ionas</hi> ſent <note place="margin">Ionas 3. 4.</note>vnto Nineue, <hi>Fortie dayes, and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neue ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> With this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was Chriſt himſelfe ſent vnto the <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3.</note>loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael: <hi>Except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God.</hi> And with this doctrine is this weake meſſenger or ſmal Treatiſe ſent into the world at this time. I deſire that it might do much good vnto the ſoules of Gods elect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if it do, I do vnfainedly confeſſe, it is
<pb facs="tcp:21223:3"/>
not in reſpect of any worth or ſufficiency that is in the author, but meerly by Gods free bleſſing following my poore and weake endeuours.</p>
            <p>The reaſons which haue moued me to make this doctrine and Sermon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, are theſe, viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the conſideration of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of it: for what is more neceſſarie then to vnderſtand the myſterie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? without which no fleſh can be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the conſideration of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall extent of this doctrine: for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not onely them which heard the Sermon, but alſo all others; for <hi>God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 17. 30.</note>
               <hi>all men to repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the deſire of diuers holy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whoſe earneſt and godly requeſt I deſire to fulfill to my power.</p>
            <p>And in that I do commend vnto your Honour, theſe my poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours contained in this booke, it is:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21223:4"/>
Firſt, becauſe your Honour was an eare-witneſſe of this Sermon, enduring the coldneſſe of the ſeaſon, to heare it with much attention.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe your Honour hath purchaſed to your ſelfe a good report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, by your inſt and vpright ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in that worthy place and calling whereunto you are called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe your Honour hath had, and I hope will haue vnto the end, a ſingular care of Gods Sabbath, that it may not be profaned by the leudneſſe of men, which are more ſet vpon their own gaine and pleaſure, then in any ſort vpon Gods glorie: which deſire not onely to ſinne themſelues, but alſo to make Chriſtian magiſtrates partakers of their ſinnes, by giuing licence and libertie vnto them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that I might hereby teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my loue vnfained vnto this famous Citie; for the which I will alwayes pray, that God would turne his iudgements
<pb facs="tcp:21223:4"/>
from it, and preuent it with his liberall bleſſings, eſpecially in heauenly things in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beſeech your Honour to accept this Treatiſe, which I offer as the widowes mite, to be caſt into Gods treaſurie. And ſo I will pray</hi> the very God of <note place="margin">1.

               <q>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions whereby ye haue tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart and a new ſpirit: for why will ye die, ô houſe of Iſrael?</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verſe of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chapter, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells vs, that the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had complained againſt the Lord, that his wayes were not equall. Vnto the which impudent, ſawcie, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous complaint, the Lord in his owne moſt iuſt defence giueth a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21223:6"/>
anſwer: firſt in the 26 and 27 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in theſe words: <hi>If a righteous man for ſaketh his righteouſneſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth iniquitie, and dieth in them: for the iniquitie that he hath done, ſhall he die. Againe, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſſe that he hath committed, and doth that which is equall and right, he ſhall ſaue his ſoule aliue.</hi> As though the Lord ſhould ſay: He that condemneth the impenitent, though formerly neuer ſo righteous in ſhew; and he that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth the penitent, though formerly neuer ſo wretched in deed, his wayes muſt needs be equall. But God doth all this: Therefore his wayes muſt needs be equall. The ſecond anſwer which the Lord giueth to the former vniuſt complaint, is contained in the words of my text: <hi>Cast away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby ye haue tranſgreſſed,</hi> &amp;c. As though it were ſaid: He which offereth you life
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21223:6"/>
and ſaluation, vpon condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment for the time to come, his wayes muſt needs be equall. But God offereth you this offer. Therfore his wayes muſt needs be equall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſt away all your tranſgreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. The parts of this text are two, to wit, an exhortation, and an expoſtulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or a counſell, and a reaſon. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation or counſell, the Church of God is taught, firſt, what to auoid, in theſe words, <hi>Caſt away all your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, whereby ye haue tranſgreſſed.</hi> Secondly, what to labour fot, in the words following, <hi>And make you a new heart and a new ſpirit.</hi> And the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation or reaſon, is taken from the danger that will enſue if the counſell be reiected, in theſe words, <hi>For why will ye die, ô houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>

               <hi>is here vnderſtood, as is with an holy deteſtation or indignation: much like vnto that ſpeech of the Prophet</hi>

So that that which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth here to be renewed, is the whole inner man: according to that holy <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 26.</note>Prouerb, <hi>My ſon giue me thine heart.</hi> But here a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: Will God therefore be content with the bare renewing of the inner man? or is he indifferent, whether the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man be renewed or no? Not ſo: <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 20</note>
               <hi>For we are bought with a price: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt glorifie God both in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and in our ſpirits: for they are Gods.</hi> But the Lord nameth the inner man, becauſe the true renouation begins there, namely at the heart and in the mind.

               <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> There is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold death mentioned in the holy Scriptures: Firſt, naturall, and that is nothing elſe but a ſeparation for a time of the ſoule from the body. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſpirituall, and that is a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoule from the life of God. Thirdly, eternall, and that is a finall ſeparation both of body and ſoule, from the comfortable preſence of God. Of the firſt kind of death, is ſpoken in Heb. 9. 27. <hi>It is appointed vnto men to die once.</hi> Of the ſecond, is ſpoken in <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 32. <hi>This thy brother was dead, &amp; is aliue again.</hi> Of the third is made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Reu. 21. 8. <hi>The fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vnbeleeuing, &amp; abhominable, &amp; murderers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all lyers, ſhall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone: which</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:21223:9"/>
               <hi>is the ſecond death.</hi> My text is meant of the third kind of death: <hi>why will ye die?</hi> that is, why will ye incurre the danger of the ſecond death, which is eternall damnation both of ſoule and bodie, to be tormented with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and his Angels for euer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> By the houſe of Iſrael in this place, is meant the Church of God both among the Iewes and among the Gentiles. For the name <hi>Iſrael</hi> is giuen to both peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in Gal. 6. 16. And I am ſure the matter of the exhortation concernes vs Gentiles as much as euer it did the Iewes. For I appeale to euery mans conſcience: haue not we as great need to be exhorted to caſt away all our tranſgreſſions, as euer had the Iewes? Haue not we as much need to be ſtirred vp to become new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as euer had the Iewes? Iudge we in our ſelues. Furthermore, this name <hi>Iſrael</hi> is taken from the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21223:9"/>
               <hi>Iacob,</hi> who was named <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 28.</note>the Angell which wraſtled with him, becauſe as a Prince he had preuailed with God. And it is a very fit name for all Gods people, becauſe they are a generation that can wraſtle with God in prayer, and alſo preuaile. Thus much of the literall meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſt away all your tranſgreſſions.</hi> Before I come to the points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which I principally aime at, two queſtions are firſt to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Firſt, whether repentance be in a mans owne power or no, becauſe the Church is here exhorted, as by her owne action, to caſt away her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and to make her ſelfe a new heart and a new ſpirit? And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion is, whether a man haue free will or no? becauſe it is ſaid here, <hi>Why will ye die, ô houſe of Iſrael?</hi> As ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to imply, that it was in the free choiſe of Iſrael her ſelfe, whether ſhe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21223:10"/>
would be ſaued or damned.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt queſtion, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that true repentance, or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which is neuer to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, it is not in mans power, but it is the eſpeciall gift of God: according to that in 2. Tim. 2. 25. <hi>In meekneſſe inſtructing them that oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, prouing if God peraduenture will giue them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> And furthermore, euery vnregenerate perſon, man or woman, <note place="margin">Ier. 13. 23.</note>is a very blacke More, yea a Leopard: and therefore as the blacke More can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots, no more can any vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon do good, which is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to do euill. We do not denie, but natural men and women may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3.</note>ſome degree of ſorrow, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did; &amp; ſome degree of outward humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, <note place="margin">1. Kin. 21. 29 Exod. 9. 27</note>as <hi>Ahab</hi> did; and ſome degree of confeſſion, as <hi>Pharao</hi> did; and ſome degree of the reſtraining ſpirit, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21223:10"/>
               <hi>Abimelech</hi> did; and ſome degree of <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 6.</note>ſatisfaction vnto men for iniuries done, as the ſame <hi>Iudas</hi> did. But to <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 5.</note>the ſauing ſight of ſinne, or to the contrite ſpirit, which God wil not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe; or ſound inward mortification vnto ſin, which is by the Spirit; or to true conſcience of ſin, and louing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour after righteouſneſſe: hereunto a meere naturall perſon can neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by his owne naturall ſtrength. For it is ſpiritually, and not naturally attained: it is the worke of God, and not of man. And therefore <hi>Ephraim</hi> is heard bemoning himſelfe to God in theſe termes, <hi>Turne thou me, and I</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 18.</note>
               <hi>ſhall be turned: for thou art the Lord my God.</hi> Wherein he doth ſecretly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that he had not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in his owne power, but that it was the gift of God.</p>
            <p>But here remaineth ſtill another difficultie. For it may be obiected fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If repentance be not in a mans
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21223:11"/>
owne power, then why doth God exhort vs here to caſt off all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and to make our ſelues new hearts and new ſpirits? God doth not this becauſe he preſuppoſeth an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in vs to perform that which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; but becauſe he himſelf is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do that for vs, which he requires at our hands. For the word of God is not as the word of man, to wit, a bare ſound or voice; but being ioyned with the Spirit, it offereth grace, and effecteth that in the harts of the elect in ſome meaſure, which it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. As we reade concerning <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> Ioh. 20. 27. 28. Chriſts word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Thomas</hi> not to be infidelious but beleeuing, and the ſame word wrought faith in him to beleeue: ſo that he immediatly fell downe at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus feets, and ſaid vnto him, <hi>Thou art my God and my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond queſtion, which is, whether a man haue free
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21223:11"/>
will, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> To this I anſwer, a man or woman may haue a free choiſe in things ciuill and indifferent: thus, if any one be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to a feaſt, he is at his own choiſe whether he will go or no; and if he go, he is at his owne choiſe of what diſhes he wil taſte or eate: according to that in 1. Cor. 10. 27. <hi>If any one that beleeueth not, bid thee to a feaſt; and if thou wilt go</hi> &amp;c. But to make choiſe, or to refuſe to go to a feaſt, or to make choiſe to feed moderately for conſcience ſake, or for Gods glorie, this is immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all holineſſe. <hi>For we are not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 5.</note>
               <hi>ſufficient to thinke any thing as of our ſelues, but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> Again, that a Chriſtian hath in ſome meaſure a freed will after conuerſion, though not an abſolute free will, we do not gainſay: for Chriſt came <hi>to proclaime libertie to the captiues, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſai. 61. 1.</note>
               <hi>the opening of the priſon to them that</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21223:12"/>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 17</note> 
               <hi>are bound.</hi> And <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie.</hi> But to ſay, that a man hath abſolute freedome, and that he hath power of himſelfe, without the Spirit, to will that which is good, and to nill that which is euil; <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note>to affirme this we cannot. <hi>For it is God which giueth both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> We haue not free will before conuerſion: <hi>For euery ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note>
               <hi>of the thoughts of our hearts are onely euill continually.</hi> And, <hi>in vs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note>that is, in our fleſh, <hi>abideth nothing which is good.</hi> Neither haue we free <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5. 4.</note>will after conuerſion: For <hi>without Chriſt can we do nothing.</hi> And, <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruite of it ſelfe except it abide in the vine, no more can we, except we abide in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we Chriſtians haue iuſt cauſe to reiect the doctrine of Poperie, as in other points funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, as namely in the doctrine of iuſtificaton by a mans owne merits;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21223:12"/>
and in the doctrine of praying, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diuine worſhip vnto Saints and Angels; and in the doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie; and in the doctrine of the Popes authoritie to diſpenſe with ſin, or to forgiue ſin; in the doctrine of Tranſſubſtantiation; in the doctrine of the Popes power to dethrone Chriſtian Kings, &amp;c. As we haue, I ſay, iuſt cauſe to reiect theſe vaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, with innumerable other Antichriſtian traditions: ſo likewiſe we haue iuſt cauſe to diſſent from the Papiſts and new vpſtart Arminians in the doctrine of Free will. And the doctrine of Free will, in that ſence as it is maintained by Papiſts and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, is ſo much the more to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: firſt becauſe it denieth the doctrine of the erernall truth of God concerning election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; maintaining that one perſon is not elected more then another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for foreſeene faith or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21223:13"/>
workes. Contrary vnto that in Rom. 9. 11. <hi>For the children being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euill, that the purpoſe of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to election might ſtand, not of workes, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid vnto her, The elder ſhall ſerue the yonger: as it is written, Iacob haue I loued, and Eſau haue I hated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the doctrine of freewill is ſo much the more to be reiected, becauſe it derogates from the glorie of God, and maketh a man his owne ſauiour: for if a man haue abſolute power of himſelfe, by his owne will to be ſaued or damned, then if he be ſaued, he may thanke himſelfe and not God. Thirdly, if the doctrine of freewill were receiued, then we muſt alſo grant, that there is no aſſurance of ſaluation in this life: contrary to that in 2. Pet. 1. 10. <hi>Make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Yea we muſt grant alſo, that a Chriſtian might fall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21223:13"/>
and totally from ſauing grace: contrary to that in Math. 16. 18. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not preuaile,</hi> &amp;c. and thus one groſſe abſurdity being granted, a thouſand would follow. The reaſon therefore that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates thus with his Church, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> is not to implie any free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in vs, but rather to intimate a great frowardneſſe in vs vnto that which is good, and a deſperate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe and proneneſſe vnto that which is euill. <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> that is, why will ye deſperately reſiſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit when he offers grace vnto you? and why will ye wilfully ruſh into ſinne as the horſe into the battell, and ſo incurre the danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when ye are ſufficiently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned? Thus much for the meaning of the words and matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</hi> I purpoſe not to collect all the doctrines which I might out of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21223:14"/>

I will therefore (if God will) inſiſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon ſuch points as ſtand beſt with the ſcope of the holy Ghoſt in this text or portion of Scripture, and which I think to be the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrines concerning the time and place.</p>
            <p>

Againe, it is not ſaid, caſt away ſome of your tranſgreſſions, or ſuch tranſgreſſions which you can beſt ſpare, but caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all, euen to your very infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

And if thine eye offend thee, plucke it out, and caſt it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then hauing two eyes to be caſt into hell fire.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Cor. 7. 1.</hi> Hauing therefore theſe promiſes (dearely beloued) let vs cleanſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the feare of God.</p>

He that will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his ſinne, he remaineth vnder the <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note>wrath of God. <hi>For the wrath of God is reuealed from heauen againſt all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe and vnrighteouſneſſe of men.</hi> He that will not forſake his ſin, he is continually ſubiect to Gods <note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 21.</note>vengeance in this world, for <hi>God will wound the hairie ſcalpe of ſuch an one as goeth on in his wickedneſſe.</hi> He that will not forſake his ſinne, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, according to that in Gal. 5. 21. <hi>Of which I tell you before, as I haue alſo told you before, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God.</hi> Laſtly, he which will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his beloued ſinne, he ſhall be ſure to haue his portion in the lake <note place="margin">Reu. 21. 8.</note>that burneth with fire and brimſtone;

And therefore whoſoeuer they be that deſire to eſcape theſe dangers, they muſt of neceſſitie breake off their beloued ſinnes.</p>

               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> Fiftly, euery Chriſtian ought to breake off his beloued ſinne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the good which he ſhall reape thereby: and the true Chriſtian ſhall receiue infinite benefite by the forſaking of ſinne. For firſt, if he will touch no vncleane thing, God will <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 17</note>receiue him for his child.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if he will forſake all his ſinnes, be ſhall be made fit for Gods ſeruice, as for prayer, hearing Gods word, receiuing the Sacrament: whereas otherwiſe if he forſake not ſinne, he is vnfit for all theſe; for if we regard wickedneſſe in our hearts, <note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 18.</note>God will not regard our ſeeming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21223:18"/>
but it is abhomination to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if a Chriſtian will forſake his beloued ſinne, he ſhall haue peace of conſcience, which he ſhall neuer haue vnleſſe he forſake his ſinne. For <note place="margin">Iſay 57. 21.</note>
               <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, if a Chriſtian forſake his ſinne, he ſhall profite by the word; <note place="margin">Luke 8. 14.</note>wheras otherwiſe the word is choked by the venime of his beloued ſinne.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, if a Chriſtian forſake his <note place="margin">Iſay 1. 16.</note>ſinne, he ſhall haue fellowſhip with God and ioy in the holy Ghoſt; whereas if he forſake nor his ſinne, he <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note>remaineth <hi>an alien to God;</hi> and <hi>in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laughter his heart ſhall be ſorrowfull.</hi> Pro. 14. 13.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, if a Chriſtian forſake his beloued ſinne, he ſhall approue the truth of his repentance, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe his repentance is no better then the repentance of <hi>Herod.</hi> For
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21223:18"/>
               <hi>Herod</hi> was content to do many <note place="margin">Marke 6.</note>things at the preaching of <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> but he would not forſake his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias:</hi> and therefore his obedience was no obedience, and his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance no repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Obiection.</hi> Pro. 24. 16.</note> But doth not the <hi>righteous man fall ſeuen times a day?</hi> and do we not <hi>in many things offend all?</hi> are we not <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 2.</note>all ſinners? is there any man that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and ſinneth not? Therefore what neceſſitie is there that any man ſhould endeuour to purge himſelfe from all ſinne?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> It is very true that we are all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, For <hi>if we ſay we haue no ſinne, we lie, and ſpeake not the truth;</hi> but there is great difference betwixt ſinnes of infirmitie whereunto the children of God are ſubiect, and ſins of preſumption whereunto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are giuen.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſinnes of infirmitie are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vpon the ſudden, by a preſent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21223:19"/>
and vnexpected temptation, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 116. 11. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, all men are liers.</hi> But a ſinne of preſumption is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with premeditation and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For <hi>the wicked deuiſeth miſchiefe vpon his bed; he ſetteth himſelf vpon a way that is not good,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 36. 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a ſinne of infirmitie is done vnwillingly, with much ſtriuing againſt the fleſh, yea with the very hatred of the ſinne committed: as we ſee in the example of bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 15. <hi>That which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that do I.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, a ſinne of preſumption is committed willingly, with the whole heart, with great delight, yea euen with greedineſſe, Epheſ. 4. 19. <hi>Who being paſt feeling, haue giuen themſelues ouer vnto laſciuiouſneſſe: to worke all vncleaneneſſe with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:21223:19"/>
Thirdly, a ſinne of infirmitie is commonly committed in things of a lower nature. For few of the children of God after conuerſion (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) do fall ſo groſly as did <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> The child of God after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation may be aſſailed with euill thoughts, and may be ſubject to like paſſions as others are: yea idle words may ſometimes ſlip from them at vnawares, and ſome failings there may be in their actions and dealings: and they may alſo come ſhort in the well performing of holy duties and the like. But a ſinne of preſumption is vſually committed with an high hand in groſſe matters. Rom. 3. 13. <hi>Their throate is an open ſepulcher, with their tongues they haue vſed deceit; the poyſon of aſpes is vnder their lips: whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, their feete are ſwift to ſhed bloud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, a ſinne of infirmitie is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21223:20"/>
commonly of ignorance, as was the ſinne of <hi>Peter</hi> when raſhly he deſired that three Tabernacles might be made, one for Chriſt, one for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 9. 6.</note>and one for <hi>Elias,</hi> not knowing what he ſaid; whereas a ſinne of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is alwayes againſt the light of knowledge. For the wicked <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iudgement of God (that they which do ſuch things are worthy of death) not onely do the ſame, but haue pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> Rom. 1. 32.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, a ſinne of infirmitie when it is knowne, it is preſently repented of, and is more carefully ſhunned and bewar'd of for the time to come: as we ſee in the example of holy <hi>Iob,</hi> in his fortieth chapter, and fourth and fifth verſes: who perceiuing that he had bene too bold with God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon the ſight of his ſinne breaketh out into theſe termes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:21223:20"/>
               <hi>I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand vpon my mouth, once haue I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer againe: yea twiſe, but I will proceed no further.</hi> Whereas on the contrary a ſinne of preſumption is commonly made a trade of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, yea many times defended and boaſted of. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made a trade of prouoking God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to anger in the wilderneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued therein fortie yeares, Pſal. 95. 10. The wicked idolaters offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their offering of cakes to the Queene of heauen, Ier. 44. 17. And <hi>the vngodly boaſteth of his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi> Pſal. 10. 3.</p>
            <p>Now therefore conſidering what great difference there is betwixt ſins of infirmitie and ſinnes of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let no man deceiue himſelfe in being encouraged to liue in his groſſe ſinnes of preſumption, becauſe the true children of God, ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils, are ſubiect to many
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21223:21"/>
ſlips and imperfections.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obiection.</hi>
               </note> I am conuinced in my conſcience (may ſome ſay) that I ought to liue better then I do, and that I ought to breake off my beſt-beloued ſinnes: but may I not do this hereafter? what neceſſitie is there of preſent amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>To this I anſwer: It is not for thee (my poore brother) to put off thy repentance from day to day; and that for diuerſe weightie reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe God himſelfe calleth vpon thee for preſent repentance:</hi> To <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 7.</note>day if ye will heare his voyce, harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation, and in the day of temptation in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe through pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination thine heart may be made hard and impenitent, as is implied in Heb. 3. 13.</hi> Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:21223:21"/>
Thirdly, becauſe thy life is fraile and vncertaine; thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth; thou mayeſt be aliue and in health to day, and dead and buried by to morrow: therefore it behoueth thee to repent whileſt thou haſt yet time.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there be (no doubt) mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes at this inſtant in hell fire for deferring their repentance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they purpoſed, as thou doeſt, to repent hereafter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leſt thou be like ſuch fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and leſt thou alſo come to that place of torment, thou muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent, and caſt away all thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions whereby thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed; but this thou muſt do to day, without any minutes procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Obiection.</hi>
               </note> I am content (will ſome haply ſay) to part with whatſoeuer I am conuinced of to be a ſinne; but how ſhall I be conuinced of ſinne, or by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21223:22"/>
what meanes may I come to find out <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>my beloued ſinne? I anſwer, if thou knoweſt not (my Chriſtian brother) thy beloued ſinne, which euery man doth more eaſily know then forſake, take theſe few directions for the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of thy ſinne:</p>
            <p>Firſt, pray vnto God (but pray fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently, and in the name of Chriſt) that he would vouchſafe to diſcouer vnto thee thy ſins. For it is the Spirit <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 8.</note>of God which <hi>conuinceth the world of ſinne;</hi> and he is that <hi>eye-ſalue</hi> which muſt cauſe thee to ſee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thou muſt be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in Gods word, but eſpecially in the reading of the Law of God: <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20</note>for <hi>by the Law cometh the knowledge</hi> 
               <note place="margin">I am. 1. 23.</note>
               <hi>of ſin.</hi> And the Law is that true cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall glaſſe, wherein thou mayeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and ſee thy vgly deformities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou muſt carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the checkes of thy conſcience. For if thou haſt not feared thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21223:22"/>
with an hote iron, it will at one time or other checke thee for thy beloued ſinne; and thine owne heart will ſmite thee, as <hi>Dauids</hi> heart ſmote him, when he had cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thou muſt be content to ſuffer the word of exhortation from thy Miniſter, from thy friend, yea from thy very enemy, if thou deſireſt to come to the ſight of thy ſin. Many times others ſee more in vs, then we can ſee in our ſelues. How came <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> to the ſight of his ſin, but by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note>the Prophet his miniſtery?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> Now hauing proued vnto you at large the truth of the doctrine, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a true conuert muſt turne, not from ſome, but from all his ſins: the vſe of the point is, firſt to condemne the practiſe of groſſe hypocrites, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom ſin is ſweet, and they hide it <note place="margin">Iob 20. 12.</note>vnder their tongues: which with <hi>Saul</hi> ſpare their fat ſinnes of pleaſure and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21223:23"/>
profit; and learne of <hi>Naaman</hi> to ſay, Lord be merciful vnto vs in theſe ſins; when in the meane time they neuer meane to forſake them. But I leaue ſuch to their iuſt condemnation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they repent.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> Secondly, it ſerues for exhortation, to excite euery one of you, and mine owne ſoule alſo, to forſake all ſin. Let Miniſters learne to beware of falſe doctrine, and bad example, leſt many therby be defiled. Let Lawyers learne to beware of bribes, to peruert iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and iuſtice. Let Magiſtrates learne to beware of too much ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie towards ſome, and of too much partialitie towards others. Let tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men learne to breake off all fraud and deceit, and all ſhamefull ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of their particular callings. In a word, let euery man and woman, rich and poore, yong &amp; old, one and other, learne to caſt off all their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, whereby they haue tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21223:23"/>
And that we may obtaine the happie victory againſt our eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall corruptions, theſe rules are to be obſerued with all carefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt daily examine our ſelues: for thus ſaith the Lord of hoaſts by the Prophet, <hi>Conſider your</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Agg. 1. 12.</note>
               <hi>wayes;</hi> and by his beloued Diſciple, <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Reu. 2. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt daily confeſſe them, and bemoane our ſelues daily for them to God; yea we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our ſelues for them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſtrength againſt them by prayer. All this did <hi>Paul</hi> for the remouing of the meſſenger of Satan, which was <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>ſent to buffet him, 2. Cor. 12. 7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we muſt daily renew our couenant with God, vowing againſt our ſins, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; <hi>I haue ſworne,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 106.</note>
               <hi>and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous indgements.</hi> A reſolute vow and ſtedfaſt reſolution, are nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſeruatiues againſt all ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:21223:24"/>
Fourthly, we muſt be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in the vſe of Gods ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to wit, of praying, aduiſed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, frequent hearing, prepared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Lords Supper, &amp;c. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in theſe things is an eſpeciall meanes, with the helpe of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to mortifie any ſinne.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, we muſt auoid the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſuch as haue bene the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Satan formerly to allure vs to ſin. For in vaine ſhall we purpoſe to keepe the commandements of our God, vnleſſe with <hi>Dauid</hi> we ſay to our <note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 115</note>graceleſſe companions, <hi>Depart from me ye wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> Thirdly, conſidering that all ſinne muſt be caſt off, it may ſerue more particularly for the inſtruction both of Miniſters and Magiſtrates. Of vs Miniſters; we muſt hereby be excited to take diligent notice of the ſinnes that reigne in this land, and eſpecially amongſt that people of which God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21223:24"/>
hath made vs ouerſeers: and let vs without reſpect of perſons endeuour to ſubdue all ſin. Let vs not feare the rich, not fauour our benefactors. Let vs not deſire to ſpeak pleaſing things, but profitable things. Let vs <hi>Cauſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 2.</note>
               <hi>to know all her abhominations.</hi> Let vs deliuer our ſelues from bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltineſſe, by giuing warning; and ſo <hi>When the chiefe Shepheard ſhal appeare,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 4.</note>we <hi>ſhall receiue the crowne of glorie, which fadeth not away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this may ſerue for the inſtruction of all ſuch as are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie either in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: they muſt labour to ſuppreſſe to their power all ſin; but eſpecially ſuch ſins as reigne in this Land, and in this famous Citie of <hi>London.</hi> Let Eccleſiaſtical power ſuppreſſe all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and ſchiſme, ſuch as are Popery, Arminianiſme, Anabaptiſme, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme, deprauing of the Sabbath, and ſuch like. Let the maintainers of theſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21223:25"/>
curſed ſects be ſharply cenſured, and ſought out, and diligently enquired after. Let theſe skulking foxes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for theſe are they that ſpoile this vine, perſwading vnſtable ſoules to deſperate ſeparation.</p>
            <p>Here likewiſe let the ſecular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate learne to ſuppreſſe and puniſh the groſſe abuſes of the time, ſuch as are, ſwearing, Sabbath-breaking, theft, whoredome, drunkenneſſe, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and innumerable other. For <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 11.</note>
               <hi>ſentence against an euill worke is not ſpeedily executed, therefore the heart of the ſonnes of men is fully ſet in them to do euil.</hi> Let Magiſtrates learne of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to puniſh ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and blaſphemers; for he (though an heathen) made a ſolemne decree, <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 29.</note>
               <hi>That euery people, nation and language, which ſhould ſpeake any thing amiſſe againſt the God of Shadrach, Meſhech, and Abednego, ſhould be cut in peeces, and their houſes ſhould be made a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:21223:25"/>
Surely this heathen man may iuſtly riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs profeſſed Chriſtians, in that we ſuffer the glorious and fearefull Name of God, and the precious bloud and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred wounds of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and ordinarily to be profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and blaſphemed. Let Magiſtrates learne of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to be zealous <note place="margin">Neh. 13. 21.</note>for the Lords Sabbath; that as he threatned to lay hands on all ſuch as broke the Sabbath by their ſelling wares on that bleſſed day, ſo they would take notice of the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath in euery kinde, and labour to ſuppreſſe all abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and not to giue the leaſt tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration at the requeſt of any, for any carnall libertie: knowing the ill diſpoſition of mans nature, that if it haue an inch, it will take an elne. Let Magiſtrates therefore learne of <hi>Phinees,</hi> to execute ſeuere iudgement <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 30.</note>vpon the adulterer and the whore.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21223:26"/>

Cor. 5. 17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature: old things are paſſed away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, all things are become new.</hi> By both which places it is manifeſt, that it is not ſufficient to ceaſſe to be old, but there muſt be alſo a renewing.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by what meanes it is wrought. Thirdly, by what degrees. Fourthly, what be the concomitants of it. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concerning the conſtancie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Point.</hi>
               </note> Concerning the neceſſitie of this inward renouation or regeneration, we are to conſider, firſt, that without it no fleſh can be ſaued: for Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Except ye be conuerted,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 3.</note>
               <hi>and become as litle children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And againe he ſaith, <hi>Except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God.</hi> Againe, we are all vaſſals of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan by nature, and <hi>are taken of him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 26</note>
               <hi>at his will:</hi> and therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we ſhould be ſet free out of ſpirituall bondage by vertue of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Againe, by nature all the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21223:31"/>
faculties of our ſoules are out of frame, our members being the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 19</note>of vnrighteouſneſſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary that we ſhould be ſet in ioynt againe by regeneration. Laſtly, without regeneration our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſacrifices, our prayers, our hearing the word, our almes, our ciuill liues, are vnpleaſing to God. For as much <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 8.</note>as <hi>they that are in the fleſh</hi> (that is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate) <hi>cannot pleaſe God,</hi> as the bleſſed Apoſtle ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Let euery man and woman lay to heart this neceſſitie; &amp; let them not deceiue themſelues with that fond conceit, that if they liue ciuilly, and pay euery man his owne, and go to the Church as others do, that then they ſhal ſurely be ſaued, though they remaine as ignorant of regeneration as euer was <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> I tell you nay: for vnleſſe you be regenerate and borne againe, you remaine in danger of eternall condemnation, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21223:31"/>
the very ſlaues of Satan; and the beſt things that you do or can do in your naturall condition, are abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and odious to God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Point.</hi>
               </note> Concerning the meanes whereby regeneration is wrought, we are to note firſt, that the efficient cauſe of it is not man, nor Angel, but Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. There is no creature in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor earth that can conuert a ſoule by his owne power: this worke belongs to God alone: for we <hi>are borne not of bloud, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the fleſh, but of God;</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh in his firſt chap. and 13. verſe. And therefore the whole glory of the admirable worke of regeneration is due to God alone, and is not to be aſcribed to any creature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the moſt ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe (not to ſpeake of the extraordinary meanes) which God vſeth for the conuerſion of ſoules, is the word of God, eſpecially
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21223:32"/>
preached: as appeares by theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſalme 19. 7.</hi> The Law of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the ſoule.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. Cor. 4. 15.</hi> For though you haue ten thouſand inſtructors, yet haue ye not many fathers: for in Chriſt Ieſus I haue begotten you through the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames 1. 18.</hi> Of his owne will begat he vs by the word of truth, that we ſhould be a kind of firſt fruites of his creatures.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. Pet. 1. 23.</hi> Being borne anew, not of mortall ſeed, but of immortall, by the word of God, which liueth and endureth for euer.</p>
            <p>By all which places, and many more, it is euident, that the eſpeciall inſtrumentall cauſe of regeneration is the holy word of God contained in the Canonicall Scriptures. Whereby it appeareth, what infinite wrong the Pope doth vnto the ſoules of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, by withholding from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21223:32"/>
them the vſe of the Scriptures: and alſo what enemies they are vnto Chriſts kingdome and to mens ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which labour to their power to ſuppreſſe and extinguiſh the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull preaching of Gods word. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſhould teach vs to glorifie God for the plentie of preaching in this Land, but eſpecially in this Citie: for hereby there is good hope of the conuerſion of many ſoules. And let vs alwayes, as we haue all iuſt cauſe, pray againſt Poperie, and that not onely in reſpect of the bloudthirſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that religion, diſplayed in that moſt barbarous plot of the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder treaſon, but alſo becauſe it ſeekes to depriue vs of the vſe of Gods word, the eſpeciall inſtrument of mans ſaluation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Point.</hi>
               </note> Concerning the degrees where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by regeneration is moſt commonly wrought, they are theſe following:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the holy Ghoſt quickens the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21223:33"/>
ſoule which it doth conuert, finding it dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Thus it quickened the prodigall ſon, Luke 15. 32. <hi>This thy brother was dead, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue againe:</hi> and thus he quickened the Epheſians, in the fifth Chapter of that Epiſtle, the eighth verſe; and in the ſecond Chapter, the firſt verſe. Where we are to note, that the ſoule is not ſaid to be dead by nature, or to be quickened by regeneration, becauſe the ſoule is deſtitute of all life, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe naturally it is an alien from the life of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in Eph. 4. 18. God doth not exerciſe the life of grace in the ſoule of any vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon, as he doth in the hearts of thoſe that are regenerate. And this firſt act of regeneration or ſpirituall quickening, is termed in Scriptures, <note place="margin">Reu. 20. 6.</note>
               <hi>the firſt reſurrection.</hi> Firſt, becauſe as in the day of the generall reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Many that ſleepe in the duſt ſhall awake,</hi> Dan. 12. 2: ſo by vertue of this firſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21223:33"/>
reſurrection, many that ſleepe in ſin ſhall <hi>awake to liue righteouſly.</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 34. Secondly, as in the generall reſurrection the bodies of the Saints ſhall be made like vnto the glorious body of Chriſt himſelfe, Philip. 3. 21: ſo by vertue of this firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection the ſoules of the Saints come to beare the image and ſtampe of God himſelfe, being made holy as he is holy, Eph. 4. 24. And hereby a man or woman may trie whether they be regenerate and quickened or no, if they will but examine whether they be awake to liue righteouſly or no, and whether they beare Gods image in true holineſſe or no. If theſe things be in thee, thou art vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly quickned; if not, thou remaineſt ſtill but a dead man.</p>
            <p>The ſecond degree whereby rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is wrought, is illumination: for when we begin to <hi>ſtand vp from the dead,</hi> then immediatly <hi>Chriſt giues</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:21223:34"/>
               <hi>vs light,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 14. the <hi>God which commanded light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> beginneth to <hi>ſhine in our hearts,</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 6. Yea then the <hi>day of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> beginneth <hi>to dawne,</hi> and <hi>the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarre</hi> of ſauing knowledge to <hi>ariſe in our hearts.</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 19. By vertue of this heauenly light a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is brought to ſee in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the danger of their natural ſtate, and what need they haue of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of Chriſt, and of Gods mercy, and of inward purging from their corruptions; and what reaſon they haue of denying themſelues, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying about with them ſuch a maſſe of corruption, whereof now they are aware. Where it is to be noted, that the reprobate may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be enlightened alſo. He may haue ſo much light as to leaue him without excuſe. This is manifeſt out of Heb. 6. 4. where it is ſaid of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates and finall backſliders, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21223:34"/>
               <hi>they were once enlightened.</hi> But the difference is, firſt, the child of God is enlightened and quickened: but the reprobate is onely enlightened and not quickened; for he remaines ſtill an <hi>alien from the life of God.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. Secondly, the elect are enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to ſee their ſinne, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 27. <hi>I ſee another law in my members,</hi> &amp;c. but the reprobate are enlightened e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to behold the danger of ſin, and the puniſhment of the ſame; as we ſee in the example of <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 13. <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can beare.</hi> Thirdly, the elect are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened to amendement, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Iob,</hi> in his 40 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fift verſe, <hi>I haue ſpoken once, but I will do ſo no more;</hi> or <hi>I will not anſwer.</hi> But the reprobate are enlightened to deſpaire, and to deſperate courſes. As we ſee in the example of <hi>Iudas,</hi> Math. 27. 5. who ſo ſoone as he was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21223:35"/>
enlightened to ſee the danger of his eſtate, went immediatly, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hanged himſelfe. And hereby we may examine and try our ſelues, whether we be ſauingly enlightened or no. For if we be enlightened and quickened, if we be brought to the ſight of our ſecret corruptions, and to amendment, then it is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne, that we are ſauingly enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened; otherwiſe we remaine in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto this houre.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third degree wherby regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt vſually wrought, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. Thus when thoſe three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted by <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon, Acts 2. 37. it is ſaid that <hi>they were pricked in their hearts;</hi> and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſinner when ſhe was regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>ſhe ſtood behind Christ at his feete weeping,</hi> Luke 7. 38. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Peter</hi> and diuerſe others.</p>
            <p>Where alſo it is carefully to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that the very reprobate may

haue a kind of ſorrow, and may hang down their heads like a bulruſh for a time, Eſay 58. 5. <hi>Is it ſuch a faſt that I require, that a man ſhould afflict his ſoule for a day?</hi> &amp;c. But the difference is, firſt the elect mourne for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt God, as we ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 51. 4. <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee onely haue I ſinned.</hi> But the reprobate mourne eſpecially in reſpect of the puniſhment, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus 9. 27. who when he ſaw the iudgements of God vpon him, and vpon his land, could then confeſſe with a ſeeming ſorrow, that <hi>He and his people were wicked.</hi> Secondly, the elect mourne with a <hi>godly ſorrow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repentance not to be repented of,</hi> as we ſee in the example of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, 2. Cor. 7. 10: but the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſorrow with a <hi>worldly ſorrow that cauſeth death.</hi> Thirdly, the elect mourne, but with ſome grounds of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21223:36"/>
hope. For they know in the midſt of their ſorrow, that their ſinne is not greater then can be forgiuen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in caſe of temptation: they know alſo that Gods mercy is greater then their ſinne; and that the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt is able to waſh them from all iniquitie: and ſo by theſe generall grounds at the leaſt in the middeſt of their ſorrow, they ſuſtaine their heart in ſome degree of hope: but the reprobate mourne as men quite bereft of all hope, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſins to be greater then can be forgiuen.</p>
            <p>And hereby alſo we may try our ſelues whether we haue ſauingly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for ſinne or no. For if we haue ſorrowed for the ſinne, as well as for the puniſhment; and if we haue ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to repentance and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and laſtly, if we haue ſorrowed in hope, it is a good ſigne that our ſorrow is true. Otherwiſe our ſorrow
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21223:36"/>
is not the true ſorrow of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, but rather the worldly ſorrow of the wicked.</p>
            <p>The fourth degree whereby rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is commonly wrought, is the ſpirituall hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe. The conuert ſoule thirſts and pants after Chriſt, <hi>As the heart brayeth after the riuers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 1.</note>If God would giue riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pleaſures, and not Chriſt, they would be accounted as dung and droſſe, Phil. 3. 7. And the child of God thirſteth after Chriſt, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his benefits, and to ſerue his owne turne, but alſo out of loue to Chriſt his perſon, in reſpect of his excellencies. Whereupon the Church is ſaid to be <hi>ſicke of loue</hi> to Chriſt, Cant. 5. 8. And to this degree no reprobate in the world attaineth. For to loue Chriſt for himſelfe, and to loue his glorious appearing, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the elect, and to ſuch as ſhall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21223:37"/>
receiue the crowne of righteouſneſſe, 2. Tim. 4. 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the true Conuert thirſteth after Chriſt, ſo likewiſe he longeth after the word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as appeareth by the example of the 3000 in Acts 2. 42. who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon their conuerſion <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reprobate and wicked may attaine a kind of deſire after the word, but it is either with <hi>Eue,</hi> meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to get knowledge,</hi> or with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to make gaine, or with the Phariſee to get a name; or with the carnall Goſpellers amongſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, for affectation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him that deliuers it. Or if it be for any taſte of ſweetneſſe which they find in the word, then that taſte laſteth but for a ſeaſon. As the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticke Iewes could <hi>reioyce in Iohn</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:21223:37"/>
               <hi>Baptiſts light for a ſeaſon,</hi> Ioh. 5. 35. whereas the true Conuert loues the word for it ſelfe, and continues in the ſtudy of it, and endeuours to attaine ſauing grace by it, labouring to bring forth the fruits in holy practiſe.</p>
            <p>The ſift degree whereby regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is commonly wrought, is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from ſin. For ſo ſoone as any ſoule is conuerted to God, and made partaker of the diuine nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it begins to diſtaſte ſin, and to ſtriue againſt it. Euen <hi>Paul</hi> ſo ſoone as he was conuerted, he ceaſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Gods Church, Act. 9. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Zaccheus</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others. Where we muſt note, that the reprobate and wicked may abſtaine from many ſinnes, as well as the true Conuert: as appeares by the example of the Phariſee, Luk. 18. 11. <hi>I thanke God I am not as other men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, vniuſt, adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. But the difference is, the true conuert de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21223:38"/>
from ſin by vertue of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Spirit of God; he is <hi>waſhed by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1. Cor. 6. 10. 11: But the wicked abſtaineth onely by the reſtraining ſpirit, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20. 6. <hi>I haue kept thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the true Conuert is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with all his ſins, euen with his beloued ſins, as we ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 119. 101: <hi>I haue refrained my feete from euery euill way.</hi> But the wicked perſon is like <hi>Herod,</hi> he will not part with his <hi>Herodias</hi> or darling ſinne, Mark. 6. 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the true Conuert forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſin for conſcience ſake, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Geneſ. 39. <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſinne againſt God?</hi> whereas the wicked ſhunneth ſin, not for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but either for feare of men, or for feare of ſhame, or for feare of hel, or in reſpect of ſauing charges, or the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21223:38"/>
like: as we ſee in the example of the high Prieſts, who would faine haue bene medling with Chriſt, but they did forbeare, howbeit not for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, but <hi>for feare of the people.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 46</note>Let all Chriſtians examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by theſe differences, whether their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from ſinne be the right decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or no.</p>
            <p>The ſixt degree whereby regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is wrought and perfected, is, full aſſurance of Gods fauour. For when the holy Ghoſt hath in ſome good meaſure ſanctified the heart, &amp; made it pliable to Gods will in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall obedience, then it becomes <hi>the Spirit of adoption, crying, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in our hearts, and <hi>teſtifying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our ſpirits that we are the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. 16. Where we muſt alſo note, that the very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked may haue a kind of perſwaſion of Gods fauour towards them, as they ſeeme to haue in 1. Theſſ. 5. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21223:39"/>
crie <hi>Peace and ſafetie.</hi> But the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is; firſt, the aſſurance of the elect is wrought by the Spirit of adoption; but the perſwaſion of the wicked is not ſo, but is wrought rather by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan which lulleth them aſleepe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the aſſurance of the elect hath a ſure foundation, to wit, the promiſes of the Goſpell, the mercy of God, and Chriſt: but the perſwaſion of the wicked is grounded vpon the ſandy foundation of his owne merits. Thirdly, the aſſurance of the elect breedeth an eſpeciall care to pleaſe God: but the perſwaſion of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked breedeth carnall ſecuritie and boldneſſe to ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Point.</hi>
               </note> The fourth generall point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded concerning this great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of regeneration, is touching the concomitants of this grace. And the concomitants or things acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying this grace of regeneration, are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, an vniuerſall change. For
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21223:39"/>
there is none truly regenerated, but they are truly changed, yea vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally changed, <hi>All things are become</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 17</note>
               <hi>new</hi> with them: yea they <hi>are changed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 18</note>
               <hi>from glorie to glorie, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Where we are to note, that the very reprobate may alſo be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; as we reade of <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>God gaue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. 9</note>
               <hi>him another heart.</hi> But the change in the reprobate is far different from the change wrought in the elect. For the change in the reprobate, is but in common gifts of the Spirit, as we ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi> he was changed onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, or to rule; whereas the elect are changed by ſpeciall and ſauing gifts, as, to be regenerate, ſauingly to <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 23. Phil. 1. 29. 2. Cor. 7. 10.</note>beleeue, to repent with repentance neuer to be repented of, &amp;c. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the reprobates are changed but onely in part; they are like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or as a cake baked on the one ſide: but the elect are vniuerſally changed, both inwardly and outwardly; in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21223:40"/>
iudgement, wil, affections, conſcience, conuerſation, outward behauiour, and the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſecond concomitant of regeneration, is the combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the fleſh and the ſpirit. For there is none truly regenerate, but they haue a combat within them. Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> who found in himſelfe after regeneration, <hi>a law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the law of his mind,</hi> Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 7. 18. Where we muſt alſo note, that the very reprobate may haue a kind of reluctation, by vertue of the light of their natural conſciences; as we ſee in the example of <hi>Pilate,</hi> he was loth to condemne Chriſt, he had a kind of <note place="margin">Iohn 19. 12</note>ſtriuing within him, yea <hi>he ſought to releaſe him.</hi> But the difference is, the reprobate haue a ſtriuing againſt ſin, either in reſpect of the ſhame of ſin, or in reſpect of the feare of hell fire, or for ſuch like carnall ends; ſo that their ſtriuing is not the combat of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21223:40"/>
fleſh and the ſpirit, but the combat of the fleſh and the fleſh: whereas the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect haue a ſtriuing againſt ſinne, for conſcience ſake, and in loue to God. <note place="margin">Gen. 39. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the third concomitant of regeneration, is fruitfulneſſe. There be none truly regenerate, but they are made fruitful. We might inſtance for the proofe of this point, in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> and many other. Where obſerue, that the wicked and vnregenerate may do many ſeeming good works, as we ſee in the example of the Barbarians, who laded <hi>Paul</hi> with things neceſſary, Acts 28. 10. But the difference is, the reprobate and wicked do many ſeeming good <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 33.</note>works, either mercenarily to <hi>receiue the like againe,</hi> or vaingloriouſly for the <hi>praiſe of men,</hi> or ſuperſtitiouſly <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 5. Iſay 58. 5.</note>with opinion of <hi>merit.</hi> Whereas the elect do good works vnto ſuch as are not able to requite them, and that in true ſinceritie and humilitie, not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21223:41"/>
their owne praiſe, but Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, confeſſing when they haue done all that they can, that they <hi>are vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſeruants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the fourth concomitant of regeneration, is the matter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. For there is none regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to <hi>liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> but they <hi>muſt ſuffer perſecution</hi> in one kind or in another, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in 2. Tim. 3. 9. Where we are alſo to note, that the very wicked may ſuffer for their profeſſion; yea and ſuffer many things for the truths ſake alſo, as <hi>Paul</hi> implieth in 1. Cor. 13. 3. that they that are without loue, may <hi>giue their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be burned:</hi> and as we ſee in the examples of Papiſts, Arrians, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wretched heretikes, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are ready to lay downe their liues for their profeſſion ſake. But the difference is in the cauſe of ſuffering: for it is not the ſuffering, but the cauſe of ſuffering, that makes the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21223:41"/>
Martyr. The wicked and vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſuffer commonly for error, and not for the truth; or if at any time for the truth, then it is not for loue of the truth it ſelfe, but for ſome other by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect: whereas the elect child of God ſuffers for the truth it ſelfe, and that in loue to the ſame, and with zeale of Gods glory.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Point.</hi>
               </note> The fifth and laſt generall point propounded concerning the myſtery of regeneration, is concerning the conſtancy of the ſame. For we are to know, that a man or woman being once regenerate, they are for euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; and being once made the children of God by adoption, they are for euer the children of God.</p>
            <p>For the proofe of this point, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto you theſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture following:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. Ioh. 3. 9.</hi> His ſeed remaineth in him.</p>

            <p>By all which places, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is manifeſt that they which are once effectually called, and truly regenerate, and haue receiued the Spirit of adoption, they are for euer the children of God.</p>

               </note> Fourthly, God giueth ſufficient warning, by his threatnings out of the word, and by his iuſt iudgements ſhewed vpon others: and therefore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21223:44"/>
if we will take no warning, neither by threats, nor by iudgements, nor by ſignes from heauen, we ſhal worthily periſh without mercy.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 9. 11. 12. 13.</hi> For the children
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21223:45"/>
being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good nor euill: it was ſaid, Iacob haue I loued, and Eſau haue I hated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iude 4.</hi> For there are certaine men crept in vnawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ier. 6. 30.</hi> Reprobate ſiluer ſhall men call them: for the Lord hath reiected them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> We acknowledge the truth of theſe holy places; we acknowledge alſo the truth of the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, to wit, that God as the mightie Potter, hauing abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the lumpe of mankind, hath made ſome veſſels to honor, and ſome to diſhonor; and that of his owne free will, for the declaring of his power, and manifeſting of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Rom. 9. 23.</p>
            <p>But here it is carefully to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that howſoeuer a mans repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation be of God, yet his deſtruction is of himſelf; &amp; that for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:21223:45"/>
Firſt, becauſe howſoeuer God in his iuſtice and wiſedome doth repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate many, and that before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world was caſt; yet he throweth no man nor woman, yong nor old into hell, before they come to their perſonall appearance before Chriſt, and be found guiltie at the barre of Gods iudgement ſeate, of ſin either actuall, or at the leaſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, 2. Cor. 5. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though God do repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate men and women, yet he doth not tempt or enforce any man or woman to ſinne for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his owne decree. <hi>For God tempteth no man;</hi> as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh in his firſt Chap. v. 13. And it were hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh blaſphemy to affirme, that God were in any ſort the author of ſinne.</p>

               </note> If deſtruction be of a mans ſelfe, then it ſeemeth that he hath free will to be ſaued if he will, contrary vnto that which was deliuered before.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Man indeed in <hi>Adam</hi> had once free will, as well as he had the liuely image of God; but now hauing loſt it, he may iuſtly be condemned for the loſſe of it: and now he hath no further wil vnto good then he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Gods Spirit; nor further power againſt euill, then he is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the power of God through faith.</p>

               </note> Yea but it might ſeeme ſtill, that a mans deſtruction is of God, becauſe he doth not reſtraine men from ſin, nor preuent them with his grace. For is not he guiltie of a childs death, that ſeeth it run toward a pit, and ſtayeth it not, when there is power in his hand to do it?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> We muſt not meaſure God who is aboue the Law, by man vnder the Law. A man in this caſe is indeed guiltie, becauſe he is bound by the Law to ſaue life if he can; but God is a free worker, it is in him to <hi>haue</hi>

We make our ſelues liable to Gods wrath, we bring vpon our ſelues iudgements in this world, we wilfully loſe heauen, and the comfortable preſence of God, and Chriſt, and of bleſſed Saints and Angels; yea we purchaſe to our ſelues eternall torment in hell fire with the diuell and his angels, in that horrible darke and deepe pit which the diuels themſelues do tremble to thinke vpon. O conſider this all ye that forget God, and which ſport and delight your ſelues in your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſes, which drinke iniquitie as the Oxe drinketh water, which drinke I ſay, and are neuer ſatisfied: O why will ye die, ye poore houſe of Iſrael?</p>

                  <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> Let all good Chriſtians learne, that as the wicked and vngodly do diligently worke out their owne damnation, ſo to be carefull on the contrary to worke out their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this they ſhall do by the power of God, and not by their owne power, or by any thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if they be carefull to vſe all the meanes which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the working of ſauing faith, and the nouriſhing of the ſame in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if they labour in all the parts of repentance, if they daily exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues, if they daily hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their ſoules for their ſinnes, if they daily labour for mortification, and if they endeuour to ſerue God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of their liues.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe take theſe few directions: Let euery Chriſtian
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21223:47"/>
which deſires to grow in grace be carefull of Gods publicke ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Let them heare Gods word with <hi>Marie,</hi> acknowledging that to be <hi>the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 41.</note>
               <hi>better part;</hi> but let them not vnder that pretence quite caſt off their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular lawfull callings, and ſo liue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, contrary to the rule of the Apoſtle in 2. Theſ. 3. 12. <hi>Now them that are ſuch, we command and exhort by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that with quietneſſe they worke, and eate their owne bread.</hi> And concerning the right hearing of Gods word, take theſe rules, before thou repaireſt to Gods houſe. Firſt, prepare thy ſelfe with repentance, and with an heartie purpoſe of amendment of life. For otherwiſe if thou comeſt to Gods houſe with thine hands full of bloud, God may iuſtly ſay vnto thee: <hi>What haſt thou to do, to tread within my Courts?</hi> Iſaiah 1. 12. Secondly, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſelfe by reading ſome part
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21223:48"/>
of Gods word, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Eunuch, Act. 8. 30. who was well prepared to heare <hi>Philip</hi> preach, when he had prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe firſt by reading the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Thirdly, prepare thy ſelfe for publicke hearing by priuate prayer, praying for thy ſelfe, for the Miniſter, and for the Congregation: beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God of his mercie to open vnto <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 19.</note>the Miniſter <hi>the doore of vtterance,</hi> and to thy ſelfe and the reſt of the <note place="margin">Acts 14. 27.</note>Congregation <hi>the doore of faith.</hi> Fourthly, repaire vnto Gods houſe with an honeſt heart, not to ſee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, not to carpe at the Miniſter, not vpon cuſtom, not to be noted to be religious, nor for feare of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s law: but go with a true deſire to worſhip God, and to reape to thy owne ſoule eternall benefite; according to the example of the Church in Iſay. 2. 3: which ſaith, <hi>Come, let vs go vp to the houſe of the Lord: he will teach vs his</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:21223:48"/>
               <hi>wayes, and we will walke in his paths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, when thou art come to the Church, hearken with all diligence and reuerence to Gods word, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who <hi>attended to the doctrine of Paule,</hi> and <note place="margin">Acts 16. 14.</note>was conuerted. Beware of gazing in the time of Gods ordinance, leſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan tempt thee. Beware of ſleeping in the Congregation, leſt God ſhew his iudgement and execute his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon thee, as he did vpon <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychus.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 20. 9.</note>Take heede of praying and reading other matters in the ſermon time, when thou ſhouldeſt attend vnto the preaching, leſt thou <hi>offer the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 1.</note>
               <hi>ſacrifice of fooles.</hi> Remember that there is a time for all things, and euery <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3. 1.</note>thing ought to be done in its <hi>fit time and ſeaſon.</hi> Sixtly, after thou haſt heard the word, meditate throughly of the points deliuered, leſt Satan come and ſteale the good ſeed out of thine heart; examine thy ſelfe by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21223:49"/>
that which was preached; and if thou findeſt thy ſelfe rebuked for ſinne, let that rebuke preuaile with thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment.</p>
            <p>Alſo when thou haſt heard Gods word, marke the directions, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them: <hi>For, not the hearers but the doers of the Law are iuſt before God,</hi> Rom. 2. 13. And concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, apply them to thy ſelfe if thou findeſt thy ſelfe capable, that is, if thou endeuoureſt to keepe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of them: and indeed the word will profit thee nothing, vnleſſe thou haſt faith to apply it, Heb. 4. 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that thou mayeſt worke out thine owne ſaluation, be carefull frequently and often to be partaker with Gods Church of the Lords Supper. For the Sacrament worthily <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 55.</note>receiued is <hi>meate indeed, and drinke indeed.</hi> Thou muſt not thinke it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to receiue the Sacrament once or twiſe by the yeare, but thinke it an
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21223:49"/>
eſpeciall fauor of God if thou mayeſt receiue it often; alwayes prouided that thou beeſt prepared thereunto, with knowledge, faith, repentance, and charity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, be carefull alſo of priuate duties, reade the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diligently: refreſh thy ſoule morning and euening with ſome Chapter of Gods word. The King himſelfe is not exempted from this holy duty, but the Lord would haue his word to be with him, that he might <hi>reade therein all the dayes of his life,</hi> Deut. 17. 19. And concerning reading Gods word in priuate, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe directions if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt profite. Firſt, lift vp thine heart by prayer before thou readeſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, reade with diligent heede, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of Math. 24. 15. <hi>Let him that readeth, conſider it.</hi> Deſire not to reade faſt, but ſure. Alſo exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy ſelfe by that which thou
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21223:50"/>
readeſt; and ruminate or meditate, that thou mayeſt extract nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and comfort out of that which thou readeſt. Thirdly, reade the word in order, not here a Chapter and there a Chapter; but begin at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a booke, and leaue it not off vntill by degrees thou haſt paſſed through it. Fourthly, if thou readeſt a difficult place, take diligent notice of it, that thou mayeſt aske the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, eſpecially of Gods Miniſters, concerning the meaning.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if thou deſireſt to worke out thine owne ſaluation, and not wilfully to runne vpon thine owne deſtruction, be diligent of priuate prayer. If thou beeſt a maiſter of a family, pray with thy family, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it, that thou and thine houſe may ſerue the Lord: according to the example of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> in the laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that booke, the 15 verſe. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one alſo in the family pray apart
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21223:50"/>
and in ſecret, according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> which made conſcience to pray conſtantly thriſe euery day, to wit, morning, euening, and at noone, Pſal. 55. 17. Dan. 6. 10.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and laſtly, if thou deſireſt to worke out thy ſaluation, walke worthy of thy holy calling whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thou art called. Let thy conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be anſwerable to thy profeſſion: endeuour to liue holily towards God, righteouſly towards men, and ſoberly concerning thy ſelfe. Thus thou ſhalt glorifie God, adorne the Goſpell of Chriſt, and purchaſe to thy ſelfe through Gods free mercie and Chriſts merits, an inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and vndefiled, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reſerued in heauen for thee. Vnto the which glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, he bring vs which hath ſo dearely bought vs, euen Ieſus Chriſt the righteous; to whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21223:51"/>
and the holy Ghoſt, three glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſons, but one God, be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as moſt due, all honour and glorie, from this time forth vnto all eternitie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Amen.</p>
