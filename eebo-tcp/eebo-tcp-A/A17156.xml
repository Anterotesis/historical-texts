            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Would GOD in sutch Uertues, the Chrystians were theyr Equalles. When you haue read the Simples following, then approacheth the <hi>Chirurgian</hi> Plaster, and Salue prepared ready, to make whole the wounded Man holpen by <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> to finishe hys cunning cure. Then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the Apothecarie <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> wyth ryche <hi>Cordials, Pilles, Electuaries,</hi> and Purgations of eche kynde, wyth hys mayster the Physician, who doth dispense euery Medicine in Tyme, Place, Quantity, and good order, to hys Pacient wyth good Diet, trauell, sleepe: and finally, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perturbacions of the Mynde. At whych place good Reader, I should haue declared of other Iudgements, as Pulse, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne, and the proper Cures of euery Feuer, afflicting the Body: whych hereafter, by Gods grace, I shall bryng to passe, if tyme wyll suffer mee to lyue. And vntill sutch tyme, most gentle Reader, take this in good part, from the hands of him, who thincketh it well bestowed vpon thee, if curteously thou doe receyue the same agayne. Thus fare thou hartily well. Thyne euer to hys small power.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Heard my frendes and bretheren say, that there were two kyndes of woundes which doo no lesse differ in name, than in their cures,<note place="margin">Two kyndes of Woundes. the one simple and the other double or com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pound.</note> The one Men call a symple wounde, the other double or compounded. The symple is where no substaunce is lost, and is ensounded &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with one intencion alone. And of this, wee shall make no further adoe, because of the facillity therof. For why? Coblers, Carters, and women bee able to cure such woundes. Now that which is properly called a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is where some substaunce is lost, and necessarily requyreth dyuers intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the cure, as thus. To vnite that which was seperated, to restore that was lost, and to displace an apostumation, if it bee concurraunt with the same. But here note, that amonges woundes, some be vncurable. And it is not inconuenient to begin at the harte, as the cheefe Forte and principal part of the body,</p>
                     <p>Then we say, that euery wounde, annoying and perishing the substance of the harte, it is deadly and vncurable. For why as <hi>Auicen</hi> sayth the harte duryng the natural lyfe, may not suffer any breache of continuance. And therfore to knit vp much in one knot, such woundes as geue let,<note place="margin">What wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds be mortall</note> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, to the vertue, which is necessary to lyfe, take mankynd away, without remedy. As woundes in the substaunce of the Brayn: of the wind pype. of the wessand: of the Lunges: of the Liuer: of the Gaule, of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dryfte, of the Maw: of the Spleen: of the smal guttes: of the kidneis, and bladder: and generally all such woundes, which perce through the bulk and inward partes, be very daungerous. Because the inward parts be altered by mouyng of the ayre from out forth. and the spirites be offended within,<note place="margin">Partes moste daungerous to be hurte.</note> and the vertu natural, which maynteineth lyfe, is destroyed. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why, is that, when these partes be wounded, they be most hardly helped by reason of their continual mouinge and labourynge. And when this may not be made whole, they be notable, ne sufficient to do their offices, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to nature.</p>
                     <p>Now must we speake somwhat of woundes, that happen in muskelles, and lacertes. For they may be thought as daungerous, as the foresayd,<note place="margin">Woundes in the Muskels.</note> For as in the one, be manifest tokens of death, so in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other be Prognosticable signes, for men enflamed with high and diuine foresight.<note place="margin">Example.</note> For a wound in a Muscle doth much lyke a woode Snake, which lyeth in wayt for men out of their way, lurkyng vnder the greene flowers, where he putteth them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> go by in doubt or hasard of their lyfe. Therfore my frends let vs reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of them also, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they leade vs not forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vayne hope, and oppresse vs amonge other, as careles, &amp; ydle heads.

Wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saying of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>

Wherefore the woundes in such partes must be handled warely, and wyth aduysed deliberation. For why, they wil to notablye hynder the <hi>Chirurgian</hi> his estimation, if he prognosticate warely of the same to them that sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by: which thing truly had befallen to my selfe, when I promised a man his life, had not I bene admonished by mayster <hi>Rasis,</hi> who secretly and wittely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to al the family, pluckt me by the elbow, and warned mee, wyth these or lyke wordes in effect. And then the pacientes strength was agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to health, and no apostumation rysen, but he slept as he ayled nothing at all. Consider with thy selfe, sayth he, as thou dost lightly alway, the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whiche induce conuultion in woundes. Whereas there appeareth no swellinge in the soare, in good fayth, I conceiue an euil opinion in, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientes life, which I haue gotten me, with long obseruation. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which should come forth, to the payned place, is supped vp of the syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes. Wherfore I se a conuultion euen at hand, For if the matter, thoughe it were lyttle (for in much it fareth lyke) had issued and gathered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place it would geue me occasion to thinke wel of him. For it shoulde signify, that the matter did relinquish the synewes, and draw outwarde.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A goodly note to be obserued when death is hande.</note>Now in asmuch as it remayneth, as a sleepe within, surely I thynke euil of it: and truly, it was marueilously sayd of him.

Yea, and if there bee any other els, worthy of obseruation, marke the veyne also diligently, that it may stand youe for steede, when neede shall requyre. For this wil require a vigilante Eye of the <hi>Chirurgian.</hi> Wherefore I appeale here to youre se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete hartes, and bid you beware, that ye disgrace not your selues thorow rashnes, but be rype in Prognostications, and circumspect in obseruinge of the tymes of your workinges, Both for one helpe and others.</p>
                     <p>Now all other woundes, these only excepted, which I haue recited, no doubt be curable, And as for the helpe of these that are curable. there are two principall found, the one by the fyrst intention, the other by the second. The latter is, wher deuyded partes are ioyned togeather through a portion of an other kynd of matter. As for an example</p>
                     <p>Bones are ioined, togeather, with a certayn hard matter, much lyke a bone but not a bone which is muche lyke to Alasarte. The other, when partes are ioyned togeather, with their lyke in kynd, as flesh with flesh. And these wayes, we must needes haue before our eyes, to the intent we minister not any thing in wounds, which we might afterward repent. Wherfore to auoyde these euils I iudge it best to begyn with suche thynges as may bee vsed generally, in all kynd of woundes, to helpe mankynde.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou shall fyrst remember, that wounds made, with any longe and round weapen, as an arrow or dart: must not for a few dayes, bee cured by the first intencion, notwithstanding they be cured partly by the fyrst. Some do say they be not cured, by the first, for why?<note place="margin">Example.</note> We keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> open, least the matter be imprisoned here. For if it were so, wounds myghte incurre extreame dolour, by reason of alliance, wyth cordes and sinewes. And therefore we say plainly, they ought not to be shut vp in the first daies.
<pb facs="tcp:7528:119"/>
For my selfe sawe thys in a valyaunt Captaine, at Barwicke, who had a wound in the Necke. And a certayn Phisicion toke the man in hand, and wylling to hast the helpyng of the wound, which ought to haue ben kepte open,<note place="margin">Pate Hardie the Scotte a good Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian.</note> he closed it vp wyth a seame: whereupon, the pacient fell into extreme paine, and as it were, into a continuall conuulsion, insomutch, that if a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Chirurgian,</hi> called Pate Hardie, a Skot, had not put to hys Hand the soner, he had borne his owne message to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead. But to our purpose, where I sayd, notwithstanding, they be cured by the fyrst intencion, this is vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standed, that is where there is no lost substaunce, newly produced in them. For if there were,<note place="margin">Of the fyrst and second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> the cured should be after the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d intencion. And where any substaunce is lost, and ought newly be produced, sewing shal be righte straunge and vntoward. For why, it can not otherwyse be well cured, but by the second.<note place="margin">Matter doth couet digestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </note> For nature seeketh euer restitucion of the lost part, wyth no lesse carefulnesse, than the mother her onely lost Sonne. Wherefore, if wee minde to restore that, we may not sowe vp the wound, or it be recouered. If the wound be deepe, and greatlie altered, by the receipt of the ayre, think of no sewyng.<note place="margin">His name was Iue, of Swasa in Cambrige<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyre.</note> For matter is now secretly caused, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ayre, which cryeth out for digestion, and abstersion. And if the impericke, whome yee know of, had thus handeled the matter, the honest man ye wote of, had ben yet a liue. For when he had taken a large gash in his Legge, and long had left it open to the ayre, thynking to be notablye well cured: caused a <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> to be sent for, which immediatly in all the hast (a Gods name) seweth vp the wound. What wyll ye more? Immediatly after the sewyng, importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dolours did arise,<note place="margin">A wound of a bruse.</note> and on the thyrd day, the legge was so feastred, that in the .vii, the man would needes take his <hi>Vltimum Vale,</hi> and say farewell to the lyuing. Now if the imperike had fyrst vsed digestion with abstersion, and then sewing of the wound: perchaunce the matter had not growen, to that extremitie of death. And in case the wound come by meanes of a bruse then attempt not to sew it. For without doubt, ye shal shortly perceiue, that ye labour in vayne.</p>
                     <p>Whereof <hi>Galen</hi> giueth vs a warning word, sayinge: that it foloweth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,<note place="margin">It is peryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to sew a wound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the biting, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of some beastes.</note> that a bruse should putrifie, and tourne to corruption. I adde, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, if it be an extreame bruse: for in a meane, it taketh no place. Therefore, if it be sewed, the seame wyll soone be corrupted. As wee sawe our selfe, a lusty young man, who came to see a Bull baityng in Parisse Garden, and fallen before the same, I wote not how, the Bull gaue hym in the thygh a rent, wyth the hornes. Now when a <hi>Chirurgian</hi> had taken hym in hand, incontinente he sewed the wound, whych putryfied ryght soone. And certainly, vnlesse maister Backter had helped it, I thinke assuredly, the man had dyed of it. Further we say, that sewyng is not good in a wound, caused by bityng of some beast. For a bytten place, is hollow and abated, or otherwise, somwhat sauoreth of the nature of a bruse. Howbeit, wee leaue this case to the good <hi>Chirurgians</hi> Iudgement. For partes seuered by by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng may well bee ioyned wyth a threede, in some cases. Sewynge is to no purpose, where a Wounde vncouereth a Bone broken, or whole,

Or be it a Lacert, whych is rent in latitude, it is not drawen together, but rather some thyng is put betweene, leaste the skinne grow together. &amp;c. Wherefore he would the wound went at large, whiles the cure is after the second intencion. The same do sinewie places desyre also, for if they be sewed, the Lyppes wyll grow to one, and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes vnder couerte, wyl caste reumetike matter, and shortly cause apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumacion, so that ye shalbe driuen, whether ye wyl or no, to louse the seame or make a new incision. Therefore to auoyd this inconuenience, wee shall suffre sutch wounds, to run at large for a season: and so ye shall haue them, more tractable in handlyng. How bee it, here is a tedious disputacion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. whether a cut sinewe should be sewed, or not. For there bee sundry opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and aucthorityes of the learned, of the one side, and of the other. And verely, if I should dispute the matter, I would mayntayne both the opiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although at this present, I assente wyth maister Ihon de Uigo, not for that I haue sworne, to say as he sayth, but because his words, seeme moste consonaunt to reason.</p>
                     <p>And to <hi>Auicen,</hi> where he sayeth, if the sinewes be broken in latitude, then it is necessary to sewe the wound: and if it be not sewed,<note place="margin">Of sinewes</note> the Wound wyll not grow together. Howbeit, I wyll omit the prosecution of this question sith it is not necessary vnto this treatise. But yet by the way, marke well the saying of <hi>Auicen,</hi> where he commaundeth to sew the wound of necessitye Certes, I, after <hi>Marianus</hi> would let it go open. But he meaneth of a large. wound, whych would cause great deformitye, if it be vnsewed. And lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse, if it bee sewed, that there bee a great distaunce betwene stitch &amp; stitch And on the other side, where I said, I would suffre it to be louse. I ment of a small wound, whych experience shall teach you to be true. Moreouer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dolorous and apostumated wounds, wyll none of sewing, which, what for the facilitie, and manifest apparance, needeth no further declaracion. For the cause is open to them, that wyll diligently consider the matter. These be the causes, where wee vse not to sewe Woundes,<note place="margin">How to sewe a wound, and how not.</note> and bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be put in memory.

Wherefore, once agayne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the accidentes, before mencioned, to the intent we may be able to redresse, and amende them one by one.

And therefore we purpose, to prosecute the amendment of them in their order accordyngly. Now when a compounded Ulcer is offered vs, let vs looke what accidentes be concurrant, hindering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ensounding. For if many maladies or accidentes, were founde in it, we must begin at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which doth most comber the vlcer, as <hi>Auicen</hi> sayth: if we will cure a malady,<note place="margin">In healinge a compounde vlcer, marke the accidentes concurrant.</note> where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers accidents be concurrant, wee must begin at that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whych hath one of these three properties, <hi>Vna earum est ꝙ alia sanari non potest antequam ipsa sanetur vt apostema, &amp;c.</hi> The one is, where the accident is sutch, that if it be not first cured, the vlcer may not be cured, as apostumacion ioyned wyth an vlcer. For in thys case sayth hee, we followe the apostumacion, vnto sutch tyme as the malice of the complexion be displaced, and then we followe the cure of the pryncipall. Wherefore, to followe and obserue the Canons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: we shall order pryncipally our intencions,<note place="margin">Fyrst handle the accidentes in a cure, and note three thynges.</note> so that we fyrst take in hande the accident, whych shall chiefely comber and molest the Paciente and vs in the cure. And the fyrst of these intencions shall be, to order the Pacientes lyfe conueniently. Next to purge the faulty humour, according to the exigente thereof. Thirdly, to amende the maliciousnesse of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in the Ulcer. Thys last shall be deuyded yet agayne, according to the disposicion of the Ulcer, requiring dyuers intencions.<note place="margin">Regimente of lyfe.</note> Now as touchinge the order of lyfe, you may by your owne iudgement consider, what is to bee done therein: partly by hys regiment before tyme, and partely in hys syckenesse tyme, turning hys Dyet to the contrary quality. As thus: if he vsed a colde regiment before, vse hym to hoat, so if dry, moysty, but doe it moderately, and by little and little. For nature cannot away wyth sodayne chaunges: Howbeit thys is not seene lyghtly in humours, wythout longe vse of contraryes in Foodes. Wee shall knowe to purge the humours,<note place="margin">Of vrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sicke or soare man.</note> by the shewing of the sycke Water, in two poynctes, that is, by the colour &amp; substaunce: whereunto is added the residence, wyth hys qualities mutch or little. And by the sygnification of these well considered, wee may try out all the sycke persons complexion.</p>
                     <p>For if the Uryne shall bee thycke in Substaunce, and red in colour: it meaneth that bloud ruleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man. If it be thin of Substaunce, and red of

But if it bee thicke in substaunce, and whyte of colour, then fleume hath the maistrie: as if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce be thynne, and colour whyte, melancholy. Now of, and by the resy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ye shall perceiue the tyme to gyue pocions, and purgacions: for when that begynneth to appeare, it sheweth digestion of the humours to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

If yee wyll knowe howe an Humour shall bee purged, reade <hi>Leonardus Fuchsius</hi> who teacheth to purge, accordyng to the fault of the Humour.

But when, and how, these meanes shall bee put in vre, that shall wee shew, when wee goe aboute to displace the accydents of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.

                     <p>UUe haue entreated before suffyciently of bleeding, comming of a cause primatiue, from whence yee must fetch hither, sutch thinges as there were spoken. For it were superfluous, to speake more of the matter in this place. Wherefore, being at poinct with that accident, I wyl make forth to the rest, and speake no more of this. The like would I do with superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flesh, if I had rehersed the cause of it, when we speake of a sanious Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.

Wherefore take you heede, that yee proceede not to farre, in moistyng of the Fleshe. And as for remedyes, the matter is playne, for that we know the cause: but remember that ye quicken or delaie, in drought and corrosion, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, according as the matter shall require, and as the Flesh shall bee more or lesse swelled vp wyth foggie Fat.

If this happen vnder your hands, if easy remedies profit not (of whych sort be <hi>Vnguentum Apostolorum,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> take a corosyue pouder, &amp; brent Alum) feare not to dry it wyth an hoat Iron also.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7528:129"/>
vtterly interdite and suspend almost, all the vertues, as well naturall as animall, and spirituall. Wherefore of very ryght wee must put our helping hand to this also.</p>
                     <p>For as mutch then, as dolour is as it were a cupping glasse, in drawing matter vnto the place, the writers haue vsed mutch diligence,<note place="margin">Example.</note> in appeasing of it, considering the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, whych may insue thereupon, as ouerthrow of the vertue naturall, fayling of spirites, and contractions of synewes. Al whych accidentes are perilous, &amp; to bee doubted in all maladies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the intent men may eschue thys by a rule: they learne men know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in their publicated workes, that it proceedeth of two causes, that is, of the breach of continuaunce, and alteration of qualityes. As <hi>Galen</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Breach of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce or hurting of the whole me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber.</note> dolours where as they be, declare breach of continuaunce, or sodayne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracion of qualityes: the contynuaunce may be broken four wayes, by incision, corrosion, breaking, and stretching, as in apostumation. Alteraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by heat and cold, moysture, drought, and other sutch lyke. Note, what dyligence they tooke, to fynde the causes of dolour. Now if dolour aryse,<note place="margin">Alteration, what it is,</note> by meanes of incision, as in wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: the fyrst way to appease it, is to sewe it, and next to anoynt hoat oyle Omphacine in the edges and circuit of the wounde. And thys must be don, not once or twyce, but continually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> til it be appeased in a great part. If it come to corrosion, whych accident,<note place="margin">Of dolour.</note> properly pertayneth to an vlcer, it must be remooued also, if we entende to cure the vlcer. But here note, that there be two causes of the matter, a proper,<note place="margin">Two causes of matter.</note> and a depending: the proper cause is, a certayne malignity, or shreudnesse in the fleshe, whych our men call, <hi>proprietas occulta,</hi> the secret property. The cause dependinge is nought els, but euill humours, whych fret and eate out the fleshe when they come to the conuinct, as doth Choler, myxt wyth Salt Flegme. And certaynly, thys latter shall haue neede of euacuation wyth <hi>Cassia, Manna, Diacatholicon,</hi> and other lyke purgations. But as for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it shall be ruled after an other order, euen by comforting of the edges of the vlcer, wyth defensiues, able to cherishe and feede the complexion of the flesh, and with the strong pouder, <hi>Praecipitatus,</hi> cast in the vlcer whose des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription ye shal finde, at the end of the treatises. If it come by breaking, it is eased by setting of the bones, and competent bynding, and situacion of the member. For albeit, the breach be neuer so wel restored, and set in place: there wyll be yet discontinuaunce, if it be vntowardly set to rest. And as for the setting of Bone, yee shall learne at other Mens handes: For their Bookes are replenished, wyth preceptes &amp; rules for the purpose, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Galen. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if alteracion come of extension, or stretching,<note place="margin">Alteracion of extension.</note> as it is in apostumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mollificatiue Medicines shall be best, to prepare the matter to come forth: And <hi>Auicen</hi> sendeth vs to sutch appeasementes, saying, the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy also of Dolour, causeth vs of necessity, to vse mollificatiues, or softning Medicines. But of truth my Friende, if it grewe through alteracion of the Substaunce, the matter must be redressed by the contrary Qualities. For Example. If an Ulcer bee dystempered wyth heate (whych is

To be short, if we worke after thys maner, we shall discomfite al maner dolours, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through excesse of one quality, aboue an other. Thus shall wee wyth proper medicins, succor the humayne lyfe of mankynde, specially when we attayne to the cause of the malady, neyther shall begge remedyes, as doe these Dogleaches,<note place="margin">Example.</note> whych would be called Practicians, a Gods name, and wot not what practice is.

                     <p>Euery good Phisition, my frende, willing to cure his paciente rightlye,<note place="margin">Hardnes of an vlcer</note> wil appoynt himselfe twoo principall intentions, that is, to preserue, and to cure. The fyrst searcheth for the causes, the other imagineth wayes to displace theffect therof. Therfore to the intent we maye be able to remoue this cause, and withstande the effect,<note place="margin">To search the cause, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place the effect</note> let vs see how many causes hardnesse hath. When I was geuen to reade <hi>Chirurgi,</hi> and delyted in the antique bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, I fel bechaunce vppon <hi>Galens</hi> fyrst booke. <hi>De simplicium medicamentoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> where I noted him, to put three causes of hardnes. For it chaunceth,<note place="margin">Thre causes of hardnesse.</note> sayeth he, of to much drought of congelynge of matter, or els of fulnesse &amp; repletion. If it come of drought, moysture wil ease it. And this must bee done with oyntmentes, plasters, and imbrocations, after the mynde of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen,</hi> Imbrocations be made with hoat water,<note place="margin">Imbrocasion.</note> and Mutton broth of the Weather, Plasters may be of all thinges, as ye hard before Now the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes be of <hi>Muscilages,</hi> and sometyme of <hi>Tripharmacon,</hi> as <hi>Mirepsus</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. How beit I suppose <hi>Myrepsus</hi> vsed it in hardnes, caused of frising, and not in drought. For I neuer saw <hi>Tripharmacon</hi> cause moisture, but in hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelacions or frising, it serueth wel, if it be made w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Uineger, which notably cutteth clammy and viscous humours. If it come of fulnesse, (as it is seene in Apostumations) euacuation helpeth the matter: as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> sayeth, sicknesses, which come of replecion or fulnesse, be cured by eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation. Now if ye mynd to resolue it, let it fyrst be softned with some mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lificatiue, and it wil the better vanish and transpire, the pores beyng opened with the mollificatiue. And if it fall to hardnes agayne, rype it agayn with the same medecine as <hi>Auicen</hi> wryteth in the cure of Apostumations, &amp; then let it be resolued. As for the making of these medecines, ye must retourne to the treatise of apostumations, where ye shal fynd a special plaster made of Melilote, Sapa or newe wyne and lye, and an other of the decoction of Beanes, Mallowe leaues. &amp;c. But as for the thyrd kind of hardnesse, partei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to an vlcere, and for an end, if the hardnes wil not be amended by these meansfrete it with some corosiue, according to the maner, as it was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crybed in the correction of hard lippes in an vlcere.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning corrosiue, or gnawing in an vlcere, we would treat to the ful thereof, if we had not medled with the matter,<note place="margin">Corosion or bytynge.</note> when we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the appeasyng of dolour, namely, for that that accident is much more combrous then any of the other, But yet in asmuch as we haue there ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen no remedyes, we wil here haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter a little while in consideration agayne. Wee suppose then, that corosion is termed of that, that it with his sharpenesse, byting, and freting, resolueth, wasteth, and drieth vp the moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the member, after which resolution, the substance of the flesh is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and so falleth to vlceration. Wherfore, according to our determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there be two causes of this, the proper, and depending. And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proper cause, it is as we sayd before, a certayne malignity, or fylthynes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh, which Phisitians call the secrete property. And for the displacyng of

this, ye must consider the property of the member and then temper and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it with defensiues, linimentes, and oyntmentes, made accordinge to your intention, as is that, which I made, respecting both complexcion, and purpose, in the mallady, or euil.</p>

But if it stay, and fynde some let, ye may then think well,<note place="margin">How to serch a wound.</note> that the bone is clouen and cut.

                     <p>Fissures or Chinkes, be caused in the heade two wayes: with a thyng, whych geueth a blunt stripe, or els wyth a thing, whych cutteth.<note place="margin">Fissuries or chappes.</note> If it bee wyth a thyng, that giueth a blunt stripe, the thyng properly, is called a clift or a ryuing. And if it be wyth a cut, it is called a chynke or a clift. And all these varry in length, shortnes, largenes, and smalnes, they vary also other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse. For euery of them, I say, the chinke and clift,<note place="margin">A clift in the heade.</note> may be wyth depressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bone, or wythout depression. For an instrument, whych cutteth, may cause depression, namely, if it be thicke or blunt. And albeit, they agree in the former poynctes, yet they differ in this, that is to say, the clift, which is caused by a bruse, is euer thought to be with penetracion, or through go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing and percing of the bone, where it is not a lyke alway in a cut or incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

For mens Scalpes wyll ryue. and be cut through, rather than be infolded, by reason of the hardnes, and drought of the Bone. Wherefore, men that are come to hardnesse, are depryued of this, which is founde in tender age.

For by the help of drought, we preserue the complexion of the bone, and pannycles whych be dry of complection, as <hi>Galen</hi> wryteth.

Neyther must you maruayle at the matter, my frend Soarenesse, and your Felowes, as dyd one, when he heard a man say, that Hony was moyst in feeling, and drying in vertue and workyng. Uerely of hys corpulency, if I may so say, it moysteth, but as touching his qualityes &amp; vertue, hys operacion is drying. But it was no wonder, that the young Phylosopher, dyd not perceyue the matter: Alas he had not yet read ouer bookes of simples, neyther the Prynciples of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.

Feare is after some euyll tidyngs, or doubte of mischiefe, as losse, pryson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that death wyll quickly insue. Then these thynges wyll follow: The spirites and bloud are all drawen inward, and then all the outwarde. members are pale and colde, wyth tremblyng and fayntnesse of speach. By the reason that all the vertues, both Anymall and Naturall, are made fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and sodaynely weake: through whych often tymes it haue bene seene, that sodayne feare, hath brought sodayne Death: as example: Ely the hygh Priest, ouer the People of GOD, in the Day of the great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, when the Philistines preuayled agaynst Israell: as he satte vpon a Stoole, lokyng towards the waye, hys hearte feared hym, for the arke of GOD: in the meane tyme, there ran a Man hastely vnto him, wyth a lamentable looke, in mournyng Clothes, declaryng vnto hym, fyrste how that Israell was fled and slayne. Secondly, that his two Sonnes, Ophni, and Phinehes were slayne. Thyrdly, that the vncircumcysed had taken the Arke of GOD: at whych tidinges, sutch sodayne feare came to hys heart, that forthwith he fell down backward &amp; brake his neck.

And thys same euill tidings, slue wyth sodayne care, hys daughter in lawe, the wyfe of Phinihes, saying in her death, the glory is gone from Israell.<note place="margin">Euyll paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and euyll Chyldren.</note> This was Elies plague, for sufferyng hys Chyldren to lyue wickedly. For where as God is not feared, at length he wyll sodaynely feare them. Feare I do say, is a marueilous monster, an Infernall Image, and a terrible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the soule: for feare is not for thynges past, but onely for thynges to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to take thyngs in the worst part, Was not Iesus Chryst oure God and sauiour afrayde, what tyme as he set before his eyes, the Paynes and sharpenes of death, <hi>Dolore afficitur anima mea vs<expan>

This was a great feare, euen in Chryst: but yet it made hym not gyue ouer, foreseeing the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of our election by his death. But the feare, whych taketh mortal men, maketh them cowardly oft tymes. Through it Peter dyd sweare, he was none of Chrystes company: and that he knew hym not at all. Feare made Dauid to counterfayt, and go lyke a mad man,<note place="margin">Feare in Chryst.</note> for to auoyde Saule which persecuted hym. Feare made Athanasius, the Bishop of Alexandria, to hide hymselfe syxe yeares in a Caue, from the cruelty of the Arrians,<note place="margin">Feare in S. Peter.
