            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Would GOD in sutch Uertues, the Chrystians were theyr Equalles. When you haue read the Simples following, then approacheth the <hi>Chirurgian</hi> Plaster, and Salue prepared ready, to make whole the wounded Man holpen by <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> to finishe hys cunning cure. Then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth the Apothecarie <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> wyth ryche <hi>Cordials, Pilles, Electuaries,</hi> and Purgations of eche kynde, wyth hys mayster the Physician, who doth dispense euery Medicine in Tyme, Place, Quantity, and good order, to hys Pacient wyth good Diet, trauell, sleepe: and finally, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perturbacions of the Mynde. At whych place good Reader, I should haue declared of other Iudgements, as Pulse, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne, and the proper Cures of euery Feuer, afflicting the Body: whych hereafter, by Gods grace, I shall bryng to passe, if tyme wyll suffer mee to lyue. And vntill sutch tyme, most gentle Reader, take this in good part, from the hands of him, who thincketh it well bestowed vpon thee, if curteously thou doe receyue the same agayne. Thus fare thou hartily well. Thyne euer to hys small power.</p>

Because the inward parts be altered by mouyng of the ayre from out forth. and the spirites be offended within,<note place="margin">Partes moste daungerous to be hurte.</note> and the vertu natural, which maynteineth lyfe, is destroyed. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why, is that, when these partes be wounded, they be most hardly helped by reason of their continual mouinge and labourynge. And when this may not be made whole, they be notable, ne sufficient to do their offices, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to nature.</p>
                     <p>Now must we speake somwhat of woundes, that happen in muskelles, and lacertes. For they may be thought as daungerous, as the foresayd,<note place="margin">Woundes in the Muskels.</note> For as in the one, be manifest tokens of death, so in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other be Prognosticable signes, for men enflamed with high and diuine foresight.<note place="margin">Example.</note> For a wound in a Muscle doth much lyke a woode Snake, which lyeth in wayt for men out of their way, lurkyng vnder the greene flowers, where he putteth them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> go by in doubt or hasard of their lyfe.

The latter is, wher deuyded partes are ioyned togeather through a portion of an other kynd of matter. As for an example</p>
                     <p>Bones are ioined, togeather, with a certayn hard matter, much lyke a bone but not a bone which is muche lyke to Alasarte.

And these wayes, we must needes haue before our eyes, to the intent we minister not any thing in wounds, which we might afterward repent.

For my selfe sawe thys in a valyaunt Captaine, at Barwicke, who had a wound in the Necke.

And if the impericke, whome yee know of, had thus handeled the matter, the honest man ye wote of, had ben yet a liue. For when he had taken a large gash in his Legge, and long had left it open to the ayre, thynking to be notablye well cured: caused a <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> to be sent for, which immediatly in all the hast (a Gods name) seweth vp the wound.

Now if the imperike had fyrst vsed digestion with abstersion, and then sewing of the wound: perchaunce the matter had not growen, to that extremitie of death. And in case the wound come by meanes of a bruse then attempt not to sew it. For without doubt, ye shal shortly perceiue, that ye labour in vayne.</p>
                     <p>Whereof <hi>Galen</hi> giueth vs a warning word, sayinge: that it foloweth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,<note place="margin">It is peryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to sew a wound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the biting, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of some beastes.</note> that a bruse should putrifie, and tourne to corruption. I adde, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, if it be an extreame bruse: for in a meane, it taketh no place. Therefore, if it be sewed, the seame wyll soone be corrupted. As wee sawe our selfe, a lusty young man, who came to see a Bull baityng in Parisse Garden, and fallen before the same, I wote not how, the Bull gaue hym in the thygh a rent, wyth the hornes. Now when a <hi>Chirurgian</hi> had taken hym in hand, incontinente he sewed the wound, whych putryfied ryght soone. And certainly, vnlesse maister Backter had helped it, I thinke assuredly, the man had dyed of it. Further we say, that sewyng is not good in a wound, caused by bityng of some beast. For a bytten place, is hollow and abated, or otherwise, somwhat sauoreth of the nature of a bruse. Howbeit, wee leaue this case to the good <hi>Chirurgians</hi> Iudgement.

                     <p>And to <hi>Auicen,</hi> where he sayeth, if the sinewes be broken in latitude, then it is necessary to sewe the wound: and if it be not sewed,<note place="margin">Of sinewes</note> the Wound wyll not grow together.

                     <p>For if the Uryne shall bee thycke in Substaunce, and red in colour: it meaneth that bloud ruleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man. If it be thin of Substaunce, and red of

colour: doubt not, but choler hath the preheminence. But if it bee thicke in substaunce, and whyte of colour, then fleume hath the maistrie: as if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce be thynne, and colour whyte, melancholy. Now of, and by the resy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ye shall perceiue the tyme to gyue pocions, and purgacions: for when that begynneth to appeare, it sheweth digestion of the humours to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But there be also refractions of colours, and eleuacions, and depressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of residences, whych signyfy the denominacion and Seruyce, of the Naturall Heate,<note place="margin">Of radicall moysture.</note> and wastyng of the radycall Moysture: whych thynges. now are not to bee prosecuted, because thys matter partayneth to a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicion, whereof if God gyue me Lyfe, I purpose to treate at conuenyent leysure: now let thys be suffycient for the cure of an Ulcer. If yee wyll knowe howe an Humour shall bee purged, reade <hi>Leonardus Fuchsius</hi> who teacheth to purge, accordyng to the fault of the Humour.

All whych thyngs we doe orderly, omittyng the former matters, for a time, because trouble hath preuented me.</p>
                     <p>UUe haue entreated before suffyciently of bleeding, comming of a cause primatiue, from whence yee must fetch hither, sutch thinges as there were spoken. For it were superfluous, to speake more of the matter in this place. Wherefore, being at poinct with that accident, I wyl make forth to the rest, and speake no more of this. The like would I do with superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flesh, if I had rehersed the cause of it, when we speake of a sanious Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. The cause of superfluous fleshe, is to mutch moisture and vncleane mundyficacion, as <hi>Auicen</hi> thinketh, in the Chapiter of Ulcers. sayinge: In some Ulcers groweth superfluous flesh,<note place="margin">The cause of superfluous fleshe.</note> and in some it groweth<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> not. And the Ulcers where it groweth, be they in the which, to mutch haste is made, in the repaire of flesh, before complete mundificacion. Wherefore take you heede, that yee proceede not to farre, in moistyng of the Fleshe. And as for remedyes, the matter is playne, for that we know the cause: but remember that ye quicken or delaie, in drought and corrosion, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, according as the matter shall require, and as the Flesh shall bee more or lesse swelled vp wyth foggie Fat. We haue seene that thys kinde of maladies, hath not felte, nor forsed of other remedies, and hath required an

If this happen vnder your hands, if easy remedies profit not (of whych sort be <hi>Vnguentum Apostolorum,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> take a corosyue pouder, &amp; brent Alum) feare not to dry it wyth an hoat Iron also. And if ye shal so do, &amp; a blisterous crust be risen: ye may displace it, as we shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our treatise of apostumacions, &amp; then returne to the cure agayne.</p>

For why, thys is now and then so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, cruell and sharp, that it doth not only exclude the cure of vlcers, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7528:129"/>
vtterly interdite and suspend almost, all the vertues, as well naturall as animall, and spirituall. Wherefore of very ryght wee must put our helping hand to this also.</p>
                     <p>For as mutch then, as dolour is as it were a cupping glasse, in drawing matter vnto the place, the writers haue vsed mutch diligence,<note place="margin">Example.</note> in appeasing of it, considering the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tes, whych may insue thereupon, as ouerthrow of the vertue naturall, fayling of spirites, and contractions of synewes. Al whych accidentes are perilous, &amp; to bee doubted in all maladies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the intent men may eschue thys by a rule: they learne men know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in their publicated workes, that it proceedeth of two causes, that is, of the breach of continuaunce, and alteration of qualityes. As <hi>Galen</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Breach of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce or hurting of the whole me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber.</note> dolours where as they be, declare breach of continuaunce, or sodayne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracion of qualityes: the contynuaunce may be broken four wayes, by incision, corrosion, breaking, and stretching, as in apostumation. Alteraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by heat and cold, moysture, drought, and other sutch lyke. Note, what dyligence they tooke, to fynde the causes of dolour. Now if dolour aryse,<note place="margin">Alteration, what it is,</note> by meanes of incision, as in wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>des: the fyrst way to appease it, is to sewe it, and next to anoynt hoat oyle Omphacine in the edges and circuit of the wounde. And thys must be don, not once or twyce, but continually<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> til it be appeased in a great part. If it come to corrosion, whych accident,<note place="margin">Of dolour.</note> properly pertayneth to an vlcer, it must be remooued also, if we entende to cure the vlcer. But here note, that there be two causes of the matter, a proper,<note place="margin">Two causes of matter.</note> and a depending: the proper cause is, a certayne malignity, or shreudnesse in the fleshe, whych our men call, <hi>proprietas occulta,</hi> the secret property. The cause dependinge is nought els, but euill humours, whych fret and eate out the fleshe when they come to the conuinct, as doth Choler, myxt wyth Salt Flegme. And certaynly, thys latter shall haue neede of euacuation wyth <hi>Cassia, Manna, Diacatholicon,</hi> and other lyke purgations. But as for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it shall be ruled after an other order, euen by comforting of the edges of the vlcer, wyth defensiues, able to cherishe and feede the complexion of the flesh, and with the strong pouder, <hi>Praecipitatus,</hi> cast in the vlcer whose des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription ye shal finde, at the end of the treatises. If it come by breaking, it is eased by setting of the bones, and competent bynding, and situacion of the member. For albeit, the breach be neuer so wel restored, and set in place: there wyll be yet discontinuaunce, if it be vntowardly set to rest. And as for the setting of Bone, yee shall learne at other Mens handes: For their Bookes are replenished, wyth preceptes &amp; rules for the purpose, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Galen. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if alteracion come of extension, or stretching,<note place="margin">Alteracion of extension.</note> as it is in apostumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mollificatiue Medicines shall be best, to prepare the matter to come forth: And <hi>Auicen</hi> sendeth vs to sutch appeasementes, saying, the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy also of Dolour, causeth vs of necessity, to vse mollificatiues, or softning Medicines. But of truth my Friende, if it grewe through alteracion of the Substaunce, the matter must be redressed by the contrary Qualities. For Example. If an Ulcer bee dystempered wyth heate (whych is
<pb facs="tcp:7528:130"/>
perceyued by rednesse in the circuite) it is redressed by a colde Oyntment. And if the substaunce be fallen to cold,<note place="margin">When to vse contraryes in hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To be short, if we worke after thys maner, we shall discomfite al maner dolours, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through excesse of one quality, aboue an other. Thus shall wee wyth proper medicins, succor the humayne lyfe of mankynde, specially when we attayne to the cause of the malady, neyther shall begge remedyes, as doe these Dogleaches,<note place="margin">Example.</note> whych would be called Practicians, a Gods name, and wot not what practice is.

Euen so fareth it with these groping prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians: for why? they be not able to distynct, neyther tymes of sicknesse, neyther know the causes of them, or properties of oyntments, as he who bare men in hand, wyth grauity of words, that he was a practician: and when one demaunded, what quality <hi>Vnguentum Rosarum</hi> had, he aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great deliberacion, a Gods name, hoat, yea Mary sir Íùô the other a worthy aunsweare for sutch a practician.

                     <p>Now, as touching apostumacion, concurrant wyth vlcers, what should I say,<note place="margin">Apostumatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> concurrant with an vlcer</note> sithen we haue largely sayd in the matter, when we spake of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumacions?

As for the making of these medecines, ye must retourne to the treatise of apostumations, where ye shal fynd a special plaster made of Melilote, Sapa or newe wyne and lye, and an other of the decoction of Beanes, Mallowe leaues. &amp;c.

Wherfore, according to our determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there be two causes of this, the proper, and depending.

Whych if yee mynde to cure rightly, yee shall forthwyth prouyde these thynges before your eyes.

Yee shall search it thus. Draw the Searcher to and fro, pretely vppon the Bone: and if it slyde playnly wythout stay, it is a sygne the Scalpe is saulfe and sounde.

But if it stay, and fynde some let, ye may then think well,<note place="margin">How to serch a wound.</note> that the bone is clouen and cut. But now, in as mutch as we speak of rimmes, and because they be dyuers, this place requireth, to distincte them properly, or euer we medle further in the cure.</p>
                     <p>Fissures or Chinkes, be caused in the heade two wayes: with a thyng, whych geueth a blunt stripe, or els wyth a thing, whych cutteth.<note place="margin">Fissuries or chappes.</note> If it bee wyth a thyng, that giueth a blunt stripe, the thyng properly, is called a clift or a ryuing. And if it be wyth a cut, it is called a chynke or a clift. And all these varry in length, shortnes, largenes, and smalnes, they vary also other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse. For euery of them, I say, the chinke and clift,<note place="margin">A clift in the heade.</note> may be wyth depressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bone, or wythout depression. For an instrument, whych cutteth, may cause depression, namely, if it be thicke or blunt. And albeit, they agree in the former poynctes, yet they differ in this, that is to say, the clift, which is caused by a bruse, is euer thought to be with penetracion, or through go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing and percing of the bone, where it is not a lyke alway in a cut or incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I say this of mens scalpes, and not of chyldren. For in chyldren, which be within seuen yeare of age: we may be deceyued, as we see by experience. For why, sutch sculles will be infolded,<note place="margin">A note. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a mans Scull, and a voyes.</note> because they be not yet hardned ne strengthned: and moysture also abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>deth in them, whych property is not founde in mens scalpes that are come to ripe age. For mens Scalpes wyll ryue. and be cut through, rather than be infolded, by reason of the hardnes, and drought of the Bone. Wherefore, men that are come to hardnesse, are depryued of this, which is founde in tender age. And after what sort, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of these may be cured, we shall declare orderly, when we haue fyrst pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed the intencions, whych must needes be obserued, if we intend ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to eschue daungers in sutch cases.

                     <p>Presupposing then the regiment of lyfe, these be the chiefe and pryncipall intencions about thys cure: that is to wit, to conserue the complexion of the member in hys proper state, to prohibite Apostumacions, and to apply locall medicines fit for the purpose.

Wherefore in so doing, they open the way to apostumation whyles they thyncke to preuent and stop it, and become occasion of the Pacients death.

                     <p>Now, in case the Body bee full, and replenished wyth humours,<note place="margin">When to let bloud, two tymes in one place, &amp; why.</note> ye shall let your Pacient bleede agayne, in the same place, where yee let him bloud before. But if the apostumation were in the clensing places, as vnder the arme holes, Flankes, and eares, I would in no wyse let my Pacient blede, for that malady: because I fynde not, why I shoulde so doe. For an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumacion may not a rise, in the emunctory places, but by euilnesse or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of some pryncipall member, or by reason of the superfluities of some member adiacent. If the place be apostumated through matter, expelled from a principall member: Fleubotomy were not to the purpose, because the matter myght bee reuoked inwarde, whych Nature had put forth. Neyther should it be well to the purpose also, if the swelling came of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluityes, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next parts thereunto. For we should put the matter from the vnnoble and petite member, and burdein agayne the pryncipall wyth it, whereof would ensue great inconueniences and daungers.

And it shall make no matter, whether yee open the veyne in the ryghte syde, or left, so the Apostumation bee in the vpper part of the body: but in case the apostumation be in the lower part,<note place="margin">If an apostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midst of the vpper part of the body, then to bleede ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> left arme, or else right, is well.</note> bloud may bee taken from the Lyuer veynes, in the foote of the <hi>opposite</hi> parte, accordinge as yee shall thyncke it most conuenient.

For it shall altogether haue vertue, to dry and to moyst, because as I iudge, medycines for the head, must actually moyst, and drye potencially. For by the help of drought, we preserue the complexion of the bone, and pannycles whych be dry of complection, as <hi>Galen</hi> wryteth.

All these thynges shall we obtayne, wyth Rosed Hony strayned, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> &amp; the pouder, whych we shal order in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cure. Neyther must you maruayle at the matter, my frend Soarenesse, and your Felowes, as dyd one, when he heard a man say, that Hony was moyst in feeling, and drying in vertue and workyng. Uerely of hys corpulency, if I may so say, it moysteth, but as touching his qualityes &amp; vertue, hys operacion is drying. But it was no wonder, that the young Phylosopher, dyd not perceyue the matter: Alas he had not yet read ouer bookes of simples, neyther the Prynciples of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. Lady Ignoraunce caused him to muse, but not to search the cause, as did the Phylosophers, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> wryteth, in his supernaturals. He woulde not haue marueyled, if hee had read <hi>Aristotle</hi> concerning the mynglinge of the Elementes: whereby hee shoulde haue easely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, that Hony is of the Qualityes, whereof I reported it to be, by reason of the complection in mynglyng, if it bee aduisedly consydered, according to his essence and Nature. And if there shall bee any man, whych shall not perceyue throughly, the Nature of the Symples, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in Medicines, yet let hym assuredly perswade hymselfe, that I wyll descrybe no other way of Cure, than I haue wrytten, and haue got thereby, both profyt and good well spent tyme: yee haue heard the cautelles and prouisions, whych I recken necessary.

For why, in that case it coulde not be otherwyse, but some gobet of bone would be vnder the scalp, pricking the vtter rimme, or <hi>Dura mater.</hi> And in thys case heare them not, whych shall counsayle &amp; perswade, to remooue part of the brused, and to leaue part.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to auoyde, and eschue the sayd cause, let vs take forth all the brused. But if the clift be founde, wythout depressing of the bone, ye may not cut out altogether, but only make an hole in that part, where the matter shall most easely come forth.

Then these thynges wyll follow: The spirites and bloud are all drawen inward, and then all the outwarde. members are pale and colde, wyth tremblyng and fayntnesse of speach. By the reason that all the vertues, both Anymall and Naturall, are made fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and sodaynely weake: through whych often tymes it haue bene seene, that sodayne feare, hath brought sodayne Death: as example: Ely the hygh Priest, ouer the People of GOD, in the Day of the great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, when the Philistines preuayled agaynst Israell: as he satte vpon a Stoole, lokyng towards the waye, hys hearte feared hym, for the arke of GOD: in the meane tyme, there ran a Man hastely vnto him, wyth a lamentable looke, in mournyng Clothes, declaryng vnto hym, fyrste how that Israell was fled and slayne.
