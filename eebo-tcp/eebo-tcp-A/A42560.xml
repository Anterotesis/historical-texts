         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Honey-Bee is known by
long experience to be ſuch
an Induſtrious and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Creature, that it has been
ever accounted a delightful and
profitable labour to provide for
its preſervation, by providing it
a Houſe to live and work in, and
Food in Winter and other bad
ſeaſons, when through diſtreſs it
cannot provide for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meliſſus</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be the firſt that invented
and taught the uſe of Hives, and
of Honey, which is become ſo
profitable for the health of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gulielmus</hi> a <hi>Conchis</hi> writes,
that in his time, a Conſul of <hi>Rome</hi>
was ſo much delighted with this
<pb facs="tcp:100261:3"/>
excellent Creature, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Hives of Tinn-horn to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in his Gardens, that
through the horn he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their work.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory affords many more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of honourable perſons in
all ages, who have delighted in
this care of Bees: Yea, many at
this time in <hi>Poland,</hi> and other
Kingdoms, make good Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
by the profitable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Bee-keeping; and it
is certain, that if Apifactories
were encouraged, a Kingdom
might be conſiderably advantag'd
thereby.</p>
            <p>But the former forms of Hives,
are ſubject to ſo many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
charge, trouble, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties,
that men have been much
diſcourag'd from the pleaſant
and profitable improvement of
Bee-keeping; this many have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
and complain'd of: And
<pb facs="tcp:100261:3"/>
I have found it by experience,
wherefore it animated me to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
if by a new form of Hives
theſe Inconveniences might be
redreſſed or prevented. So after I
had try'd ſeveral forms, I at laſt
found one which anſwered my
expectation, which is the ſame
that I publiſh in this little Tract.</p>
            <p>After I had communicated in
general my experience to ſeveral
perſons of quality, they judged
the invention commodious, and
better then they any way yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed;
and they deſir'd me to
publiſh it, which I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do, until by further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
I had found the great
advantage and conveniency of
the ſame.</p>
            <p>But while I was thinking only
of communicating this Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to my Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
I was advertiſed by
an Ingenious Gentleman, that
<pb facs="tcp:100261:4"/>
the Illuſtrious Royal Society at
<hi>Greſham-Colledge</hi> (thoſe great
Encouragers and Promoters of
Learning, and Honourers of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention)
had in a Tranſaction
<hi>(Numb. 96. July</hi> 21. 1673.)
given a deſcription of one of my
Boxes (which they had gotten
from Sr. <hi>Robert Murray,</hi> and he
from Sir <hi>William Thomſon,</hi> who
had got it from me, together
with a written Deſcription of its
parts and uſe, not intended for
publication, but for private ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
only:) And that they
had approved of the ſame as the
beſt form of Hives yet invented.</p>
            <p>This encouraged me to the
publication of the Houſe and
Hives together; for (I ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
if that Illuſtrious Society e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
ſo much of a lame
and defective repreſentation
of a part, then would they
much more eſteem the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb facs="tcp:100261:4"/>
when certified of the
long experience of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
and conveniency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>The ſubject-matter then of the
Tract, is the deſcription of the
Hives and Houſes, together with
their uſe advantage &amp; excellency
beyond any other forms of Hives
yet invented; which I intend to
treat of with all poſſible brevity &amp;
perſpicuity: But firſt I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the following Hypotheſes or
fundamental truths, upon which,
as upon a baſe, the whole Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the enſuing diſcourſe is
founded; and they are theſe:</p>
            <p>1. It is natural for all Bees to
begin at the top, and to work
downwards.</p>
            <p>2. That Bees ſwarm for want
of room.</p>
            <p>3. That a great hinderance of
their labour is confuſion about
Swarming, and miſpending their
time in Luxury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100261:5"/>
4. That Idleneſs, cauſes Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
and extravagant and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
increaſe of Bees, which
being by this commodious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of labour and induſtry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
the uſual, but unkind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
of ſmothering and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is likewiſe avoyded.</p>
            <p>5, That the great charge and
trouble attending upon Swarming
of Bees does diſcourage the
Owner and conſume his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>

               <note place="margin">Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
or <hi>Firr-Deals,</hi> or of
the ſame materials
that the <hi>London</hi>-Pales,
for carrying
water, or as your Buſhel or
Peck-meaſure in the Country.</p>
            <p>For their Dimenſion, it is fit
that each Box be of that large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that it may contain a Buſhel,
the height not exceeding 12 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and its breadth one third
more than the heighth; that ſo
they may the more conveniently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100261:6"/>
ſtand upon one another; and that
when the Bees come in Loaden,
they may not have a great height
to go up.</p>
            <p>The Box is in figure an <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
or eight ſquare, or round,
each ſide 9 inches in breadth; it
is covered cloſe at the top, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a ſquare hole in the middle
4. inches long and broad, with a
ſhutter that ſlides to and fro in a
Groove,<note place="margin">Figure.</note> about half an inch longer
than the hole. It has 4. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
each in figure a <hi>Rhombus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Parts.</note>
or like an ordinary pain of glaſs,
oppoſite to one another, and in
them pains of glaſs, ſhutters
to cover them. The Door for
the Bees is divided into 6. holes,
half an inch wide, and an inch in
height, for the better helping the
Bees to carry out their dead;
each of theſe holes has a ſhutter,
that ſlides up and down in a
Groove, to cover leſs or more as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100261:6"/>
the ſeaſon requires, or as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
offers. Each Box has two
Iron handles, with joynts to be
placed about the middle of the
Box on the ſides thereof, for liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame up, to ſet another
under it, or for tranſporting the
ſame for uſe, when the Bees have
wrought down to the lower Box.
At the top of the Box there is a
creaſe or rebbit all round it, about
half an inch in depth on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and an inch in height, and
another in the inſide at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
which ſerves to ſix them,
when ſet upon one another. Each
Box has alſo a hole at the bottom
upon the ſide, that ſhuts with a
ſliding cover; this is to be open'd
and us'd (when the Boxes are
placed upon one another, and the
uppermoſt is full of Honey, and
all the Bees are wrought down to
the lower Box) for ſhutting the
ſquare hole in the top of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100261:7"/>
Box, that its cover may divide
and cut the work, in the upper
Box from the work in the lower;
And for this end, it is fit that the
ſquare end of that ſliding ſhutter
be covered with Lattin or Iron
well ſharpned, that it may cut
the work the better.</p>
            <p>Within each Box there is a
ſquare frame made of four poſts
joynted together, by 12. ſmall
ſticks, and 6. other croſſing theſe,
and one ſtanding perpendicular
in the middle of the frame, the
frame conſiſting of the 4. poſts,
and 19 ſmall ſticks; this frame
is to be put within the Box, and
faſtned to 4. ſides thereof by
8. ſcrews, two in each poſt; upon
this frame are the Bees to faſten
their work, and this is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
for when you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

            <p>The uſe of the pains of glaſs,
is not only for pleaſure, to behold
the work and labour of the Bees;
but alſo to know their ſtrength,
idleneſs, fulneſs, or want of
room, that ſo you may inlarge or
remove them as you pleaſe. And
whereas ſome may think that the

            <head>Of the convenient ſcituation
of your Bee-Houſes.</head>
            <p>HAving deſcrib'd the Boxes
and Houſe, it will be ſit
in the next place to adviſe
you how to ſcituate your Houſe
with greateſt conveniency for
the warmneſs, quiet, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of flying abroad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home of your Bees.</p>
            <p>Firſt: Of all your Gardens,
Commons, and Incloſures, that
which you would beſtow moſt
pains upon, in Planting and
Hedging, is the fitteſt place for
building of your Bee-Houſe in,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100261:17"/>
for Bees get their moſt Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Food of Trees.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Take care you be
well guarded from the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
or cold ſtorms, and ſee that
the Houſe be fencible againſt all
their Enemies and yours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Place your Houſe in
the moſt Valley-ground, that the
aſcent may be when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and the deſcent when
they return home laden with
work.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: Build not your
Houſe directly Eaſt and Weſt,
but a point or two from the
South-eaſt, to the North-Weſt,
becauſe the Bees come not forth
in the Morning before the Sun is
riſen, and they continue after the
Sun is ſet, at work and exerciſe,
if the Night be fair and calm,
whereby ſeveral days ſome hours
are gain'd to their advantage.</p>
            <p>Fifthly: Beware that you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-lay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100261:17"/>
not your ground with too
many Colonies, for there will be
more profit of a few Colonies
well nouriſh'd, then of many in
over-laid ground: Wherefore,
build your Houſe according to
your ground.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: It well be worth the
expence and pains of any Bee-Maſter
to plant ſuch Trees in his
ground, as conduce moſt for the
food and nouriſhment of Bees, as
the Oak, Palm-tree, and Elm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Alſo, it will be convenient that he
plant his Gardens with Time,
Balm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly: If the Houſe be
built near Meadows, where Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel

Swarm in the old form of Straw-Hives,

mark that ſide of it that is the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
paſſage of the Bees in and
out; place it upon the top of the

it round on the edge of the old
Hive, ſo as to ſtop all paſſſages

way but through the box;
and if it happen that the old Hive
be broader then the top of the
box you are to place it on, then
take a thin board made broad,
with a hole cut in it even with
the hole of the box, and ſo put
the Hive on it, being between the

how they go forward with their
work.</p>
            <p>Alſo, let all the doors of the
Houſe be kept ſhut but upon like
occaſion, except the ſmall ledge
at the bottom, which muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
open, ſave in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>When you find that firſt box
full of Work and Bees, except it
be very late in the year, take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
box of the Collony, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100261:19"/>
having prepar'd it as the former,
lift up the firſt box, with the Hive
upon it, by a Pulley faſtned to the
top of the houſe, or by hands,
and put the ſecond box in the
place of the firſt, under the firſt
box and Hive, having perſons
ready upon the lifting up of the
box and Hive, with their hands to
direct it ſo as they may fall in the
creaſes or rebbits; and ſo leave
the Bees to work down into the
ſecond box, till they have filled
it alſo, which is not to be expected
the firſt, Summer except the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
be very advantageous. Then
at the uſual time of the year, for
taking of Bees, take off the old
Hive for uſe, which will be filled
with work, but no Bees, for they
will be working in the loweſt box.
This tranſplantation of the Bees,
is only uſed the firſt time that you

that although there
be three boxes in one Colony,
yet you muſt know by your

full of work, and the body of the
Bees working in the loweſt box.
Likewiſe ſpecial reſpect muſt be
had to the ſeaſon of the year,

the boxes are to be taken off in

off the upper box, then unſcrew
the pinns of the ſide, and let out

ſcrew in the Frame into its place

between the Hives, the hole in

put on again the box you took off

let it always be Circulated as ſoon

or experimented, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
not fit for a wiſe man
to disburſe a ſum of money up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I anſwer, That the Rationale
of the propoſal, with the preſent
certificate of ſeveral ſubſtantial
perſons living near the place
where this hath been practiſed
and experimented with ſucceſs
full Seven years; together, with
an expreſs account thereof given
in the printed Tranſaction
<hi>(Numb. 96. July</hi> 21. 1673.)
Of the Illuſtrious Royal Society
at <hi>Greſham</hi>-Colledge, is enough
to encourage any ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to run ſo ſmall a hazard, for
ſo great an advantage.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> If then this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
of ſo great an advantage,
has been known for ſeveral years
by many perſons, how comes it
to paſs that it han't been practis'd
alſo by many perſons? Anſwer,
That perſon that manag'd it, has
not been ſo free to accommodate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100261:24"/>
perſons with the perfect meaſures
&amp; ſecrets of it, although it has
been often and earneſtly deſired
of him by perſons of Quality.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Object.</hi> Seeing the Bees
are ſtill preſerv'd from deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then we find by calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they'l increaſe to ſo great a
number and ſwarm, as the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
won't be able to contain
them. Anſwer, If the Honey
be ſeaſonably taken from them,
ſo as Room be left to work in,
they'l be more induſtrious, and
leſs luxurious; ſo that experience
will teach you, that they increaſe
in number only, becauſe of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and heat, for theſe make
them luxurious.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Object.</hi> That you depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them of their Honey, and
not deſtroying them, keeps them
only alive to be ſtarv'd in Winter.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. It being clear from
the premiſes, that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
of their time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100261:25"/>
made ⅔ of proviſion
more in that time, the Owners
may as ſafely take away ⅔ of their
Honey, upon a right judgment
made by inſpection through the
glaſs, and leaving but one third,
as they that leave a ſtock full of
Bees and Honey.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Object.</hi> That the charge of
5. or 6. pound in ſetting them
up at firſt, does bring a preſent
inconveniency upon the Owner.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, The ample and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
aforementioned advance of
his profit and freedom from the
continued charge of old Bee-Hives,
does abundantly overba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
that preſent inconveniency
or charge.</p>
