            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle giveth a large teſtimony to the Saints of <hi>Philippi</hi> concerning the ſincerity and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of their graces; yet not being ſatisfied with the meaſure to which they had attained, he preſſeth them to a farther growth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe: And for this end having laid before them his own example, he exhorteth them, <hi>Brethren, be followers of us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and mark them which walk ſo, as ye have us for an example.</hi> Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation he enforceth by two main arguments:</p>
            <p n="1">1 From the baſeneſſe of their way, who took a contrary courſe, and the wofull iſſue of that way: they were enemies to<note place="margin">Ver. 18, 19.</note> the croſſe of Chriſt, their God was their belly, their glory was in their ſhame, they minded earthly things: the iſſue is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, their end is deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2 From the excellency of the way wherein he walked, and<note place="margin">V. 20. 21.</note> the bleſſed and glorious iſſue of that way. His way is deſcribed in theſe words, <hi>Our converſation is in heaven:</hi> the iſſue in the words following: where he ſheweth, that as the converſation of the Saints is in heaven, ſo their expectation is from heaven. Where may be obſerved, 1. The Perſon whoſe appearing they expect, <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> their Saviour, in whom all their hopes are treaſured up. 2. The fruit of His appearing, and that is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious change to be wrought in their whole man, though that of the body onely, be here expreſſed.</p>
            <p>In this change may be noted foure things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> the condition wherein their bodies ſhall be found before they are transformed, a ſtate of vileneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:113857:4"/>Secondly, The <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the condition into which they ſhall be changed, a ſtate of glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The pattern according to which they ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the glorious body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The power by which this glorious change ſhall be wrought, and that is the efficacy or working of Chriſt, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf: which is the thing I intend to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>This change is wonderfull, that ſuch vile bodies ſhould be transformed into a condition ſo exceedingly glorious, yet no way incredible, if we conſider that it ſhall be done by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, of whom it was prophecied of old, <hi>His Name ſhall be called Wonderfull,</hi> The mighty God, who wrought ſuch wonders<note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 6.</note> in the dayes of his humiliation, and diſcovered ſo much of God in the form of a ſervant, and (which was the height of wonders) when he was dead, by his own power, by the Almighty working of his eternall Spirit, and Divine nature, raiſed himſelf from death to life. So that here we ſee the Apoſtle aſcendeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high in aſſerting this truth, which ſeemeth ſo far above rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: he hath recourſe to Chriſt his omnipotency, who hath all power in heaven and earth, and is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf, and not only the power, but the efficacy, the working,<note place="margin">

And in aſmuch as the Apoſtle doth not confine his ſpeech to this particular of changing the bodies of the Saints, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth himſelf in an univerſal expreſſion of the efficacy or working of Chriſts Almighty power, whereby he is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things to himſelf; I purpoſe to follow him herein, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting you with this obſervation from the text, that,</p>

Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have no conſiſtency, but would diſſolve, the frame of their nature would be disjoynted and fall aſunder, did not he hold them together, and therefore how eaſie is it for him to ſubdue them to himſelf.

            <p>For the farther cleering and ſtrengthening of this truth, let us conſider the various workings and different wayes of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing this power of his, for the ſubduing of all things to himſelf.

complicated and interwoven, that the three laſt will fall in with the firſt, and it would require much time to purſue every one of them diſtinctly; I purpoſe to inſiſt onely upon the firſt, taking the reſt in collaterally.</p>
            <p>Theſe objects which Chriſt hath to work upon, are either ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures, or ſuch as are void of the principles of reaſon. The former are Angels or men.</p>
            <p>The Angels which are holy He preſerveth in that ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection<note place="margin">1</note> to Himſelf wherein they continued when the reſt left their habitation, upholding them not onely in their beings, but in the integrity and perfection of their beings, whoſe perfection is their voluntary ſubordination to the Son of God, Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Head of all principality and power:<note place="margin">Col. 2. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But as theſe Angels good and evill are inviſible ſpirits, ſo the workings of Chriſt in ſubduing them ſeem more inviſible and ſecret, than thoſe which He exerciſeth upon thoſe rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are viſible, <hi>viz.</hi> men and women, which are to be conſidered in the next place.</p>
            <p>Theſe we may look upon either, 1. as ſingle perſons; or, 2. as<note place="margin">3</note> aſſociated and combined in Societies, Kingdoms, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, &amp;c. As ſingle perſons they are either veſſels of mercy and honour, or veſſels of wrath and diſhonour. The former He ſubdueth by the Scepter of His Goſpel, and power of His grace, ſecretly, but effectually and infallibly, bowing and ſubjecting their ſouls and whole man to the government of His Spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them by His love ſhed abroad in their hearts, and bringing them under a regiment of love, ſweetning His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with diſcoveries of His love, and (as it were) oyling His yoke with love, ſo making it eaſie to them, and teaching them to obey in love, and to walk in love as He hath loved them, and given Himſelf for them: giving His own Spirit poſſeſſion of their hearts, and making them one with Himſelf, and ſo ſubjecting them to Himſelf as members to their Head. And this He doth by degrees, leaving ſomething in them unſubdued, while they are abſent from Him in the body (which as it is diſpleaſing to Him, ſo it is grievous to them) but in the end He will not leave any thing in them either of ſoul or body unſuitable to Himſelf, but will bring them into a full ſubjection and conformity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their bodies into the likeneſſe of His own glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and their ſouls into the likeneſſe of His own perfect holineſſe, fulneſſe of joy, and bleſſedneſſe.

The workings of Chriſt in this kinde have been more glorious and conſpicuous in ſome ages than in others: as in the times of the Apoſtles and the ages next after, when thouſands were ſubdued at once, Cities and Nations were brought in ſubjection to Chriſt: the devill raged, and ſtirred up his inſtruments to oppoſe the growth of Chriſt His kingdom with fire and ſword: <hi>Nec eò minùs ad Apoſtolorum vocem gentes commoventur: principum aulae legioneſ<expan>

Some experience of this the world hath already had, in the Eaſtern Babylon, in the City of Jeruſalem, after that Himſelf was crucified there, his Goſpel rejected, his people perſecuted, to what a fearfull deſolation did he bring it by the hands of the <hi>Romanes!</hi> and the Temple it ſelf when it was kept up as a Monument of defiance againſt him, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance o thoſe ſacrifices which were aboliſhed by his death, by a people blaſpheming his Name, he deſtroyed it: and when that wretched people attempted to rebuild it, through the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, he fully (as is conceived) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his prophecy upon it, not leaving one ſtone upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.

But here is the comfort of the Church, the mighty vertue and working of Chriſt ſhall ſubdue them all.

Certainly Chriſt His approaches have been very glorious of late, and the Antichriſtian faction hath been much weakened by Him: very much of the power of Chriſt hath been put forth againſt thoſe who have ſided with the Beaſt. But I am perſwaded the time is at hand, when Chriſt ſhall come in a more glorious manner, and give forth more admirable demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His power in ſubduing thoſe enemies, who have for ſo long a time oppoſed and exalted themſelves againſt Him. For I conceive we are under the ſeventh trumpet, to which all the ſeven vials full of the wrath of God, to be emptied upon the enemies of the Church, do belong; and under the fourth viall powred on the Sun. Now mark what is ſaid upon the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet. <hi>And the ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there</hi>

them to go on in acts of hoſtility for a time, as if he had laid by his great power: but when he ſeeth his time, taketh up his power again, raiſeth his Armies to ſuppreſſe them. So Chriſt may ſeem for divers ages to have laid by His great power, ſuffering the Dragon and his Angels, and then the Beaſt and his ten horns to reign and domineer: But at the ſounding of the ſeventh trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, He ſhould take to Himſelf His great power and reign. And therefore now let the people of God expect wonders to be wrought by the great power of Chriſt daily. It followeth, <hi>And the Nations were angry:</hi> the devill being caſt out of the throne by Chriſt, ſtirreth up his vaſſals to anger: and we have had great experience of their fury. Some of them have ſeemed even mad with anger, ſo as to run on deſperately upon their own ruine, when the hand of God hath been apparently againſt them, when the Lord hath blaſted their counſels, croſſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded their plots, broken their ſtrength, leaving them no ſuch grounds of hope as might encourage rationall men, yet on they would, and why? they <hi>were angry,</hi> and their anger and rage car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them headlong. But I beleeve Chriſt will anger them yet more, whileſt He goeth on conquering, and to conquer.</p>
            <p>Again the Elders proceed in their doxology, <hi>And thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they ſhould be judged;</hi> the time when Chriſt ſhould judge, and avenge the cauſe of His ſervants that have been ſlain, by executing vengeance on their bloodie enemies: <hi>And that thou ſhouldſt give reward to thy ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to thy Saints, and to them that fear thy Name, ſmall and great, and ſhouldſt deſtroy them that deſtroy the earth:</hi> Chriſt ſhall raiſe the ſpirits, and encourage the hearts of his deſpiſed Miniſters and people, and deſtroy their deſtroyers. This hath been done in part, and ſhall be more fully accompliſhed. <hi>And the Temple of God was opened in heaven:</hi> the glory of Chriſts Church ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more viſible, and it ſhall have a free and open paſſage, many which were without, entring into it: <hi>And there was ſeen <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his Temple the Ark of his Teſtament:</hi> the ſecrets of his kingdom ſhall be manifeſted, the Ark it ſelf that was hidden from the multitude within the veil, ſhall be diſcovered. <hi>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thundrings, and great hail:</hi> dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon thoſe who will not ſee and ſubmit to the mighty power of Chriſt: <hi>And an earthquake,</hi> dreadfull concuſſions, great

changes and alterations in the kingdoms of the world. The hearts of God his people ſhould now be filled with expectation of the glorious acts of Chriſt, in aſmuch as the time is come that He hath taken to Himſelf His great power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Chriſt moſt certainly <hi>will ſubdue all things to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> it is our wiſdome willingly to ſtoop unto Him. Let us aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelves, Chriſt will not part with his royalties in the leaſt degree. He will maintain to the uttermoſt his ſupremacy, and ſoveraign authority. We muſt bow or break: one way or other we ſhall undoubtedly be brought under, either we muſt will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly yeeld to the golden Scepter of his love, or we ſhalbe cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the iron rod of his wrath. <hi>Joſeph</hi> (I conceive) was a type of Chriſt both in his abaſement and exaltation: when he was made ruler over the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>they cryed or proclaimed before him; Bow the knee: let all people throughout the Knigdom ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
               <note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>to his authority.</hi> So when Chriſt for his Fathers glory and mans ſalvation, had greatly humbled Himſelf, even to the death of the Croſſe, <hi>God highly exalted Him, and gave him a Name above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Name, that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth.</hi> He proclaimed before Him throughout heaven, earth and hell, <hi>Bow the knee:</hi> All, men, angels, devils and other creatures ſhall be ſubjected to Him. A neceſſity lyeth upon us, and woe unto us if we do not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit. For this end take theſe three conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. The glorious and magnificent titles attributed to Chriſt in<note place="margin">1. 1 Tim. 6. 15.</note> Scripture. <hi>The Bleſſed and Onely Potentate,</hi> earthly Potentates have but a ſhaddow of power in compariſon of Him, though all due honour and ſubjection muſt be given them by thoſe under their Government. But in reſpect of Chriſt their power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is no more than the light of the Starrs in the preſence of the Sun. <hi>He is Lord of Lords:</hi> other Lords are but his vaſſels, <hi>King of Kings,</hi> other Kings are but his Subjects: ſo they are <hi>de jure,</hi> ſo they ought to be: and they ſhall <hi>de facto,</hi> actually at one time or other, one way or other, be brought under. Yea He hath this Name written upon his thigh, and upon his veſture, <hi>King of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 19. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> The Name which He weareth on His lower parts, upon the skirt of his robe, proclaimeth Him <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> If we poore worms are ſo apt to tremble at the name of an earthly King or Ruler, Oh let all the

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113857:9"/>
powers of our ſouls proſtrate themſelves, and lie lowe before the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider what a bleſſed condition they are in, who<note place="margin">2</note> in ſincerity have ſubjected themſelves unto him. 1. In regard<note place="margin">1</note> of His ſingular love toward them. He is infinitely above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the moſt gracious Maſter toward thoſe whoſe ſpirits are ſubdued to His government. Saith the Spouſe, <hi>His banner over</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>me was love.</hi> What an encouragement is it to Souldiers to have the love of their Generall! Thrice happy ſouls that have Chriſt for their Commander, and are led, governed and conducted by Him as their King and Captain of their ſalvation: His very banner over them is love: all His Commands are commands of love: all the ſervice He requireth of them, is impoſed in love: He never enjoyneth them any thing but what is for their good: they are never loſers by obeying his pleaſure: all their loſſes come by their diſobedience. He never putteth them upon any ſuffering, but it is done in love. He chaſteneth us for our good,<note place="margin">Heb 12. 10.</note> that we might be partakers of His holineſſe. If He leadeth them into the field, and letteth them meet with any ſharp encounters,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> He maketh them more than conquerours. The Apoſtle having (as it were) ſearched Satans muſter-rolls, and taken a view of his ſeverall brigades, tribulation, diſtreſſe, perſecution, famine, nakedneſſe, perill, ſword (enemies of a terrible aſpect to the eye of fleſh, as the grim viſages of <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> his Germans were to <hi>Ceſars</hi> Souldiers) he ſlighteth them all, in all theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we do more than conquer, through him that loved us: it may ſeem more proper to have ſaid, through the Almighty power of Chriſt our Captain: But he chuſeth the ſweet attribute of love, ſhewing that it is a ſpeciall act of his love that he leadeth on his followers to ſuch conflicts, intending to make them happy gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, more than conquerours. I beleeve ſo many would turn Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that we ſhould want hands for other imployments, if they could be aſſured of two things. Firſt, to be entirely beloved of their Commander, as his own right arm. Secondly, that they ſhould return with ſafety and victory. This is the happineſſe of all the ſervants and ſouldiers of Chriſt: He loveth them tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the members of his own body, as the apple of his own eye. He will bring them off more than conquerours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He delivereth all his faithfull ſervants from all

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113857:10"/>
thoſe cruell task-maſters to which they were enſlaved. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you:</hi> for ye are under grace. Oh what an<note place="margin">Rom 6. 14.</note> happineſſe is it to be freed from ſo many tyrannicall monſters, to have the ſtrength of pride, covetouſneſſe, luſt, ſenſuality bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken! This ſhould wonderfully provoke us fully to yeeld up our ſpirits in ſubjection to Chriſt. Bleſſed is the Soul that maketh ſuch a change, that is freed from the ſlavery of ſin and Satan, carrying it on to deſtruction, and is now governed and led by Chriſt in the way of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He pitieth them in regard of the infirmities accompanying<note place="margin">3.</note> them in his ſervices, for which themſelves mourn, againſt which they ſtrive: and graciouſly ſpareth them as a Father ſpareth his ſon that ſerveth him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, He helpeth their infirmities, cometh in upon them by<note place="margin">4.</note> his Spirit; when the work is too heavy for them, is a co-worker with them, eaſeth their yoke, and delighteth to manifeſt his power in their weakneſſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The happineſſe of his ſubjects and ſervants appeareth in<note place="margin">5. Pſal. 58. 11. Prov. 11. 18.</note> their reward, that is, 1. Sure. 2. Incomparable. 1. Sure. <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous. The wicked worketh a deceitfull work:</hi> that is, a ſelf-deceiving work, as the oppoſite member ſheweth: he that hath to do with ſin, dealeth with a cheater, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth gain, pleaſure, ſatisfaction; but meerly deceiveth him, payeth him with ſhame, ſorrow, miſerie: but to him that loveth righteouſneſſe ſhall be a ſure reward: righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe is ſuch a kinde of ſeed as never miſcarrieth; he that ſoweth it is ſure of a good harveſt: it is a ſeed taken out of the granary of heaven: it will grow and proſper in any ground. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me:</hi> His reward is ready. Thoſe that ſerve Princes or States moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, muſt wait long for their reward many times, though they whom they ſerve be very deſirous to ſatisfie them, becauſe their reward is not alwayes with them, not alwayes ready. <hi>I have</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.</note> 
               <hi>fought a good fight</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. his Crown was ready for him before he was ready to wear it; it was laid up and kept in ſtore for him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the reward is incomparable, 1. In the ſervice. 2. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the ſervice: <hi>In ſcelere ſceleris ſupplicium: ſceleri paena coaetanea.</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113857:10"/>
Sin carrieth vengeance in it own bowels: ſin and puniſhment are contemporary: fin it ſelf is a miſery; holineſſe it ſelf is a reward. <hi>Now being made free from ſin, and become the ſervants of God, ye have</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22.</note> 
               <hi>your fruit unto holineſſe, and the end everlaſting life.</hi> This is a certain truth (and the people of God find it by experience) that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reward that goeth along with the work of Chriſt, the ſweet refreſhings which Chriſtians meet with in the way of holineſſe, are far above all the pleaſures of ſin, and the beſt things which the world can beſtow upon it lovers. That ſweet peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thoſe taſtes of heaven, thoſe glimpſes of glory, thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of eternall life are far above all earthly comforts.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, the reward that is prepared for them after their work is done, is more than they are able to deſire or conceive.<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 19, 20.</note> Saith <hi>Moſes, I beſeech thee, ſhew me thy glory.</hi> The Lord telleth him, <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face: for there ſhall no man ſee me and live:</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Moſes,</hi> thou askeſt thou knoweſt not what: the weight of glory which would reſult from my face is more than thou art able to ſtand under in this mortall condition. That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of glory which Chriſt hath provided for his people is ſo great, ſo incomparable, that they are not capable of it, untill they be transformed into the likeneſſe of Chriſt: it is more happineſſe than their hearts can hold in that eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in now they are. Oh that the Lord would give us hearts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve theſe things really, as they are moſt ſure and reall truths! Doth not many a man think, if I could get into ſuch a mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I were a man made. This is onely true of the ſervice of Chriſt: thou art more happy if thou haſt him for thy Maſter, than if thou hadſt all the men on earth for thy ſervants. His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is a greater preferment than the richeſt Crown under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. If our hearts were not wretchedly muddy, earthly, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, how could we ſleep quietly untill we were entertained by Chriſt in his ſervice!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider the miſery of thoſe that do not yeeld ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection<note place="margin">3.</note> to Him. No enemie ſo dreadfull as Chriſt to them that ſtand out againſt Him. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger?</hi> Little<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 11. Luk. 19. 27.</note> do poore ſouls know the weight of his Almighty arm. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies, which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me,</hi> let me ſee them executed. Kings, Rulers, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſpire in rebellion againſt the Lord, and againſt His Chriſt:

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113857:11"/>
               <hi>Let us break their hands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> Alas poore worms: <hi>He that ſitteth in the heavens ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion. Then ſhall he ſpeak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</hi> That wrath which ſpringeth out of the earth, which men of the world can ſhew, ſeemeth ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: but who is able to endure that wrath which is powred<note place="margin">V. 9. 10.</note> down from Him that ſitteth in heaven? Thou ſhalt <hi>break them with a rod of iron,</hi> thou ſhalt <hi>daſh them in peices like a potters veſſell.</hi> Then followeth the Uſe that now we are upon: <hi>Be wiſe now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O ye Kings, be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth.</hi> It is the wiſdom of Kings and Rulers, yea, and of all degrees of people, to ſtoop to Him who can, and moſt certainly will, ſubdue all to Himſelf. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed but a little.</hi> A little of His wrath is more dreadfull than all the rage of man. Let us beg this wiſdom from above, that we may be taught of God, in all humility to yeeld and ſubmit to Chriſt. If a people riſing up in rebellion againſt the Authority of the State could be fully aſſured of two things: firſt, that if upon ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they lay down their Arms and ſubmit, they ſhall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be pardoned, but much advantaged in their eſtates: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that if they remain obſtinate, it will be the ruine of themſelves, their families, and poſterities, were it not meer mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſhew themſelves wilfull? We are all from our birth ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and rebels againſt Chriſt. The ſilver trumpet of the Goſpel proclaimeth pardon, mercy, adoption, ſalvation, the promiſes of this life and that which is to come, to thoſe that have been deepeſt in this rebellion, if they come in. On the contrary it is moſt certain, all that ſtand out againſt Chriſt in their naturall eſtate and impenitency, ſhall be ſubdued to their everlaſting ruine and deſtruction: <hi>For He muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, how carefull ſhould we be throughly to examine<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> our ſelves whether we be truly ſubjected to Chriſt, or not? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther His grace have bowed us that ſo we may be ſure his power ſhall not break us; whether we are over-powred by his love, that ſo we may not be overwhelmed with his wrath? Beloved, this is one of the principall enquiries which we are to make throughout our whole lives. We are fallen upon times which

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113857:11"/>
are full of queſtions and controverſies. I beleeve there have not been many ages ſince Chriſts aſcenſion, wherein more <hi>queries</hi> have been ſtirring, more doubts and diſputes agitated, than in theſe dayes. Now I ſuppoſe a man of ordinary obſervation, may take notice of two ſorts of people among us: <hi>Galli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> meer ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that look on and care for none of theſe things, who mind the things of the world: the main queſtion that ſeemeth to ſtick with them, is how they may compaſſe their worldly ends, or how they may ſatisfie their luſts, and make proviſion for the fleſh: theſe as they trouble not themſelves to finde out the truth of things in controverſie, ſo they are ſecurely negligent about this great enquiry, whether they are ſubjected unto Chriſt or not? Others are very buſie in various diſputs about things pertaining to religion, ſome of whom (I feare) take little or no care to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in this great buſines, whether their ſpirits are effectually ſubdued to the Government of Chriſt. I beſeech you let us, in the fear of God, ſet our ſelves to ſtudy this point. If once we can by good evidence of Scripture rightly infer this concluſion, that our ſouls are brought into a willing ſubjection to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we are loyall Subjects to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we may aſſure our ſelves that The Spirit of Chriſt will lead us by the light of His word into all neceſſary truth. And though we be not able to anſwer every cavill, and frivolous objection made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome particular truth, yet if we can confute thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bent againſt the ſaving work of Chriſt upon our ſouls, in reducing us under the Scepter of His Goſpel, we ſhall find more ſolid comfort and ſweet ſatisfaction, then thoſe that toſſe the word of God in reſtleſſe and doubtfull diſputes; and ſhall be ſure to have ſo much knowledge as may ſerve to light us the way to heaven. 1 Then are our minds, underſtandings and judgments,<note place="margin">1.</note> ſubdued to the wiſdom of Chriſt, revealed in His word? In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this head, let us put our ſelves to theſe three interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. 1. Do we verily account all that wiſdom to be meer foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes, which lifteth up it ſelf againſt any truth of Chriſt? Do we ſincerely deſire and endeavour, to have every thought within us captivated under the power of His truth? Doe we abhorre it as no leſſe than a degree of rebellion againſt Chriſt, when we find any imaginations, any carnall reaſonings in our minds croſſing the Goſpel of Chriſt in any part? For inſtance: it is one

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113857:12"/>
of the great truths of Chriſt which the Apoſtle hath taught us by the Spirit of Chriſt: <hi>Godlines is profitable unto all things, having</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> And firſt he confirmeth it as a moſt certaine truth, <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying.</hi> Secondly, he valueth it as a moſt precious truth, <hi>and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> Thirdly, he juſtifieth it as an approved, experimented truth. <hi>For therefore we both labour and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve.</hi> Beloved, if every one here preſent were examined upon this interrogatory, and conſcience were to make the anſwer, how few would be able to approve themſelves in the ſight of God, as true and loyall ſubjects unto Chriſt? Do not many of you entertain ſuch thoughts as theſe in your hearts? If I ſhould obſerve the Lord His day according to the ſtrict rule of godlines, if in the courſe of my life I ſhall make godlineſſe my rule in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming duties in ſecret, in my family, in publick, in buying, ſelling, in all the buſineſſe of my calling, in converſing with others, if I ſhould regulate all my votes in Parliament according to the principles of godlineſſe, I might loſe my friends, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, many advantages for my eſtate, much prejudice if not ruin my ſelf and my poſterity? What anſwer the tongue would give I know not; but I am perſwaded many an ones conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in would plead guilty. This argueth non-ſubjection to the Scepter of Chriſt, and rebellion againſt His Soveraignty. Saith Chriſt, <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 14.</note> 
               <hi>thirſt; but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of living water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> Here is a point of divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uttered by the mouth of Chriſt Himſelf: Are not many that read and hear this ſo far from ſubjecting their reaſon to it, that they are ready to ſcorn or ſlight it? Let them have wine and ſtrong drink, their pleaſures, let their ciſterns be filled with worldly abundance, and they do not much trouble themſelves about this living water: they can live without it. Their minds are not ſubdued to the wiſdom of Chriſt. But he that looketh upon Chriſt as a fountain of living water, beleeving verily that if once he hath him dwelling in him, he ſhall never be exhauſted and drawn dry, but that this ſpring of grace and ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſhall ſtream forth into the ocean and full ſea of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory. He whoſe thirſty ſoul cannot be ſatisfied without

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113857:12"/>
the ſaving graces and comforts of Chriſts Spirit, fully ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to this wiſdom of Chriſt, and renouncing ſence and reaſon which ſeemeth to contradict it: he may ſay, I am a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Chriſts Scepter, the Lord Jeſus is my Chriſt and King. Again ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate, for wide is the gate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth 7. 13, 14</note> 
               <hi>and bread is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Strive to enter in at the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 13, 24.</note> 
               <hi>ſtrait gate: for many I ſay unto you will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> Are your minds ſubjected to the wiſdom of Chriſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe truths? Are ye verily perſwaded that the gate is ſtrait, and the way narrow, that it requireth much ſtriving and contending to enter, that a cold, ſluggiſh, common, formall way of ſeeking will never give you entrance? If not, if you pleaſe your ſelves in your own conceits and vain imaginations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the wiſdom of Chriſt, that it is an eaſie thing to go to heaven, ye hope to be ſaved as well as the beſt, though ye hold on in an eaſie broad way, ſliding down the hill, carried with the ſtreame of the world, the tide of your luſts, the wind of Satans ſuggeſtions, and applauſe of the multitude, aſſure your ſelves ye are rebels againſt Chriſt: ye oppoſe your carnall conceits, and exalt your blind reaſon againſt His heavenly wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if your underſtandings be ſubdued to the wiſdom of Chriſt, then ye will yeeld to particular truths of Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding former engagements to the contrary. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve his loyalty to that Prince or State to whom he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Allegeance, unleſſe he renounce contrary engagements to a forreign Prince, If by education, miſtake, weakneſſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeducements of others, thou haſt been engaged in defence of any errour, and becauſe of ſuch prejudice will ſtiffely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it againſt the contrary truth of Chriſt, what is this but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the wiſdom of Chriſt. But that is a ſweet, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, loyall ſpirit, that is freely ready to quit all engagements for receiving of any truth of Chriſt, and is content that all his own notions ſhould fall to the ground, that the wiſdom and truth of Chriſt might be exalted and maintained in it juſt and full authority.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when thy mind and judgement ſtoopeth to the truth of Chriſt held forth by ſuch Inſtruments as the proud world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth,

ſo ſoon as ever thou ſeeſt the Kings ſtamp upon it, that is ſo ſoon as thou findſt Chriſt His authority for it: not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by whom it is preſented to thee, but looking up to Him who ſitteth at the right hand of God, humbly ſubjecteſt thy ſelf to his wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if a man be brought into ſubjection unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">2.</note> then is his will ſubdued to and by the Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>Barnabas</hi> being ſent from the Church of Jeruſalem to confirm the new converts of Antioch, <hi>When he came and had ſeen the grace of God, was</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>3</note> 
               <hi>glad, and exhorted them all that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Brethren, I rejoyce to ſee theſe happy beginnings, to ſee the kingdom of Chriſt thus enlarged, and withall let me exhort you, that ye yeeld up your wils ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſteadfaſtly unto Him; cleaving to Him with purpoſe of heart. This ſhall be a ſweet evidence to your ſouls, that ye are indeed ſubjected to Him. That is a reall ſubjection of a loyall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted people to Chriſt, when they are reſolvedly His; not when they have ſome ſlight inclinations toward him, but when the purpoſe of their heart is fixed upon Him, and they are ſteadfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved that Chriſt ſhall give law to them. It is grievous to a loyall ſubject of Chriſt to have any thing remaining in his will that ſavoureth of rebellion againſt Chriſt, any renitency, any unwillingneſſe and indiſpoſedneſſe to the work of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when a man is ſubjected unto Chriſt, his affections<note place="margin">3.</note> are ſubdued to Him. He obeyeth Chriſt, and he obeyeth Him in love; he ſhunneth ſin, and he loveth to avoid it. He doth the will of Chriſt with a deſire exceeding his performance and ability. A carnall perſon not ſubjected to Chriſt, his performances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his affections, he doth many outward ſervices to which he hath no heart. Again, the loyall ſubject delighteth in his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. He would not for a world be free from this yoke. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe rebels ſaid, <hi>Let us break their bonds aſunder, and caſt away</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> 
               <hi>their cords from us:</hi> he ſaith from the bottome of his heart, Bleſſed be God that ever He brought me under the government of his Son, that inſtead of a ſlave of Satan, He hath made me a ſubject to the King of glory. As it is ſaid of one of our Engliſh Martyrs, that he kiſſed the ſtake, ſaying, <hi>Welcome the croſſe of Chriſt, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come everlaſting life.</hi> So ſaith he whoſe heart is ſubjected to the Lord Jeſus, welcome the ſweet yoke of Chriſt, the very entrance

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113857:13"/>
into everlaſting life. <hi>I rejoyce in the Law of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> to do thy will O my God: yea <hi>thy law is within my heart,</hi> or<note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 8.</note> in the midſt of my bowels, ſaith <hi>David.</hi> He profeſſeth it was his delight to do the will of God, and giveth two reaſons: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer imployed in thoſe words [<hi>O my God</hi>] thou haſt given me thy ſelf for my gracious God and portion, and therefore it is my delight to give up my ſelf to thee in obedience. The ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in theſe, <hi>Thy Law is within my heart.</hi> When the Law of God is once lodged within a man, written in his heart, fixed in his bowels, then is he a loyall ſubject of Chriſt, and goeth on in the way of holineſſe with rejoycing. he delighteth in godly ſorrow for his diſloyalties: and wheras others ſtrive to forget and ſhake off the fear of God, he rejoyceth to find his heart over-awed by Chriſt: It is delightfull to him to curb his luſts, to controll his own will: It is the joy of his heart to ſee theſe enemies of Chriſt within his own ſoul, lye ſlain before Him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He that is a true ſubject of Chriſt, rejoyceth to ſee<note place="margin">4.</note> the kingdom of Chriſt enlarged, his cauſe proſper, his implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemies brought under; but eſpecially to ſee rebels ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, as to become loyall and obedient ſubjects. What ſpectacle ſo glorious in his eye as to ſee Chriſt victorious, to behold the Captain of his ſalvation on a day of triumph? Thoſe that are otherwiſe affected, ſhew of what ſpirit they are, whatever they pretend: <hi>I heard a voice from heaven, come out of her my people, that ye</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities. Reward her even as ſhe hath rewarded you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and double unto her double according to her works.</hi> If this be a voice from heaven, what ſhall we think of the clamour of thoſe that contradict it? is not that a voice from hell? It followeth in that place, how the enemies of Chriſt mourned at the funerall of the whore of Babylon, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of late ſeemed to be vexed at the fall and weakning of them that fought for the whore. But what ſaith the holy Ghoſt? <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> 
               <hi>over her, thou heaven,</hi> [thou Church of Chriſt] <hi>and ye holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets: for God hath avenged you on her. And after theſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 19. 1. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>things, I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, ſaying, Alleluia: ſalvation, and glory, and honour, and power unto the Lord our God. For true and righteous are his judgements, for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:113857:14"/>
               <hi>blood of His ſervants at her hand.</hi> They that belong to the kingdom of Chriſt rejoyce and give thanks in this caſe: who are they that lament but thoſe that belong to the prince of darkneſſe?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This ſhould ſtir up all who are loyall-hearted ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note> of Chriſt, to labour more fully to ſubject themſelves unto him. And firſt endeavour to take deeper rooting in Chriſt by<note place="margin">1</note> faith, that ye may partake more of the power and Spirit of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for He according to his working is able to ſubdue all things to Himſelf. The more ye have of Chriſt, the more ſhall your ſpirits be ſubjected unto Chriſt. Dilate your hearts by faith in ſweet and free meditations on the promiſes, that ye may let in more of Chriſt into your ſouls. His entrance into the ſoul is the ruine of Satans ſtrong holds: when He is exalted in the heart, luſt will ſink, corruption will be weakned. Meditations on the Law, and on the wrath of God may be of great uſe to prepare the way of Chriſt: but it is the preſence and power of Chriſt poſſeſſing the heart, which doth the work. <hi>For this purpoſe the Son</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>of God was manifeſted, that He might deſtroy the works of the devil:</hi> that is ſpoken of his manifeſtation to the world in generall. It hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth true in this caſe, the more Chriſt is manifeſted to any belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in particular, the more are the works of the devil deſtroyed in him, and the more is that ſoul ſubjected unto Chriſt. The cauſe why Satans bulwarks are not more fully demoliſhed, and our ſpirits ſo little ſubdued unto Chriſt, is, becauſe we have but obſcure diſcoveries of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour to be more and more humble, and ſencible<note place="margin">2</note> of your own vileneſſe. Self-abaſing is the lifting up of Chriſt. The ſpirit that ſtoopeth loweſt is beſt prepared to become a throne for Chriſt. <hi>For thus ſaith the High and lofty one that inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>eternity, whoſe Name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit.</hi> This may ſeem ſtrange that the higheſt place in heaven, and the loweſt hearts on earth ſhould be the fitteſt thrones for Chriſt. And why? the heart that is loweſt in humility, is higheſt in excellency in his eſteeme: the ſpirit that is lifted up to the greateſt height of pride, is loweſt for vileneſſe and baſenes in his account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God reſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teth the proud, becauſe they lift up themſelves againſt His royall Majeſty, and giveth grace to the humble, becauſe they yeeld him ſubjection. Humility maketh way for more grace, and ſo for more full ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113857:14"/>
unto Chriſt. They that delight to lie at the footſtool of Chriſt in humility, ſhall ſee Chriſt ſitting in the throne of their hearts, &amp; ſhall be exalted to ſit with Chriſt in his throne of glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Keep a continuall watch. A Commander who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">3</note> many of his Souldiers to be ill affected to the cauſe wherein he is engaged, and ready to raiſe a mutiny, or that hath many ſturdy priſoners in his Camp that wait an opportunity to act miſchief, had need ſet a ſtrong guard upon them, and keep a watchfull eye over them. So a Chriſtian finding many treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous luſts in his heart, ready upon occaſion to break into actuall rebellion againſt Chriſt, had need be very watchfull: if he be ſlumbering, they will ſoon be acting miſchief. Watch therfore, and if they begin to ſtir, execute martiall Law upon them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Let them dye without mercy, that thy ſoul may live, and Chriſt may reign.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Keep peace with God: and let the peace of God rule<note place="margin">4</note> in thine heart, that ſo thy ſoul may reſt in a ſweet ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of Chriſt the Prince of peace; whileſt the hearts of others are hurried up and down with divers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary luſts, being like the raging ſea, caſting up mire and dirt.</p>
            <p>As the point is of univerſal concernment to all degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo I have carried it on in the Application. I yet deſire liberty for one word to this Honourable Audience, whom it eſpecially concerneth.</p>
            <p>Much honoured in the Lord, I beſeech You take home to your ſelves what hath been ſpoken to you and others in the Name of Chriſt, &amp; labour to make it your own. This is that which would make your memories precious to poſterity, and cauſe future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to call you bleſſed; yea this will enable you to give up your laſt account with joy, if firſt your own ſpirits ſhall be truly ſubdued to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and then if your Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry counſels and proceedings ſhal be ſuch as ſavour of the loyalty of your hearts toward this King of Saints. The Apoſtle ſeemeth<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 12, 13.</note> to have been wonderfully affected with a work of mercy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by private Chriſtians, in relieving the neceſſities of their poore Brethren. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the adminiſtration of this ſervice not onely ſupplyeth the want of the Saints, but is abundant alſo by many thanksgivings unto God: whileſt by the experiment of this miniſtration, they glorifie God for your profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> How much more ſhall the right adminiſtration of this publick Service

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113857:15"/>
wherein ye are engaged, and the faithful diſcharge of this great truſt committed to You, not only ſupply the wants, and make up the breaches of Church and State; but alſo be abundant by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thankſgivings unto God, enlarging the hearts, and opening the mouthes of thouſands of the godly, whileſt by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this publick miniſtration they glorifie God for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt. And if the Apoſtle in that caſe did break out ſo affectionately, how much more ſhall the faithfull have cauſe to lift up the praiſes of their God, and<note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> to ſay: <hi>Thanks be unto God for his unſpeakable gift:</hi> Bleſſed be God for a Parliament that ſubjected themſelves, and all their power and authority to Him whom God hath ſet at His own right hand, far above principalities and powers, and every name that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not onely in this world, but alſo in the world to come; for a Parliament, who in all their legiſlative Acts hold reſpect to their ſubordination to that ſupream Law-giver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy, who were tender of the glory of the Lord Jeſus, of the purity of his truth and worſhip, and would not for a world infringe any of His royal prerogatives. Ye have mighty engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereunto: And therefore for concluſion let me ſet before<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 47, 48</note> you <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, and his example. <hi>It is God that avengeth me, and ſubdueth the people under me.</hi> Hath not God avenged you, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſubdued the people under you, far beyond the hopes of thoſe that were moſt confident among you? <hi>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea thou haſt lifted me up above thoſe that riſe up againſt me; thou haſt delivered me from the violent man.</hi> Cannot ye ſay after him <hi>verbatim,</hi> and apply all to your ſelves, word for word? What cauſe have you to conclude with him, <hi>Therefore will</hi>

               <hi>I give thanks unto the Lord among the heathen; and will ſing praiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Name.</hi> Labour in thankfulneſſe to make the Name of the Lord glorious among the heathen; heatheniſh Chriſtians that are ſtrangers to him in divers parts of the Land, by propagating the Goſpel, and giving neceſſary encouragement to thoſe that publiſh it. And remember that Chriſts higheſt end in al his works (and therefore certainly in ſuch admirable works) is Himſelf: not the greatn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
