            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Author <hi>of this Book is ſufficiently known, and ſo is the Book it ſelf, both at Home and Abroad, to the Curious and Inquiſitive; but never having been rendred into</hi> Engliſh, <hi>many, whoſe Veneration for the</hi> Author <hi>would induce them to read any thing of his, and who could not máſter it in the Language in which he wrote it, were deprived of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of peruſing it, and of the Information they might juſtly expect from it. To gratifie them it is, that this Tranſlation, long ſince made, is now publiſhed; for the perſon who took the pains to Tranſlate it, did it partly for his own private entertainment, and partly to gratifie one or two of his Friends, without any deſign of mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>As</hi> Firſt, <hi>That the Author does with a great Freedom of Language, and Strength of Reaſon, detect the Fallacy of all the Cobweb Arguments made uſe of by the Flatterers of Princes, to prove their Power to be derived immediately from God, and to be ſuperior to that of the Law, whether deduced from Scripture, Reaſon, or Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That whereas ſome things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that contain Perſonal Reflections upon the late King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt, and pains taken to juſtifie all the Proceedings of the Parliament from firſt to laſt, which may ſound harſh in ſome of our ears; the Reader ought to conſider the time when theſe things were written, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the</hi> Author'<hi>s Undertaking this Defence, which were ſuch as put him under a neceſſity of Vindicating whatever his Maſters had done. The Tranſlator has not gelt him, nor was the Publiſher willing to do it; eſpecially ſince the Book has for many years been ſo publick, tho in another Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And the great Uſe which it yields for the moſt part, ought not to be loſt, becauſe ſome things are here and there interſperſed, which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

his Readers to have read</hi> Salmaſius; <hi>to ſome or other of whoſe Authorities and Reaſons, ſuch Paſſages relate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That where</hi> Salmaſius'<hi>s words are inſerted, they are, for the moſt part, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in</hi> Italick: <hi>Tho the Coherence of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would ſufficiently diſcloſe to one that reads with care, when</hi> Salmaſius <hi>ſpeaks, and when the</hi> Author.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>That if the</hi> Author <hi>may ſeem to lay aſide even rules of Decency in treating his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, whom indeed he ridicules and expoſes with a great deal of Smartneſs, Freedom, and Contempt, it muſt be conſidered, That the</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>wrote on the behalf, and in Defence of the Powers then in being, and in anſwer to a priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sixthly, <hi>That the Tranſlator has kept perhaps too cloſe to his Copy, and not taken that liberty which is allowed to a Tranſlation, eſpecially in

the angry and peeviſh parts of it: But it's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Faithfulneſs of the Tranſlation may in ſome meaſure recompence for that; and it is very well known to thoſe that knew him, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could, nor did pretend to laſh ſo well in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, <hi>as the</hi> Author <hi>could in</hi> Latin.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S Preface.</head>
            <p>ALTHO I fear, leſt, if in defending the People of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhould be as copious in Words, and empty of Matter, as moſt Men think <hi>Salmaſius</hi> has been in his Defence of the King; I might ſeem to deſerve juſtly to be accounted a verboſe and ſilly Defender; yet ſince no Man thinks himſelf obliged to make ſo much haſte, tho in the handling but of any ordinary Subject, as not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſome Introduction at leaſt, according as the weight of his Subject requires; if I take the ſame courſe in handling well-nigh the greateſt Subject that ever was, without being too tedious in it, I am in hopes of attaining two things, which indeed I earneſtly deſire: The one, not to be at all wanting, as far as in me lies, to this moſt Noble Cauſe, and moſt worthy to be recorded to all future Ages. The other, That I ſhall appear to have avoided my ſelf, that fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſneſs of Matter, and redundancy of Words, which I find fault with in my Antagoniſt. For I am about to diſcourſe of Matters, neither inconſiderable nor common, but how a moſt Potent King, after he had trampled upon the Laws of the Nation, and given a ſhock to its Religion, and was ruling at his own Will and Pleaſure, was at laſt ſubdu'd in the
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:96415:5"/>
Field by his own Subjects, who had undergone a long Slavery under him; how afterwards he was caſt into Priſon, and when he gave no ground, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Words or Actions, to hope better things of him, he was finally by the Supreme Council of the Kingdom condemned to dye, and beheaded before the very Gates of the Palace. I ſhall likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, (which will much conduce to the eaſing mens minds of a great Superſtition,) by what Right, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially according to our Law, this Judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all theſe Matters tranſacted; and ſhall eaſily defend my Valiant and Worthy Countrymen, and who have extremely well deſerved of all Subjects and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the World, from the moſt wicked Calumities both of Domeſtick and Foreign Railers, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Reproaches of this moſt vain and empty Sophiſter, who ſets up for a Captain and Ringleader to all the reſt. For what King's Majeſty ſitting upon an Exalted Throne, ever ſhone ſo brightly, as that of the People of <hi>England</hi> then did, when ſhaking off that old Superſtition, which had prevailed a long time, they gave Judgment upon the King himſelf, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon an Enemy, who had been their King, caught as it were in a Net by his own Laws (who alone of all Mortals challenged to himſelf impunity by a Divine Right) and ſcrupled not to inflict the ſame puniſhment upon him himſelf, being guilty, which he would have inflicted upon any other. But why do I mention theſe things as performed by the People? which almoſt open their Voice themſelves, and teſtify the Preſence of God throughout. Who, as often as it ſeems good to his Infinite Wiſdom, uſes to throw down proud and unruly Kings, exalting themſelves above the Condition of Humane Nature, and utterly to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By his manifeſt Impulſe being ſet on work to recover our almoſt loſt Liberty, following him as our Guide, and adoring the impreſſes of his Divine Power mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted upon all occaſions, we went on in no obſcure, but an illuſtrious Paſſage, pointed out, and made plain to us by God himſelf. Which things, if I ſhould ſo much as hope by any diligence or ability of mine, such as it is, to diſcourſe of as I ought to do, and commit them ſo to writing, as perhaps all Nations and all Ages may read them, it would be a very vain thing in me. For what ſtile can be auguſt and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent enough, what man has parts ſufficient to undertake ſo great a Task? ſince we find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in ſo many Ages as are gone over the World, there has been but here and there a man found, who has been able worthily to recount the Actions of Great Heroes, and Potent States; can any man have ſo good an opinion of himſelf, as to think himſelf capable to reach theſe glorious and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works of Almighty God, by any Language, by any ſtile of his? Which Enterprize, though ſome of the moſt Eminent Perſons in our Commonwealth have prevailed upon me by their Authority to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and would have it be my buſineſs to vindicate with my Pen againſt Envy and Calumny (which are proof againſt Arms) thoſe Glorious Performances of theirs (whoſe opinion of me I take as a very great honour, that they ſhould pitch upon me before others to be ſerviceable in this kind to thoſe moſt Valiant Deliverers of my Native-Countrey; and true it is, that from my very youth I have been bent extremely upon ſuch ſort of Studies, as inclin'd me, if not to do great things my ſelf, at leaſt to celebrate thoſe that did) yet as having no confidence in any ſuch Advantages, I have recourſe to the Divine Aſſiſtance; And invoke
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:96415:6"/>
the Great and Holy God, the Giver of all good Gifts, that I may as ſubſtantially, and as truly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs and refute the Sawcineſs and Lies of this Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Declamator, as our Noble Generals piouſly and ſucceſsfully by force of Arms broke the King's Pride, and his unruly Domineering, and afterwards put an end to both by inflicting a memorable Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon himſelf; and as throughly as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon did with caſe but of late confute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the King himſelf, riſing as it were from the Grave, and recommending himſelf to the People in a Book publiſh'd after his death, with new Artiſices and Allurements of Words and Expreſſions. Which Antagoniſt of mine, though he be a Foreigner, and, though he deny it a thouſand times over, but a poor Grammarian; yet not contented with the Salary due to him in that Capacity, choſe to turn a Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Coxcomb; and not only to intrude in State-Affairs, but into the Affairs of a Foreign State: tho he brings along with him neither Modeſty, nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or any other qualification requiſite in ſo great an Arbitrator, but Sawcineſs, and a little Grammar only. Indeed, if he had publiſh'd here, and in Engliſh, the ſame things that he has now wrote in Latin ſuch as it is, I think no man would have thought it worth while to return an Anſwer to them, but would partly deſpiſe them as common, and exploded over and over already, and partly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them as ſordid and Tyrannical Maxims, not to be endured even by the moſt abject of Slaves; Nay, men that have even ſided with the King, would have had theſe thoughts of his Book. But ſince he has ſwol'n it to a conſiderable bulk, and diſpers'd it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Foreigners, who are altogether ignorant of our Affairs and Conſtitution; it's ſit that they who
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:96415:6"/>
miſtake them, ſhould be better informed; and that he, who is ſo very forward to ſpeak ill of others, ſhould be treated in his own kind. If it be asked, why we did not then attack him ſooner, why we ſuffered him to triumph ſo long, and pride himſelf in our ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? For others I am not to anſwer; for my ſelf I can boldly ſay, That I had neither had words nor Arguments long to ſeek, for the defence of ſo good a Cauſe, if I had enjoyed ſuch a meaſure of health, as would have endur'd the fatigue of writing. And being but yet weak in Body, I am forced to write by piece-meal, and break off almoſt every hour, though the Subject be ſuch as requires an unintermitted ſtudy and intenſeneſs of mind. But though this bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition may be a hindrance to me in ſetting forth the juſt Praiſes of my moſt worthy Countreymen, who have been the Saviours of their Native Country, and whoſe Exploits, worthy of Immortality, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready famous all the World over; yet I hope it will be no difficult matter for me to defend them from the Inſolence of this ſilly little Scholar, and from that ſawey Tongue of his at leaſt. Nature and Laws would be in an ill caſe, if Slavery ſhould find what to ſay for it ſelf, and liberty be mute: and if Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants ſhould find men to plead for them, and they that can maſter and vanquiſh Tyrants, ſhould not be able to find Advocates: And it were a deplorable thing indeed, if the Reaſon Mankind is endu'd withal, and which is the gift of God, ſhould not furniſh more Arguments for mens Preſervation, for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and, as much as the nature of the thing will bear, for making them equal to one another, than for their oppreſſion, and for their utter ruine under the Domineering Power of One ſingle Perſon.

Let me therefore enter upon this Noble Cauſe with a chearfulneſs, grounded upon this Aſſurance, That my Adverſary's Cauſe is maintain'd by nothing but Fraud, Fallacy, Ignorance and Barbarity; whereas mine has Light, Truth, Reaſon, the Practice and the Learning of the beſt Ages of the World, of its ſide.</p>
            <p>But now, having ſaid enough for an Introduction, ſince we have to do with Criticks; let us in the firſt place conſider the Title of this Choice Piece: <hi>Defenſio Regia pro Car. Primo, ad Car. Secundum. A Royal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> (or the King's Defence) <hi>for Charles the Firſt to Charles the Second.</hi> You undertake a wonderful piece of work, whoever you are; to plead the Father's Cauſe before his own Son: a hundred to one but you carry it. But I ſummon you, <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſculk'd under a wrong name, and now go by no name at all, to appear before another Tribunal, and before other Judges, where perhaps you may not hear thoſe little Applauſes, which you uſe to be ſo fond of in your School. But why this Royal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence dedicated to the King's own Son? We need not put him to the torture; he confeſſes why. <hi>At the King, charge,</hi> ſays he. O mercenary and chargeable Advocate! could you not afford to write a Defence for <hi>Charles</hi> the Father, whom you pretend to have been the beſt of Kings, to <hi>Charles</hi> the Son, the moſt indigent of all Kings, but it muſt be at the poor King's own Charge? But though you are a Knave, you would not make your ſelf ridiculous, in calling it <hi>the King's Defence;</hi> for you having ſold it, it is no longer yours, but the King's indeed: who bought it at the price of a hundred <hi>Jacobuſſes,</hi> a great Sum for a poor King to disburſe. I know very well what I

ſay; and 'tis well enough known who brought the Gold, and the Purſe wrought with Beads: We know who ſaw you reach out greedy fiſts, under pretence of embracing the King's Chaplain, who brought the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but indeed to embrace the Preſent it ſelf, and by accepting it to exhauſt almoſt all the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.</p>

For what harm is it to you, that are Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners? are any of you hurt by it, if we amongſt our ſelves put our own Enemies, our own Traytors to death, be they Commoners, Noble men, or Kings?

As for others, it's hardly credible, that when they heard the news of our having inflicted a Capital Puniſhment upon the King, there ſhould any be found, eſpecially in a Free State, ſo naturally adapted to Slavory, as either to ſpeak ill of us, or ſo much as to cenſure what we had done: Nay, 'tis highly probable, that all good men applauded us, and gave God thanks for ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, ſo exalted a piece of Juſtice; and for a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo very uſeful to other Princes.

King was born and known in the world,</hi> we ſhall e'en let whine on, till they cry their eyes out. But in the mean time, what School-boy, what little inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Monk could not have made a more elegant Speech for the King, and in better <hi>Latin</hi> than this Royal Advocate has done? But it would be folly in me to make ſuch particular Animadverſions upon his Childiſhneſs and Frenzies throughout his Book, as I do here upon a few in the beginning of it; which yet I would be willing enough to do (for we hear, that he is ſwollen with Pride and Conceit to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degree imaginable) if the ill-put-together and immethodical bulk of his book did not protect him: He was reſolved to take a courſe like the Soldier in <hi>Terence,</hi> to ſave his Bacon; and it was very cunning in him to ſtuff his Book with ſo much Childiſhneſs, and so many ſilly whimſies, that it might nauſeate the smarteſt man in the world to death, to take notice of 'em all. Only I thought it might not be amiſs to give a ſpecimen of him in the Preface; and to let the ſerious Reader have a taſte of him at firſt, that he might gueſs by the firſt diſh that's serv'd up, how noble an Entertainment the reſt are like to make; and that he may imagine within himſelf what an infinite number of Fooleries and Impertinencies, muſt heeds be heaped up together in the body of the Book, when they ſtand ſo thick in the very Entrance into it, where of all other places they ought to have been ſhunned. His tittle-tattle that follows, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons fit for nothing but to be worm eaten, I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily paſs by; as for any thing in them relating to us, we doubt not in the leaſt, but that what has been written and publiſhed by Authority of Parliament,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:96415:10"/>
will have far greater weight with all wiſe and ſober men, than the Calumnies and Lies of one ſingle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent little Fellow; who being hired by our Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, their Countrey's Enemies, has ſcrap'd together, and not ſcrupled to publiſh in Print, whatever little Story any one of them that employed him, put into his head. And that all men may plainly ſee how little conſcience he makes of ſetting down any thing right or wrong, good or bad, I deſire no other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than <hi>Salmaſius</hi> himſelf. In his book, entituled, <hi>Apparatus contra Primatum Papae,</hi> he ſays, <q>There are moſt weighty Reaſons why the Church ought to lay aſide Epiſcopacy, and return to the Apostolical Inſtitution of Presbyters: That a far greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That it would be very much for the good of the Church, if Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were taken away, together with the Papacy: That if Epiſcopacy were once taken down, the Papacy would fall of it ſelf, as being founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>page</hi> 171. He ſays he can ſhow very good reaſons why Epiſcopacy ought to be put down in thoſe Kingdoms that have renounced the Pope's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; but that he can ſee no reaſon for retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it there: That a Reformation is not entire,
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:96415:11"/>
that is defective in this point: That no reaſon can be alledged, no probable cauſe aſſigned, why the Supremacy of the Pope being once diſowned, Epiſcopacy ſhould notwithſtanding be retained,</q>

It's notoriouſly known, That when both Houſes of Parliament, being extremely deſirous to Reform the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the pattern of other Reformed Churches, had reſolved to aboliſh Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, the King firſt interpoſed, and afterwards waged War againſt them chiefly for that very cauſe; which proved fatal to him.

Civil Societies have Laws, and Churches have a Diſcipline, peculiar to themſelves, and far differing from each other. And this has been the occaſion of ſo many Wars in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> to wit, becauſe the Civil Magiſtrate and the Church confounded their Juriſdictions. And therefore we do not admit of the Popiſh Sect, ſo as to tolerate Papiſts at all; for we do not look upon that as a Religion but rather as an Hierarchical Tyranny, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And from hence it was that the name of <hi>Independents</hi> prevailed amongſt the Vulgar. The reſt of your Preface is taken up in endeavouring not only to ſtir up the hatred of all Kings and Monarchs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, but to perſwade them to make a General War upon us. <hi>Mithridates</hi> of old, though in a different cauſe, endeavoured to ſtir up all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> by laying to their charge almoſt juſt the ſame things, that you do to ours: <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> aim'd at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Subverſion of all Kingdoms, that they had no regard to any thing, whether Sacred or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that from their very firſt riſe they never enjoy'd any thing, but what they had acquir'd by force, that they were Robbers, and the greateſt Enemies in the world to Monarchy: Thus <hi>Mithridates</hi> expreſt himſelf in a Letter to <hi>Arſaces</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> But how came you, whoſe buſineſs it it is to make ſilly Speeches from your Desk, to have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to imagine, that by your perſuaſions to take up Arms, and <hi>ſounding an Alarm</hi> as it were, you ſhould be able ſo much as to influence a King amongſt Boys at play; eſpecially, with ſo ſhrill a Voice, and unsavoury Breath, that I believe, if

you were to have been the Trumpeter, not ſo much as <hi>Homer</hi>'s Mice would have waged War againſt the Frogs. So little do we fear, you Slug, you, any War or Danger from Foreign Princes, through your ſilly Rhetorick, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us to them, juſt as if you were at play, <hi>That we toſs Kings heads like Balls; play at Bowls with Crowns; and regard Scepters no more then if they were Fool's Staves with heads on.</hi> But you in the mean time, you ſilly Logerhead, deſerve to have your Bones well-thraſh'd with a Fool's ſtaff, for thinking to ſtir up Kings and Princes to War by ſuch Childiſh Arguments. Then you cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to all Nations, who, I know full well, will never heed what you ſay. You call upon that Wretched and Barbarous Crew of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels too, to aſſert the King's Party. Which one thing is ſufficient evidence how much you are both a Fool, and a Knave, and how you out-do almoſt all Mankind in Villany, Impudence, and Madneſs, who ſcruple not to implore the Loyalty and Aid of an execrable People, devoted to the Slaughter, whom the King himſelf always abhorr'd, or ſo pretended, to have any thing to do with, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the guilt of ſo much innocent Blood, which they had contracted.

You told us in the <hi>12th.</hi> Page of your Preface, that <hi>ſo good and ſo juſt a cauſe ought not to be embeliſht with any flouriſhes of Rhetorick; that the King needed no other defence than by a bare Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of his Story;</hi> and yet in your firſt Chapter, in which you had promiſed us that bare Narrative, you neither tell the Story aright, nor do you abſtain from making uſe of all the skill you have in Rhetorick to ſet it off. So that if we muſt take your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

we muſt believe the King's Cauſe to be neither good nor juſt. But by the way I would adviſe you not to have ſo good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your ſelf (for no body elſe has ſo of you) as to imagin that you are able to ſpeak well upon any ſubject; who can neither play the part of an Orator, nor an Hiſtorian, nor expreſs your ſelf in a ſtile that would not be ridiculous even in a Lawyer; but like a Mountebank's Jugler, with big ſwelling words in your Preface, you rais'd our expectation, as if ſome mighty matter were to enſue; in which your deſign was not ſo much to introduce a true Narrative of the King's Story, as to make your own empty inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded flourished go off the better.

Alas! there's a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt them. Our Fathers begot us. Our King made not us, but we him.

they might lawfully do; for having been a Tyrant, he became an open Enemy, and was taken in War. <hi>Often changing his Keepers.</hi> Leſt they themſelves ſhould change. <hi>Sometimes they gave him hopes of Liberty, nay, and ſometimes even of reſtoring him to his Crown, upon Articles of Agreement.</hi> It ſeems then the taking away his Life, was not done upon ſo much Premeditation, as he talked of before; and that we did not lay hold on all opportunities and means, that offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to renounce our King. Thoſe things that in the beginning of the War we demanded of him, when he had almoſt brought us under, which things if they were denied us, we could enjoy no Liberty, nor live in any Safety; thoſe very things we petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned him for when he was our Priſoner, in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſubmiſſive way, not once, nor twice, but thrice, and oftner, and were as often denied. When we had now loſt all hopes of the King's complying with us, then was that noble Order of Parliament made, That from that time forward, there should no Articles be ſent to the King; ſo that we left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> applying our ſelves to him, not from the time that he began to be a Tyrant, but from the time that we found him incurable. But afterward ſome Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men ſet upon a new Project, and meeting with a convenient opportunity to put it in practice, pass a Vote to ſend further Propoſals once more to the King. Whoſe Wickedneſs and Folly neareſt reſembles that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, who contrary to the Opinion of <hi>M. Tullius,</hi> and all honeſt Men, voted to ſend Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to <hi>M. Anthony;</hi> and the Event had been the ſame, but that it pleaſed God Almighty in his Providence to order it otherwiſe, and to aſſert our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, tho he ſuffer'd them to be enſlav'd. For then the King did not agree to any thing that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96415:20"/>
to a firm Peace, and Settlement of things more than he had before, they go and Vote themſelves ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Then the ſounder part of the Houſe finding themſelves and the Commonwealth betray'd, implore the aid of that Valiant and always Faithful Army to the Commonwealth. Upon which occaſion I can obſerve only this, which yet I am loath to utter; to wit, that our Soldiers underſtood themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our Senators, and that they ſaved the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth by their Arms, when th'other by their Votes had almoſt ruined it. Then he relates a great many things in a doleful, lamentable Strain; but he does it ſo ſenſleſly, that he ſeems rather to beg of his Readers that they would be ſorrowful, than to ſtir up any ſuch Paſſion in them. It grieves him <hi>to think that the King ſhould undergo a Capital Puniſhment after ſuch a manner as no other King ever had done.</hi> Tho he had often told us before, that there never was a King that underwent a Capital Puniſhment at all. Do you uſe to compare ways and manners, ye Coxcomb, when you have no Things, nor Actions to compare with one another? <hi>He ſuffer'd Death,</hi> ſays, he, <hi>as a Rabber, as a Murderer, as a Parricide, as a Traytor, as a Tyrant.</hi> Is this defending the King? Or is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giving a more ſevere Sentence againſt him than that that we gave? How came you ſo all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be of our mind? He complains <hi>that Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Vizars</hi> [perſonati Carnifices] <hi>cut off the King's Head.</hi> What ſhall we do with this Fellow? He told us before, of <hi>a Murder committed on one in the Diſguiſe of a King:</hi> [In Perſonâ Regis.] Now he ſays, 'twas done in the Diſguiſe of an Executioner. Twere to no purpoſe to take particular Notice of every ſilly thing he ſays. He tells Stories of <hi>Boxes on the Ear, and Kicks, that,</hi> he ſays, <hi>were given the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96415:20"/>
King by Common-Soldiers, and that 'twas four Shillings a piece to ſee his dead Body.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which partly are falſe, and partly impertinent, betray the Ignorance and Childiſhneſs of our poor Scholar; but are far from making any Reader ever a whit the ſadder. In good faith, his Son <hi>Charles</hi> had done better to have hired ſome Ballad-ſinger to have bewailed his Fathers misfortunes, than this doleful, ſhall I call him, or rather moſt ridiculous Orator, who is ſo dry and inſipid, that there's not the leaſt Spirit in any thing he ſays. Now the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative's done, and 'tis hard to ſay what he does next, he runs on ſo ſordidly and irregular. Now he's angry, then he wonders; he neither cares what he talks, nor how; repeats the ſame things ten times over, that could not but look ill, tho he had ſaid them but once. And I perſuade my ſelf, the extemporary Rimes of ſome Antick Jack-pudding may deſerve Printing better; ſo far am I from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought he ſays worthy of a ſerious Anſwer. I paſs by his ſtiling the King a <hi>Protector of Religion,</hi> who choſe to make War upon the Church, rather than part with thoſe Church-Tyrants, and Enemies of all Religion, the Biſhops; and how is it poſſible that he ſhould <hi>maintain Religion in its Purity,</hi> that was himſelf a Slave to thoſe impure Traditions, and Ceremonies of theirs? And for our <hi>Sectaries, whoſe Sacrilegious Meetings,</hi> you ſay, <hi>have publick Allowance;</hi> Inſtance in any of their Principles, the Profeſſion of which is not openly allow'd of, and countenanced in <hi>Holland?</hi> But in the mean, there's not a more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Wretch in Nature than your ſelf, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took liberty to ſpeak ill of all ſorts of People. <hi>They could not wound the Commonwealth more dangerouſly than by taking off its Maſter.</hi> Learn, ye abject, home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born

As ſoon as the Biſhops, and thoſe Clergy-men, whom they daily inveighed against, and branded with the odious Names of Pluraliſts and Non-reſidents, were taken out of their way, they preſently Jump, ſome into two, ſome into three of their beſt Benefices; being now warm themſelves, they ſoon unworthily neglected their Charge. Their Coverouſneſs brake through all reſtraints of Modeſty and Religion, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves now labour under the ſame Infamy, that they had loaded their Predeceſſors with; and becauſe their Covetouſneſs is not yet ſatisfied, and their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition has accuſtomed them to raiſe Tumults, and be Enemies to Peace; they can't reſt at quiet yet, but preach up Sedition againſt the Magiſtracy, as it is now eſtabliſhed, as they had formerly done againſt the King. They now tell the people that he was cruelly murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; upon whom themſelves having heap'd all their Curſes, had devoted him to Deſtruction, whom they had delivered up as it were to the Parliament to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96415:21"/>
be diſpoil'd of his Royalty, and purſu'd with a Holy War. They now complain that the Sectarie's are not extirpated; which is a moſt abſurd thing to expect the Magiſtrates ſhould be able to do, who never yet were able, do what they could, to extirpate avarice and ambition, thoſe two moſt pernicious Hereſies, and more deſtructive to the Church than all the reſt, out of the very order and tribe of the Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves. For the Sects which they inveigh againſt, I confeſs there are ſuch amongſt us, but they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and make no noiſe in the world: The Sects that they are of, are publick and notorious, and much more dangerous to the Church of God. <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> and <hi>Diotrephes</hi> were the Ring-leaders of 'em. Yet are we ſo far from perſecuting theſe men, tho' they are peſtilent enough, that for all we know them to be ill affected to the Government, and deſirous of, and endeavouring to work a change, we allow them but too much Liberty. You, that are both a <hi>French-man</hi> and a Va gabond, ſeem diſpleas'd that <hi>the Engliſh, more fierce and cruel than their own Maſtiffs,</hi> as your bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Eloquence has it; <hi>have no regard to the lawful Succeſſor and Heir of the Crown: Take no care of the King's Youngeſt Son, nor of the Queen of</hi> Bohemia.

If whatever a King has a mind to do, the Right of Kings will bear him out in (which was a Leſſon that the bloody Tyrant <hi>Antoninus Caracalla,</hi> though his Step-mother <hi>Julia</hi> preach'd it to him, and endeavour'd to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They may ſafely violate all the Laws of God and Man: their very being Kings keeps them innocent. What Crime was ever any of them guilty of? they did but make uſe of their own Right upon their own Vaſſals. No King can commit ſuch horrible Cruelties and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, as will not be within this Right of Kings. So that there's no Pretence left for any Complaints or Expostulations with any of them. And dare you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, That <hi>this Right of Kings,</hi> as you call it, <hi>is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Law of Nations, or rather upon that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> you Brute Beaſt? for you deſerve not the name of a Man, that are ſo cruel and unjuſt towards all thoſe of your own kind; that endeavour as much as in you lies, so to bear down and villify the whole Race of Mankind, that were made after the Image of God, as to aſſert and maintain that thoſe cruel and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Taskmaſters, that through the ſuperſtitious whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

By which Peſtilent Doctrine of yours, having rendred them more fierce and untractable, you not only enable them to make havock of, and trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot their miſerable ſubjects; but endeavour to arm them for that very purpoſe with the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Right of Kings, and the very Conſtitutions of Government; than which nothing can be more impious or ridiculous. By my conſent, as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> formerly, of a Tyrant became a School-maſter, ſo you of a Grammarian, ſhould become a Tyrant; not that you may have that Regal Licenſe of doing other people harm, but a fair opportunity of periſhing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably your ſelf: That, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> complain'd, when he had confin'd himſelf to the Iſland <hi>Capreae,</hi> you may be reduced into ſuch a condition, as to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that you periſh daily. But let us look a little more narrowly into this right of Kings that you talk of. <hi>This was the ſenſe of the Eaſtern, and of the VVeſtern part of the world.</hi> I ſhall not anſwer you with what <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> who are both as credible Authors as any we have, tell us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the people of <hi>Aſia</hi> eaſily ſubmit to ſlavery, but the <hi>Syrians</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> are even born to it from the womb. I confeſs there are but few, and thoſe men of great wiſdom and courage, that are either deſirous of Liberty, or capable of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. The greateſt, part of the world chuſe to live under Maſters; but yet they would have them juſt ones. As for ſuch as are unjuſt and tyrannical, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was God ever ſo much an enemy to Mankind as to enjoyn a neceſſity of ſubmitting to them; nor was there ever any people ſo deſtitute of all ſenſe, and ſunk into ſuch a depth of deſpair, and to impoſe ſo cruel a Law upon themſelves and their poſterity. Firſt,

you produce <hi>the words of King Solomon in his Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</hi> And we are as willing to appeal to the Scripture as you. As for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s authority, we'l conſider that hereafter, when perhaps we ſhall be better able to underſtand it. Firſt, let us hear God himſelf ſpeak, <hi>Deut. 17. 14. VVhen thou art come into the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, like as the Nations that are round about me.</hi> Which paſſage I could wiſh all men would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider; for hence it appears by the teſtimony of God himſelf: Firſt, that all Nations are at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to erect what form of Government they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, and to change it when, and into what they will. This God affirms in expreſs terms concerning the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation; and it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear but that other Nations are as to this reſpect in the ſame condition. Another remark that this place yields us, is, That a Commonwealth is a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect form of Goverment th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n a Monarchy, and more ſuitable to the condition of Mankind; and in the opinion of God himſelf, better for his own people; for himſelf appointed it; And could hardly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd withal a great while after, and at their own importunate deſire, to let 'em change it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Monarchy. But to make it appear that he gave 'em their choice to be Govern'd by a ſingle perſon, or by more, ſo they were juſtly Govern'd, in caſe they ſhould in time to come reſolve upon a King, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Laws for this King of theirs to obſerve; whereby he was forbidden to multiply to himſelf Horſes and Wives, or to heap up Riches; whence he might eaſily infer, that no power was put into his hands over others, but according to Law, ſince even thoſe actions of his life, which related only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, were under a Law. He was commanded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96415:25"/>
to tranſcribe with his own hand all the Precepts of the Law, and having writ 'em out, to obſerve and keep 'em, that his mind might not be lifted up above his Brethren. 'Tis evident from hence, that as well the Prince as the people was bound by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> To this purpoſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes, a proper and an able Interpreter of the Laws of his own Country, who was admirably well vers'd in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Policy, and infinitely preferable to a thouſand obſcure ignorant Rabbins: He has it thus in the Fourth Book of his <hi>Antiquities:</hi>

An <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy</hi> is the beſt form of Government; wherefore do not you endeavour to ſettle any other; 'tis enough for you that God preſides over ye. But if you will have a King, let him guide himſelf by the Law of God, rather than by his own wiſdom; and lay a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon him, if he offer at more power than the ſtate of your affairs will allow of.</q> Thus he expreſſeth himſelf upon this place in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> Another <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Author, <hi>Philo Judaus,</hi> who was <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> his Contemporary, a very ſtudious man in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon which he wrote a large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary; when in his Book concerning the Creation of the King, he interprets this Chapter of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> he ſets a King looſe from the Law no otherwiſe than as an enemy may be ſaid to be ſo: <q>They, ſays he, that to the prejudice and deſtruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple acquire great power to themſelves, deſerve not the name of Kings, but that of Enemies. For their actions are the ſame with thoſe of an irreconcilable enemy. Nay, they, that under a pretence of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are injurious, are worſe than open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. We may fence our ſelves againſt the latter; but the malice of the former is ſo much the more Peſtilent, becauſe it is not always easie to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</q>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96415:26"/>
But when is is diſcover'd, why ſhould they not be dealt with as enemies? The ſame Author in his ſecond Book, <hi>Allegoriar. Legis,</hi> 
               <q>A King, ſays he, and a Tyrant are Contraries. And a little after, A King ought not only to command, but obey.</q> All this is very true, you'l ſay, a King ought to obſerve the Laws, as well as any other man. But what if he will not? What Law is there to puniſh him? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the ſame Law that there is to puniſh other men; for I find no exceptions; there is no expreſs Law to puniſh the Prieſts or any other inferior Magiſtrates, who all of 'em, if this opinion of the exemption of Kings from the Penalties of the Law would hold, may by the ſame reaſon claim impunity, what guilt ſoever they contract, becauſe there is no poſitive Law for their puniſhment; and yet I ſuppoſe none of them ever challeng'd ſuch a Prerogative; nor would it ever be allow'd 'em, if they ſhould. Hitherto we have learn'd from the very Text of God's own Law, that a King ought to obey the Laws, and not lift himſelf up above his Brethre. Let us now conſider whether <hi>Solomon</hi> preacht up any other Doctrine, <hi>Ch. 8 v. 2.

Here's nothing like Tyranny. Nothing that a good man needs be afraid of. <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power; and who may ſay to him VVhat doſt thou?</hi> And yet we read of one that not only ſaid to a King, <hi>VVhat doſt thou?</hi> but told him, <hi>Thou haſt done fooliſhly.</hi> But <hi>Samuel,</hi> you may ſay, was an Extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

The Preacher therefore in this place prudently adviſeth private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſous not to contend with Princes; for it is even dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to contend with any man that's either rich or powerful: But what then? muſt therefore the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Nation, and all the inferior Magiſtrates, and the whole body of the people not dare to mutter when a King raves and acts like a mad-man?

            <p>Firſt, What is that to us, what ſort of Kings the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſired? eſpecially ſince God was angry with

them, not only for deſiring ſuch a King as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had, and not ſuch a King as his own Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, but barely for deſiring a King? Nor is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that they ſhould deſire an unjuſt King, and one that ſhould be out of the reach of all Laws, who could not bear the Government of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Sons, though under the power of Laws, but from their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs ſought refuge in a King. And laſtly, The Verſe that you quote out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> does not prove that the Kings of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> had an abſolute unlimited Power; for thoſe Bees, that he there ſpeaks of, and who reverence their Kings, he ſays, more than the <hi>Egyptians</hi> or <hi>Medes</hi> do theirs, by the Authority of the ſame Poet,</p>

This fancy you borrow from them, and urge it here with the ſame malice that they did there. Now that very ſame anſwer that you gave them, whilſt you were an honeſt man, now that you are become a Knave, you ſhall give your ſelf, and pull off with your own hand that Vizor you've now put on; <hi>The Bees,</hi> ſay you <hi>are a State, and ſo natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers call them; they have a King, but a harmleſs one, he is a Leader, or Captain, rather than a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And whereas he reckons up five ſeveral ſorts of Monarchies, four of thoſe five he makes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments according to Laws, and with the conſent of the People; and yet he calls them Tyrannical forms of Government, becauſe they lodg ſo much power in one man's hand.

               </gap>). That manner of theirs was Wicked, and Odious, and Tyranical: It was no right, but great wrong. The Fathers have commented upon this place too: I'le inſtance in one, that may ſtand for a great many; and that's <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> a contemporary and intimate Friend of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and in St. <hi>Auguſtin's</hi> opinion, a man of great Wiſdom and Learning.

But according to <hi>Saluſt,</hi> that lawful Power and Authority that Kings were entruſted with, for the Preſervation of the publick Liberty, and the good of the Common-wealth, quickly degenerated into Pride and Tyranny: And this is the ſenſe of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines, and of all Lawyers upon that place of <hi>Samuel:</hi> And you might have learn't from <hi>Sichardus,</hi> that moſt of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> too, were of the ſame mind; at leaſt, not any one of them ever aſſerted that the abſolute inherent right of Kings is there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of.

Now what a piece of folly and impudence is this in you to maintain in oppoſition to all Orthodox Expoſitors, that thoſe very actions which God ſo much condemns, are the right

of Kings? And to pretend Law for them? Though your ſelf confeſs, that that right is very often exercis'd in committing Outrages, being injurious, contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, and the like. Was any man ever to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>ſui juris,</hi> ſo much his own Maſter, as that he might lawfully prey upon mankind, bear down all that ſtood in his way, and turn all things up-ſide down?

               <q>There is none of us igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſays he, of the manner of Kings. Theſe are their Lordly dictates. Mind what I ſay, and do accordingly.</q> Many paſſages to this purpoſe he quotes out of Poets, and calls them not the right, but the cuſtom or the manner of Kings; and he ſays, We ought to read and conſider them, not only for curioſity ſake, but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96415:29"/>
that we may learn to beware of 'em and avoid 'em. You perceive how miſerably you're come off with <hi>Saluſt,</hi> who though he be as much an enemy to Tyranny, as any other Author whatſoever, you thought would have Patroniz'd this Tyrannical right that you are eſtabliſhing. Take my word for't, the right of Kings ſeems to be tottering, and even to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its own ruin, by relying upon ſuch weak props for its ſupport; and by endeavouring to maintain it ſelf by ſuch Examples and Authorities, as would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten its down-fall, if it were further off than it is. <hi>The extremity of right or law,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is the height of injury, Summum jus ſumma injuria; this ſaying is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified moſt properly in Kings, who when they go to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their right, fall into thoſe courſes, in which</hi> Samuel <hi>makes the Right of Kings to conſiſt.</hi> And 'tis a miſerable Right, which when you have ſaid all you can for, you can no otherwiſe defend, than by confeſſing, that it is the greateſt injury that may be. The extremity of Right or Law is ſaid to be, when a man ties himſelf up to Niceties, dwells upon Letters and Syllables, and in the mean time neglects the intent and equity of the Law; or when a written Law is cunningly and maliciouſly interpreted; this <hi>Cicero</hi> makes to have been the riſe of that common ſaying. But ſince 'tis certain that all right flows from the fountain of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo that nothing can poſſibly be any man's right that is not juſt, 'tis a moſt wicked thing in you to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that for a King to be unjuſt, rapacious, tyrannical, and as ill as the worſt of 'em ever were, is according to the right of Kings, and to tell us that a Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would have perſuaded the people to ſuch a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thing. For whether written or unwritten, whether extreme or remiſs, what Right can any Man have to be injurious? Which leſt you ſhould confeſs to be true
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96415:30"/>
of other Men, but not of Kings; I have one Man's Authority to oppoſe you with, who I think was a King himſelf, and profeſſeth that that Right of Kings that you ſpeak of, is odious both to God and himſelf: It is in the 94th Pſalm, <hi>Shall the throne of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have fellowſhip with thee, that frameth miſchief by a law?</hi> Be not therefore ſo injurious to God, as to aſcribe this Doctrine to him, <hi>viz.</hi> that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wicked and flagitious Actions are but the Right of Kings; ſince himſelf tells us, that he abhors all fellowſhip with wicked Princes for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Becauſe under pretence of Soveraignty they create Miſery and Vexation to their Subjects. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring up a falſe Accuſation againſt a Prophet of God; for by making him to teach us in this place what the Right of Kings is, you do not produce the right <hi>Samuel,</hi> but ſuch another empty Shadow, as was raiſed by the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> Tho for my own part, I verily believe that that infernal <hi>Samuel</hi> would not have been ſo great a Lyar, but that he would have confeſs'd, that what you call the Right of Kings, is Tyranny. We read indeed of Impieties countenanced by Law, <hi>Jus datum ſceleri:</hi> you your ſelf confeſs, that they are bad Kings that have made uſe of this boundleſs Licenſe of theirs to do every thing. Now this Right that you have introduc'd for the Deſtruction of Mankind, not proceeding from God, as I have prov'd it does not, muſt needs come from the Devil; and that it does really ſo, will appear more clearly hereafter. <hi>By vertue of this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Princes may if they will.</hi> And for this, you pretend to have <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Authority. I'm always wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mention your Authorities, for it generally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the very Authors you quote them out of, give you an Anſwer themſelves. Hear elſe what <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96415:30"/>
ſays in his 4th <hi>Phillippicke,</hi> 
               <q>What cauſe of War can be more juſt and warrantable than to avoid Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? For tho a People may have the good fortune to live under a Gentle Maſter, yet they are in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Condition, whoſe Prince may Tyrannize over them if he will.</q> May, that is, can; has Power enough ſo to do. If he meant it of his Right, he would contradict himſelf, and make that an unjuſt Cauſe of War, which himſelf had affirm'd with the ſame Breath to be a moſt juſt one. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Right of all Kings that you deſcribe, but the Injuriouſneſs, and Force, and Violence of ſome. Then you tell us what private men may do. <hi>A private Man,</hi> ſay you, <hi>may Lie, may be Ungrateful,</hi> and ſo may Kings, but what then? May they therefore Plunder, Murder, Raviſh without controul? 'Tis equally prejudicial and deſtructive to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whether it be their own Prince, or a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or a Foreign Enemy that Spoils, Maſſacres, and Enſlaves them. And queſtionleſs, being both alike Enemies of Humane Society, the one as well as the other may lawfully be oppos'd and puniſh'd; and their own Prince the rather, becauſe he, tho raiſed to that Dignity by the Honours that his People have conferr'd upon him; and being bound by his Oath to defend the Publick Safety, betrays it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all. At laſt you grant, That <hi>Moſes preſcribes Laws, according to which the King that the People of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>ſhould chuſe, ought to Govern, tho different from this Right that</hi> Samuel <hi>propoſeth;</hi> which words contain a double Contradiction to what you have ſaid before. For where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s you had affirm'd, That a King was bound by no Law, here you confeſs he is. And you ſet up two contrary Rights, one deſcribed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and another by <hi>Samuel,</hi> which is abſurd. <hi>But,</hi> ſays
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96415:31"/>
the Prophet, <hi>you ſhall be Servants to your King.</hi> Tho I ſhould grant that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were really ſo, it would not preſently follow, that it was the Right of their Kings to have them ſo; but that by the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Injuſtice of moſt of them, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to that Condition. For the Prophet had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them, that that importunate Petition of theirs would bring a Puniſhment from God upon them; not becauſe it would be their King's Right ſo to harraſs them, but becauſe they themſelves had deſerved it ſhould be ſo. If Kings are out of the reach of the Law, ſo as that they may do what they liſt, they are more abſolute than any Maſters, and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in a more deſpicable Condition than the worſt of Slaves. The Law of God provided ſome Redreſs for them, tho of another Nation, if their Maſters were Cruel and Unreaſonable towards them. And can we imagine that the whole Body of the People of a free Nation, tho oppreſs'd and tyranniz'd over, and prey'd upon, ſhould be left remedileſs? That they had no Law to protect them, no Sancturay to betake themſelves to? Can we think that they were delivered from the Bondage that they were under to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, to be reduced into a worſe, to one of their own Brethren? All which being neither agreeable to the Law of God, nor to common Senſe, nothing can be more evident than that the Prophet declares to the People the <hi>Manner,</hi> and not the Right of Kings; nor the <hi>Manner</hi> of all Kings, but of moſt. Then you come to the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and quote two of them, but you have as bad luck with them here, as you had before. For it is plain, that that other Chapter that <hi>Rabbi Joſes</hi> ſpeaks of, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, he ſays, the Right of Kings, is that in <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,</hi> and not in <hi>Samuel.</hi> For <hi>Rabbi Judas</hi> ſays ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96415:31"/>
truly, and againſt you, that that Diſcourſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>'s was intended only to frighten the People. 'Tis a moſt pernicious Doctrine to maintain, that to be any ones Right, which in its ſelf is flat Injuſtice, unleſs you have a mind to ſpeak by contraries. And that <hi>Samuel</hi> intended to affrighten them, appears by the 18th Verſe, <hi>And ye ſhall cry out in that day becauſe of your king, which ye ſhall have choſen you, and I will not hear you in that day, ſaith the Lord.</hi> That was to be their Puniſhment for their Obſtinacy in perſiſting to deſire a King againſt the Mind and Will of God, and yet they are not forbidden here either to pray againſt him, or to endeavour to rid themſelves of him. For if they might lawfully pray to God againſt him, without doubt they might uſe all lawful means for their own Deliverance. For what Man living, when he finds himſelf in any Calamity, betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, ſo as to neglect his own Duty in order to a Redreſs, and rely upon his lazy Prayers only? But be it how it will, what is all this to the Right of Kings, or of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People? Who neither asked a King againſt the Will of God, nor had one appointed us by God, but by the Right that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have to appoint their own Governors, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a King over us by Laws of our own, neither in Obedience to, nor againſt any Command of God? And this being the Caſe, for ought I ſee, we have done well in depoſing our King, and are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for it, ſince the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſinned in asking one. And this the Event has made appear, for we, when we had a King, prayed to God againſt him, and he heard us, and delivered us. But the <hi>Jews,</hi> who not being under a Kingly Government, deſired a King, he ſuffered to live in Slavery under one, till at laſt, after their return from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96415:32"/>
they betook themſelves to their former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again. Then you come to give us a diſplay of your Talmudical Learning, but you have as ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with that, as you have had with all the reſt. For whilſt you are endeavouring to prove that Kings are not liable to any Temporal Judicature, you quote an Authority out of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Sanhedrim, That the King neither is judged of others, nor does himſelf judge any.</hi> Which is againſt the Peoples own Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Samuel;</hi> for they deſired a King that might judge them. You labour in vain to ſalve this, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that it is to be underſtood of thoſe Kings that reigned after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity. For then, what ſay ye to <hi>Maimonides?</hi> He makes <hi>this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Kings of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and thoſe of</hi> Juda; <hi>that the Kings of the Poſterity of</hi> David <hi>judge, and are judged, but the Kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>do neither.</hi> You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and quarrel with your ſelf, or your <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and ſtill do my work for me. <hi>This,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is not to be underſtood of the Kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for in the 17th Verſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>You ſhall be his Servants,</hi> that is, he ſhall uſe ye to it, not that he ſhall have any Right to make you ſo. Or if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of their Kings Right, 'tis but a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon them for asking a King; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which they were ſenſible of under moſt of their Kings, tho not perhaps under all. But you need no Antagoniſts, you are ſuch a perpetual Adverſary to your ſelf. For you tell us now a Story, as if you were arguing on my ſide, how that firſt <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and after him <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For whoſe ſake,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96415:32"/>
you ſay, that Childiſh Fable of the principal Men of that Aſſembly, <hi>being ſtruck dead by the Angel</hi> Gabriel, was firſt invented: And thus you confeſs that this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Prerogative, upon which you ſeem mainly to rely, <hi>viz. That Kings are not to be judged by any upon Earth,</hi> was grounded upon this worſe than an old Wives Tale, that is, upon a Rabbinical Fable. But that <q>the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings were liable to be call'd in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Actions, and to be puniſhed with ſtripes, if they were found faulty,</q> 
               <hi>Sichardus</hi> ſhows at large out of the Writings of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> to which Author you are indebted for all that you make uſe of, of that ſort of Learning, and yet you have the Impudence to be thwarting with him. Nay, we read in the Scripture that <hi>Saul</hi> thought himself bound by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of his own making; and in Obedience thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that he caſt Lots with his Son <hi>Jonathan</hi> which of them two ſhould die. <hi>Uzzias</hi> likewiſe, when he was thruſt out of the Temple by the Prieſts as a Leper, ſubmitted as every private Perſon in ſuch a Caſe ought to do, and ceas'd to be a King. Suppoſe he ſhould have refuſed to go out of the Temple, and lay down the Government, and live alone, and had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to aſſert that Kingly Right of not being ſubject to any Law; do you think the Prieſts and the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> would have ſuffered the Temple to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I confeſs that theſe Kings, and all that reign'd of <hi>David</hi>'s Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were appointed to the Kingdom both by God and the People; but of all other Kings of what Country ſoever, I affirm, that they are made ſo by the People only; nor can you make it appear that they are appointed by God any otherwiſe than as all other things, great and ſmall, are ſaid to be appointed by him, becauſe nothing comes to paſs without his Providence. So that I allow the Throne of <hi>David</hi> was in a peculiar manner call'd, <hi>The throne of the Lord;</hi> whereas the Thrones of other Princes are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96415:34"/>
no otherwiſe God's, than all other things in the World are his; which if you would, you might have learnt out of the ſame Chapter, Ver. 11, 12. <hi>Thine, O Lord, is the greatneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for all that is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in the Earth is thine. Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all.</hi> And this is ſo often repeated, not to puff up Kings, but to put them in mind, tho they think themſelves Gods, that yet there is a God above them, to whom they owe whatever they are and have. And thus we eaſily underſtand what the Poets, and the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> mean, when they tell us, That 'tis by God that Kings reign, and that they are of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> for so all of us are of God, we are all his Off-ſpring. So that this univerſal Right of Almighty God's, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that he has in Princes, and their Thrones, and all that belongs to them, does not at all derogate from the Peoples Right; but that notwithſtanding all this, <hi>all other Kings,</hi> not particularly and by name appointed by God, owe their Soveraignty to the People only, and conſequently are accountable to them for the management of it. The truth of which Doctrine, tho the Common People are apt to flatter their Kings, yet they themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whether good ones, as <hi>Sarpedon</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> is deſcribed to have been, or bad ones, as thoſe Tyrants in <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that if 'tis by God that Kings now adays Reign, 'tis by God too that the People aſſert their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; ſince all things are of him, and by him. I'm ſure the Scripture bears witneſs to both; that by him Kings reign, and that by him they are caſt down

from their Thrones. And yet experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that both theſe things are brought about by the People, oftner than by God. Be this Right of Kings therefore what it will, the Right of the People is as much of God as it. And when ever any People without ſome viſible Deſignation of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, appoint a King over them, they have the ſame Right to put him down, that they had to ſet him up at firſt. And certainly 'tis a more God like Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to depoſe a Tyrant, than to ſet up one: And there appears much more of God in the People, when they depoſe an unjuſt Prince, than in a King that oppreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay, the People have a Warrant from God to judge wicked Princes; for God has conferrd this very honour upon thoſe that are dear to him, that celebrating the praiſes of Chriſt their own King, <q>they ſhall bind in Chains the Kings of the Nations, (under which Appellation all Tyrants under the Goſpel are included) and execute the Jidgments written upon them that challenge to themſelves an Exemption from all written Laws,</q> 
               <hi>Pſalm</hi> 149. So that there's but little reaſon left for that wicked and folliſh Opinion, that Kings who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the worſt of Men, ſhould be ſo high in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For according to your Principles 'tis every King's right to be a Tyrant. What you ſay next, is very true, <hi>The Supreme Power was then in the people, which appears by their own rejecting their Judges, and making choice of a Kingly Government.</hi> Remember this when I ſhall have occaſion to make uſe of it. You ſay that <hi>God gave the children of Iſrael a King as a thing good and profitable for them, and deny that he gave them one in his anger as a puniſhment for their ſin.</hi> But that will receive an eaſie anſwer; for to what purpoſe ſhould they cry to God becauſe of the King that they had choſen if it were not becauſe a Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an evil thing; not in it ſelf, but becauſe it most commonly does, as <hi>Samuel</hi> forewarns the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that theirs would, degenerate into Pride and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;

if y'are not yet ſatisfied, hark what you ſay your ſelf; acknowledg your own hand, and bluſh; 'tis your <hi>Apparatus ad Primatum: God gave them a King in his anger,</hi> ſay you, <hi>being offended at their ſin in reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting him from ruling over them; and ſo the Chriſtian Church, as a puniſhment for it's forſaking the pure Worſhip of God has been ſubjected to the more than Kingly Government of one mortal head.</hi> So that if your own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon holds, either God gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a King as an evil thing, and as a puniſhment; or he has ſet up the Pope for the good of the Church.

Poet, as you are a bad Patron. Unleſs <hi>that ſtupidity,</hi> that you complain your Advocate is <hi>immers'd over head and ears in,</hi> has blinded the eyes of your own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding too, I'le make ye now ſenſible that y'are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very brute</hi> your ſelf. For now you come and confeſs that <hi>the Kings of all Nations have Laws preſcribed to them.</hi> But then you ſay again, <hi>They are not ſo under the power of them, as to be liable to cenſure or puniſhment of death, if they break them.</hi> Which yet you have proved neither from Scripture, nor from any good Authour. Obſerve then in ſhort; to preſcribe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Laws to ſuch as are not bound by them, is ſilly and ridiculous; and to puniſh all others, but leave ſome one man at liberty to commit all ſort of Impieties without fear of puniſhment, is moſt unjuſt; the Law being general, and not making any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither of which can be ſuppos'd to hold place in the Conſtitutions of any wiſe Law-maker, much leſs in thoſe of God's own making. But that all may perceive how unable you are to prove out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> what you undertook in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make appear by 'em, you confeſs of your own accord, That <hi>there are some Rabbins, who affirm that their fore fathers ought not to have had any other King than God himſelf; and that he ſet other Kings over them for their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> And of thoſe men's opinion, I declare my ſelf to be. It is not fitting nor decent that any man ſhould be a King that does not far excel all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But where men are Equals as in all Governments very many are, they ought to have an equal interest in the Government, and hold it by turns. But that all Men ſhould be Slaves to one that is their Equal, or (as it happens moſt commonly) far inferior to 'em, and very often a Fool, who can ſo much as entertain ſuch a thought without Indignation? Nor does <hi>it make for the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96415:38"/>
Honour of a Kingly Government, that our Saviour was of the poſterity of ſome Kings,</hi> more than it does for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the worſt of Kings, that he was the Offspring of ſome of them too. <hi>The</hi> Meſſias <hi>is a King.</hi> We acknowledg him ſo to be, and rejoyce that he is ſo, pray that his Kingdom may come, for he is worthy. Nor is there any other either equal or next to him. And yet a Kingly Government being put into the hands of unworthy and undeſerving perſons, as moſt commonly it is, may well be thought to have done more harm than good to Mankind. Nor does it follow for all this that all Kings as ſuch, are Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. But ſuppoſe it did, as for argument ſake, I'le allow it does, leaſt you ſhould think I'm too hard with ye. Make you the beſt uſe of it you can. <hi>Then,</hi> ſay you, <hi>God himſelf may properly be ſaid to be the King of Tyrants, nay, himſelf the worſt of all Tyrants.</hi> If the firſt of theſe concluſions does not follow, another does, which may be drawn from moſt parts of your Book: <hi>viz.</hi> That you perpetually contradict, not only the Scriptures, but your own ſelf. For in the very laſt fore-going Period you had affirmed that <hi>God was the King of all things, having himſelf created them.</hi> Now he created Tyrants and Devils, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by your own reaſon, is the King of ſuch. The <hi>2'd</hi> of theſe Concluſions we deteſt, and wiſh that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Mouth of yours were ſtopt up, with which you affirm God to be the worſt of Tyrants, If he be, as you often ſay he is, the King and Lord of ſuch. Nor do you much advantage your Cauſe by telling us that <hi>Moſes was a King, and had the abſolute and ſupream power of a King.</hi> For we could be content that any other were ſo, that could <hi>refer our matters to God,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and conſult with him about our affairs. <hi>Exod. 18. v.</hi> 19. But neither did <hi>Moſes,</hi> notwithſtanding

his great familiatity with God, ever aſſume a Liberty of doing what he would himſelf. What ſays he of himſelf? <hi>The people come unto me to enquire of God.</hi> They came not then to receive <hi>Moſes</hi> his own Dictates and Commands, Then ſays <hi>Jethro,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayſt bring their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto God.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſays, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. v 5. <hi>I have taught you ſtatutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me.</hi> Hence it is that he is ſaid to have been <hi>faithful in all the hauſe of God.</hi> Numb. 12 v. 7. So that the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf was the people's King, and <hi>Moſes</hi> no other than as it were an Interpreter or a Meſſenger betwixt him and them. Nor can you without In piety and Sacriledg; transfer this abſolute ſupream Power and Authority from God to a man; (not having any Warrant from the word of God ſo to do) which <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed only as a Deputy or Subſtitute to God; under whoſe Eye, and in whoſe preſence, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the people always were. But now, for an aggravation of your wickedneſs, though here you make <hi>Moſes</hi> to have exercis'd an abſolute and unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tted Power, in your <hi>apparat. ad primat.</hi> Page 230. You ſay that <hi>he together with the ſeventy elders ruled the people, and that himſelf was the chief of the people, but not their Maſter.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore were a King, as certainly he was, and the beſt of Kings, and had <hi>a Supream and Legal Power,</hi> as you ſay he had, and yet neither was the people's Maſter nor Govern'd them alone; then according to you, Kings, though indued with the Supream Power, are not by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Sovereign and Kingly Right of theirs Lords over the people, nor ought to Govern them alone; much leſs, according to their own Will and Pleaſure? After all this, you have the Impudence to feign a command from God to that people, <hi>to ſet up a

King over them, as ſoon as they ſhould be poſſeſſed of the holy land,</hi> Deut. 17. For you craftily leave out the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words, and ſhalt ſay, <hi>I will ſet a King over me,</hi> &amp;c. And now call to mind what you ſaid before, Page <hi>42d</hi> and what I ſaid, I ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of: <hi>viz.

How do theſe things agree?</hi> He finds himſelf caught, and obſerve now with how great malice againſt the Prophet, and impiety againſt God, he endeavours to diſentangle himſelf. <hi>We muſt conſider,</hi> ſays he <hi>That</hi> Samuel's <hi>own Sons then Judged the people, and the people rejected them becauſe of their corruption; now</hi> Samuel <hi>was loth his Sons ſhould be lay'd aſide, and God to gratify the Prophet, intimated to him as if himſelf were not very well pleaſed with it.</hi> Speak out ye wretch, and never mince the matter: You mean, God dealt deceitfully with <hi>Samuel,</hi> and he with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is not your Advocate, but your ſelf that are <hi>Frantick and Diſtracted;</hi> who caſt off all reverence to God Almighty, ſo you may but ſeem to Honour the King. Would <hi>Samuel</hi> prefer the Intereſt of his Sons and their Ambition, and their Covetouſneſs, before the general good of all the people, when they asked a thing that would be good and profitable for them? Can we think that he would impoſe upon them by cunning and ſubtilty, and make them believe things that were not? Or if we ſhould ſuppoſe all this true of <hi>Samuel,</hi> would God himſelf countenance and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him in it; would he diſſemble with the people? So that either that was not the right of Kings which

               <hi>Samuel</hi> taught the people; or elſe that right by the Teſtimony, both of God and the Prophet was an evil thing, was burdenſom, injurious, unprofitable, and chargeable to the Common-wealth: Or <hi>Laſtly,</hi> (which muſt not be admitted), God and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

bow down to Crucifixes painted over them on the Wall. <hi>But yet for all this, Solomon was not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die.</hi> Nor does it follow, becauſe he was not, that therefore he ought not to have been. Perhaps there were many Circumſtances that made it then not expedient. But not long after the people both by words and actions made appear what they took to be their right; when Ten Tribes of Twelve revolted from his Son; and if he had not ſaved himſelf by flight, it is very likely they would have ſtoned him, notwithſtanding his Threats and big ſwelling words.</p>

only, but even of a ſervant, that we might be made free? Nor is this to be underſtood of ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpiritual liberty only; how inconſiſtent elſe would that Song of his Mothers be with the deſign of his coming into the world, <hi>He hath ſcattered the proud in the imagination of their heart, he hath put down the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from their ſeat, and hath exalted the humble and meek?</hi> How ill ſuited to their occaſion would theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be, if the coming of Chriſt rather eſtabliſhed and ſtrengthened a Tyrannical Government, and made a blind ſubjection the duty of all Chriſtians? Himſelf having been born and lived and died under a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Government, has thereby purchaſed Liberty for us. As he gives us his Grace to ſubmit patiently to a condition of Slavery, if there be a neceſſity of it; ſo if by any honeſt ways and means we can rid our ſelves, and obtain our Liberty, he is ſo far from reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that he encourageth us ſo to do. Hence it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only of an Evangelical, but a Civil Liberty, ſays thus, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 21. Art thou called being a ſervant, care not for it; but if thou maiſt be made free, uſe it rather; you are bought with a price, be not ye ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of men.</hi> So that you are very impertinent in endeavouring to argue us into Slavery by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Saviour; who by ſubmitting to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition himſelf, has confirmed even our Civil Liberties. He took upon him indeed in our ſtead the form of a ſervant, but he always retained his purpoſe of being a deliverer; and thence it was that he taught us a quite other notion of the right of Kings, than this that you endeavour to make good: You, I ſay, that preach up not Kingſhip, but Tyranny, and that in a Commonwealth; by enjoyning not a neceſſary only, but a Religious ſubjection to whatever Tyrant gets into the Chair, whether he come to it by Succeſſion,

               </gap>; ſo that it was ſome conſiderable oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that our Saviour ſpoke of; and from hence he took occaſion to Tax <hi>Herod</hi>'s Injuſtice, under whoſe Government, and within whoſe Juriſdiction he then was; in that, whereas the Kings of the Earth (who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ct uſually the Title of Fathers of their Country) do not uſe to oppreſs their own Children, that is, their own natural born Subjects with heavy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Exactions, but lay ſuch burdens upon ſtrangers and conquer'd enemies; he, quite contrary, oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſed not ſtrangers, but his own people. But let what will be here meant by Children, either natural born Subjects, or the Children of God, and thoſe the Elect only, or Chriſtians in general, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:96415:43"/>
underſtands the place; this is certain, that if <hi>Peter</hi> was a child, and therefore free, then by conſequence we are ſo too, by our Saviour's own Teſtimony, either as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or as Chriſtans; and that conſequently it is not the right of Kings to exact heavy Tributes from their own Countrymen, and thoſe freeborn Subjects. Chriſt himſelf profeſſeth, that he paid not this Tribute as a thing that was due, but that he might not bring trouble upon himſelf by offending thoſe that demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The work that he came into this World to do, was quite of another Nature. But if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our deny, that it is the Right of Kings to burden their Free-born Subjects with grievous Exactions, he would certainly muchleſs allow it to be their Right to Spoil, Maſſacre, and Torture their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and thoſe Chriſtians too. He diſcourſed after ſuch a manner of the Right of Kings, that thoſe that he ſpoke to ſuſpected his Principles, as laying too great a reſtraint upon Sovereignty, and not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Licenſe that Tyrants aſſume to themſelves to be the Rights of Kings. It was not for nothing that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> put ſuch Queſtions to him, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him; and that at the ſame time they told him, that he regarded not the Perſon of any Man; nor was it for nothing that he was angry when ſuch Queſtions were propoſed to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. If one ſhould endeavour to enſuare you with little Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and catch at your Anſwers, to ground an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt you upon your own Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Right of Kings, and all this under a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, would you be angry with him? You'd have but very little reaſon. 'Tis evident, That our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Principles concerning Government, were not agreeable to the Hamour of Princes. His Anſwer too implies as much; by which he rather turn'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96415:44"/>
them away, than inſtructed them. He asked for the Tribute-money. <hi>Whoſe Image and Superſcription is it,</hi> ſays he? They tell him it was <hi>Caeſar's. Give then to Caeſar,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the things that are Caeſar's; and to God, the things that are God's.</hi> And how comes it to paſs, that the People ſhould not have given to them the things that are theirs? <hi>Render to all men their dues,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. So that <hi>Caeſar</hi> muſt not ingroſs all to himſelf. Our Liberty is not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s; 'tis a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing we have received from God himſelf; 'tis what we are born to; to lay this down at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s feet, which we derive not from him, which we are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him for, were an unworthy Action, and a degrading of our very Nature. If one ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider attentively the Countenance of a Man, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after whoſe Image ſo noble a Creature were framed; would not any one that heard him, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make anſwer, That he was made after the Image of God himſelf? Being therefore peculiarly God's own, and conſequently things that are to be given to him; we are intirely free by Nature, and cannot without the greateſt Sacrilege imaginable be reduced into a Condition of Slavery to any Man, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a wicked, unjuſt, cruel Tyrant. Our Saviour does not take upon him to determine what things are God's, and what <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s; he leaves that as he found it. If the piece of Money which they ſhewed him, was the same that was paid to God, as in <hi>Veſpatian</hi>'s time it was, then our Saviour is ſo far from having put an end to the Controverſy, that he has but entangl'd it, and made it more perplext than it was before; for 'tis impoſſible the ſame thing ſhould be given both to God, and to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But, you ſay, he intimates to them what things were <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s; to wit, that piece <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Money becauſe it bore the Emperor's Stamp; and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96415:44"/>
what of all that? How does this advantage your Cauſe? You get not the Emperor, or to your ſelf, a Penny by this Concluſion. Either Chriſt allowed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing at all to be <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, but that piece of Money that he then had in his hand, and thereby aſſerted the Peoples Intereſt in every thing elſe; or elſe, if (as you would have us underſtand him) he affirms all Money that has the Emperor's ſtamp upon it, to be the Emperor's own. He contradicts himſelf, and gives the Magiſtrate a property in every Man's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, when as he himſelf paid his Tribute-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with a Proteſtation, that it was more than what either <hi>Peter,</hi> or himſelf was bound to do. The ground you rely on, is very weak; for Money bears the Prince's Image, not as a token of its being his, but of its being good Metal, and that none may preſume to Counterfeit it. If the writing Princes Names, or ſetting their Stamps upon a thing, veſt the property of it in them, 'twere a good ready way for them to invade all Property. Or rather, if whatever Subjects have, be abſolutely at their Prince's diſpoſal, which is your Aſſertion, that piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, becauſe his Image was ſtampt on it, but becauſe of Right it belonged to him before 'twas coyn'd. So that nothing can be more manifeſt, than that our Saviour in this place never intended to teach our Duty to Magiſtrates (he would have ſpoke more plainly, if he had) but to reprehend the Malice and Wickedneſs of the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Phariſees.</hi> When they told him that <hi>Herod</hi> laid wait to kill him; did he return an humble, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Anſwer? <hi>Go, tell that Fox,</hi> ſays he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that Kings have no other Right to deſtroy their Subjects, than Foxes have to devour the things they prey upon. Say you, <q>He ſuffered Death under a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96415:45"/>
How could he poſſibly under any other?</q> But from hence you conclude, that he aſſerted it to be the Right of Kings to commit Murder, and act Injuſtice. You'd make an excellent Moraliſt. But our Saviour, tho he became a Servant, not to make us ſo, but that we might be free; yet carried he himſelf ſo with Relation to the Magiſtracy, as not to aſcribe any more to them then their due. Now, let us come at laſt to enquire what his Doctrine was upon this Subject. The Sons of <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bedee</hi> were ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Honour and Power in the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which they perſuaded themſelves he would ſhortly ſet up in the World; he reproves them ſo, as withal to let all Chriſtians know what Form of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he deſires they ſhould ſettle amongſt themſelves. <hi>Ye know,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them; and they that are great, exerciſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon them; but it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſover will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> Unleſs you'd been diſtracted, you could never have imagined that this place makes for you: and yet you urge it, and think it furniſhes you with an Argument to prove that our Kings are abſolute Lords and Maſters over us and ours. May it be our fortune to have to do with ſuch Enemies in War, as will fall blind-fold and naked into our Camp inſtead of their own: as you conſtantly do, who alledge that for your ſelf, that of all things in the World makes moſt againſt you. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> aſked God for a King, ſuch a King as other Nations round about them had. God diſſuaded them by many Arguments, which our Saviour here gives us an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of; <hi>You know that the Princes of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Dominion over them.</hi> But yet, becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:96415:45"/>
perſiſted in their deſire of a King, God gave them one, tho in his Wrath. Our Saviour, leſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould deſire a King, ſuch a one at leaſt, as might Rule as, he ſays, the Princes of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did, prevents them with an Injunction to the contrary; <hi>but it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> What can be ſaid plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than this? That ſtately, imperious Sway and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion that Kings uſe to exerciſe, ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you; what ſpecious Titles ſoever they may aſſume to themſelves, as that of Benefactors, or the like. <hi>But he that will be great amongſt you,</hi> (and who is greater than the Prince?) <hi>let him be your Servant.</hi> So that the Lawyer, whoever he be, that you are ſo ſmart upon, was not ſo much out of the way, but had our Saviour's own Authority to back him, when he ſaid that Chriſtian Princes were indeed no other than the Peoples Servants; 'tis very certain that all good Magiſtrates are ſo. Inſomuch that Chriſtians either muſt have no King at all, or if they have, that King muſt be the People's Servant. Abſolute Lordſhip and Chriſtianity are inconſiſtent. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, by whoſe Miniſtry that ſeviler Oeconomy of the old Law was inſtituted, did not exerciſe an Arbitrary, Haughty Power and Authority, but bore the burden of the People, and carried them in his Boſom, as a Nurſing Father does a ſucking Child, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. and what is that of a Nurſing Father, but a Miniſterial Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Plato</hi> would not have the Magiſtrates called Lords, but Servants and Helpers of the People; nor the People Servants, but Maintainers of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, becauſe they give Meat, Drink, and Wages to their Kings themſelves. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Keepers and Miniſters of the Laws. <hi>Plato,</hi> Miniſters and ſervants.

of the People, and of the Laws, nevertheleſs for all that; the Laws and the Magiſtrates were both created for the good of the People: And yet this is it, that you call <hi>the Opinion of the Fanatick-Maſtiffs in</hi> England.

Diſcourſe, was to make it appear, that our Saviour did not go about to introduce principles incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Civil Government, but ſuch as ſtrengthned it, and ſettled it upon the ſureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</q>He never intended then by ſetting <hi>Nero,</hi> or any other Tyrant out of the reach of all Laws, to enſlave mankind under his luſt and cruelty. <q>He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended too <hi>ſays the ſame Author,</hi> to diſſwade from unneceſſary and cauſeleſs Wars.</q>  But he does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a War taken up againſt a Tyrant, a boſom Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his own Countrey, and conſequently the moſt dangerous that may be. <q>'Twas commonly ſaid in thoſe days, that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles was ſeditious, themſelves perſons that endeavour'd to ſhake the ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that the Apoſtles did not write in defence of Tyrants, as you do; but they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſuch things as made them ſuſpected to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Government they liv'd under, things that ſtood in need of being explained and interpreted, and having another ſenſe put upon them, than was generally receiv'd. St. <hi>Chryſoſtme</hi> has now taught us what the Apoſtle's deſign was in this Diſcourſe; let us now examine his words. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers.</hi> He tells us not what thoſe Higher Powers are, nor who they are; for he never intended to overthrow all Governments, and the ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Nations, and ſubject all to ſome one man's will. Every good Emperour acknowledged that the Laws of the Empire, and the Authority of the Senate was above himſelf; and the ſame principle and notion of Government has obtained all along in Civiliz'd Nations. <hi>Pindar,</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:96415:48"/>
calls the Law <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>King over all. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> in his Hymns calls it the King both of Gods and Men. And he gives the reaſon why it is ſo; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>'tis that that ſits at the helm of all humane affairs. Plato</hi> in his Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>that that ought to have the greateſt ſway in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> In his Epiſtles he commends that Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in which the Law is made Lord and Maſter, and no ſcope given to any Man to tyrannize over the Laws. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of the ſame Opinion in his <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> and ſo is <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Book <hi>De Legibus,</hi> That the Laws ought to Govern the Magiſtrates, as they do the people. The Law therefore having always been accounted the higheſt Power on Earth, by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt Learned and wiſe men that ever were, and by the Conſtitutions of the beſt ordered States, and it being very certain that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel is neither contrary to reaſon nor the Law of Nations, that man is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſubject to the higher Powers, that obeys the Law, and the Magiſtrates, ſo far as they govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the people, but Princes themſelves to be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: who are not above the Laws, but bound by them: <hi>For there is no power but of God:</hi> that is, no form; no lawful Conſtitution of any Government. The moſt ancient Laws that are known to us, were formerly aſcribed to God as their Author. For the Law, ſays <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Philipp.</hi> is no other than a rule of well grounded reaſon, derived from God himſelf, enjoyning whatever is juſt and right, and forbidding the contrary. So that the inſtitution of Magiſtracy is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and the end of it is, that Mankind might live under certain Laws, and be govern'd by them; but what particular form of Government
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96415:48"/>
each Nation would live under, and what Perſons ſhould be entruſted with the Magiſtracy, without doubt was left to the choice of each Nation. Hence St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls Kings and Deputies, <hi>Humane Ordinances.</hi> And <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſea</hi> in the 8th Chapter of his Propheſy, <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me; they have made Princes, and I knew it not.</hi> For in the Commonwealth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where upon matters of great and weighty Importance, they could have acceſs to God himſelf, and conſult with him; they could not chuſe a King themſelves by Law, but were to refer the matter to him. Other Nations have received no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Sometimes the very Form of Government, if it be amiſs, or at leſt thoſe Perſons that have the Power in their hands, are not of God, but of Men, or of the Devil, Luke 4. <hi>All this power will I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, for it is delivered unto me, and I give it to whom I will.</hi> Hence the Devil is called the Prince of this World; and in the 12th of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gave to the Beaſt his Power, and his Throne, and great Authority. So that we muſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as if he ſpoke of all ſorts of Magiſtrates in general, but of lawful Magiſtrates; and ſo they are deſcribed in what follows. We muſt alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him of the Powers themſelves; not of thoſe Men always, in whoſe hands they are lodged. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks very well, and clearly upon this occaſion. <hi>What?</hi> ſays he, <hi>is every Prince then appointed by God to be ſo? I ſay no ſuch thing,</hi> ſays he. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks not of the Perſon of the Magiſtrate, but of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy it ſelf. He does not ſay, there is no Prince but who is of God. He ſays there is no Power but of God.</hi> Thus far St. <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> for what Powers are, are ordained of God. So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks only of a lawful Magiſtracy. For what is Evil and amiſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96415:49"/>
be ſaid to be ordain'd, becauſe 'tis diſorderly; order and diſorder cannot conſiſt together in the ſame Subject. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The Powers that be;</hi> and you interpret his words as if he had ſaid, <hi>The Powers that now be;</hi> that you may prove that the <hi>Romans</hi> ought in Conſcience to obey <hi>Nero,</hi> who you take for granted was then Emperor. I'm very well content you ſhould read the words ſo, and draw that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from them. The Conſequence will be, that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men ought to yield Obedience to the preſent Government, as 'tis now eſtabliſht according to a new Model; becauſe you muſt needs acknowledge that it is the <hi>preſent</hi> Government, and ordain'd of God, as much at leaſt as <hi>Nero's</hi> was. And leſt you ſhould object that <hi>Nero</hi> came to the Empire by a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſion, it's apparent from the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory that both he and <hi>Tiberius</hi> got into the Chair by the Tricks and Artifices of their Mothers, and had no right at all to the Succeſſion. So that you are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with your ſelf, and retract from your own Principles, in affirming that the <hi>Romans</hi> owed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Government that then was; and yet denying that <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> owe Subjection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that now is. But 'tis no wonder to hear you contradict your ſelf. There are no two things in the World more directly oppoſite and contrary to one another, than you are to your ſelf.

Text. Thus <hi>Salmaſius</hi> corrects that Paſſage in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> He has made a diſcovery, that the Words ought not to be read, <hi>The Powers that are;</hi> but, <hi>The Powers that now are:</hi> And all this to prove, that all Men owed Subjection and Obedience to <hi>Nero</hi> the Tyrant, whom he ſupp ſed to have been then Emperor. This <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> which you ſay was writ in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, was writ in his Predeceſſor's time, who was an honeſt well-meaning Man: And this Learned Men evince by undeniable Arguments. But beſides, the five firſt years of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign were without Exception. So that this thread-bare Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſo many Men have at their Tongue's end, and have been deceived by, to wit, that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are to be obeyed, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> injoyns a Subjection to <hi>Nero;</hi> is evident to have been but a cunning Invention of ſome ignorant Parſon. <hi>He that reſiſts the Powers,</hi> to wit, a lawful Power, <hi>reſiſts the Ordnance of God.</hi> Kings themſelves come under the Penalty of this Law, when they reſiſt the Senate, and act contrary to the Laws But do they reſiſt the Ordinance of God, that reſiſt an unlawful Power, or a Perſon that goes about to overthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a lawful one? No Man living in his right wits can maintain ſuch an Aſſertion. The words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after make it as clear as the Sun, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks only of a lawful Power; for he gives us in them a Definition of Magiſtrates, and thereby explains to us, who are the Perſons thus authoriz'd, and upon what account we are to yield Obedience, leſt we ſhould be apt. to miſtake, and ground ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Notions upon his Diſcourſe. <hi>The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are not a Terror to good Works, but to evil; Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96415:50"/>
For he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good. He bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Sword in vain; for he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil.</hi> What honeſt Man would not willingly ſubmit to ſuch a Magiſtracy as is here deſcribed? And that not only to avoid W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath, and for fear of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> Without Magiſtrates, and ſome Form or other of Civil Government, no Commonwealth, no Humane Society can ſubſiſt; there were no-living in the World. But whatever Power enables a Man, or whatſoever Magiſtrate takes upon him to act contrary to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the Duty of thoſe that are in Authority; neither is that Power, nor that Magiſtrate ordain'd of God. And conſequently to ſuch a Magiſtracy no Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is commanded, nor is any due, nor are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forbidden to reſiſt ſuch Authority, for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do not reſiſt the Power, nor the Magiſtracy, as they are here excellently well deſcribed; but they reſiſt a Robber, a Tyrant, an Enemy; who if he may notwithſtanding in ſome ſenſe be called a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, upon this account only, becauſe he has Power in his hands, which perhaps God may have inveſted him with for our puniſhment; by the ſame reaſon the Devil may be called a Magiſtrate. This is moſt certain, that there can be but one true Definition of one and the ſame thing. So that if St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place define what a Magiſtrate is, which he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does, and that accurately well; He cannot poſſibly define a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> the moſt contrary thing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, in the ſame words. Hence I infer, that he commands us to ſubmit to ſuch Magiſtrates only as he himſelf defines and deſcribes, and not to <hi>Tyrants,</hi> which are quite other things. <hi>For this Cauſe you pay Tribute alſo.</hi> He gives a Reaſon, together with a Command. Hence

St. <hi>Chryſoſtome; Why do we pay Tribute to Princes?</hi> ſays he, <hi>Do we not thereby reward them for the care they take of our Safety? We ſhould not have paid them any Tribute, if we had not been convinc'd, That it was good for us to live under a Government.</hi> So that I muſt here repeat what I have ſaid already, That ſince Subjection is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely enjoined, but upon a particular Reaſon, that reaſon muſt be the rule of our Subjection; where that reaſon holds, we are Rebels if we ſubmit not; where it holds not, we are Cowards and Slaves if we do. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are far from being Freemen; for they are wicked and flagitious.</hi> I will not reckon up here the Vices of the <hi>French,</hi> tho they live under a Kingly Government; neither will I excuſe my own Countrey-men too far; but this I may ſafely ſay, Whatever Vices they have, they have learnt them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Kingly Government; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> learnt a great deal of Wickedneſs in <hi>Egypt:</hi> And as they, when they were brought into the Wilderneſs, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the immediate Government of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, could hardly reform; juſt ſo 'tis with us: But there are good hopes of many amongſt us; that I may not here celebrate thoſe men amongſt us, that are eminent for their Piety and Virtue, and Love of the Truth; of which ſort I perſuade my ſelf we have as great a number, as where you think there are moſt ſuch. But <hi>they have laid a heavy yoke upon the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation:</hi> What if they have, upon thoſe of them that endeavoured to lay a heavy yoke upon all the reſt? Upon thoſe that have deſerved to be put under the hatches? As for the reſt, I queſtion not but they are very well content to be at the Expence of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their own Liberty, the Publick Treaſury being exhauſted by the Civil Wars.

When St. <hi>Paul</hi> has occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Nero,</hi> he calls him not a King but a <hi>Lion,</hi> that is, a wild, ſavage beaſt, from whoſe Jaws he is glad he was delivered, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. So that it is for Kings, not for beaſts that we are to <hi>pray, that under them we may live a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> Kings and their Intereſt are not the things here intended to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and ſecured; 'tis the publick peace, Godlineſs and honeſty, whoſe eſtabliſhment we are commanded to endeavour after, and to pray for. But is there any people in the world that would not chuſe rather to live an honeſt and a careful life though never free from War and troubles, in the defence of themſelves and their Families, whether againſt Tyrants or Enemies, (for I make no difference) than under the power of a Tyrant or an enemy to ſpin out a life equally trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, accompanied with Slavery and Ignominy? that the latter is the more deſirable of the two, I'le prove by a Teſtimony of your own, not becauſe I think your authority worth quoting, but that all men may obſerve how double-tongu'd you are, and how Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary your Pen is: <q>Who would not rather, <hi>ſay you,</hi> bear with thoſe diſſentions that through the emulation of great men often happen in an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Government, than live under the Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government of one, where nothing but certain miſery and ruin is to be look'd for? The people of <hi>Rome</hi> prefer'd their Commonwealth, though never ſo much ſhatter'd with Civil broils, before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable yoke of their Emperours. When a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to avoid ſedition, ſubmits to a Monarchy, and finds by experience, that that is the worſe evil of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96415:53"/>
the two, they often deſire to return to their former Government again.</q> Theſe are your own words, and more you have to this purpoſe in that Diſcourſe concerning Biſhops, which under a feigned name you wrote againſt <hi>Petavius</hi> the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to take ſome pains to find it out. But perhaps it will not be ſo to enquire into the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Fathers, and ranſack their Volumes; for if they aſſert any thing which is not warranted by the word of God, we may ſafely reject their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, be it never ſo great; and particularly that expreſſion that you alledg out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that <q>God in his Providence orders it ſo, that ſuch Kings reign as are ſuitable to, and proper for the people they are to Govern, all Circumſtances conſidered.</q> That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I ſay, is directly contrary to Scripture. For though God himſelf declared openly that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his own people to be Governed by Judges than by Kings, yet he left it to them, to change that form of Government for a worſe, if they would themſelves. And we read frequently, that when the body of the people has been good, they have had a wicked King, and contrariwiſe that a good King has ſometimes reign'd when the people have been wicked. So that wiſe and prudent men are to conſider and ſee what is profitable and fit for the people in general; for it is very certain that the ſame form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not equally convenient for all Nations, nor for the ſame Nation at all times; but ſometimes one, ſometimes another may be more proper, according as the induſtry and valour of the people may increaſe or decay. But if you deprive the people of this liberty of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96415:54"/>
ſetting up what Government they like beſt among themſelves, you take that from them, in which the life of all Civil Liberty conſiſts. Then you tell us of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> of his humble and ſubmiſſive behaviour to the <hi>Antonini,</hi> thoſe beſt of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; as if any body would not do the like to Princes of ſuch moderation as they were. <q>

But you alledg another reaſon, <hi>Humane affairs would be turn'd upſide down.</hi> They would ſo, and be chang'd for the better.

You ſay, <hi>There can be no greater Hereſie than this, to ſet up one man in Chriſt's ſeat. Theſe two are infallible marks of Antichriſt, Infallibility in Spirituals, and Omnipotence in Temporals. Apparat. ad Prim pag.</hi> 171. Do you pretend that Kings are infallible? If you do not, why do you make them Omnipotent? And how comes it to paſs that an unlimited power in one man ſhould be accounted leſs deſtructive to Temporal things, than it is to Eccleſiaſtical? Or do you think that God takes no care at all of Civil affairs? If he takes none him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I'm ſure he does not forbid us to take care which way they go. If he does take any care about them, certainly he would have the ſame reformation made in the Commonwealth, that he would have made in the Church; eſpecially it being obvious to every mans experience that Infallibility and Omnipotency
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96415:58"/>
being arrogated to one man, are equally miſchievous in both. God has not ſo modelled the Government of the World as to make it the duty of any Civil Community to ſubmit to the Cruelties of Tyrants, and yet to leave the Church at liberty to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Slavery and Tyranny; nay, rather quite contrary, he has put no Arms into the Churches hand but thoſe of Patience and Innocence, Prayer and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline; but the Commonwealth, all the Magiſtracy are by him entruſted with the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and execution of the Laws, with the power of puniſhing and revenging; he has put the Sword into their hands. I cannot but ſmile at this mans prepoſterous whimſies; in Eccleſiaſticks he's <hi>Helvidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Thraſeas,</hi> a perfect <hi>Tyrannicide.</hi> In Politicks no man more a Lackey and Slave to Tyrants than he. If his Doctrine hold, not we only that have depos'd our King, but the Proteſtants in general, who againſt the minds of their Princes have rejected the Pope, are all Rebels alike. But I've confounded him long enough with his own arguments. Such is the nature of the Beaſt: leſt his adverſary ſhould be unprovided, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf furniſhes him with weapons. Never did any man give his Antagoniſt greater advantages againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than he does. They that he has to do withal, will be ſooner weary of purſuing him, than he of flying.</p>

            <p>PErhaps you think, <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> that you have done enough to ingratiate your ſelf with Princes; that you have deſerved well of 'em; but if they conſider their own Intereſt, and take their meaſures according to what it really is, not according to the falſe Gloſs that your flatteries have put upon it, there never was any man in the world that deſerv'd ſo ill of 'em as you, none more deſtructive and pernicious to them and their intereſt in the whole world than your ſelf. For by exalting the Power of Kings above all Humane Laws, you tell all mankind that are ſubject to ſuch a Government, that they are no better than ſlaves, and make them but the more deſirous of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by diſcovering to them their error, and putting that into their heads that they never ſo much as dreamt of before, to wit, that they are ſlaves to their Princes. And without doubt ſuch a ſort of Government will be more irkſome and unſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rable, by how much the more you perſwade the world, that it is not by the allowance and ſubmiſſion of Nations, that Kings have obtained this exorbitant power, but that it is abſolutely eſſential to ſuch a form of Government, and of the nature of the thing it ſelf. So that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you make the world of your mind, or no, your Doctrine muſt needs be miſchievous and deſtructive, and ſuch as cannot but be abhorred of all Princes. For if you ſhould work men into a perſwaſion that the Right of Kings is without all bounds, they would no longer be ſubject to a Kingly Government; if you miſs of your aim, yet you make men weary of Kings, by telling them that they aſſume ſuch a power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96415:59"/>
as of right belonging to them. But if Princes will allow of thoſe Principles that I aſſert; if they will ſuffer themſelves and their own power to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed by Laws, inſtead of an uncertain, weak and violent Government, full of cares and fears, they will reign peaceably, quietly, and ſecurely. If they ſlight this counſel of mine, though wholſome in its ſelf, becauſe of the meanneſs of the Author, they ſhall know that it is not my counſel only, but what was anciently adviſed by one of the wiſeſt of Kings. For <hi>Lycurgus</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> when he obſerved that his own Relations that were Princes of <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Meſſana,</hi> by endeavouring to introduce an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government, had ruin'd themſelves and their people; he, that he might benefit his Countrey, and ſecure the Succeſſion to his own Family, could think upon no better expedient, than to communicate his Power to the Senate, and taking the great men of the Realm into part of the Government with himſelf; and by this means the Crown continued in his Family for many ages: But whether it was <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or, as ſome learned men are of opinion, <hi>Theopompus,</hi> that introduced that mixt form of Government among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſomewhat more than a hundred years after <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his time, (of whom it is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he uſed to boaſt, that by advancing the Power of the Senate above that of the Prince, he had ſetled the Kingdom upon a ſure Foundation, and was like to leave it in a laſting and durable condition to his Poſterity); which of them ſoever it was, I ſay, he has left a good Example to Modern Princes; and was as creditable a Councellor, as his Counſel was ſafe: For that all men ſhould ſubmit to any one man, ſo as to acknowledge a Power in him ſuperior to all humane Laws, neither did any Law ever Enact,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96415:60"/>
nor indeed was it poſſible that any ſuch Law ſhould ever be; for that cannot be ſaid to be a Law, that ſtrikes at the root of all Laws, and takes them quite away. It being apparent that your Poſitions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the nature of all Laws, being ſuch as render them no Laws at all. You endeavour notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in this Fourth Chapter, to make good by Examples, what you have not yet been able to do by any Reaſons that you have alledged as yet. Let's conſider whether your Examples help your Cauſe; for they many times make things plain, which the Laws are either altogether ſilent in, or do but hint at. We'll begin firſt with the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom we ſuppoſe to have known moſt of the mind of God; and then, according to your own method, we'll come to the times of Chriſtianity. And firſt, for thoſe times in which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being ſubject to Kings, who, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they were, did their utmoſt to caſt that flaviſh yoke from off their necks. <hi>Eglon</hi> the King of <hi>Moab</hi> had made a Conqueſt of them; the Seat of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was at <hi>Jericho;</hi> he was no contemner of the True God; when his Name was mentioned, he roſe from his Seat: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had ſerved him Eighteen Years; they ſent a preſent to him, not as to an Enemy, but to their own Prince; notwithſtanding which outward Veneration and Profeſſion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, they kill him by a wile, as an Enemy to their Countrey. You'l ſay perhaps, that <hi>Ehud,</hi> who did that action, had a Warrant from God for ſo doing. He had ſo, 'tis like; and what greater Argument of its being a warrantable and praiſe-worthy action? God uſeth not to put men upon things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, treacherous and cruel, but upon ſuch things as are virtuous and laudable. But we read no where that there was any poſitive Command from Heaven
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96415:60"/>
in the caſe. <hi>The Iſraelites called upon God;</hi> So did we: And God ſtirred up a Saviour for them; ſo he did for us: <hi>Eglon</hi> of a Neighbouring Prince became a Prince of the <hi>Jews;</hi> of an Enemy to them he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their King: Our Gentleman, of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King became an Enemy to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; ſo that he ceas'd to be a King: Thoſe Capacities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent: No man can be a Member of a State, and an Enemy to it at the ſame time. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> was never lookt upon by the <hi>Romans</hi> as a Conſul, nor <hi>Nero</hi> as an Emperor, after the Senate had voted them both Enemies. This <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us in his <hi>Fourth Philippick: If</hi> Antony <hi>be a Conſul,</hi> ſays he, Brutus <hi>is an Enemy; but if</hi> Brutus <hi>be a Saviour and Preſerver of the Commonwealth,</hi> Antony <hi>is an Enemy: none but robbers count him a Conſul.</hi> By the ſame reaſon, ſay I, who but Enemies to their Countrey look upon a Tyrant as a King? So that <hi>Eglon</hi>'s being a Foreigner, and King <hi>Charles</hi> a Prince of our own, will make no difference in the caſe; both being Enemies, and both Tyrants, they are in the ſame circumſtances. If <hi>Ehud</hi> kill'd him juſtly, we have done ſo too in putting our King to Death. <hi>Sampſon</hi> that Renowned Champion of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> tho his Countrey-men blam'd him for it, <hi>Doſt thou not know,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that the Philiſtines have dominion over us?</hi> yet againſt thoſe <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Dominion he was, he himſelf undertook a War in his own perſon, without any other help; and whether he acted in purſuance of a Command from Heaven, or was prompted by his own Valour only; or whatever inducement ſoever he had, he did not put to death one, but many that tyranized over his Countrey, having firſt called upon God by Prayer, and implored his Aſſiſtance: So that <hi>Sampſon</hi> counted it no act of Impiety, but quite contrary, to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96415:61"/>
kill thoſe that enſlaved his Countrey, 'tho they had dominion over himſelf too; and tho the greater part of his Countrey-men ſubmitted to their Tyranny. <hi>But yet</hi> David <hi>who was both a King and a Prophet, would not take away</hi> Saul's <hi>life, becauſe he was God's Anointed.</hi> Does it follow that becauſe <hi>David</hi> refuſed to do a thing, therefore we are obliged not to do that very thing? <hi>David</hi> was a private perſon, and would not kill the King; is that a preſident for a Parliament, for a whole Nation? <hi>David</hi> would not revenge his own quarrel, by putting his Enemy to death by ſtealth; does it follow that therefore the Magiſtrates muſt not puniſh a Malefactor according to Law? He would not kill a King; muſt not an Aſſembly of the States therefore puniſh a Tyrant? He ſcrupled the killing of God's Anointed; muſt the People therefore ſcruple to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their own Anointed? Eſpecially one that after having ſo long profeſſed Hoſtility againſt his own people, had waſh'd off that anointing of his, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacred or Civil, with the Blood of his own Subjects. I confeſs that thoſe Kings whom God by his Prophets anointed to be Kings, or appointed to ſome ſpecial ſervice, as he did <hi>Cyrus, Iſa.</hi> 44. may not improperly be called the <hi>Lord's Anointed;</hi> but all other Princes, according to the ſeveral ways of their coming to the Government, are the People's Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the Army's, or many times the Anointed of their own Faction only. But taking it for granted, That all Kings are God's Anointed, you can never prove, That therefore they are above all Laws, and not to be called in queſtion, what Villanies ſoever they commit. What if <hi>David</hi> laid a charge upon himſelf and other private perſons not to ſtretch forth their hands againſt the Lord's Anointed? Does not God himſelf command Princes not ſo much as <hi>to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96415:61"/>
touch his anointed?</hi> Which were no other than his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. He preferred that Anointing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his People were Anointed, before that of Kings, if any ſuch thing were. Would any man offer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from this place of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> That Believers are not to be called in queſtion, tho they offend againſt the Laws, becauſe God commands Princes not to touch his Anointed? King <hi>Solomon</hi> was about to put to death <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt, tho he were <hi>God's Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> too; and did not ſpare him becauſe of his <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but becauſe he had been his Father's Friend. If that Sacred and Civil Anointing, wherewith the High-Prieſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> was anointed, whereby he was not only conſtituted High-Prieſt, but a Temporal Magiſtrate in many caſes, did not exempt him from the Penalty of the Laws, how comes a Civil Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to exempt a Tyrant? But you ſay, <hi>Saul was a Tyrant, and worthy of death:</hi> What then? It does not follow, that becauſe he deſerved it, that <hi>David</hi> in the circumſtances he was then under, had power to put him to death without the People's Authority, or the command of the Magiſtracy. But was <hi>Saul</hi> a Tyrant? I wiſh you would ſay ſo; indeed you do ſo, though you had ſaid before in your <hi>Second Book,</hi> page 32. That <hi>he was no Tyrant, but a good King, and choſen of God.</hi> Why ſhould falſe Accuſers, and Men guilty of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery be branded, and you eſcape without the like ignominious Mark? For they practice their Villanies with leſs Treachery and Deceit than you write, and Treat of matters of the greateſt moment. <hi>Saul</hi> was a good King, when it ſerv'd your turn to have him ſo, and now he's a Tyrant, becauſe it ſuits with your preſent purpoſe. But 'tis no wonder that you make a Tyrant of a good King; for your Principles look
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96415:62"/>
as if they were invented for no other deſign, than to make all good Kings ſo. But yet <hi>David,</hi> tho he would not put to Death his Father-in-Law, for Cauſes and Reaſons that we have nothing to do withal, yet in his own Defence he raiſed an Army, took and poſſeſſed Cities that belong'd to <hi>Saul,</hi> and would have defended <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilah</hi> againſt the King's Forces, had he not underſtood that the Citizens would be falſe to him. Suppoſe <hi>Saul</hi> had beſieged the Town, and himſelf had been the firſt that had ſcal'd the Walls; do you think <hi>David</hi> would preſently have thrown down his Arms, and have betray'd all thoſe that aſſiſted him to his <hi>anointed</hi> Enemy? I believe not. What reaſon have we to think <hi>David</hi> would have ſtuck to do what we have done, who when his Occaſions and Circumſtances ſo required, proffered his Aſſiſtance to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who were then the profeſſed Enemies of his Country, and did that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Saul,</hi> which I am ſure we ſhould never have done againſt our Tyrant. I'm weary of mentioning your Lies, and aſham'd of them. You ſay, tis a Maxim of the <hi>Engliſh, That Enemies are rather to be ſpared than Friends;</hi> and that therefore <hi>we conceived we ought not to ſpare our King's Life, becauſe he had been our Friend.</hi> You impudent Lyar, what Mortal ever heard this Whimſy before you invented it? But we'll excuſe it. You could not bring in that thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare Flouriſh, of our being more fierce than our own Maſtiffs (which now comes in the fifth time, and will as oft again before we come to the end of your Book) without ſome ſuch Introduction. We are not ſo much more fierce than our own Maſtiffs, as you are more hungry than any Dog whaſoever, who return ſo greedily to what you have vomitted up ſo often. Then you tell us, That <hi>David</hi> commanded the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekite</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:96415:62"/>
to be put to Death, who pretended to have<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> killed <hi>Saul.</hi> But that Inſtance, neither in reſpect of the Fact, nor the Perſon, has any Affinity with what we are diſcourſing of. I do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what cauſe <hi>David</hi> had to be ſo ſevere up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that Man, for pretending to have haſtned the King's Death, and in effect but to have put him out of his pain, when he was dying; unleſs it were to take away from the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> all Suſpicion of his own having been inſtrumental in it, whom they might look upon as one that had revolted to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and was part of their Army. Juſt ſuch another Action as this of <hi>David</hi>'s, do all Men blame in <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> who put to Death <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> becauſe he had helped <hi>Nero</hi> to kill himſelf. After all this, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of your Impudence, you call him not only the <hi>anointed of the Lord,</hi> but <hi>the Lord's Chriſt,</hi> who a little before you had ſaid was a Tyrant, and acted by the impulſe of ſome Evil Spirit. Such mean thoughts you have of that Reverend Name, that you are not aſham'd to give it to a Tyrant, whom you your ſelf confess to have been poſſeſſed with the Devil. Now I come to that Preſident, from which every Man that is not blind muſt needs infer the Right of the People to be Superior to that of Kings. When <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was dead, the People Aſſembled themſelves at <hi>Sichem</hi> to make <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King. Thither himſelf went, as one that ſtood for the place, that he might not ſeem to claim the Succeſſion as his Inheritance; the ſame Right over a freeborn People, that every Man has over his Fathers Sheep and Oxen. The People propoſe Conditions, upon which they were willing to admit him to the Government. He deſires three days time to adviſe; he conſults with the old Men; they tell him no ſuch thing, as that he had an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96415:63"/>
abſolute Right to ſucceed, but perſuade him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the People, and ſpeak them fair, it being in their Power whether he ſhould Reign or not. Then he adviſeth with the young Men that were brought up-with him; they, as if <hi>Salmaſius</hi>'s Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy had taken them, thunder this Right of Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Ears; perſuade him to threaten the People with <hi>Whips</hi> and <hi>Scorpions:</hi> And he anſwered the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as they adviſed him. When all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw that the King hearkned not to them, then they openly proteſt the Right of the People, and their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; <hi>What portion have we in David? To thy tents, O Iſrael: now look to thine own houſe, David.</hi> When the King ſent <hi>Adoram</hi> to them, they ſtoned him with Stones, and perhaps they would not have ſtuck to have ſerv'd the King himſelf ſo, but he made haſte and got out of the way. The next News is of a great Army rais'd by <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to reduce the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to their Allegiance. God forbids him to proceed, <hi>Go not up,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to war againſt your brethren the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael; for this thing is of me.</hi> Now conſider; heretofore the People had deſired a King; God was diſpleaſed with them for it, but yet permitted them to make a King, according to that Right that all Nations have to appoint their own Governors. Now the People reject <hi>Rehoboam</hi> from ruling them; and this God not only ſuffers them to do, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to make War againſt them for it, and ſtops him in his undertaking; and teaches him withal, that thoſe that had Revolted from him, were not Rebels in ſo doing; but that he ought to look upon them as Brethren. Now recollect your ſelf: You ſay that all Kings are of God, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People ought not to reſiſt them, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch Tyrants. I anſwer you, The Convention
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96415:63"/>
of the People, their Votes, their Acts, are likewiſe of God; and that by the Teſtimony of God himſelf in this place; and conſequently according to your Argument, by the Authority of God himſelf, Princes ought not to reſiſt the People. For as certain as it is, that Kings are of God; and whatever Argument you may draw from thence to enforce a Subjection and Obedience to them: So certain is it, that free Aſſemblies of the Body of the People, are of God, and that naturally affords the ſame Argument for their Right of reſtraining Princes from going beyond their Bounds, and rejecting them if there be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor is their ſo doing a juſtifiable Cauſe of War, any more than the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s rejecting <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> was. You ask, why the People did not revolt from <hi>Solomon?</hi> Who but you would ask ſuch an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Queſtion? You ſee they did revolt from a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and were neither puniſhed, nor blam'd for it. It is true, <hi>Solomon</hi> fell into ſome Vices, but he was not therefore a Tyrant; he made amends for his Vices by many excellent Virtues that he was famous for, by many Benefits which accrued to the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> by his Government. But admit that he had been a Tyrant: Many times the Circumſtances of a Nation are ſuch, that the People will not, and many times ſuch, that they cannot depoſe a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. You ſee they did it when it was in their Power. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, Jeroboam's <hi>Act was ever had in Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation; 'twas looked upon as an unjuſt revolt from a lawful Prince; he and his Succſſors were accounted Rebels.</hi> I confeſs we find his Revolt from the true Worſhip of God often found fault with; but I no where find him blam'd for revolting from <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> and his Successors are frequently spoken of as wicked Princes, but not as Rebels. <hi>Acting contrary to Law and Right,</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:96415:64"/>
ſay you, <hi>cannot introduce, or eſtabliſh a Right:</hi> I pray, what becomes then of your Right of Kings? Thus do you perpetually baſtle your ſelf. You ſay, <hi>Adulteries, Murders, Thefts are daily committed with impunity.</hi> Are you not aware, that here you give an Anſwer to your own Queſtion, how it comes to paſs, that Tyrants do ſo often eſcape unpuniſhed? You ſay, <hi>Thoſe Kings were Rebels, and yet the Prophets do no where diſſwade the People from their Allegiance.</hi> And why do you, ye Raſcally falſe Prophet, endeavour to perſuade the People of <hi>England</hi> not to yield Obedience to their preſent Magiſtrates, tho in your Opinion they are Rebels. <hi>This</hi> Engliſh <hi>Faction of Robbers,</hi> ſay you, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for themſelves, that by ſome immediate Voice from Heaven, they were put upon their bloody Enterprize.</hi> It is notoriouſly evident, that you were diſtracted when you wrote theſe Lines; for as you have put the words together, they are neither Latin, nor Senſe. And that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pretend to any ſuch warrant, as a Juſtification of their Actions, is one of thoſe many Lies and Fictions that your Book is full of. But I proceed to urge you with Examples. <hi>Libna,</hi> a great City revolted from <hi>Jorom,</hi> becauſe he had forſaken God; 'twas the King therefore that was guilty, not the City, nor is the City blam'd for it. He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the reaſon that's given why that City rejected his Government, muſt conclude that the Holy Ghoſt rather approves of what they did, then condemns them for it. <hi>Theſe kind of revolts are no preſidents,</hi> ſay you. But why were you then ſo vain, as to promiſe in the beginning of this Chapter, that you would argu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from Examples, whereas all the Examples that you alledg, are mere Negatives, which prove nothing; and when we urge Examples that are ſolid and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, you ſay they are no Preſidents: Who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96415:64"/>
ſuch a way of Arguing? You challenged us at Preſidents; we produced them; and what do you do? You hang back, and get out of the way. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: <hi>Jebu</hi> at the Command of a Prophet, ſlew a King; nay, he ordered the Death of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> his own Liege Prince. If God would not have Tyrants put to Death by their own Subjects, if it were a wicked thing ſo to do, a thing of a bad Example; why did God himſelf command it? If he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, it was a lawful, commendable, and a praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Action. It was not therefore lawful to kill a Tyrant, becauſe God commanded it, but God commanded it, becauſe antecedently to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it was a juſtifiable, and a lawful Action. Again, <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Prieſt did not ſcruple to depoſe <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and kill her, tho ſhe had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years in actual Poſſeſſion of the Crown. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>ſhe took upon her the Government when ſhe had no Right to it.</hi> And did not you ſay your ſelf, but a while ago, <hi>That</hi> Tiberius <hi>aſſumed the Soveraignty when it belonged not at all to him.</hi> And yet you then affirm'd, that according to our Saviour's Doctrine, we ought to yield Obedience to ſuch Tyrants as he was; 'twere a moſt ridiculous thing to imagine, that a Prince, who gets in by Uſurpation, may lawfully be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but one that Rules tyrannically may not. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Athaliah</hi> could not poſſibly Reign according to the Law of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kingdom, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet over thee a King, ſays God Almighty; he does not ſay, Thou ſhalt ſet over thee a Queen.</hi> If this Argument have any weight, I may as well ſay, The Command of God was, that the People ſhould ſet over themſelves a King, not a Tyrant. So that I'm even with you. <hi>Amazias</hi> was a Slothful, Idolatrous Prince, and was put to Death, not by a few Conſpirators; but rather,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96415:65"/>
it ſhould ſeem, by the the Nobility, and by the Body of the People. For he fled from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had none to ſtand by him, and they purſued him to <hi>Lachiſh:</hi> They took Counſel againſt him, ſays the Hiſtory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had forſaken God: And we do not find that <hi>Azarias</hi> his Son proſecuted thoſe that had cut off his Father. You quote a great many frivolous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> to prove, that the Kings of the <hi>Jews</hi> were Superior to the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> You do not conſider <hi>Zedekia</hi>'s own words, <hi>Jerem. 38. The King is not he that can do any thing againſt you.</hi> So that this was the Princes own ſtile. Thus he confeſſed himſelf Inferior to the great Council of the Realm. <hi>Perhaps,</hi> ſay you, <hi>he meant that he durſt not deny them any thing for fear of Sedition.</hi> But what does your <hi>perhaps</hi> ſignify, whoſe moſt poſitive aſſerting any thing is not worth a Louſe? For nothing in Nature can be more Fickle and Inconſtant than you are. How oft have you appear'd in this Diſcourſe inconſiſtent with your ſelf; unſaying with one Breath what you had ſaid with another? Here, again, you make Compariſons betwixt King <hi>Charles,</hi> and ſome of the good Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> You ſpeak contemptibly of <hi>David,</hi> as if he were not worthy to come in Competition with him. <hi>Conſider</hi> David, ſay you, <hi>an Adulterer, a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; King</hi> Charles <hi>was guilty of no ſuch Crimes.</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <hi>his Son, who was accounted wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. Who can with Patience hear this filthy, raſcally Fool, ſpeak ſo irreverently of Perſons eminent both in Greatneſs and Piety? Dare you compare King <hi>David</hi> with King <hi>Charles;</hi> a moſt Religious King and Prophet, with a Superſtitious Prince, and who was but a Novice in the Chriſtian Religion; a moſt prudent, wiſe Prince with a weak one; a Valiant Prince with a Cowardly one; finally, a moſt juſt Prince with a moſt unjuſt

one? Have you the impudence to commend his Chaſtity and Sobriety, who is known to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all manner of Leudneſs in company with his Confident the Duke of <hi>Buckingham?</hi> It were to no purpoſe to enquire into the private Actions of his Life, who publickly at Plays would Embrace and Kiſs the Ladies laſciviouſly, and handle Virgins and Matrons Breaſts, not to mention the reſt? I adviſe you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you Counterfeit <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to abſtain from ſuch like Parallels, leſt I be forced to publiſh thoſe things concerning King <hi>Charles,</hi> which I am willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal. Hitherto we have entertain'd our ſelves with what the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> have acted or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Tyrants, and by what Right they did it in thoſe times, when God himſelf did immediately, as it were, by his Voice from Heaven govern their Commonwealth. The Ages that ſucceeded, do not afford us any Authority, as from themſelves, but confirm us in our Opinion by their imitating the Actions of their Fore-fathers. For after the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Captivity, when God did not give any new command concerning the Crown, tho the Royal Line was not extinct, we find the People returning to the old Moſaical Form of Government again. They were one while Tributaries to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> King of <hi>Syria;</hi> yet when he injoyn'd them things that were contrary to the Law of God, they reſiſted him, and his Deputies, under the Conduct of their Prieſts, the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and by force regain'd their former Liberty. After that, whoever was accounted moſt worthy of it, had the Principality conferr'd upon him. Till at laſt, <hi>Hircanus</hi> the Son of <hi>Simon,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Judah,</hi> the <hi>Maccabee,</hi> having ſpoiled <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Sepulchre, entertain'd foreign Soldiers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Inveſt the Prieſthood with a kind of Regal

Power. After whoſe time his Son <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> was the firſt that aſſum'd the Crown; he was a Tyrant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and yet the People ſtirred not againſt him, which is no great Wonder, for he reigned but one year. And he himſelf being overtaken with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Diſeaſe, and repenting of his own Cruelty and Wickedneſs, deſired nothing more than to dye, and had his wiſh. His Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> ſucceeded him; <hi>and againſt him,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the People raiſed no Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> tho he were a Tyrant too. And this lie might have gone down with us, if <hi>Joſepbus</hi>'s Hiſtory had not been extant.

Kings are to be prayed for. That good Kings are to be pray'd for, no Man denies; nay, and bad ones too, as long as there are any hopes of them; ſo we ought to pray for Highway-men, and for our Enemies. But how? Not that they may Plunder, Spoil and Murder us; but that they may repent. We pray both for Thieves and Enemies; and yet who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dreamt but that it was lawful to put the Laws in execution againſt one, and to fight againſt the other? I value not the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Liturgy that you quote; but the Prieſt that you mention, who prayed that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> might ſucceed his Father in the Empire, did not pray for any thing in my opinion, but Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the miſchiefs imaginable to the <hi>Roman</hi> State.

But what ſays he? he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns Tumults and Rebellions. So do we.

So then, if the matter be not wholly reſerved to Gods own Tribunal, but that men have ſomething to do in the caſe, why did not the Parliament of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> ſtand in the ſame relation to King <hi>Charles,</hi> that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did to <hi>Licinius?</hi> The Soldiers made <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> what he was. But our Laws have made our Parliaments equal, nay, ſuperior to our Kings. The Inhabitants of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> reſiſted <hi>Conſtantius</hi> an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Emperour, by force of Arms, as long as they were able; they oppoſed <hi>Hermogenes</hi> whom he had ſent with a Military power to depoſe <hi>Paul</hi> an Orthodox Biſhop; the houſe whither he had betaken himſelf for ſecurity, they fired about his ears, and at laſt kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him right out. <hi>Conſtans</hi> threatned to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Brother <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> unleſs he would reſtore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to their Biſhopricks. You ſee thoſe holy Fathers, when their Biſhopricks were in <note place="margin">☞</note> danger, were not aſhamed to ſtir up their Prince's own Brother to make War upon him. Not long after, the Chriſtian Soldiers, who then made whom they would Emperors, put to death <hi>Conſtans</hi> the Son of <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> becauſe he behaved himſelf diſſolutely and proudly in the Government, and Tranſlated the Empire to <hi>Magnentius.</hi> Nay, thoſe very perſons that ſaluted <hi>Julian</hi> by the name of Emperour, againſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his will, who was actually in poſſeſſion of the Empire, (for <hi>Julian</hi> was not then an Apoſtate, but a vertuous and valiant perſon) are they not amongſt the number of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe Example you propoſe to us for our imitation? which action of theirs, when <hi>Conſtantius</hi> by his Letters to the people very ſharply and earneſtly forbad, (which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were openly read to them) they all cried out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96415:69"/>
unanimouſly, That themſelves had but done what the Provincial Magiſtrates, the Army, and the Authority of the Commonwealth had decreed. The ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons declared War againſt <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and contributed as much as in them lay, to deprive him both of his Government and his Life. How did the Inhabitants of <hi>Antioch</hi> behave themſelves, who were none of the worſt ſort of Chriſtians? I'le warrant you they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Julian,</hi> after he became an Apoſtate, whom they uſed to rail at in his own preſence, and ſcoffing at his long Beard, bid him make Ropes of it: Upon the news of whoſe death they gave publick Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, made Feaſts, and gave other publick Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Joy; do you think they uſed when he was alive to pray for the continuance of his life and health? Nay, is it not reported, that a Chriſtian Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in his own Army was the Author of his Death? <hi>Sozomen,</hi> a Writer of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, does not deny it but commends him that did it, if the fact were ſo; <q>For it is no wonder, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that ſome of his own Soldiers might think within himſelf, that not only the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but all Mankind hitherto had agreed that it was a commendable action to kill a Tyrant; and that they deſerve all mens praiſe, who are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to die themſelves to procure the liberty of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo that that Soldier ought not raſhly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who in the cauſe of God and of Religion, was ſo zealous and valiant.</q> Theſe are the words of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> a good and Religious man of that age; by which we may eaſily apprehend what the general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of pious men in thoſe days was upon this point. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelf being commanded by the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Younger, to depart from <hi>Milan,</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to obey him, but defended himſelf and the Palace by force of Arms againſt the Emperour's Officers,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96415:70"/>
and took upon him contrary to his own Doctrine, <hi>to reſiſt the higher powers.</hi> There was a great ſedition rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt the Emperour <hi>Areadius,</hi> more than once, by reaſon of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Exile. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have ſhewn how the Primitive Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves towards Tyrants; how not only the Chriſtian Soldiers, and the people, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, themſelves have both made War upon them, and oppoſed them with force, and all this before St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time; for you your ſelf are pleaſed to go down no lower; and therefore I make no mention of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Son of <hi>Placidia,</hi> who was ſlain by <hi>Maximus</hi> a Senator, for committing Adultery with his Wife; nor do I mention <hi>Avitus</hi> the Emperour, whom, becauſe he disbanded the Soldiers, and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to a luxurious life, the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately depoſed; becauſe theſe things came to paſs ſome years after St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s death: But all this I give you: Suppoſe I had not mentioned the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians; ſuppoſe they never had ſtirred in oppoſition to Tyrants; ſuppoſe they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it unlawful ſo do; I will make it appear that they were not ſuch perſons, as that we ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Long before <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Christians had loſt much of the Primitive San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and integity both of their Doctrine and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Afterwards, when he had vaſtly enriched the Church, they began to fall in love with Honour and Civil Power and then the Chriſtian Religion went to wrack. Firſt Luxury and Sloth, and then a great drove of Herches and Immoralities broke looſe among them; and theſe begot Envy, Hatred and Diſcord; which abounded every where: At laſt, they that were linked together into one Brotherhood by that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96415:70"/>
holy band of Religion, were as much at variance and ſtrife amongſt themſelves, as the moſt bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the world could be: No reverence for, no conſideration of their duty was left amongſt them; the Soldiers and Commanders of the Army, as oft as they pleaſed themſelves, created new <hi>Emperors,</hi> and ſometimes killed good ones as well as bad. I need not mention ſuch as <hi>Verannio, Alaximus, Eugenius,</hi> whom the Soldiers all on a ſudden advanced and made them Emperors; nor <hi>Gratian,</hi> an excellent Prince; nor <hi>Valentinian</hi> the younger, who was none of the worſt, and yet were put to death by them. It is true, theſe things were acted by the Soldiers, and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the field; but thoſe Soldiers were Chriſtians, and lived in that Age which you call Evangelical, and whoſe example you propoſe to us for our imitation Now you ſhall hear how the Clergy managed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Paſtors and Biſhops, and ſometimes thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fathers whom we admire and extol to ſo high a degree, every one of whom was a Leader of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Flocks; thoſe very men, I ſay, fought for their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, as Tyrants did for their Soveraignty; ſometimes throughout the City, ſometimes in the very Churches, ſometimes at the Altar, Clergy-men and Lay-men fought promiſcuouſly; they ſlew one another, and great ſlaughters were made on both ſides. You may remember <hi>Damaſus</hi> and <hi>Vrſicinus,</hi> who were Contemporaries with <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> It would be too long to relate the Tumultuary Inſurrections of the Inhabitants of <hi>Conſtantinople, Antiach,</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> eſpecially thoſe under the Conduct and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> whom you extol as a Preacher up of Obedience; when the Monks in that fight within the City, had almoſt ſlain <hi>Oreſtes, Theodoſius</hi>'s Deputy. Now who can ſufficiently wonder at your Impudence,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96415:71"/>
or Careleſsneſs and Neglect. <q>
                  <hi>Till St.</hi> Auſtin's <hi>time,</hi> ſay you, <hi>and lower down than the age that he lived in, there is not any mention extant in Hiſtory, of any private perſon, of any Commander, or of any number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, that have put their Prince to death, or taken up Arms againſt him.</hi>
               </q> I have named to you out of known and approved Hiſtories, both private perſons and Magiſtrates, that with their own hands have ſlain not only bad, but very good Princes: Whole Armies of Chriſtians, many Biſhops amongſt them, that have fought againſt their own Emperors. You produce ſome of the Fathers, that with a great flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of words, perſuade or boaſt of Obedience to Princes: And I, on the other ſide, produce both thoſe ſame Fathers, and others beſides them, that by their actions, have declined Obedience to their Princes, even in lawful things, have defended themſelves with a Military Force againſt them; others that have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed forcibly, and wounded their Deputies; others that being Competitors for Biſhopricks, have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Civil Wars againſt one another: As if it were lawful for Chriſtians to wage War with Chriſtians for a Biſhoprick; and Citizens with Citizens; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to fight againſt a Tyrant, in defence of our Liberty, of our Wives and Children, and of our Lives themſelves. Who would own ſuch Fathers as theſe? You produce St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who you ſay, aſſerts that <hi>the Power of a Maſter over his Servants, and a Prince over his Subjects, is one and the ſame thing:</hi> But I anſwer; If St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſert any ſuch thing, he aſſerts what nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Saviour, nor any of his Apoſtles, ever aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; tho for the confirmation of that aſſertion, than which nothing can be more falſe, he pretends to rely wholly upon their Authority. The three or four laſt Pages of this Fourth Chapter, are ſtuffed with meer
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96415:71"/>
Lies, or things careleſsly and looſely put together, that are little to the purpoſe: And that every one that reads them, will diſcover by what has been ſaid already. For what concerns the Pope, againſt whom you declaim ſo loudly, I am content you ſhould bawl at him, till you are hoarſe. But whereas you endeavour to perſuade the ignorant, That <hi>all that called themſelves Chriſtians, yielded an entire obedience to Princes, whether good or bad, till the Papal Power grew to that height, that it was acknowledged ſuperior to that of the Civil Magiſtrate, and till he took upon him to abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance:</hi> I have ſufficiently proved by many Examples before and ſince the age that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> lived in, that nothing can be more falſe. Neither does that ſeem to have much more truth in it which you ſay in the laſt place; <hi>viz. That Pope</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary <hi>abſolved the</hi> French-men <hi>from their Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to their King.</hi> For <hi>Francis Hottoman,</hi> who was both a <hi>French-man</hi> and a Lawyer, and a very Learned man, in the <hi>13th</hi> Chapter of his <hi>Francogallia,</hi> denies that either <hi>Chilperic</hi> was depoſed, or the Kingdom tranſlated to <hi>Pepin,</hi> by the Pope's Authority; and he proves out of very Ancient Chronicles of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the whole affair was tranſacted in the great Council of the Kingdom, according to the Original Cenſtitution of that Government: Which being once done, the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtories, and Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> himſelf, deny that there was any neceſſity of abſolving his Subjects from their Allegiance. For not only <hi>Hotto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but <hi>Guicciard,</hi> a very eminent Hiſtorian of that Nation, informs us, That the Ancient Records of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> teſtifie, That the Subjects of that Nation, upon the firſt inſtitution of Kingſhip amongſt them, reſerved a power to themſelves, both of Chuſing their Princes, and of Depoſing them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96415:72"/>
again, if they thought fit: And that the Oath of Allegiance which they took, was upon this expreſs condition; <hi>to wit,</hi> That the King ſhould likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what at his Coronation he ſwore to do. So that if Kings by miſ-governing the people committed to their charge, firſt broke their own Oath to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, there needs no Pope to diſpenſe with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Oaths; the Kings themſelves by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs having abſolved their Subjects: And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> himſelf in a Letter of his to the <hi>French,</hi> which you your ſelf quote, renounces, and aſcribes to the people, that Authority which you ſay he aſſumes to himſelf: <q> For if a Prince be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the People, being beholden to them for his Royalty; if the people, ſince they make Kings, have the ſame Right to depoſe them,</q> as the very words of that Pope are, it is not likely that the <hi>French</hi> men would by any Oath depart in the leaſt from that Ancient Right, or ever tye up their own hands, ſo as not to have the ſame Right that their Anceſtors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had to depoſe bad Princes, as well as to honour and obey good ones; nor is it likely that they thought themſelves obliged to yield that Obedience to Tyrants, which they ſwore to yield only to good Princes. A people obliged to Obedience by ſuch an Oath, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of that obligation, when a Lawful Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Tyrant, or gives himſelf over to Sloth and Veluptuouſneſs; the rule of Juſtice, the very Law of Nature diſpenſeth with ſuch a people's Allegiance. So that even by the Pope's own opinion, the people were under no obligation to yield Obedience to <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peric,</hi> and conſequently had no need of a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V.</head>
            <p>THO I am of opinion, <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> and always was, That the Law of God does exactly agree with the Law of Nature; ſo that having ſhown what the Law of God is, with reſpect to Princes, and what the practice has been of the people of God, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I have at the ſame time, and by the ſame Diſcourſe, made to appear what is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Law of Nature; yet becauſe you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>to confute us moſt powerfully by the Law of Nature,</hi> I will be content to admit that to be neceſſary, which before I had thought would be ſuperfluous; that in this Chapter I may demonſtrate, That nothing is more ſuitable to the Law of Nature, than that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be inflicted upon Tyrants. Which if I do not evince, I will then agree with you, that likewiſe by the Law of God they are exempt. I do not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to frame a long Diſcourſe of Nature in general, and the original of Civil Societies; that Argument has been largely handled by many Learned men, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> but I ſhall endeavour to be as ſhort as may be; and my deſign is not ſo much to confute you my ſelf, who would willingly have ſpared this pains; as to ſhow that you confute your ſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your own Poſitions. I'll begin with that firſt Poſition which you lay down as a Fundamental, and that ſhall be the Groundwork of my enſuing Diſcourſe. <hi>The Law of Nature,</hi> say you, <hi>is a Principle imprinted on all mens minds, to regard the good of all mankind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering men as united together in Societies. But this innate Principle cannot procure that common good, unleſs, as there are people that muſt be governed, ſo that very Principle
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96415:73"/>
aſcertain who ſhall govern them.</hi> To wit, leſt the ſtronger oppreſs the weaker, and thoſe perſons, who for their mutual Safety and Protection have united themſelves together, ſhould be diſunited and divided by Injury and Violence, and reduced to a beſtial ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage life again. This I ſuppoſe is what you mean. <hi>Out of the number of thoſe that united into one body,</hi> you ſay, <hi>there muſt needs have been ſame choſen, who excelled the reſt in Wiſdom and Valour; that they either by force, or by perſuaſion, might reſtrain thoſe that were refractory, and keep them within due bounds; ſometimes it would ſo fall out that one ſingle Perſon, whoſe Conduct and Valour was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, might be able to do this, and ſometimes more aſſiſted one another with their Advice and Counſel. But ſince it is impoſſible that any one manſhould order all things himſelf, there was a neceſſity of his conſulting with others, and taking ſome into part of the Government with himſelf. So that whether a ſingle perſon reign, or whether the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power reſide in the body of the People, ſince it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that all ſhould adminiſter the affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or that one man ſhould do all, the Government does always lye upon the ſhoulders of many.</hi> And afterwards you ſay, <hi>Both Forms of Government, whether by many or a few, or by a ſingle perſon, are equally according to the Law of Nature; for both proceed from the ſame Principle of Nature,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is impoſſible for any ſingle perſon ſo to govern alone, as not to admit others into a ſhare of the Government with himſelf.</hi> Tho I might have taken all this out of the Third Book of <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Politicks, I chose rather to tranſcribe it out of your own Book; for you ſtole it from him, as <hi>Prometheus</hi> did Fire from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to the ruin of Monarchy, and overthrow of your ſelf, and your own opinion. For enquire as diligently as you can for your life, into the Law of Nature, as you have deſcribed it, you will not find
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96415:73"/>
the leaſt footſtep in it of Kingly Power, as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it. <hi>The Law of Nature,</hi> ſay you, <hi>in ordering who ſhould govern others, reſpected the univerſal good of all mankind.</hi> It did not then regard the private good of any particular perſon, not of a Prince; ſo that the King is for the People, and conſequently the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuperior to him; which being allowed, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that Princes ſhould have any right to oppreſs or enſlave the people; that the inferior ſhould have right to tyrannize over the ſuperior. So that ſince Kings cannot pretend to any right to do miſchief, the right of the people muſt be acknowledged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Nature to be ſuperior to that of Princes; ſo that by the ſame right, that before King hip was known, men united their Strength and Counſels for their mutual Safety and Defence, by the ſame right, that for the preſervation of all mens Liberty, Peace, and Safety, they appointed one or more to govern the reſt; by the ſame right they may depoſe thoſe very perſons, whom for their Valour or Wiſdom they advanced to the Government, or any others that rule diſorderly, if they find them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſlothfulneſs, folly, or impiety, unfit for Government; ſince Nature does not regard the good of one, or of a few, but of all in general. For what ſort of perſons were they whom you ſuppoſe to have been choſen? You ſay <hi>they were ſuch as excelled in Courage and Conduct;</hi> to wit, ſuch as by Nature ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fitteſt for Government; who by reaſon of their excellent Wiſdom and Valour, were enabled to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo great a Charge. The conſequence of this I take to be, That right of Succeſſion is not by the Law of Nature; that no man by the Law of Nature has right to be King, unleſs he excel all others in Wiſdom and Courage; that all ſuch as Reign, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96415:74"/>
want theſe qualifications, are advanced to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Force or Faction; have no right by the Law of Nature to be what they are, but ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Slaves than Princes. For Nature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points that Wiſe men ſhould govern Fools, not that Wicked men ſhould rule over Good men; Fools over wiſe men: And conſequently, they that take the Government out of ſuch mens hands, act according to the Law of Nature. To what end Nature directs Wiſe men ſhould bear the Rule, you ſhall hear in your own words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That by Force or by Perſuaſion, they may keep ſuch as are unruly, within due bounds.</hi> 
               </q> But how ſhould he keep others within the bounds of their duty, that neglects, or is ignorant of, or wilfully acts contrary to his own? Alledg now, if you can, any dictate of Nature, by which we are enjoyned to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the Wiſe Inſtitutions of the Law of Nature, and have no regard to them in Civil and Publick Concerns, when we ſee what great and admirable things Nature her ſelf effects in things that are inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and void of ſenſe, rather than loſe her end. Produce any Rule of Nature, or Natural Juſtice, by which inferior Criminals ought to be puniſhed, but Kings and Princes to go unpuniſhed; and not only ſo, but tho guilty of the greateſt Crimes imaginable, be had in Reverence, and almoſt adored. You agree, That <hi>all Forms of Government, whether by many, or a few, or by a ſingle perſon, are equally agreeable to the Law of Nature.</hi> So that the perſon of a King is not by the Law of Nature more sacred than a Senate of Nobles, or Magiſtrates, choſen from amongſt the common people, who you grant may be puniſhed, and ought to be, if they offend; and conſequently, Kings ought to be ſo too, who are appointed to rule for the very ſame end and purpoſe that other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96415:74"/>
are. <hi>For,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Nature does not allow any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon to bear rule ſo entirely, as not to have Partners in the Government.</hi> It does not therefore allow of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; it does not allow one ſingle perſon to rule ſo, as that all others ſhould be in a ſlaviſh ſubjection to his Commands only. You that give Princes ſuch Partners in the Government, <hi>as in whom,</hi> to uſe your own words, <hi>the Government always reſides,</hi> do at the ſame time make others Colleagues with them, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to them; nay, and conſequently you ſettle a power in thoſe Colleagues of puniſhing, and of depoſing them. So that while you your ſelf go about, not to extol a Kingly Government, but to eſtabliſh it by the Law of Nature, you deſtroy it; no greater misfortune could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall Soveraign Princes, than to have ſuch an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as you are. Poor, unhappy wretch! what blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind has ſeiz'd you, that you ſhould unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly take ſo much pains to diſcover your Knavery and folly, and make it viſible to the world, which before you conceal'd, in ſome meaſure and diſguis'd; that you ſhould be ſo induſtrious to heap diſgrace and ignominy upon your ſelf. What offence does Heaven puniſh you for, in making you appear in publick, and undertake the defence of a deſperate Cauſe, with ſo much impudence and childiſhneſs, and inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it, to betray it by your ignorance? What enemy of yours would deſire to ſee you in a more forlorn, deſpicable condition than you are, who have no refuge left from the depth of miſery, but in your own imprudence and want of ſenſe, ſince by your unskilful and ſilly defence, you have rendred Tyrants the more odious and deteſtable, by aſcribing to them an unbounded liberty of doing miſchief with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity; and conſequently have created them more enemies than they had before? But I return to your
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96415:75"/>
Contradictions. When you had reſolved with your ſelf to be ſo wicked as to endeavour to find out a foundation for Tyranny in the Law of Nature, you ſaw a neceſſity of extolling a Monarchy above other ſorts of Government; which you cannot go about to do, without doing as you uſe to do, that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting your ſelf. For having ſaid but a little before, <hi>That all forms of Government, whether by more or fewer, or by a ſingle perſon, are equally according to the Law of Nature,</hi> now you tell us, <hi>that of all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe ſorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That of a ſingle perſon is moſt natural.</hi> Nay, though you had ſaid in expreſs terms but lately, <hi>That the Law of Nature does not allow that any Government ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide entirely in one man.</hi> Now upbraid whom you will with the putting of Tyrants to death; ſince you your ſelf by your own folly, have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut the Throats of all Monarchs, nay even of Monarchy it ſelf. But it is not to the purpoſe for us here to diſpute which form of Government is beſt, by one ſingle perſon, or by many. I confeſs many eminent and famous men have extolled a Monarchy; but it has always been upon this ſuppoſition, that the Prince were a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon, and one that of all others deſerved beſt to reign, without which Suppoſition, no form of Government can be ſo prone to Tyranny as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is. And whereas you reſemble a Monarchy to the Government of the World, by one Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I pray anſwer me, Whether you think that any other can deſerve to be inveſted with a power here on earth, that shall reſemble his power that Governs the World, than ſuch a perſon as doth infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all other men, and both for Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in some meaſure reſemble the Deity? and ſuch a perſon in my opinion, none can be but the Son of God himſelf.

to be a kind of a Family, and make a compariſon betwixt a Prince and a Maſter of a Family; obſerve how lame the Parallel is.

But is it not obvious to all men that nothing can be more contrary to natural reaſon than that any one man ſhould be preſerved and defended to the utter ruin and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all others? But yet (you ſay) <hi>it is better to keep and defend a bad Prince, nay one of the worſt that ever was, than to change him for another; becauſe his ill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot do the Commonwealth ſo much harm as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances will occaſion, which muſt of neceſſity be raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people can get rid of him.</hi> But what is this to the right of Kings by the Law of Nature? If nature tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth me rather to ſuffer my ſelf to be robbed by High-way men rather; if I ſhould be taken captive by ſuch, to purchaſe my Liberty with all my Eſtate, than to fight with them for my life, can you infer from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> that they have a natural right to rob and ſpoil me? Nature teacheth men to give way ſometimes to the violence and outrages of Tyrants, the neceſſity of affairs ſometimes enforceth a Toleration with their enormities; what foundation can you find in this forced patience of a Nation, in this compulſory ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to build a right upon, for Princes to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize by the Law of Nature? that right which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given the people for their own preſervation, can you affirm that ſhe has inveſted Tyrants with for the people's ruin and deſtruction? Nature teacheth us, of two evils to chuſe the leaſt; and to bear with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96415:76"/>
as long as there is a neceſſity of ſo doing; and will you infer from hence, that Tyrants have ſome right by the Law of Nature to oppreſs their Subjects, and go unpuniſhed, becauſe as circumſtances may fall out, it may ſometimes be a leſs miſchief to bear with them than to remove them? Remember what your ſelf once wrote concerning Biſhops againſt a Jeſuit; you were then of another opinion than you are now: I have quoted your words formerly; you there affirm <hi>that ſeditious Civil diſſentions and diſcords of the Nobles and Common people againſt and amongſt one another, are much more tolerable, and leſs miſchievous than certain mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and deſtruction under the Government of a ſingle perſon, that plays the Tyrant.</hi> And you ſaid very true. For you had not then run mad; you had not then been bribed with <hi>Charles</hi> his <hi>Jacobuſſes.</hi> You had not got the <hi>King's-Evil.</hi> I ſhould tell you perhaps, if I did not know you, that you might be aſhamed thus to prevaricate. But you can ſooner burſt than bluſh, who have caſt off all ſhame for a little profit. Did you not remember, that the Commonwealth of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> flouriſhed and became glorious when they had baniſhed their Kings? Could you poſſibly forget that of the <hi>Low-Countries?</hi> which after it had ſhook off the yoke of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> after long and tedious Wars, but Crown'd with ſucceſs, obtained its Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and feeds ſuch a pitiful Grammarian as your ſelf with a Penſion; not that their youth might be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated by your Sophiſtry as to chuſe rather to return to their former Slavery than inherit the Glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which their Anceſtors purchaſed for them. May thoſe pernicious principles of yours be baniſhed with your ſelf into the moſt remote and barbarous corners of the World. And laſt of all, the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> might have afforded you an example, in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96415:77"/>
which <hi>Charles,</hi> who had been their King, after he had been taken captive in War, and was found incurable, was put to death. But <hi>they have defaced and impoveriſhed the Iſland with Civil broils and diſcords, which under its Kings was happy, and ſwam in Luxury.</hi> Yea, when it was almoſt buried in Luxury and Voluptuouſneſs, and the more inured thereto, that it might be enthralled the more eaſily; when its Laws were aboliſhed, and its Religion agreed to be ſold, they delivered it from Slavery. You are like him that publiſhed <hi>Simplicius</hi> in the ſame Volume with <hi>Epictetus,</hi> a very grave Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, <hi>Who call an Iſland happy, becauſe it ſwims in Luxury.</hi> I'm ſure no ſuch Doctrine ever came out of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s School. But why ſhould not you, who would give Kings a power of doing what they liſt, have liberty your ſelf to broach what new Philoſophy you pleaſe? Now begin again to act your part. <hi>There never was in any King's Reign ſo much blood ſpilt, ſo many Families ruined.</hi> All this is to be imputed to <hi>Charles,</hi> not to us, who firſt raiſed an Army of <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> againſt us; who by his own Warrant Authorized the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation to conſpire againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> who by their means slew Two hundred Thouſand of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects in the Province of <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What Principles, what Law, what Religion ever taught men rather to conſult their eaſe, to ſave their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, their blood, nay their lives themſelves, than to oppoſe an enemy with force? for I make no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96415:77"/>
difference betwixt a Foreign Enemy, and another, ſince both are equally dangerous and deſtructive to the good of the whole Nation. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw very well, that they could not poſſibly puniſh the <hi>Benjamites</hi> forSpan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Did they therefore ſuffer the Death of one poor Woman to be unrevenged? Certainly if Nature teacheth us rather to endure the Government of a King, though he be never ſo bad, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the lives of a great many Men in the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our Liberty; it muſt teach us likewiſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to endure a Kingly Government, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one that you argue ought to be ſubmitted to, but an Ariſtocracy and a Democracy: Nay, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will perſuade us, to ſubmit to a Multitude of Highway-men, and to Slaves that Mutiny. <hi>Fulvius</hi> and <hi>Rupilius,</hi> if your Principles had been received in their days, muſt not have engaged in the Servile War (as their Writers call it) after the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Armies were Slain: <hi>Craſſus</hi> muſt not have Marched againſt <hi>Spartacus,</hi> after the Rebels had deſtroyed one <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and ſpoil'd their Tents: Nor muſt <hi>

Then you tell us, that a Kingly Government appears to be more according to the Laws of Nature, becauſe <hi>more Nations, both in our days and of old, have ſubmitted to that Form of Government, than ever did to any other.</hi> I anſwer, If that be ſo, it was neither the effect of any Dictate of the Law of Nature, nor was it in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any Command from God. God would not ſuffer his own People to be under a King; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at laſt, but unwillingly; what Nature and right Reaſon dictates, we are not to gather from the practice of moſt Nations, but of the wiſeſt and moſt prudent. The <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> with many other, have of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, out of choice, preferr'd a Commonwealth to a Kingly Government; and theſe Nations that I have named, are better inſtances than all the reſt. Hence <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> ſays, That <q>the very Name of a King was always very odious among freeborn People.</q> But theſe things concern not our preſent purpoſe, nor many other Impertinences that follow over and over again. I'll make haſte to prove, that by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which I have proved already by Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is very agreeable to the Law of Nature, that Tyrants ſhould be puniſhed; and that all Nations by the inſtinct of Nature, have puniſhed them; which will expoſe your Impudence, and make it evident, that you take a liberty to publiſh palpable down-right lies. You begin with the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and indeed,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96415:78"/>
who does not ſee, that you play the Gipſy your ſelf throughout? <hi>Amongſt them,</hi> ſay you, <hi>there is no mention extant of any King, that was ever ſlain by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a Popular Inſurrection, no War made upon any of their Kings by their Subjects, no attempt made to depoſe any of them.</hi> What think you then of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was the firſt King that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ever had? Was not he ſlain by his Brother <hi>Typhon,</hi> and five and twenty other Conſpirators? And did not a great part of the Body of the People ſide with them, and fight a Battel with <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Orus,</hi> the late King's Wife and Son? I paſs by <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> whom his Brother had well-nigh put to Death, and <hi>Chemmis,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrenes,</hi> againſt whom the People were deſervedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; and becauſe they could not do it while they were alive, they threatned to tear them in pieces af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were dead. Do you think that a People that durſt lay violent hands upon good Kings, had any reſtraint upon them, either by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Religion, from putting bad ones to Death? Could they that threatened to pull the dead Bodies of their Princes out of their Graves, when they ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do miſchief, tho by the Cuſtom of their own Country, the Corps of the meaneſt Perſon was ſacred and inviolable, abſtain from inflicting Puniſhment upon them in their Life-time, when they were acting all their Villanies, if they had been able; and that upon ſome Maxim of the Law of Nature? I know you would not ſtick to anſwer me in the Affirmative, how abſurd ſoever it be; but that you may not offer at it, I'll pull out your Tongue. Know then, that ſome Ages before <hi>Cephrene</hi> s time, one <hi>Ammoſis</hi> was King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was as great a Tyrant, as who has been the greateſt; him the People bore with.

The Laws of thoſe Countries were not entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Laws of their Kings, but the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> which Laws were irrevocable, and the Kings themſelves were bound by them: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> tho he earneſtly deſired to have delivered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the hands of the Princes, yet could not effect it. <hi>Thoſe Nations,</hi> ſay you, <hi>thought it no ſufficient pretence to reject a Prince, becauſe he abuſed the Right which was inherent in him as he was Sovereign.</hi> But in the very writing of theſe words you are ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, as that with the ſame breath that you commend the Obedience and Submiſſiveneſs of thoſe Nations, of your own accord you make mention of <hi>Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'r being deprived of his Crown by <hi>Arbaces.</hi> Neither was it he alone that accompliſhed that Enterprise, for he had the aſſiſtance of the Prieſts, (who of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were beſt verſed in the Law), and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and it was wholly upon this account that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

Cambyſes</hi> being deſirous to marry his Siſter, conſulted with the Judges, who were the Interpreters of the Laws, to whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all difficult matters were to be referred. What anſwer had he from them? They told him, They knew no Law which permitted a Brother to marry his Siſter; but another Law they knew, that the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> might do what they liſted. Now to this I anſwer, if the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> were really ſo abſolute, what need was there of any other to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Laws, beſides the King himſelf? Thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, unneceſſary Judges would have had their abode and reſidence in any other place rather than in the Palace, where they were altogether uſeleſs.

               </gap>in if thoſe Kings might do what ever they would, it is not credible that ſo ambitious a Prince as <hi>Cambyſes</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:96415:81"/>
was, ſhould be ſo ignorant of that grand Prerogative, as to conſult with the Judges, whether what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired were according to Law. What was the matter then? either they deſigned to humour the King, as you ſay they did, or they were afraid to croſs his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, which is the account that <hi>Herodotus</hi> gives of it; and ſo told him of ſuch a Law, as they knew would pleaſe him, and in plain terms made a fool of him; which is no new thing with Judges and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers now a days. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, Artabanus <hi>a</hi> Perſian <hi>told</hi> Themiſtocles, <hi>that there was no better Law in</hi> Perſia, <hi>than that by which it was Enacted, That Kings were to be honoured and adored.</hi> An excellent Law that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt which commanded ſubjects to <hi>adore</hi> their Princes! but the Primitive Fathers have long ago damned it; and <hi>Artabanus</hi> was a proper perſon to commend ſuch a Law, who was the very man that a little while after ſlew <hi>Xerxes</hi> with his own hand. You quote Regicides to aſſert Royalty. I am afraid you have ſome deſign upon Kings. In the next place you quote the Poet <hi>Claudian,</hi> to prove how obedient the <hi>Perſians</hi> were. But I appeal to their Hiſtories and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which are full of the Revolts of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Medes,</hi> the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and give us frequent inſtances of the Murders of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The next perſon whoſe authority you cite, is <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> who likewiſe killed <hi>Smerdis</hi> then King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to whom, out of the hatred which he bore to a Kingly Government, he reckons up the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and injurious actions of Kings, their violation of all Laws, their putting men to death without a legal conviction, their rapes and adulteries; and all this you will have called the right of Kings, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Samuel</hi> again as a teacher of ſuch Doctrine. You quote <hi>Homer,</hi> who ſays that Kings derive their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96415:81"/>
authority from <hi>Jupiter;</hi> to which I have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an anſwer. For King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whoſe aſſerting the right of Kings, you make uſe of: I'le believe <hi>Charles</hi> his deſcription of it, as ſoon as his. Then you quote ſome Sentences out of a fragment of <hi>Diogenes</hi> a <hi>Pythagorean;</hi> but you do not tell us what ſort of a King he ſpeaks of. Obſerve therefore how he begins that Diſcourſe; for whatever follows muſt be underſtood to have relation to it. <q>Let him be King, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that of all others is moſt juſt, and ſo he is that acts moſt according to Law; for no man can be King that is not juſt; and without Laws there can be no Juſtice. </q>This is directly oppoſite to that Regal right of yours. And <hi>Ecphantas,</hi> whom you likewiſe quote, is of the ſame opinion: <q>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever takes upon him to be a King, ought to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moſt pure and clear from all imputation:</q> And a little after, <q>Him, <hi>ſays he,</hi> we call a King, that governs well, and he only is properly ſo. </q>So that ſuch a King as you ſpeak of, according to the Philoſophy of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> is no King at all. Hear now what <hi>Plato</hi> ſays in his <hi>eighth Epiſtle:</hi> 
               <q>Let Kings, <hi>ſays he,</hi> be liable to be called to account for what they do: Let the Laws controul not only the people, but Kings themſelves, if they do any thing not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Law.</q> I'le mention what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays in the <hi>Third Book of his Politicks;</hi> 
               <q>It is neither for the Publick Good, nor is it juſt, <hi>ſays he,</hi> where all men are by nature alike and equal, that any one ſhould be Lord and Maſter over all the reſt, neither where there are no Laws; nor is it for the Publick Good, or Juſt, that one man ſhould be a Law to the reſt; nor is it ſo where there are Laws; nor that any one, tho a good man, thould be Lord over other good

The Fifty Daughters of <hi>Danaus</hi> being banished out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> became Suppliants to the King of the <hi>Argives;</hi> they begg'd of him, that he would protect them from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who purſued them with a Fleet of Ships.

mouths of a few Women that were Strangers and Suppliants, tho the King himſelf, and the Hiſtory be quite contrary?

That the Ancient Government of <hi>Rome</hi> was by their Laws, tho the Name and Form of it was Regal;</q> which form of Government, when it grew into a Tyranny, you know they put down and changed. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Oration againſt <hi>Piſo,</hi> 
               <q>Shall I, <hi>ſays he,</hi> account him a Conſul, who would not allow the Senate to have any Authority in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Shall I take notice of any man as Conſul, if at the ſame there be no ſuch thing as a Senate; when of old, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledged not their Kings, if they acted without or in oppoſition to the Senate?</q> Do you hear; the very Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at <hi>Rome</hi> ſignified nothing without the Senate. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Romulus governed as he liſted;</hi> and for that you quote <hi>Tacitus.</hi> No wonder: The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not then eſtabliſhed by Law; they were a confus'd multitude of ſtrangers more like, than a State; and all mankind lived without Laws, before Governments were ſetled. But when <hi>Romulus</hi> was dead, tho all the people were deſirous of a King, not having yet experienced the ſweetneſs of Liberty, yet, as <hi>Livy</hi> informs us, <q>The Soveraign Power reſided in the People; ſo that they parted not with more Right than they retained:</q> The ſame Author tells us, <q>That that ſame Power was afterwards extorted from them by their Emperours.</q> 
               <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> at firſt reigned by fraud, and as it were a Deputy to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius Priſcus;</hi> but afterward he referred it to the people, Whether they would have him reign or no? At laſt, ſays <hi>Tacitus,</hi> he became the Author of ſuch Laws as the Kings were obliged to obey. Do you think he would have done ſuch an injury to himſelf and his Poſterity, if he had been of opinion that the Right of Kings had been above all Laws? Their laſt King, <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> was the firſt that put an
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96415:84"/>
end to that cuſtom of conſulting the Senate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Publick Affairs; for which very thing, and other enormities of his, the people depoſed him and baniſhed him and his Family. Theſe things I have out of <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> than whom you will hardly produce any better Expoſitors of the Right of Kings among the <hi>Romans.</hi> As for the Dictatorſhip, that was but Temporary, and was never made uſe of, but in great extremities, and was not to continue longer than six months. But that thing which you call the Right of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, was no Right, but a plain downright Force; and was gained by War only. <hi>But Tacitus,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that lived under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a ſingle perſon, writes thus; The Gods have committed the Sovereign Power in human Affairs to Princes only, and have left to Subjects the honour of being obedient.</hi> But you tell us not where <hi>Tacitus</hi> has theſe words; for you were conſcious to your ſelf, that you impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon your Readers in quoting them; which I presently ſmelt out, tho I could not find the place of a sudden: For that Expreſſion is not <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s own, who is an approved Writer, and of all others the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If you would have read <hi>Tacitus</hi> himſelf, and not have tranſcribed ſome looſe Quotations out of him by other Authors, he would have taught you whence that Imperial Right had its Original. <q>After the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſia, ſays he,</hi> the whole ſtate of our Affairs was turned upſide down; nothing of the ancient integrity of our Forefathers was left amongſt us; all men ſhook off that former equality which had been obſerved, and began to have a reverence for the Mandates of Princes.</q> This you might have learned out of the <hi>Third</hi> Book of his <hi>Annals,</hi> whence you have all your Regal Right: <q>When that ancient equality was laid aſide, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof Ambition and Violence took place, Tyrannical Forms of Government ſtarted up, and fixed themſelves in many Countries.</q> This ſame thing you might have learned out of <hi>Dio,</hi> if your natural Levity and Unſetledneſs of Judgment would have ſuffered you to apprehend any thing that's ſolid.

               <hi>Pliny</hi> tells <hi>Trajan</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> when the Power of the Emperors was grown to its height: <q>A Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, and an Abſolute Sovereignty are quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things. <hi>Trajan</hi> puts down whatever looks like a Ringdom; he rules like a Prince, that there may be no room for a Magiſterial Power. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, Whatever I have ſaid of other Princes, I ſaid that I might ſhow how our Prince reforms and corrects the Manners of Princes, which by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom have been corrupted and depraved.</q> Are not you aſhamed to call that the Right of Kings, that <hi>Pliny</hi> calls the corrupt and depraved Cuſtoms of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? But let this ſuffice to have been ſaid in ſhort of the Right of Kings, as it was taken at <hi>Rome.</hi> How they dealt with their Tyrants, whether Kings or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, is generally known. They expelled <hi>Tarquin. But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>How did they expel him? Did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt him judicially? No ſuch matter: When he would have come into the City, they ſhut the gates againſt him.</hi> Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Fool! What could they do but ſhut the gates, when he was haſtning to them with part of the Army? And what great difference will there be, whether they baniſhed him, or put him to death, ſo they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him one way or other? The beſt men of that age kill'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Tyrant in the very Senate. Which action of theirs, <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> who was himſelf a very excellent man, and publickly call'd the Father of his Countrey, both elſewhere and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in his ſecond <hi>Philippick,</hi> extols wonderfully. I'll repeat ſome of his words, <q>All good Men kill'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as far as in them lay. Some Men could not adviſe in it, others wanted Courage to act in it, others wanted an Opportunity, all had a good will to it. And afterwards, What greater and more glorious Action (ye holy gods!) ever was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

not in this City only, but in any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? what Action more worthy to be recommended to everlaſting memory? I am not unwilling to be included within the number of thoſe that adviſed it, as within the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe.</q> The paſſage of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> may relate both to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> 
               <q>There cannot be a greater, nor more acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered up to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> than a wicked Prince.</q> For if you conſider <hi>Hercules,</hi> whoſe words theſe are, They ſhew what the Opinion was of the principal Men amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> in that Age; If the Poet, who flouriſhed under <hi>Nero</hi> (and the moſt worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Plays generally expreſs the Poet's own Senſe) then this paſſage ſhows us what <hi>Seneca</hi> himſelf and all good Men, even in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, thought was fit to be done to a Tyrant; and how vertuous an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how acceptable to God they thought it to kill one.

               <q>Had we forgotten the avenging <hi>Nero</hi>'s Death? Was it likely that he would ſuffer his Life and Actions to be ill ſpoken of, whoſe Death he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged?</q>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:96415:86"/>
He ſeems to have thought it almoſt a Crime not to kill <hi>Nero,</hi> that counts it ſo great a one to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him that did it. By what has been ſaid, it is evident, that the beſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> did not only kill Tyrants, as oft as they could, and howſoever they could; but that they thought it a commendable, and a praiſe-worthy Action ſo to do, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> had done before them. For when they could not proceed judicially againſt a Tyrant in his life-time, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior to him in Strength and Power, yet after his Death they did it, and condemn'd him by the <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Law. For <hi>Valerius Publicola, Junius Brutus</hi> his Colleague, when he ſaw, that Tyrants being guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Soldiers, could not be brought to a legal Tryal, he deviſed a Law to make it lawful to kill them any way, tho uncondemn'd, and that they that did it, ſhould afterwards give an account of their ſo doing. Hence, when <hi>Caſſius</hi> had actually run <hi>Caligula</hi> through with a Sword, tho every Body elſe had done it in their hearts, <hi>Valerius Aſiaticus,</hi> one that had been Conſul, being preſent at the time, cried out to the Soldiers, that began to Mutiny becauſe of his Death, <hi>I wiſh I my ſelf had kill'd him.</hi> And the Senate at the ſame time was ſo far from being diſpleaſed with <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> for what he had done, that they reſolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the Memory of the Emperors, and to raze the Temples that had been erected in Honour of them. When <hi>Claudius</hi> was preſently ſaluted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by the Soldiers, they forbad him by the Tribune of the People to take the Government upon him; but the Power of the Soldiers prevailed. The Senate declared <hi>Nero</hi> an Enemy, and made enquiry after him, to have puniſhed him according to the Law of their Anceſtors; which required, that he ſhould be ſtript naked, and hung by the Neck upon a forked Stake,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96415:87"/>
and whipt to Death. Conſider now, how much more mildly and moderately the <hi>Engliſh</hi> dealt with their Tyrant, tho many are of Opinion, that he cauſed the ſpilling of more Blood than ever <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf did. So the Senate condemn'd <hi>Domitian</hi> after his Death; they commanded his Statues to be pull'd down and daſh'd in pieces, which was all they could do. When <hi>Commodus</hi> was ſlain by his own Officers, neither the Senate, nor the People puniſht the Fact, but declared him an Enemy, and enquired for his dead Corps to have made it an Example. An Act of the Senate made upon that occaſion is extant in <hi>Lampridius:</hi> 
               <q>Let the Enemy of his Country be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of all his Titles; let the Parricide be drawn, let him be torn in pieces in the <hi>Spoliary,</hi> let the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of the gods, the Executioner of the Senate be drag'd with a Hake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> The ſame Perſons in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full Senate condemn'd <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> to Death, and ſent a Tribune to ſlay him in the Palace. The ſame Senate depoſed <hi>Maximinus,</hi> and declared him an Enemy. Let us hear the words of the Decree of the Senate concerning him, as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> relates it, <q>The Conſul put the queſtion, Conſcript Fathers, what is your pleaſure concerning the <hi>Maximines?</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>They anſwered,</hi> 
               <q>They are Enemies, they are Enemies, who ever kills them ſhall be rewarded.</q> Would you know now, whether the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Provinces of the Empire obeyed the Senate, or <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> the Emperor? Hear what the ſame Author ſays, The Senate wrote Letters into all the Provinces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to take care of their Common Safety and Liberty; the Letters were publickly read. And the Friends, the Deputies, the Generals, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, the Soldiers of <hi>Maximine,</hi> were ſlain in all places; very few Cities were found that kept their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96415:87"/>
Faith with the publick Enemy. <hi>Herodian</hi> relates the ſame thing. But what need we give any more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories? Let us now ſee what manner of thing the Right of Kings was in thoſe days, in the Nations that bordered upon the Empire. <hi>Ambiorix,</hi> a King of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> confeſſeth, <q>The Nature of his Dominion to be ſuch, that the People have as great Power over him, as he over them. </q>And conſequently, as well as he judged them, he might be judged by them. <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> another King in <hi>Gaul,</hi> was accuſed of Treaſon by his own People. Theſe things <hi>Caeſar</hi> relates in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Wars. <q>Neither is the Regal Power among the <hi>Germans</hi> abſolute and uncontroulable; leſſer matters are ordered and diſpoſed by the Princes; greater Affairs by all the People. The King or Prince is more conſiderable by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Perſuaſions, than by any Power that he has of Commanding. If his Opinion be not approv'd of, they declare their diſlike of it by a general mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Noiſe. This is out of <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
               </q> Nay, and you your ſelf now confeſs, that what but of late you exclaim'd againſt as an unheard of thing, has been often done, to wit, That <hi>no leſs than fifty</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Kings have been either Baniſhed, or Impriſoned, or put to Death, nay, and ſome of them publickly executed.</hi> Which having come to paſs in our very Iſland; why do you, as if it were your Office to conceal the violent Deaths of Tyrants, by burying them in the dark, exclaim againſt it as an abominable and unheard of thing? You proceed to commend the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for their Religious Obearence even to Tyrants, and to heap one lye upon another, all which I have already con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who but you ever argued ſo childiſhly? So that they deſired a King for ſome other reaſon, than that they might have a Maſter over them, whoſe Power ſhould be ſuperior to that of the Law; which reaſon what it was, it is not to our preſent purpoſe to make a Conjecture: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, both God and his Prophets tells us, it was no piece of prudence in the People to deſire a King.

            <p>AFter having diſcours'd upon the Law of God, and of Nature, and handled both ſo unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, that you have got nothing by the bargain but a deſerved reproach of Ignorance and Knavery; I cannot apprehend what you can have farther to alledg in defence of your Royal Cauſe, but meer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles. I for my part hope I have given ſatisfaction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to all good and learned men, and ſhall have done this Noble cauſe Right, ſhould I break off here; yet leſt I ſhould ſeem to any to decline your variety of arguing and ingenuity, rather than your immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate impertinence, and tittle-tattle, I'le follow you where ever you have a mind to go; but with ſuch brevity as ſhall make it appear, that after having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd whatever the neceſſary defence of the Cauſe required, if not, what the dignity of it merited, I now do but comply with ſome mens expectation, if not their curioſity. <hi>Now,</hi> ſay you, <hi>I ſhall alledg other and greater arguments.</hi> What? greater arguments than what the Law of God and Nature afforded? Help, <hi>Lucina!</hi> The mountain <hi>Salmaſius</hi> is in labour! It is not for nothing that he has got a ſhe-husband. Mortals ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome extraordinary birth. <hi>If he that is, and is called a King, might be accuſed before any other power, that power muſt of neceſſity be greater than that of the King; and if ſo, then muſt that power be indeed the Kingly power, and ought to have the name of it: For a Kingly power is thus defined; to wit, the Supreme power in the State reſiding in a ſingle perſon, and which has no ſuperior.</hi> O ridiculous birth! a Mouſe crept out of the Mountain! Help Grammarians! one of your number is in danger of periſhing! The Law of God and of Nature are ſafe; but <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his Dictionary is undone. What if I
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96415:91"/>
ſhould anſwer you thus? That words ought to give place to things; that we having taken away King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government it ſelf, do not think our ſelves concerned about its name, and definition; let others look to that, who are in love with Kings: We are contented with the enjoyment of our Liberty; ſuch an anſwer would be good enough for you. But to let you ſee that I deal fairly with you throughout, I will anſwer you, not only from my own, but from the opinion of very wiſe and good men, who have thought that the name and power of a King are very conſiſtent with a power in the people and the Law, ſuperior to that of the King himſelf. In the firſt place <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> a man very eminent for his wiſdom, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, to ſecure a Kingly Government as well as it was poſſible, could find no better expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to preſerve it, than by making the power of the Senate, and of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> that is, the power of the people, ſuperior to it. <hi>Theſeus</hi> in <hi>Euripedes,</hi> King of <hi>Athens</hi> was of the ſame opinion; for he to his great honour reſtored the people to their liberty, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the power of the people above that of the King, and yet left the Regal Power in that City to his Poſterity. Whence <hi>Euripedes</hi> in his Play call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Suppliants,</hi> introduceh him ſpeaking on this manner: <q>I have advanced the people themſelves into the Throne, having freed the City from Slavery, and admitted the people to a ſhare in the Government, by giving them an equal right of Suffrage.</q> And in another place to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald of <hi>Thebes,</hi> 
               <q>In the firſt place, <hi>ſays he,</hi> you begin your Speech, Friend, with a thing that is not true; in ſtiling me a Monarch; for this City is not govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſingle perſon, but is a free State; the people reigns here.</q> Theſe were his words, when at the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96415:92"/>
ſame time he was both called, and really was King there. The Divine <hi>Plato</hi> likewiſe in his Eight Epiſtle, <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>introduced the power of the Senate and of the</hi> Ephori, <hi>a thing very preſervative of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by this means hath honourably flouriſhed for ſo many ages, becauſe the Law in effect was made King.</hi> Now the Law cannot be King, unleſs there be ſome, who, if there ſhould be occaſion, may put the Law in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt the King. A Kingly Government ſo bounded and limited, he himſelf commends to the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians,</hi> 
               <q>Let the people enjoy their Liberty under a Kingly Government; let the King himſelf be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable; let the Law take place even againſt Kings themſelves, if they act contrary to Law.</q> 
               <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> likewiſe in the third Book of his <hi>Politicks,</hi> 
               <q>Of all Kingdoms, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that are govern'd by Laws, that of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſeems to be moſt truly and properly ſo.</q> And he ſays, all forms of Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are according to ſetled and eſtabliſht Laws, but one, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> which he does not mention ever to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in any Nation. So that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought ſuch a Kingdom, as that of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> was, to be and deſerve the name of a Kingdom more properly than any other; and conſequently that a King, tho ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to his own people, was nevertheleſs actually a King properly ſo called. Now ſince ſo many and ſo great Authors aſſert that a Kingly Government both in name and thing may very well ſubſiſt even where the people, tho they do not ordinarily exerciſe the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

By this means you'l have more wit and not <hi>run on in infinitum,</hi> which now you're afraid of <hi>It was to no purpoſe then, for</hi> Seneca, <hi>you ſay, to deſcribe thoſe three forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as he has done.</hi> Let <hi>Seneca</hi> do a thing to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo we enjoy our Liberty. And if I miſtake us not, we are other ſort of men than to be enſlav'd by <hi>Seneca</hi>'s flowers. And yet <hi>Seneca,</hi> though he ſays that the Soveraign Power in a Kingly Government reſides in a ſingle perſon, ſays withal that <hi>the power is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's,</hi> and by them committed to the King for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the whole, not for their ruin and deſtruction; and that the people has not given him a propriety in it, but the uſe of it. <hi>Kings at this rate,</hi> you ſay, <hi>do not reign by God, but by the people.</hi> As if God did not ſo over-rule the people, that they ſet up ſuch Kings, as it pleaſes God. Since <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours derived their Authority from that <hi>Royal Law, whereby the people gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them and veſted in them all their own power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> But how oft ſhall we repeat theſe things over and over again? Then you take upon you to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Conſtitution of our Government, in which you are no ways concerned, who are both a ſtranger and a foreigner; but it ſhows your ſawcineſs, and want of good manners. Come then, let us hear your Soloeciſms, like a buſie Coxcomb as you are. You tell us, but 'tis in falſe <hi>Latin,</hi> that <hi>what thoſe Deſperadoes ſay, is only to deceive the people.</hi> You Raſcal! was it for this that you a Renegado Grammarian, were ſo forward to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with the affairs of our Government, that you might introduce your Soloeciſms and Barbariſms amongſt us? But ſay, how have we deceiv'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96415:93"/>
               <hi>The form of Government which they have ſet up, is not Popular, but Military.</hi> This is what that herd of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives and Vagabonds hired you to write. So that I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to anſwer you, who bleat what you know nothing of, but I'le anſwer them that hired you. <hi>Who excluded the Lords from Parliament, was it the people?</hi> Yea, it was the people; and in ſo doing they threw an intollerable yoke of Slavery from off their necks. Thoſe very Soldiers, who you ſay did it, were not foreigners, but our own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a great part of the people; and they did it with the conſent, and at the deſire of almoſt all the reſt of the people, and not without the authority of the Parliament neither. <hi>Was it the people that cut off part of the Houſe of Commons, forcing ſome away, &amp;c.</hi> Yes, I ſay, it was the people. For whatever the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſounder part of the Senate did, in which the true power of the people reſided, why may not the people be ſaid to have done it? What if the greater part of the Senate ſhould chuſe to be ſlaves, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Government to ſale, ought not the leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to interpoſe, and endeavour to retain their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it be in their power? <hi>But the Officers of the Army and their Soldiers did it.</hi> And we are beholden to thoſe Officers for not being wanting to the State, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Tumultary violence of the Citizens and Mechanicks of <hi>London,</hi> who, like that Rabble that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd for <hi>Clodius,</hi> had but a little before beſet the very Parliament Houſe? Do you therefore call the right of the Parliament, to whom it properly and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally belongs to take care of the Liberty of the people both in Peace and War, a Military power? But 'tis no wonder that thoſe Traytors that have dictated theſe paſſages to you, ſhould talk at that rate; ſo that profligate faction of <hi>Anthony</hi> and his adherents uſed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96415:93"/>
to call the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the enemies of their Country, The Camp of <hi>Pompey.</hi> And now I'm glad to underſtand that they of your party, envy <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that moſt valiant General of our Army, his undertaking that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (ſo acceptable to Almighty God) ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a joyful crowd of his Friends, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with the well-wiſhes of the people, and the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all good men: For I queſtion not but at the news of his many Victories there, they are by this time burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with ſpleen. I paſs by many of your impertinencies concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers. What follows is moſt notoriouſly falſe: <hi>The power of the people,</hi> ſay you, <hi>ceaſes where there is a King.</hi> By what Law or Right is that? Since it is known that almoſt all Kings of what Nations ſoever, received their Authority from the people upon certain conditions; which if the King do not perform, I wiſh you would inform us, why that Power, which was but a Truſt, ſhould not return to the people, as well from a King, as from a Conſul, or any other Magiſtrate. For when you tell us, that 'tis neceſſary for the Publick Safety, you do but trifle with us; for the ſafety of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is equally concerned, whether it be from a <hi>King,</hi> or from a <hi>Senate,</hi> or from a <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> that the power wherewith they were entruſted, revert to the people, upon their abuſe of it; and yet you your ſelf grant that it may ſo revert from all ſorts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, a King only excepted. Certainly, if no people in their right wits ever committed the Government either to a King, or other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, for any other purpoſe, than for the common good of them all, there can be no reaſon why, to prevent the utter ruin of them all, they may not as well take it back again from a King, as from other
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96415:94"/>
Governors; nay, and it may with far greater eaſe be taken from one, than from many And to inveſt any mortal creature with a power over themſelves, on any other terms than upon Truſt, were extreme madneſs; nor is it credible that any people ſince the Creation of the world, who had freedom of will, were ever ſo miſerably ſilly, as either to depart with the power for ever, and to all purpoſes, or to revoke it from thoſe whom they had entruſted with it, but upon moſt urgent and weighty reaſons. If diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if Civil Wars, are occaſioned thereby, there cannot any Right accrue from thence to the King, to retain that power by force of arms, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple challenge from him as their own Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that what you ſay, and we do not deny, That <hi>Governors are not lightly to be changed,</hi> is true with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the peoples Prudence, not the King's Right; but that therefore they ought never to be changed, upon no occaſion whatſoever, that does not follow by no means; nor have you hitherto alledged any thing, nor made appear any Right of Kings to the contrary, but that all the people concurring, they may lawfully be depoſed, when unfit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; provided it may be done, as it has been often done in your own Countrey of <hi>France,</hi> without any Tumults or Civil Wars Since therefore the Safety of the People, and not that of a Tyrant, is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Law, and conſequently ought to be alledged on the peoples behalf againſt a Tyrant, and not for him againſt them, you that go about to pervert ſo ſacred and ſo glorious a Law, with your fallacies and juglings; you who would have this Supreme Law, and which of all others is moſt beneficial to mankind, to ſerve only for the Impunity of Tyrants, let me fell you, ſince you call us <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſo often <hi>Inſpired,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:96415:94"/>
and <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> let me, I ſay, be ſo far a Prophet, as to tell you, That the Vengeance of God and man hangs over your head for ſo horrid a Crime; altho your ſubjecting all mankind to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as far as in you lies, which in effect is no better than condemning them to be devoured by wild beaſts, is in it ſelf part of its own Vengeance, and whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you flye, and whereſoever you wander, will firſt or laſt purſue you with its Furies, and overtake you, and cauſe you to rave worſe than you do now. I come now to your ſecond Argument, which is not unlike the firſt: If the people may reſume their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>there would be no difference,</hi> you ſay, <hi>betwixt a Popular State and a Kingdom; but that in a Kingdom one man rules, and in a Popular State many.</hi> And what if that were true; would the State have any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice by it? But you your ſelf tell us of other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that would be notwithſtanding; to wit, of <hi>Time and Succeſſion; for in popular States, the Magiſtrates are generally choſen yearly;</hi> whereas Kings, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves well, are perpetual; and in moſt Kingdoms there is a Succeſſion in the ſame Family. But let them differ from one another, or not differ, I regard not thoſe petty things: In this they agree, That when the Publick Good requires it, the people may without doing injury to any, reſume that power for the Publick Saftety, which they committed to another for that end and purpoſe. <hi>But by the Royal Law, by the</hi> Romans <hi>ſo called, which is mentioned in the Inſtitutes, the people of</hi> Rome <hi>granted all their Power and Authority to the Prince.</hi> They did ſo by compulſion; the Emperor, being willing to ratifie their Tyranny by the Authority of a Law; but of this we have ſpoken before; and their own Lawyers commenting upon this place in the Inſtitutes, confeſs as much. So

that we make no queſtion but the people may revoke what they were forced to grant, and granted againſt their wills. But moſt rational it is to ſuppoſe, that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> transferred no other power to the Prince, than they had before granted to their own Magiſtrates; and that was a power to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, and a revocable, not an abſurd, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical power: Hence it was that the Emperors aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Conſular Dignity, and that of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the people; but after <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> not one of them pretended to the Dictatorſhip: In the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Maximus</hi> they uſed to adore the people, as I have ſaid already out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Claudian.</hi> But <hi>as heretofore many private perſons have ſold themſelves into ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſo a whole Nation may.</hi> Thou Gaol-bird of a Knight, thou day-ſpirit, thou everlaſting ſcandal to thy Native-Countrey.

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if people had ſo enſlaved themſelves to Kings, then might Kings turn them over to other Maſters, or fell them for money; and yet we know that Kings cannot ſo much as alienate the Demeſnes of the Crown: And ſhall he, that has but the Crown, and the Revenues that belong to it, as an Uſufructuary, and thoſe given him by the people, can he be ſaid to have, as it were, purchaſed the people, and made them his Propriety? Tho you were bored through both ears, and went bare-foot, you would not be ſo vile and deſpicable, ſo much more contemptible than all Slaves, as the broaching ſuch a ſcandalous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this makes you.

            <p>TO avoid two very great inconveniences, and conſidering your own weight, very weighty ones indeed, you denied in the foregoing Chapter, That the Peoples Power was ſuperior to that of the King; for if that ſhould be granted, Kings muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves of ſome other name, becauſe the people would indeed be King; and ſome diviſions in your Syſtem of Politicks would be confounded; the firſt of which inconveniences would thwart with your Dictionary, and the latter overthrow your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96415:96"/>
To theſe I have given ſuch an anſwer as ſhows, That tho our own Safety and Liberty were the principal things I aimed the preſervation of, yet withal, I had ſome conſideration of ſalving your Dictionary, and your Politicks. <hi>Now,</hi> ſay you, <hi>I will prove by other arguments, That a King cannot be judged by his own Subjects; of which Arguments this ſhall be the greateſt and moſt convincing, That a King has no Peer in his Kingdom.</hi> What? can a King have no Peer in his Kingdom? What then is the meaning of thoſe Twelve Ancient Peers of the Kings of <hi>France?</hi> Are they Fables and Trifles? Are they called ſo in vain, and in mock only? Have a care how you affront thoſe Principal men of that Kingdom: Who if they are not the King's Peers, as they are called, I am afraid your Dictionary, which is the only thing you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for, will be found more faulty in <hi>France,</hi> than in <hi>England?</hi> But go to, let's hear your demonſtration, that a King has no Peer in his own Kingdom. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the people of</hi> Rome, <hi>when they had baniſh'd their King, appointed not one, but two Conſuls; and the reaſon was, That if one of them ſhould tranſgreſs the Laws, his Collegue might be a check to him.</hi> There could hardly have been deviſed any thing more ſilly: How came it to paſs then, that but one of the Couſuls had the bundles of Rods carried before him, and not both, if two were appointed, that each might have a Power over the other?

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96415:96"/>
a famous inſtance of that in the <hi>Decemviri;</hi> who tho they were inveſted with the Power of Conſuls, and were the chief Magiſtrates, yet the Authority of the Senate reduced them all, tho they ſtruggled to retain their Government: Nay, we read that ſome Conſuls before they were out of office, have been declared enemies, and Arms been taken up againſt them; for in thoſe days no man looked upon him as a Conſul, who acted as an Enemy. So War was waged againſt <hi>Antony,</hi> tho a Conſul, by Authority of the Senate; in which being worſted, he would have been put to death, but that <hi>Octavius,</hi> affecting the Empire, ſided with him to ſubvert the Commonwealth. Now whereas you ſay, <hi>That it is a property peculiar to Kingly Majeſty, that the power reſides in a ſingle perſon;</hi> that's but a looſe expreſſion, like the reſt of what you ſay, and is contradicted by your ſelf a little after: <hi>For the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Judges,</hi> you ſay, <hi>ruled as long as they lived, and there was but one of them at a time: The Scripture alſo calls them Kings; and yet they more accountable to the great Councel.</hi> Thus we ſee, That an itch of Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, in being thought to have ſaid all that can be ſaid, makes you hardly ſay any thing but contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Then I ask, what kind of Government that was in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when ſometimes Two, ſometimes Three Emperors, reign'd all at once? Do you reckon them to have been Emperors, that is, Kings, or was it an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or a <hi>Triumvirate?</hi> Or will you deny, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire under <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Verus,</hi> under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> was ſtill but one entire Empire? If theſe Princes were not Kings, your Three forms of Government will hardly hold; if they were, then it is not an eſſential Property of a Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to reſide in a ſingle perſon. <hi>If one of theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:96415:97"/>
ſay you, <hi>then may the other refer the matter to the Senate, or the People, where he may be accuſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> And does not the Senate and the People then judg, when the matter is ſo referred to them? So that if you will give any credit to your ſelf, there needs not one Collegue to judg another. Such a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Advocate as you, if you were not ſo wretched a fellow as you are, would deſerve compaſſion; you lye every way ſo open to blows, that if one were minded for ſports-ſake to make a Paſs at any part of you, he could hardly miſs, let him aim where he would. <hi>'Tis ridiculous,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to imagine, That a King will ever appoint Judges to condemn himſelf.</hi> But I can tell you of an Emperor, that was no ridiculous perſon, but an Excellent Prince, and that was <hi>Trajan,</hi> who when he delivered a Dagger to a certain <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate, as the cuſtom was, that being the badge of his Office, frequently thus admoniſhed him, <q>Take this Sword, and uſe it for me, if I do as I ought, if otherwiſe, againſt me; for Miſcarriages in the Supreme Magiſtrate are leſs excuſable.</q> This <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> ſay of him: You ſee here, that a worthy Emperor appointed one to judge himſelf, tho he did not make him his equal. <hi>Tiberius</hi> perhaps might have ſaid as much out of Vanity and Hypocriſie; but 'tis almoſt a crime to imagine that ſo good and virtuous a Prince as <hi>Trajan,</hi> did not really ſpeak as he thought, and according to what he apprehended right and juſt. How much more reaſonable was it that tho he were ſuperior to the Senate in power, and might if he would, have refuſed to yield them any obedience, yet he actually did obey them, as by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his office he ought to do, and acknowledged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>? For ſo <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us in his <hi>Panegyrick</hi> 
               <q>The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96415:97"/>
both deſired and commanded you to be Conſul a fourth time; you may know by the Obedience you pay them, that this is no word of Flattery, but of Power: And a little after: This is the deſign you aim at, to reſtore our loſt Liberty.</q> And <hi>Trajan</hi> was not of that mind alone; the Senate thought ſo too, and were of opinion, That their Authority was indeed Supreme: For they that could Command their Emperor, might Judge him. So the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> when <hi>Caſſius</hi> Governor of <hi>Syria</hi> endeavoured to get the Empire from him, referred himſelf either to the Senate, or the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and declared himſelf ready to lay down the Government, if they would have it ſo. Now how ſhould a man determine of the Right of Kings, better, and more truly, than out of the very mouths of the beſt of Kings? Indeed every good King accounts either the Senate, or the People, not only equal, but ſuperior to himſelf by the Law of Nature: But a Tyrant being by nature inferior to all men, every one that is ſtronger than he, ought to be accounted not only his equal, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior: For as heretofore nature taught men from Force and Violence to betake themſelves to Laws, ſo wherever the Laws are ſet at naught, the ſame dictate of nature muſt neceſſarily prompt us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our ſelves to Force again. <q>To be of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>ſays</hi> Cicero <hi>pro Seſtio,</hi> is a ſign of Wiſdom; to put it in practice, argues Courage and Reſolution; to do both, is the effect of Vertue in its perfection</q> Let this ſtand then as a ſetled Maxim of the Law of Nature, never to be ſhaken by any Artifices of Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, That the Senate, or the people, are ſuperior to Kings, be they good or bad: Which is but what
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96415:98"/>
you your ſelf do in effect confeſs, when you tell us, That the Authority of Kings was derived from the people. For that power which they transferred to Princes, doth yet naturally, or as I may ſay virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſide in themſelves notwithſtanding; for ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes that produce any effect by a certain eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of operation, do always retain more of their own vertue and energy than they impart; nor do they by communicating to others, exhauſt themſelves. You ſee, the cloſer we keep to Nature, the more evidently does the peoples power appear to be above that of the Prince. And this is likewiſe certain, That the people do not freely, and of choice, ſettle the Government in their King abſolutely, ſo as to give him a Propriety in it; nor by Nature can do ſo; but only for the Publick Safety and Liberty; which when the King ceaſeth to take care of, then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in effect have given him nothing at all: For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays the people gave it him to a particular end and purpoſe; which end, if neither Nature nor the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can attain, the peoples Gift becomes no more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, than any other void Covenant or Agreement. Theſe Reaſons prove very fully, That the People are Superior to the King; and ſo your <hi>greateſt and moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

from hence, but that they who ſet up Kings over them, are the moſt miſerable and moſt ſilly people in the world. But, I paay, what's the reaſon why the people may not puniſh a King that becomes a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, as well as they may popular Magiſtrates and Senators in an Ariſtocracy? Do you think that all they that live under a Kingly Government, were ſo ſtrangely in love with Slavery, as when they might be free, to chuſe Vaſſalage, and to put themſelves all and entirely under the dominion of one man, who often happens to be an ill man, and often a fool, ſo as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſe might be, to leave themſelves no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96415:99"/>
Kingdom; and that if he do not, they ſhall be diſcharged of their Allegiance, and himſelf</hi> ipſo facto <hi>ceaſe to be their King, yet if he break this oath, 'tis God and not man that muſt require it of him.</hi> I have tranſcribed theſe lines, not for their Elegance, for they are barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed; nor becauſe I think there needs any anſwer to them, for they anſwer themſelves, they explode and damn themſelves by their notorious falſhood and loathſomneſs; but I did it to recommend you to Kings for your great Merits; that among ſo many places as there are at Court, they may put you into ſome Preferment or Office that may be fit for you; ſome are Princes Secretaries, ſome their Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, ſome Maſters of the Revels; I think you had beſt be Maſter of the Perjuries to ſome of them; You ſha'nt be Maſter of the Ceremonies, you are too much a Clown for that; but their Treachery and Perfidiouſneſs ſhall be under your care. But that men may ſee that you are both a Fool and a Knave to the higheſt degree, let us conſider theſe laſt aſſertions of yours a little more narrowly; <hi>A King,</hi> ſay you, <hi>tho he ſwear to his Subjects at his Election that he will govern according to Law,</hi> and that if he do not, <hi>they ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of their Allegiance, and he himſelf,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>ceaſe to be their King;</hi> yet can he not be depoſed or puniſhed by them. Why not a King, I pray, as well as popular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates? Becauſe in a popular State, the People do not transfer all their Power to the Magiſtrates. And do they in the Caſe that you have put, veſt it all in the King, when they place him in the Government upon thoſe terms expreſly, to hold it no longer than he uſeth it well? So that it is evident, that a King ſworn to obſerve the Laws, if he tranſgreſs them, may be puniſhed and depoſed, as well as popular Magiſtrates. So, that you can make no more uſe of that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96415:99"/>
invincible Argument of the Peoples tranferring all their Right and Power into the Prince; you your ſelf have battered it down with your own Engines. Hear now another <hi>moſt powerful and invincible Argument of his,</hi> why Subjects cannot judge their Kings, <hi>becauſe he is bound by no Law, being himſelf the ſole Lawgiver.</hi> Which having been proved already to be moſt falſe, this great reaſon comes to nothing, as well as the former. But the reaſon why Princes have but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom been proceeded againſt for perſonal and private Crimes, as Whoredom, and Adultery, and the like, is not becauſe they could not juſtly be puniſhed even for ſuch, but leſt the People ſhould receive more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice through diſturbances that might be occaſioned by the King's Death, and the change of Affairs, than they would be profited by the puniſhment of one Man or two. But when they begin to be univerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and inſufferable, it has always been the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Nations, that then, being Tyrants, it is lawful to put them to Death any how, condemn'd or uncondemn'd. Hence <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Second <hi>Phillip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick,</hi> ſays thus of thoſe that kill'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> 
               <q>They were the firſt that ran through with their Swords, not a Man who affected to be King, but who was actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled in the Government; which, as it was a worthy and godlike Action, ſo it's ſet before us for our imitation.</q> How unlike are you to him! <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Adultery, Injuries, are not regal and publick, but private and perſonal Crimes.</hi> Well ſaid Paraſite! you have obliged all Pimps and Proſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How ingeniouſly do you act, both the Paraſite, and the Pimp, with the ſame breath? <hi>A King that is an Adulterer, or a Murderer, may yet govern well, and conſequently ought not to be put to Death, becauſe together with his Life he muſt loſe his

Kingdom; and it was never yet allowed by God's Laws, or Man's, that for one and the ſame Crime, a Man was to be puniſhed twice.</hi> Infamous foul-mouth, Wretch! By the ſame reaſon the Magiſtrates in a popular State, or in an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> ought never to be put to Death, for fear of double Puniſhment; no Judge, no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator muſt dye, for they muſt loſe their Magiſtracy too, as well as their Lives. As you have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take all Power out of the Peoples hands, and veſt it in the King, ſo you would all Majeſty too: A delegated, tranſlatitious Majeſty we allow, but that Majeſty does chiefly and primarily reſide in him, you can no more prove, than you can, that Power and Authority does. <hi>A King,</hi> you ſay, <hi>cannot commit Treaſon againſt his People, but a People may againſt their King.</hi> And yet a King is what he is for the People only, not the People for him.

If by the Nobility, whom you ſtile <hi>Optimates,</hi> you mean the Peers only; for it may happen, that amongſt the whole number of them, there may not be one Man deſerving that Appellation; for it often falls out, that there are better and wiſer Men, than they

amongſt the Commons, whom in Conjunction with the greater, or the better part of the People, I ſhould not ſcruple to call by the Name of, and take them for all the People. <hi>But if the King is not Superior in Power to all the People together, he is then a King but of ſingle Perſons, he is not the King of the whole Body of the People.</hi> You ſay well, no more he is, unleſs they are content he ſhould be ſo.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96415:101"/>
we have ſetled one Supreme Senate only, in which the Nobility alſo, as a part of the People, not in their own Right, as they did before; but Repreſenting thoſe Burroughs or Counties, for which they may be choſe, may give their Votes. Then you inveigh againſt the Common People, as being <hi>Blind and Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, Ignorant of the Art of Governing,</hi> you ſay there's <hi>nothing more Empty, more Vain, more Inconſtant, more Uncertain than they.</hi> All which is very true of your ſelf, and it's true likewiſe of the Rabble, but not of the middle ſort, amongſt whom the moſt prudent Men, and moſt skilful in Affairs are generally found; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are moſt commonly diverted either by Luxury and Plenty, or by Want and Poverty, from Virtue, and the Study of Laws and Government. <hi>There are many ways,</hi> you ſay, <hi>by which Kings come to the Crown, ſo as not to he beholden to the People at all for it;</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, <hi>thoſe that inherit a Kingdom.</hi> But thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions moſt certainly be Slaves, and born to Slavery, that acknowledge any one to be their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſo abſolutely, as that they are his inheritance, and come to him by deſcent, without any Conſent of their own; they deſerve not the Appellation of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor of Freemen, nor can they be juſtly repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch; nor are they to be accounted as a Civil Society, but muſt be looked on as the Poſſeſſions and Eſtate of their Lord, and his Family: For I ſee no difference as to the Right of Ownerſhip betwixt them, and Slaves, and Beaſts. Secondly, <hi>They that come to the Crown by Conqueſt, cannot acknowledge themſelves to have receiv'd from the People, the Power they uſurp.</hi> We are not now diſcourſing of a Conqueror, but of a Conquered King; what a Conqueror may lawfully do, we'll diſcourſe elſewhere; do you keep to your
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96415:101"/>
Subject. But whereas you aſcribe to Kings that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Right that Maſters of Families have over their Houſholds, and take an example from thence of their abſolute Power, I have ſhown already over and over, that there is no likeneſs at all betwixt them. And <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom you name ſo often, if you had read him, would have taught you as much in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Politicks, where he ſays they judge amiſs that think there is but little difference betwixt a King, and a Maſter of a Family: <hi>For that there is not a numerical, but a ſpecifical Difference betwixt a Kingdom and a Family.</hi> For when Villages grew to be Towns and Cities, that Regal Domeſtick Right vaniſhed by degrees, and was no more owned. Hence <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> in his firſt Book ſays, That anciently King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were tranſmitted not to the former King's Sons, but to thoſe that had beſt deſerved of the People. And <hi>Juſtine,</hi> 
               <q>Originally, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Nations, and of Countries, was by Kings, who were exalted to that height of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, not by popular Ambition, but for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which commended them to good Men.</q> Whence it is manifeſt, that in the very beginning of Nations, that Fatherly and Hereditary Government gave way to vertue, and the peoples right. Which is the moſt natural reaſon and cauſe, and was the true riſe of Kingly Government. For at firſt, men entred into Societies, not that any one might inſult over all the reſt, but that in caſe any ſhould injure other, there might be Laws and Judges to protect them from wrong, or at leaſt to puniſh the wrong doers. When men were at firſt diſpers'd and ſcattered aſunder, ſome wiſe and eloquent man perſwaded them to enter into Civil Societies; <hi>that he himſelf,</hi> ſay you, <hi>might exerciſe Dominion over them, when ſo united.</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:96415:102"/>
Perhaps you meant this of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who is ſaid to have been the firſt Tyrant. Or elſe it proceeds from your own malice only, and certainly it cannot have been true of thoſe great and generous ſpirited men, but is a fiction of your own, not warranted by any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that I ever heard of. For all ancient Writers tell us, that thoſe firſt Inſtituters of Communities of men, had a regard to the good and ſafety of Mankind only, and not to any private advantages of their own, or to make themſelves great or powerful. One thing I cannot paſs by, which I ſuppoſe you intended for an Emblem, to ſet off the reſt of this Chapter: <hi>If a Conſul,</hi> ſay you, <hi>had been to be accuſed before his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy expired, there muſt have been a Dictator created for that purpoſe;</hi> though you had ſaid before, <hi>that for that very reaſon there were two of them.</hi> Juſt ſo your Poſitions always agree with one another, and almoſt every Page declares how weak and frivolous whatever you ſay or write upon any ſubject, is. <hi>Under the ancient Engliſh-Saxon Kings,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the people were never call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Parliaments.</hi> If any of our own Country-men had aſſerted ſuch a thing; I could eaſily have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him that he was in an error. But I am not ſo much concerned at your miſtaking our affairs, becauſe y'are a Foreigner. This in effect is all you ſay of the Right of Kings in general. Many other things I omit, for you uſe many digreſſions, and put things down that either have no ground at all, or are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, and my deſign is not to vye with you in impertinence.</p>

            <p>IF you had publiſhed your own opinion, <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> concerning the Right of Kings in general, without affronting any perſons in particular, yet, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this alteration of affairs in <hi>England,</hi> as long as you did but uſe your own liberty in writing what your ſelf thought fit, no <hi>Engliſh</hi> man could have had any cauſe to have been diſpleaſed with you, nor would you have made good the opinion you maintain, ever a whit the leſs. For if it be a poſitive command both of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>That all men whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether</hi> Spaniards, French, Italians, Germans, Engliſh <hi>or</hi> Scotch, <hi>ſhould be ſubject to their Princes, be they good or bad,</hi> which you aſſerted <hi>(Page</hi> 127.) to what purpoſe was it for you, who are a foreigner and unknown to us, to be tampering with our Laws, and to read us Lectures out of them as out of your own Papers and Miſcellanies, which, be they how they will, you have taught us already in a great many words, that they ought to give way to the Laws of God. But now it is apparent that you have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the defence of this Royal Cauſe, not ſo much out of your own inclination, as partly becauſe you were hired, and that at a good round price too, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how things are with him, that ſet you on work; and partly, 'tis like, out of expectation of ſome greater reward hereafter, to publiſh a ſcandalous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are injurious to none of their Neighbours, and meddle with their own mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only. If there were no ſuch thing as that in the caſe, is it credible that any man ſhould be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or ſo mad, as though he be a ſtranger, and at a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96415:103"/>
great diſtance from us, yet of his own accord to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with our affairs, and ſide with a party? What, the Devil, is it to you what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves? What would you have, Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Puppy? what would ye be at? Have you no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of your own at home? I wiſh you had the ſame concerns that that famous <hi>Olus,</hi> your fellow buſie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie body, in the <hi>Epigram</hi> had; and perhaps ſo you have; you deſerve them I'm ſure. Or did that Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur your Wife, who encouraged you to write what you have done, for out-law'd <hi>Charles</hi> his ſake, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you ſome profitable Profeſſors place in <hi>England,</hi> and God knows what Gratifications at <hi>Charles</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? But aſſure your ſelves, my Miſtreſs and my Maſter, that <hi>England</hi> admits neither of <hi>Wolfes,</hi> nor Owners of <hi>Wolfes.</hi> So that it's no wonder you ſpit ſo much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom <note place="margin">St. <hi>Lou,</hi> in <hi>Latin, Sanctus Lupus;</hi> Saint <hi>Wolf,</hi> is the name of a place in <hi>France,</hi> where <hi>Salmaſius</hi> had ſome ſmall Eſtate, and was called ſo from St. <hi>Lupus a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhop, who with St. <hi>German</hi> came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>England, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Dom.</hi> 429.</note> at our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſtiffs.

Being a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor to the Prince, you are at too great a diſtance from your own Country. But I ſee full well that ſhe neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires you, nor your Counſel; nor did it appear ſhe did, when you were there a few years ago, and began to lick a Cardinal's Trencher; ſhe's in the right, by my troth, and can very willingly ſuffer ſuch a little fellow as you, that are but one half of a man, to run up and down with your Miſtreſs of a Wife, and Desks full of Trifles and Fooleries, till you light ſome
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96415:103"/>
where or other upon a Stipend, large enough for a Knight of the Grammar, or an Illuſtrious Critick on Horſeback; if any Prince or State has a mind to hire a Vagabond Doctor that is to be ſold at a good round Price. But here's one that will bid for you; whether you're a Merchantable Commodity or not, and what you are worth we ſhall ſee by and by. You ſay, <hi>The Parricides aſſert, that the Government of</hi> England <hi>is not meerly Kingly, but that it is a mixt Government.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> a Country-man of ours in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's days, a good Lawyer, and a Stateſman, one whom you your ſelf will not call a Parricide, in the beginning of a Book which he wrote <hi>of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of England,</hi> aſſerts the ſame thing, and not of our Government only, but of almoſt all others in the world, and that out of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and he ſays it is not poſſible that any Government ſhould otherwiſe ſubſiſt. But as if you thought it a crime to ſay any thing, and not unſay it again, you repeat your former thread-bare Contradictions: You ſay, <hi>There neither is nor ever was any Nation that did not underſtand by the very name of a King, a perſon whoſe authority is inferior to God alone, and who is accountable to no other.</hi> And yet a little after you confeſs, <hi>that the name of a King was formerly given to ſuch Powers and Magiſtrates, as had not a full and abſolute right of themſelves, but had a dependance upon the people, as the</hi> Suffetes <hi>among the</hi> Carthaginians, <hi>the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Judges, the Kings of the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>and of</hi> Arragon. Are you not very conſiſtent with your ſelf? Then you reckon up five ſeveral ſorts of Monarchies out of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> in one of which only that Right obtain'd, which you ſay is common to all Kings. Concerning which I have ſaid already more than once, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> give an inſtance of any ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, nor was there ever any ſuch in being; the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96415:104"/>
other four he clearly demonſtrates that they were bounded by Eſtabliſht Laws, and the King's Power ſubject to thoſe Laws. The firſt of which four was that of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which in his opinion did of all others beſt deſerve the name of a Kingdom. The ſecond was ſuch as obtain'd among Barbarians, which was laſting, becauſe regulated by Laws, and becauſe the people willingly ſubmitted to it; whereas by the ſame Author's opinion in his third Book, what King ſo ever retains the Soveraignty againſt the people's will, is no longer to be accounted a King, but a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Tyrant; all which is true likewiſe of his third ſort of Kings, which he calls <hi>Aeſymnete,</hi> who were choſen by the people, and moſt commonly for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time only, and for ſome particular purpoſes, ſuch as the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictators were. The fourth ſort he makes of ſuch as reigned in the Heroical days, upon whom for their extraordinary merits the people of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord conferr'd the Government, but yet bounded by Laws; nor could theſe retain the Soveraignty againſt the will of the people; nor do theſe four ſorts of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governments differ, he ſays, from Tyranny in any thing elſe, but only in that theſe Governments are with the good liking of the people; and That againſt their will. The fifth ſort of Kingly Government, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or abſolute Monarchy, in which the Supreme Power reſides in the King's perſon, which you pretend to be the right of all Kings, is utterly condemn'd by the Philoſopher, as neither for the good of Mankind, nor conſonant to Juſtice or Nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome people ſhould be content to live under ſuch a Government, and withal confer it upon ſuch as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all others in vertue. Theſe things any man may read in the third Book of his <hi>Politicks.</hi> But you, I believe, that once in your life you might appear witty
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96415:104"/>
and florid, pleaſed your ſelf with making a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>betwixt theſe five ſorts of Kingly Government, and the five Zones of the World; betwixt the two extremes of Kingly power, there are three more temperate Species interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as there lie three Zones betwixt the Torrid and the Frigid.</hi> Pretty Rogue! what ingenious compariſons he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways makes us! May you be for ever baniſhed, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you your ſelf condemn <hi>an abſolute Kingdom</hi> to be, to wit, to the frigid <hi>Zone,</hi> which when you are there, will be doubly cold to what it was before. In the mean while we ſhall expect that new faſhioned ſphere which you deſcribe, from you our modern <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> in which there ſhall be two extreme <hi>Zones,</hi> one Torrid, and the other Frigid, and three temperate ones lying betwixt. <hi>The Kings of the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians, you ſay, <hi>might lawfully be Impriſoned, but it was not lawful to put them to Death.</hi> Why not? Becauſe the Miniſters of Juſtice, and ſome Foreign Soldiers, being ſurpriſed at the Novelty of the thing, thought it not lawful to lead <hi>Agis</hi> to his Execution, though condem'd to die? And the people of <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> were diſpleaſed at his death, not becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to die, though a King, but becauſe he was a good man and popular, and had been circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a faction of the great ones. Says <hi>Plutarch,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Agis</hi> was the firſt King that was put to death by the <hi>Ephori;</hi>
               </q> in which words he does not pretend to tell us what lawfully might be done, but what actually was done. For to imagin that ſuch as may lawfully accuſe a King, and impriſon him, may not alſo lawfully put him to death, is a childiſh conceit. At laſt you betake your ſelf to give an account of the Right of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings. <hi>There never was,</hi> you ſay, <hi>but one King in England.</hi> This you ſay, becauſe you had ſaid before, that <hi>unleſs a King be ſole in the Government, we cannot be a King.</hi> Which if it be true, ſome of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96415:105"/>
them, who I had thought had been Kings of <hi>England,</hi> were not really ſo; for to omit many of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their Sons, or their Brothers Partners with them in the Government, it is known that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, reign'd together with his Son. <hi>Let them show,</hi> ſay you, <hi>a Preſident of any Kingdom under the Government of a ſingle perſon, who has not an abſolute power; though in ſome Kingdoms more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, in others more intenſe.</hi> Do you ſhow any Power that's <hi>abſolute,</hi> and yet <hi>remiſs,</hi> you Aſs; is not that power that's abſolute, the Supreme Power of all? How can it then be both ſupreme and remiſs? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Kings you ſhall acknowledg to be inveſted with a remiſs (or a leſs) power, thoſe I will eaſily make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have no abſolute power; and conſequently to be inferior to a People, free by nature, who is both its own Law given, and can make the Regal Power more or leſs intense or remiſs; that is, greater or less. Whether the whole Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Governed by Kings, or no, is uncertain. It's most likely that the form of their Government changed according to the Exigencies of the times. Whence <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays, <hi>The</hi> Britains <hi>anciently were under Kings; now the great man amongſt them divide them into Parties and Factions.</hi> When the <hi>Romans</hi> left them, they were about forty years without Kings; they were not always therefore under a Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you ſay they were; but when they were ſo, that the Kingdom was Hereditary, I poſitively deny; which that it was not, is evident both from the Series of their Kings, and their way of Creating them; for the consent of the people is asked in expreſs words.

               </gap>orſooth, ſubdued us. But they who are not ſtrangers to our Hiſtory, know full well, that the Strength of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation was not ſo broken in that one Fight at <hi>Haſtings,</hi> but that they might eaſily have renewed the War. But they choſe rather to accept of a King, than to be under a Conqueror and a Tyrant: They ſwear therefore to <hi>William,</hi> to be his Liege-men, and he ſwears to them at the Altar, to carry to them as a good King ought to do in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. When he broke his word, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves again to their Arms, being diffident of his ſtrength, he renewed his Oath upon the Holy Evangeliſts, to obſerve the Ancient Laws of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore, if after that he miſerably oppreſſed the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (as you ſay he did) he did it not by Right of Conqueſt, but by Right of Perjury. Beſides, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that many ages ago, the Conquerors and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered coaleſced into one and the ſame people: So that that Right of Conqueſt, if any ſuch ever were, muſt needs have been antiquated long ago. His own words at his death, which I give you out of a <hi>French Manuſcript</hi> written at <hi>Cane,</hi> put all out of doubt: <hi>I appoint no man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to inherit the Kingdom of England.</hi> By which words, both his pretended Right of Conqueſt, and the Hereditary Right, were
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96415:106"/>
diſclaim'd at his death, and buried together with him. I ſee now that you have gotten a place at Court, as I foretold you would; you are made the King's Chief Treaſurer and Steward of his Court-Craft: And what follows, you ſeem to write <hi>ex Officio,</hi> as by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of your Office, Magnificent Sir. <hi>If any preceding</hi> Kings, <hi>being thereunto compelled by Factions of Great Men, or Seditions amongſt the Common People, have receded in ſome meaſure from their Right, that cannot prejudice the Succeſſor; but that he is at liberty to reſume it.</hi> You ſay well; if therefore at any time our Anceſtors have through neglect loſt any thing that was their Right, why ſhould that prejudice us their Poſterity? If they would promiſe for themſelves to become Slaves, they could make no ſuch promiſe for us; who ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways retain the ſame Right of delivering our ſelves out of Slavery, that they had of enſlaving themſelves to any whomſoever. You wonder how it comes to paſs that a King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> muſt now-adays be looked upon as one of the Magiſtrates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom only; whereas in all other Kingly Governments in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> Kings are inveſted with a Free and Abſolute Authority. For the <hi>Scots,</hi> I remit you to <hi>Buchanan:</hi> For <hi>France,</hi> your own Native Countrey, to which you ſeem to be a ſtranger, to <hi>Hottoman's Franco Gallia,</hi> and <hi>Girardus</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian; for the reſt, to other Authors, of whom none that I know of, were <hi>Independents:</hi> Out of whom you might have learned a quite other leſſon concerning the Right of Kings, than what you teach. Not being able to prove that a Tyrannical Power belongs to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by Right of Conqueſt, you try now to do it by Right of Perjury. Kings profeſs themſelves to Reign <hi>By the Grace of God:</hi> What if they had profeſſed themſelves to be gods? I believe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96415:106"/>
if they had, you might eaſily have been brought to become one of their Prieſts. So the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> pretended to Archbiſhop it by <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> Are you ſuch a fool, as to deny the Pope's being a King in the Church, that you may make the King greater than a Pope in the State? But in the Statutes of the Realm the King is called our <hi>Lord.</hi> You are become of a ſudden a wonderful <hi>Nomenclator</hi> of our Statutes: But you know not that many are called Lords and Maſters, who are not really so: You know not how unreaſonable a thing it is to judge of Truth and Right by Titles of Honour, not to ſay of Flattery. Make the ſame Inference, if you will, from the Parliament's being called the <hi>King's Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for it is called the King's Bridle too; or a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to the King; and therefore the King is no more Lord or Maſter of his Parliament, than a Horſe is of his Bridle. But why not the King's Parliament, ſince the <hi>King ſummons them?</hi> I'le tell you why; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Conſuls uſed to indict a Meeting of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, yet were they not Lords over that Council. When the King therefore ſummons or calls together a Parliament, he does it by vertue and in diſcharge of that Office, which he has received from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he may adviſe with them about the weighty affairs of the Kingdom, not his own particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: Or when at any time the Parliament debated of the King's own Affairs, if any could properly be called his own, they were always the laſt things they did; and it was in their choice when to debate of them, and whether at all or no, and depended not upon the King's Pleaſure: And they whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns to know this, know very well, That Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments anciently, whether ſummoned or not, might by Law meet twice a Year: But the Laws are called
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96415:107"/>
too, <hi>The King's Laws.</hi> Theſe are flattering aſcriptions; a King of <hi>England</hi> can of himſelf make no Law: For he was not conſtituted to make Laws, but to ſee thoſe Laws kept, which the People made. And you your ſelf here confeſs, That <hi>Parliaments Meet to make Laws:</hi> Wherefore the Law is alſo called the Law of the Land, and the Peoples Law. Whence King <hi>Ethelſtane</hi> in the Preface to his Laws, ſpeaking to all the People, <hi>I have granted you every thing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by your own Law.</hi> And in the form of the Oath, which the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> uſed to take before they were made Kings, The People stipulate with them thus; <hi>Will you grant thoſe Juſt Laws, which the People ſhall chuſe?</hi> The King An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>I will.</hi> And you are infinitely miſtaken in ſaying, That <hi>When there is no Parliament ſitting, the King Governs the whole ſtate of the Kingdom, to all intents and purpoſes, by a Regal Power.</hi> For he can determine nothing of any moment, with reſpect to either Peace or War; nor can he put any ſtop to the Proceedings of the Courts of Juſtice. And the Judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Swear, That they will do nothing Judicially, but according to Law, tho the King by Word, or M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

You would not trifle thus, if you had any guts in your brains.

my conſent be the High Prieſt of Tyranny; and that you may have all the Pope's Titles, you ſhall be a <hi>Servant of the Servants,</hi> not of God, but of the Court. For that Curſe pronounced upon <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſeems to ſtick as cloſe to you, as your Shirt. You call the People, <hi>a Beaſt.</hi> What are you then your ſelf? For neither can that Sacred Confiſtory, nor your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of St. <hi>Lou,</hi> exempt you its Maſter from being one of the People, nay, of the Common People; nor can make you other than what you really are, a moſt loathſome Beaſt. Indeed, the Writings of the Prophets ſhadow out to us the Monarchy and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Great Kings by the Name, and under the Reſemblance of a Great Beaſt. You ſay, That <hi>there is no mention of Parliaments held under our Kings, that reigned before</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror.</hi> It is not worth while to Jangle about a <hi>French</hi> word: The thing was always in being; and you your ſelf allow that in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, <hi>Concilia Sapientum Wittena-gemots,</hi> are mentioned. And there are wiſe Men among the Body of the People, as well as amongſt the Nobility. But <hi>in the Statute of</hi> Merton <hi>made in the twentieth year of King</hi> Henry <hi>the 3d, the Earls and Barons are only named.</hi> Thus you are always impoſed upon by words, who yet have ſpent your whole Life in nothing elſe but words; for we know very well that in that age, not only the Guardians of the Cinque-Ports, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of Cities, but even Tradeſmen are ſometimes called Barons; and without doubt they might much more reaſonably call every Member of Parliament, tho never ſo much a Commoner, by the Name of a Baron. For that in the fifty ſecond Year of the ſame King's Reign, the Commoners as well as the Lords were ſummoned, the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> and moſt other Statutes, declare in expreſs words, which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96415:108"/>
Commoners King <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> in the Preface to the Statute-Staple, calls, <hi>Magnates Comitatum; The Great Men of the Counties,</hi> as you very learnedly quote it for me; thoſe to wit, <hi>That came out of the ſeveral Counties, and ſerved for them;</hi> which number of Men conſtituted the Houſe of Commons, and neither were Lords, nor could be. Beſides, a Book more Ancient than thoſe Statutes, called, <hi>Modus habendi Parliamenta,</hi> i. e. <hi>The manner of holding Parliaments;</hi> tells us, That the King, and the Commons may hold a Parliament, and enact Laws, tho the Lords, the Biſhops are abſent; but that with the Lords, and the Biſhops, in the Abſence of the Commons, no Parliament can be held. And there's a reaſon given for it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Kings held Parliaments and Councils with their People before any Lords or Biſhops were made; beſides, the Lords ſerve for themſelves only, the Commons each for the County, City, or Burrough that ſent them. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commons in Parliament repreſent the whole Body of the Nation; in which reſpect they are more worthy, and every way preferable to the Houſe of Peers. <hi>But the power of Judicature,</hi> you ſay, <hi>never was inveſted in the Houſe of Commons.</hi> Nor was the King ever poſſeſſed of it: Remember tho, that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally all Power proceeded, and yet does proceed from the People. Which <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> excellently well ſhows in his Oration, <hi>De lege Agraria, Of the</hi> Agrarian <hi>Law.</hi> 
               <q>As all Powers, Authorities, and publick Adminiſtrations ought to be derived from the whole Body of the People; ſo thoſe of them ought in an eſpecial manner ſo to be derived, which are ordained and appointed for the Common Benefit and Intereſt of all; to which Impolyments every particular Perſon, may both give his Vote for the

Whilſt we may dwell in ſuch a light of Truth and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Age afforded, you labour in vain to blind us with the darkneſs of obſeurer times.

               </gap>e of our Anceſtors, who moſt certainly went further in the enacting of good Laws, than either the Ages they lived in, or their own Learning or Education ſeem to have been capable of; and tho ſometimes they made Laws that were none of the beſt, yet as being conſcious to themſelves of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ought to be looked upon as null and void. Whence it follows, that tho it were poſſible for you to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Statute, or other publick Sanction, which aſcribed to the King a Tyrannical Power, ſince that would be repugnant to the Will of God, to Nature, and to right Reaſon, you may learn from that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and primary Law of ours, which I have juſt now quoted, that it will be null and void. But you will never be able to find that any ſuch Right of Kings has the leaſt Foundation in our Law. Since it is plain therefore, that the Power of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was originally in the People themſelves, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96415:109"/>
that the People never did by any Royal Law part with it to the King, (for the Kings of <hi>England</hi> neither uſe to judge any Man, nor can by the Law do it, otherwiſe than according to Laws ſettled and agreed to: <hi>Fleta, Book 1. Cap.</hi> 17.) It follows, that this Power remains yet whole and entire in the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For that it was either never committed to the Houſe of Peers, or if it were, that it may lawfully be taken from them again, you your ſelf will not deny. But, <hi>It is in the King's Power,</hi> you ſay, <hi>to make a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage into a Burrough, and that into a City; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the King does in effect create thoſe that conſtitute the Commons Houſe of Parliament.</hi> But, I ſay, that even Towns and Burroughs are more Ancient than Kings; and that the People is the People, tho they ſhould live in the open Fields. And now we are extreamly well pleaſed with your <hi>Angliciſms, COUNTY COURT, THE TURNE, HUNDREDA:</hi> you have quickly learnt to count your hundred <hi>Jacobuſſes</hi> in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

The next thing you do is to trouble us with a long Diſcourſe of the Earls and the Barons, to ſhow that the King made them all; which we readily grant, and for that reaſon they were moſt commonly at the King's beck; and therefore we have done well to take care, that for the future they ſhall not be Judges of a free People? You affirm, That <hi>the Power of calling Parliaments as often as he pleaſes, and of diſſolving them when he pleaſes, has belonged to the King time out of mind.</hi> Whether ſuch a vile, mercenary Foreigner as you, who tranſcribe what ſome Fugitives dictate to you, or the expreſs Letter of our own Laws are more to be credited in this matter, we ſhall enquire hereafter. But, ſay you, <hi>there is another argument, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible one, to prove the Power of the Kings of</hi> England <hi>Superior to that of the Parliament; the King's Power is perpetual and of courſe, whereby he adminiſters the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſingly without the Parliament; that of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is extraordinary, or out of courſe, and limited to particulars only, nor can they Enact any thing ſo as to be binding in Law, without the King.</hi> Where does the great force of this argument lye? in the words of <hi>courſe and perpetual?</hi> Why many inferior Magiſtrates have an <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>perpetual</hi> power, thoſe whom we call Juſtices of Peace. Have they therefore the Supreme Power? and I have ſaid already, that the King's Power is committed to him, to take care, by interpoſing his Authority, that nothing be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, and that he may ſee to the due obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Laws, not to top his own upon us;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96415:110"/>
and conſequently that the King has no Power out of his Courts; nay all the ordinary power is rather the proples, who determine all Controverſies themſelves by Juries of Twelve Men. And hence it is that when a Malefactor is asked at his Arraignment, <hi>How will you be tried?</hi> he anſwers always according to Law and Cuſtom, <hi>by God and my Country;</hi> not by God and the King, or the King's Deputy. But the authority of the Parliament, which indeed and in truth is the Supreme power of the people committed to that Senate, if it may be called Extraordinary, it muſt be by reaſon of its Eminence and Superiority; elſe it is known they are called <hi>Ordines,</hi> and therefore cannot properly be ſaid to be <hi>extra ordinem, out of order;</hi> and if not actually, as they ſay, yet vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they have a perpetual power and authority over all Courts and ordinary Magiſtrates, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King. And now it ſeems our barbarous terms grate upon your Critical ears, forſooth! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if I had leiſure, or that it were worth my while, I could reckon up ſo many Barbariſms of yours in this one Book, as if you were to be chaſtiz'd for them as you deſerve, all the School-boys Ferulers in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> would be broken upon you; nor would you receive ſo many Pieces of Gold as that wretched Poet did of old, but a great many more Boxes o'th' ear. You ſay, <hi>'Tis a Prodigy more monſtrous than all the moſt abſurd Opinions in the world put together, that the</hi> Bedlams <hi>ſhould make a diſtinction betwixt the King's Power and his Perſon.</hi> I will not quote what every Author has ſaid upon this ſubject; but if by the words <hi>Perſonam Regis,</hi> you mean what we call in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Perſon of the King; Chryſoſtome,</hi> who was no <hi>Bedlam,</hi> might have caught you, that it is no abſurd thing to make a diſtinction betwixt that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96415:111"/>
and his power; for that Father explains the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles command of being ſubject to the Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to be meant of the thing, the Power it ſelf, and not of the Perſons of the Magiſtrates. And why may not I ſay that a King, who acts any thing contrary to Law, acts ſo far forth as a private perſon, or a Tyrant, and not in the capacity of a King inveſted with a Legal Authority? If you do not know that there may be in one and the ſame man more <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Capacities</hi> than one, and that thoſe Capacities may in thought and conception be ſevered from the man himſelf, you are altogether ignorant both of <hi>Latin</hi> and Common ſenſe.

Princes; I will now alledg out of our ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a few things indeed of many, but ſuch as will make it evident that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lately tried their King according to the ſetled Laws of the Realm, and the Cuſtoms of their Anceſtors. After the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> quitted this Iſland, the <hi>Britains</hi> for about forty years were <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> and without any Kings at all. Of whom thoſe they firſt ſet up, ſome they put to death. And for that, <hi>Gildas</hi> reprehends them, not as you do, for killing their Kings, but for killing them uncondemned, and (to uſe his own words) <hi>Non pro veri examinatione,</hi> without inquiring into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact. <hi>Vortigerne</hi> was for his Inceſtuous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with his own Daughter, condemn'd, as <hi>Nenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> informs us, the moſt ancient of all our Hiſtorians next to <hi>Gildas,</hi> by St. <hi>German, and a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Britains,</hi> and his Son <hi>Vortimer</hi> ſet up in his ſtead. This came to paſs not long after St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s death, which is enough to diſcover how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>utilous you are, to ſay, as you have done, that it was a <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> by name, who firſt held the lawfulneſs of judging Kings. About the year of our Lord 600, <hi>Morcantius,</hi> who then Reign'd in <hi>Wales,</hi> was by <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> condemn'd to Exile, for the Murther of his Uncle, though he got the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence off by beſtowing ſome Lands upon the Church. Come we now to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whoſe Laws we have, and therefore I ſhall quote none of their Preſidents. Remember that the <hi>Saxons</hi> were of a <hi>German</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, who neither inveſted their Kings with any abſolute, unlimited power, and conſulted in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the more weighty affairs of Government; whence we may perceive that in the time of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors <hi>Parliaments</hi> (the name it ſelf only excepted) had the Supreme Authority.

Other Laws K. <hi>Alfred</hi> made, <hi>by the advice</hi> in like manner of <hi>his Wiſe-men,</hi> and he ſays himſelf, <hi>That it was by the conſent of them all, that they were commanded to be obſerved.</hi> From theſe and many other like places, it is as clear as the Sun, that choſen Men even from amongſt the Common People, were Members of the Supreme Councils, unleſs we muſt believe that no Men are wiſe, but the Nobility. We have likewiſe a very Ancient Book, called the <hi>Mirror of Juſtices,</hi> in which we are told, That the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when they firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and choſe themſelves Kings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an Oath of them, to ſubmit to the Judgment of the Law, as much as any of their Subjects, <hi>Cap. 1. Sect.</hi> 2. In the ſame place 'tis ſaid, that it is but juſt that the King have his Peers in Parliament, to take Cognizance of wrongs done by the King, or the Queen; and that there was a Law made in King <hi>Alored</hi>'s time, that Parliaments ſhould be holden twice a year at <hi>London,</hi> or oftner, if need were. Which Law, when through neglect it grew into diſuſe, was revived by two Statutes in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time. And in another ancient Manuſcript, called <hi>Modus tenendi Parliamenta,</hi> we read thus, <q>If the King diſſolve the Parliament before they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht the buſineſs, for which the Council was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd, he is guilty of Perjury; and ſhall be reputed to have broken his Coronation Oath. </q>For how can he be ſaid to grant thoſe good Laws, which the people 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96415:112"/>
chuſe, as he is ſworn to do, if he hinders the People from chuſing them, either by ſummoning Parliaments ſeldomer, or by diſſolving them ſooner than the Publick Affairs require, or admit. And that Oath, which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> take at their Coronation, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been looked upon by our Lawyers, as a moſt ſacred Law. And what remedy can be found to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the great Dangers of the whole State (which is the very end of ſummoning Parliaments) if that Great and Auguſt Aſſembly may be diſſolved at the pleaſure many times of a ſilly, head-ſtrong King? To abſent himſelf from them, is certainly leſs than to diſſolve them; and yet by our Laws, as that <hi>Modus</hi> lays them down, the King neither can, nor ought to abſent himſelf from his Parliament, unleſs he be really indiſpoſed in Health; nor then neither, till twelve of the Peers have been with him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his Body, and give the Parliament an account of his Indiſpoſition: Is this like the Carriage of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to a Maſter? On the other hand, the Houſe of Commons, without whom there can be no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment held, tho ſummoned by the King, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and having made a Seceſſion, expoſtulate with the King concerning Male-adminiſtration, as the ſame Book has it. But, which is the greateſt thing of all, amongſt the Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> there is one very excellent, relating to the Kingly Office; which Office, if the King do not diſcharge as he ought; Then, ſays the Law, <hi>He ſhall not retain ſo much as the Name of a King.</hi> And leſt theſe words ſhould not be ſufficiently underſtood, the Example of <hi>Chilperic</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> is ſubjoyn'd, whom the People for that Cauſe depoſed. And that by this Law a wicked King is liable to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Sword of King <hi>Edward,</hi> called <hi>Curtana,</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:96415:113"/>
denotes to us, which the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> uſed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Solemn Proceſſion at a Coronation; <hi>A to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> ſays <hi>Mathew Paris, that he has Authority by Law to puniſh the King, if he will not do his Duty:</hi> and the Sword is hardly ever made uſe of but in Capital Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. This ſame Law, together with other Laws of that good King <hi>Edward</hi> did <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror ratifie in the Fourth Year of his Reign, and in a very full Council held at <hi>Verulam,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it with a moſt ſolemn Oath: And by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he not only extinguiſh'd his Right of Conqueſt, if he ever had any over us, but ſubjected himſelf to be judged according to the Tenor of this very Law. And his Son <hi>Henry</hi> ſwore to the obſervance of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, and of this amongſt the reſt; and upon theſe only terms it was, that he was choſen King, whilſt his Elder Brother <hi>Robert</hi> was alive. The ſame Oath was taken by all ſucceeding Kings, before they were Crowned. Hence our Ancient and Famous Lawyer <hi>Bracton,</hi> in his firſt Book, Chap. 8. <hi>There is no King in the caſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>where Will rules <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>; and Law does not take place.</hi> And in his Third Book, Chap. 9. <hi>A King is a King ſo long as he Rules well; he becomes a Tyrant when he oppreſſes the People committed to his Charge.</hi> And in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>The King ought to uſe the Power of Law and Right, as God's Miniſter and Vice-gerent; the Power of wrong is the Devils, and not Gods; when the King turns aſide to do Injuſtice, he is the Miniſter of the Devil.</hi> The very ſame words almoſt another Ancient Lawyer has, who was the Author of the Book, called <hi>Fleta;</hi> both of them remembred that truly Royal Law of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that Fundamental Maxim in our Law, which I have formerly mentioned, by which nothing is to be accounted a Law, that is contrary to the Laws of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96415:113"/>
God, or of Reaſon; no more than a Tyrant can be ſaid to be a King, or a Miniſter of the Devil, a Miniſter of God. Since therefore the Law is chiefly right Reaſon; if we are bound to obey a King, and a Miniſter of God; by the very ſame Reaſon, and the very ſame Law, we ought to reſiſt a Tyrant, and a Miniſter of the Devil. And becauſe Controverſies ariſe oftner about Names than Things; the ſame Authors tell us, that a King of <hi>England,</hi> tho he have not loſt the Name of a King, yet is as liable to be judged, and ought ſo to be, as any of the Common People. <hi>Bracton,</hi> Book 1. Chap. 8. <hi>Fleta,</hi> Book 1. Chap. 17. <hi>No Man ought to be greater than the King in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice; but he himſelf ought to be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as the leaſt in receiving Juſtice,</hi> ſi peccat, <hi>if he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</hi> Others read it, <hi>ſi petat.</hi> Since our Kings therefore are liable to be judged, whether by the Name of Tyrants, or of Kings, it muſt not be difficult to aſſign their Legal Judges. Nor will it be amiſs to conſult the ſame Authors upon that point. <hi>Bracton,</hi> Book 1. Chap. 16. <hi>Fleta,</hi> Book 1. Chap. 17. <hi>The King has his Superiors in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The Law, by which he is made King, and his Court, to wit, the Earls, and the Barons:</hi> Comites <hi>(Earls) are as much as to ſay, Companions; and he that has a Companion, has a Maſter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the King will be without a Bridle, that is, not govern by Law, they ought to bridle him.</hi> That the Commons are comprehended in the word Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, has been ſhown already; nay, and in the Books of our Ancient Laws they are fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently ſaid to have been called Peers of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment; and eſpecially in the <hi>Modus tenendi,</hi> &amp;c.

And it is but reaſonable they ſhould, for they Vote for a whole County, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Earls for themſelves only. And who can but perceive that thoſe <hi>Patent Earls,</hi> whom you call Earls made by <hi>Writ</hi> (ſince we have now none that hold their Earldoms by Tenure) are very unfit Perſons to try the King, who conferr'd their Honours upon them? Since therefore by our Law, as appears by that old Book, call'd <hi>The Mirror,</hi> the King has his Peers, who in Parliament have Cognizance of wrongs done by the King to any of his People; and ſince it is notoriouſly known, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Man in the Kingdom may even in inferior Courts have the benefit of the Law againſt the King himſelf in Caſe of any Injury, or Wrong ſuſtained; how much more Conſonant to Juſtice, how much more neceſſary is it, that in caſe the King oppreſs all his People, there ſhould be ſuch as have Authority not only to reſtrain him, and keep him within Bounds, but to Judge and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him? For that Government muſt needs be very ill, and moſt ridiculouſly conſtituted, in which remedy is provided in caſe of little Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done by the Prince to private Perſons, and no Remedy, no Redreſs for greater, no care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the ſafety of the whole; no Proviſion made to the contrary, but that the King may without any Law ruin all his Subjects, when at the ſame time he cannot by Law, ſo much as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96415:114"/>
hurt any one of them. And ſince I have ſhown that it is neither good manners, nor expedient, that the Lords ſhould be the Kings Judges; it follows, that the Power of Judicature in that caſe, does wholly, and by very good Right, belong to the Commons, who are both Peers of the Realm, and Barons, and have the Power and Authority of all the People committed to them. For ſince (as we find it expreſly in our written Law, which I have already cited) the Commons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the King, make a good Parliament without either Lords or Biſhops, becauſe before either Lords or Biſhops had a being, Kings held Parliaments with their Commons only; by the very ſame reaſon the Commons apart muſt have the Sovereign Power without the King, and a Power of Judging the King himſelf, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ever was a King, they in the Name of the whole Body of the Nation held Councils and Parliaments, had the Power of Judicature, made Laws, and made the Kings themſelves; not to Lord it over the People, but to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter their publick Affairs. Whom if the King, inſtead of ſo doing ſhall endeavour to injure and oppreſs, our Law pronounces him from time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not ſo much as to retain the Name of a King, to be no ſuch thing as a King; and if he be no King, what need we trouble our ſelves to find out Peers for him? For being then by all good Men adjudged to be a Tyrant, there are none but who are Peers good enough for him, and proper enough to pronounce Sentence of Death upon him judicially. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, I think I have ſufficiently proved what
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96415:115"/>
I undertook, by many Authorities, and written Laws; to wit, that ſince the Commons have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by very good Right to try the King, and ſince they have actually tried him, and put him to Death, for the miſchief he had done both in Church and State, and without all hope of amendment, they have done nothing therein but what was juſt and regular, for the Intereſt of the State, in diſcharging of their Truſt, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Dignity, and according to the Laws of the Land. And I cannot upon this occaſion, but congratulate my ſelf with the Honour of having had ſuch Anceſtors, who founded this Government with no leſs prudence, and in as much Liberty as the moſt worthy of the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> ever ſounded any of theirs; and they muſt needs, if they have any knowledg of our Affairs, rejoyce over their Poſterity, who when they were almoſt reduced to Slavery, yet with ſo much Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Courage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>I Think by this time 'tis ſufficiently evident that Kings of <hi>England</hi> may be judged even by the Laws of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> and that they have their proper Judges; which was the thing to be proved. What do you do farther? (for whereas you repeat many things that you have ſaid before I do not intend to repeat the anſwers that I have given them), <hi>'Tis an eaſie thing to demonſtrate even from the nature of the things for which Parliaments are ſummon'd, that the King is above the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The Parliament,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is wont to be aſſembled upon weighty affairs, ſuch as wherein the ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and of the people, is concerned.</hi> If therefore the King call Parliaments together, not for his own concerns, but thoſe of the Nation, nor to ſettle thoſe neither, but by their own conſent, at their own diſcretion, what is he more than a Miniſter, and as it were an agent for the people? ſince without their Suffrages that are choſen by the people, he cannot E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> the leaſt thing whatſoever, either with relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any body elſe? Which proves likewiſe that 'tis the King's duty to call Parliaments whenever the people deſire it; ſince the peoples and not the King's concerns are to be treated of that Aſſembly, and to be ordered as they ſee cauſe. For although the King's aſſent be required for faſhion ſake, which in leſſer matters, that concerned the welfare of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons only, he might refuſe, and uſe that form, <hi>the King will adviſe;</hi> yet in thoſe greater affairs that concern'd the publick ſafety, and liberty of the people in general, he had no Negative voice; for it would have been againſt his Coronation Oath to deny
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96415:116"/>
his aſſent in ſuch caſes, which was as binding to him as any Law could be, and againſt the chief article of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> Cap. 29. <q>We will not deny to any man, nor will we delay to render to every man Right and Juſtice.</q> Shall it not be in the King's power to deny Juſtice, and ſhall it be in his power to deny the Enacting of Juſt Laws? Could he not deny Juſtice to any particular perſon, and could he to all his people? Could he not do it in inferior Courts, and could he in the Supreme Court of all? Or, can any King be ſo arrogant as to pretend to know what's juſt and profitable better than the whole body of the people? Eſpecially, ſince <q>he is created and choſen for this very end and purpoſe, to do Juſtice to all, as <hi>Braction</hi> ſays, <hi>Lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 9. that is to do Juſtice according to ſuch Laws, as the people agree upon. </q>Hence is what we find in our Records, <hi>7 H</hi> 4. <hi>Rott. Parl. num.</hi> 59. <q>The King has no Prerogative that derogates from Juſtice and Equity.</q> And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly when Kings have refuſed to confirm Acts of Parliament, to wit, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and ſome others, our Anceſtors have brought them to it by force of Arms. And yet our Lawyers never were of opinion that thoſe Laws were leſs valid, or leſs binding, ſince the King was forced to aſſent to no more than what he ought in Juſtice to have aſſented to voluntarily, and without conſtraint. Whileſt you go about to prove that Kings of other Nations have been as much under the power of their Senates or Counſels, as our Kings were, you do not argue us into Slavery, but them into Liberty. In which you do but that over again, that you have from the very beginning of your Diſcourſe, and which ſome ſilly Leguleians now and then do, to argue unawares againſt their own Clients. But you ſay, <hi>VVe confeſs that the King where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96415:116"/>
he be, yet is ſuppoſed ſtill to be preſent in his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by vertue of his power; inſomuch that whatever is tranſacted there, is ſuppoſed to be done by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and then as if you had got ſome petty bribe or ſmall morſel, and tickled with the remembrance of your Purſe of Gold, <hi>We take,</hi> ſay you, <hi>what they give us;</hi> and take a Halter then, for I'm ſure you deſerve it. But we do not give it for granted, which is the thing you thought would follow from thence, <hi>That therefore that Court acts only by vertue of a Delegated Power from the King.</hi> For when we ſay that the Regal Power, be it what it will, cannot be abſent from the Parliament, do we thereby acknowledg that Power to be Supreme? does not the King's Authority ſeem rather to be transferred to the Parliament, and, as being the leſſer of the two, to be compriſed in the greater? Certainly if the Parliament may reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ind the King's Acts, whether he will or no, and revoke Priviledges granted by him, to whomſoever they be granted. If they may ſet bounds to his Prerogative, as they ſee cauſe, if they may regulate his yearly Revenue, and the Expences of his Court, his Retinue, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the concerns of his Houſhold; If they may remove his moſt intimate Friends and Counſellors, and as it were pluck them out of his boſom, and bring them to condign puniſhment: Finally, if any Subject may by Law appeal from the King to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, all which things, that they may lawfully be done, and have been frequently practiſed, both our Hiſtories and Records, and the moſt eminent of our Lawyers aſſure us, I ſuppoſe no man in his right wits will deny the Authority of the Parliament to be ſuperiour to that of the King. For even in an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum</hi> the Authority of the Parliament is in being, and (than which nothing is more common in our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories)
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96415:117"/>
they have often made a free Choice of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, without any regard to an Hereditary deſcent. In ſhort, the Parliament is the Supreme Councel of the Nation, conſtituted and appointed by a moſt free people, and armed with ample power and authority, for this end and purpoſe; <hi>viz.</hi> to conſult together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt weighty affairs of the Kingdom; the King was created to put their Laws in execution.

ages, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is the head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to the end that you may, as far as in you lies, bring in the Biſhops again, his Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and Table-Companions, grown ſo of late, to rob and Tyrannize in the Church of God, whom God himſelf hath depoſed and degraded, whoſe very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you had heretofore aſſerted in Print that it ought to be rooted out of the world, as deſtructive of and pernicious to the Chriſtian Religion. What Apoſtate did ever ſo ſhamefully and wickedly deſert as this man has done, I do not ſay his own, which indeed never was any, but the Chriſtian Doctrine which he had formerly aſſerted? <hi>The Biſhops being put down, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King, and by his permiſſion held Plea of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cauſes, upon whom,</hi> ſay you, <hi>will that Juriſdiction devolve?</hi> O Villain, have ſome regard at leaſt to your own Conſcience; Remember before it be too late, if at leaſt this admonition of mine come not too late, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this mocking the Holy Spirit of God is an inexpiable crime, and will not be left unpuniſht. Stop at laſt, and ſet bounds to your fury, leſt the wrath of God lay hold upon you ſuddenly, for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to deliver the flock of God, his Anointed ones, that are not to be touched, to Enemies and cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, to be cruſht and trampled on again, from whom himſelf by a high and ſtretched out arm had ſo lately delivered them; and from whom you your ſelf maintained that they ought to be delivered, I know not whether for any good of theirs, or in order to the hardning of your own heart, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your own damnation. If the Biſhops have no right to Lord it over the Church, certainly much leſs have Kings, whatever the Laws of men may be to the contrary. For they that know any thing of the Goſpel know thus much, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96415:118"/>
of the Church is altogether Divine and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and no Civil Conſtitution. Whereas you ſay, That <hi>in Secular Affairs, the Kings of</hi> England <hi>have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had the Sovereign Power.</hi> Our Laws do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly declare that to be falſe. Our Courts of Juſtice are erected and ſuppreſſed, not by the King's Authority, but that of the Parliament; and yet in any of them, the meaneſt Subject might go to Law with the Ring; nor is it a rare thing for the Judges to give Judgment againſt him; which if the King ſhould endeavour to obſtruct by any Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Mandate, or Letters, the Judges were bound by Law, and by their Oaths not to obey him, but to reject ſuch Inhibitions as null and void in Law; the King could not impriſon any man, or ſeize his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as forfeited; he could not puniſh any man, not ſummoned to appear in Court, where not the King but the ordinary Judges gave Sentence; which they frequently did, as I have ſaid, againſt the King. Hence our <hi>Bractan,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 9. <hi>The Regal Power,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is according to Law; he has no power to do any wrong, nor can the King do any thing but what the Law warrants.</hi> Thoſe Lawyers that you have conſulted, men that have lately fled their Countrey, may tell you another tale, and acquaint you with ſome Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, not very Ancient neither, but made in King <hi>Edward</hi> 4th's, King <hi>Henry 6th</hi>'s, and King <hi>Edward 6th</hi>'s days; but they did not conſider, That what power ſoever thoſe Statutes gave the King, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him by Authority of Parliament; ſo that he was beholding to them for it; and the ſame power that conferr'd it, might at pleaſure reſume it. How comes it to paſs that ſo acute a diſputant as you, ſhould ſuffer your ſelf to be impoſed upon to that degree, as to make uſe of that very Argument to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96415:118"/>
prove the King's Power to be Abſolute and Supreme, than which nothing proves more clearly, That it is ſubordinate to that of the Parliament? Our Records of the greateſt Authority with us, declare, That our Kings owe all their Power, not to any Right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, of Conqueſt, or Succeſſion, but to the people. So in the Parliament Rolls of King <hi>Hen. 4. numb.</hi> 108. we read, That the Kingly Office and Power was granted by the Commons to King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> and before him, to his Predeceſſor King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> juſt as Kings uſe to grant Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners places, and Lieutenantſhips to their Deputies, by Edicts and Patents. Thus the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ordered expreſly to be entred upon record, <q>That they had <hi>granted to King</hi> Richard <hi>to uſe the ſame good Liberty that the Kings of</hi> England <hi>before him had uſed:</hi>
               </q> Which becauſe that King abuſed to the ſubverſion of the Laws, and <hi>contrary to his Oath at his Coronation,</hi> the ſame perſons that granted him that power, took it back again, and depoſed him. The ſame men, as appears by the ſame Record, declared in open Parliament, That having confidence in the <q>Prudence and Moderation of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> they will and enact, That he enjoy the ſame Royal Authority that his Anceſtors enjoyed.</q> Which if it had been any other than in the nature of a Truſt, as this was, either thoſe Houſes of Parliament were fooliſh and vain, to give what was none of their own, or thoſe Kings that were willing to receive as from them, what was already theirs, were too inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious both to themſelves and their Poſterity; neither of which is likely. <hi>A third part of the Regal Power,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is converſant about the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> which our Kings were bound to ſwear that they would maintain, make this appear beyond all exception, in the Chapter <hi>De He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retochus, viz.</hi> 
               <q>That there were certain Officers appointed in every Province and County through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, that were called <hi>Heretochs,</hi> in Latin, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And in the <hi>6th.</hi> Law, Caſtles, Boroughs, and Cities, were firſt built for the Defence of the people, and therefore ought to be maintained free and entire, by all ways and means.</q> What then? Shall Towns and Places of Strength in times of Peace be guarded againſt Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by common Councils of the ſeveral Places, and ſhall they not be defended in dangerous times of War, againſt both Domeſtick and Foreign Hoſtility, by the common Council of the whole Nation? If this be not granted, there can be <hi>no Freedom,</hi> no <hi>Integrity,</hi> no <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the guarding of them; nor ſhall we obtain any of thoſe ends, for which the Law it ſelf tells us, that Towns and Fortreſſes were at firſt founded. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our Anceſtors were willing to put any thing into the King's power, rather than their Arms, and the Gariſons of their Towns; conceiving that to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor worſe, than betraying their Liberty to the Fury and Exorbitancy of their Princes. Of which there are ſo very many inſtances in our Hiſtories, and thoſe ſo generally known, that it would be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to mention any of them here. But <hi>the King owes protection to his Subjects; and how can be protect them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have Men and Arms at Command?</hi> But, ſay I, he had all this for the good of the Kingdom, as has been ſaid, not for the deſtruction of his people, and the ruin of the Kingdom: Which in King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi>'s time, one <hi>Leonard,</hi> a Learned man in thoſe days, in an Aſſembly of Biſhops, told <hi>Ruſtandus,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio and the King's Procurator, in theſe words; <q>All Churches are the Pope's, as all Temporal things are ſaid to be the King's, for Defence and Protection, not his in Propriety and Ownerſhip, as we ſay; they are his to De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Law of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> is to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;</q>and what does this import more than a Truſt?  Does this look like Abſolute Power? Such a kind of Power a Commander of an Army always has, that is, a Delegated Power; and yet both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad he is never the leſs able to defend the people that chuſe him. Our Parliaments would anciently have contended with our Kings about their Liberty and the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> to very little purpoſe; and '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>would have been an unequal match betwixt the Kings and them, if they had been of opinion, that that the Power of the Sword belonged to him alone; for how unjuſt Laws ſoever their Kings would have impoſed upon them, their <hi>Charter,</hi> tho never ſo <hi>great,</hi> would have been a weak Defence againſt Force. But ſay you, <hi>What would the Parliament be the better for the Militia, ſince without the King's Aſſent, they cannot raiſe the leaſt Earthing from the people towards the maintaining it?</hi> Take you no thought for that: For in the firſt place you go upon a falſe ſuppoſition, <hi>That Parliaments cannot impoſe Taxes without the King's Aſſent,</hi> upon the people that ſend them, and whoſe concerns they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake. In the next place, you that are ſo officious an enquirer into other mens matters, cannot but have heard, That the people of their own accord, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Plate to be melted down, raiſed a great Sum of Money towards the carrying on of this War againſt the King. Then you mention the largeneſs of our King's Revenue: You mention over and over again <hi>Five Hundred and Forty Thouſands;</hi> That <hi>theſe of our Kings that have been eminent for their Bounty and Liberality, have uſed to give Large Boons out of their own Partimony.</hi> This you were glad to hear; 'twas by this Charm, that thoſe Traytors to their Countrey al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured you, as <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to curſe the people of God, and exclaim againſt the Judicial Diſpenſations of his Providence. You Fool! what was that unjuſt and violent King the better for ſuch abundance of Wealth? What are you the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it? Who have been no partaker of any part of it, that I can hear of, (how great hopes ſoever you may have conceiv'd of being vaſtly enriched by it) but only of a Hundred pieces of Gold, in a Purſe wrought with beads. Take that reward of thine Iniquity, <hi>Balaam,</hi> which thou haſt loved, and enjoy it.

For a number of Soldiers given to the King by the people, is one thing, and the ſole power of the Militia is quite another thing; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does not allow that Kings ought to be maſters of, and that in this very place which you have quoted: <hi>He ought,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to have ſo many armed men about him, as to make him ſtronger than any one man, than many men got together; but he muſt not be ſtronger than all the people,</hi> Polit. lib. 3. cap. 4. Elſe inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting them, it would be in his power to ſubject both People and Laws to himſelf. For this is the difference betwixt a King and a Tyrant: A King, by conſent of the Senate and People, has about him
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96415:121"/>
ſo many Armed men, as to enable him to reſiſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſuppreſs Seditions. A Tyrant, againſt the Will both of Senate and People, gets as great a number as he can, either of Enemies, or profligate Subjects to ſide with him againſt the Senate and the People. The Parliament therefore allowed the King, as they did whatever he had beſides, the ſetting up of a <hi>Standard;</hi> not to wage War againſt his own people, but to defend them againſt ſuch as the Parliament ſhould declare Enemies to the State: If he acted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, himſelf was to be accounted an Enemy; ſince according to the very Law of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a more ſacred Law than that, the Law of Nature it ſelf, he loſt the name of a King, and was no longer ſuch. Whence <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Philip.</hi> 
               <q>He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits his Command in the Army, and Intereſt in the Government, that employs them againſt the State.</q> Neither could the King compel thoſe that held of him by Knight-Service, to ſerve him in any other War, than ſuch as was made by conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is evident by many Statutes. So for Cuſtoms and other Subſidies for the maintenance of the Navy; the King could not exact them without an Act of Parliament; as was reſolved about twelve years ago, by the ableſt of our Lawyers, when the King's Authority was at the height. And long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> an Eminent Lawyer, and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> 
               <q>The King of <hi>England, ſays he,</hi> can neither alter the Laws, nor exact Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without the people's conſent;</q> nor can any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies be brought from Antiquity, to prove the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> England to have been <hi>merely Regal.</hi> 
               <q>The King, ſays <hi>Bracton,</hi> has a Juriſdiction over all his Subjects;</q> that is, in his Courts of Juſtice, where Juſtice is adminiſtred in the King's name indeed, but

according to our own Laws. <q>All are ſubject to the King; that is, every particular man is;</q> and ſo <hi>Bracton</hi> explains himſelf in the places that I have cited. What follows is but turning the ſame ſtone over and over again; (at which ſport I believe you are able to tire <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphus</hi> himſelf), and is ſufficiently anſwered by what has been ſaid already. For the reſt, if our Parliaments have ſometimes complimented good Kings with ſubmiſſive expreſſions, tho neither favouring of Flattery nor Slavery, thoſe are not to be accounted due to Tyrants, nor ought to prejudice the peoples Right; good manners and civility do not infringe Liberty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you cite out of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> and others, <q>That the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> is an <hi>Abſolute Kingdom;</hi>
               </q> that is ſaid with reſpect to any Foreign Prince, or the Emperor; becauſe as <hi>Cambden</hi> ſays, <q>It is not under the Patronage of the Emperor;</q> but both of them affirm that the Government of <hi>England</hi> reſides not in the King alone, but in a Body Politick. Whence <hi>Forteſcue</hi> in his Book de <hi>laud. leg. Angl. cap.</hi> 9. <q>The King of <hi>England, ſays he,</hi> governs his people, not by a merely Regal, but a Political power; for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> are govern'd by Laws of their own making.</q> Foreign Authors were not ignorant of this: Hence <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> a Grave Author, in the <hi>Fifth Book of his Commentaries,</hi> 
               <q>Of all the Kingdoms of the earth, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that I have any knowledge of, there is none in my opinion, where the Government is more moderate, where the King has leſs power of hurting his people, than in <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> Finally, <hi>'Tis ridiculous,</hi> ſay you, <hi>for them to affirm that Kingdoms were ancienter than Kings; which is as much as if they ſhould ſay, that there was Light before the Sun was created.</hi> But with your good leave, Sir, we do not ſay that Kingdoms, but that the people were before Kings. In
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96415:122"/>
the mean time, who can be more ridiculous than you, who deny there was Light before the Sun had a being. You pretend to a curioſity in other mens matters, and have forgot the very firſt things that were taught you. <hi>You wonder how they that have ſeen the King upon his Throne, at a Seſſion of Parliament</hi> (ſub aureo &amp; ſerico Coelo, <hi>under a golden and ſilken Heaven) under a Canopy of State, ſhould ſo much as make a queſtion whether the Majeſty reſided in him, or in the Parliament?</hi> They are certainly hard of belief, whom ſo lucid an Argument coming down from Heaven, cannot convince.

while we had Kings, but was a perfect and entire Parliament of it ſelf, without the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords, much more without the Biſhops. But, <hi>The whole Houſe of Commons themſelves were not admitted to have to do with the Tryal of the King.</hi> To wit, that part of them was not admitted, that openly revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in their Minds and Councels; whom, tho they ſtil'd him their King, yet they had ſo often act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, as an Enemy. The Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Deputies ſent from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the 13th of <hi>January,</hi> 1645. wrote to the King, in Anſwer to a Letter of his, by which he deſired a deceitful Truce, and that he might Treat with them at <hi>London;</hi> that they could not admit him into that City, till he had made Satisfaction to the State for the Civil War that he had raiſed in the three Kingdoms, and for the Deaths of ſo many of his Subjects ſlain by his Order; and till he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to a true and firm Peace upon ſuch Terms as the Parliaments of both Kingdoms had offered him ſo often already, and ſhould offer him again. He on the other hand either refuſed to hear, or by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Anſwers eluded their juſt and equal Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, tho moſt humbly preſented to him ſeven times over. The Parliament at laſt, after ſo many years patience, leſt the King ſhould over-turn the State by his Wiles and Delays, when in Priſon, which he could not ſubdue in the Field, and leſt the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd Enemy pleaſed with our Diviſions, ſhould recover himſelf, and triumph unexpectedly over his Conquerors, vote that for the future, they would have no regard to him, that they would ſend him no more Propoſals, nor receive any from him: After which vote, there were found even ſome Members of Parliament, who out of the hatred they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96415:124"/>
bore that invincible Army, whoſe Glory they envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which they would have had disbanded, and ſent home with diſgrace, after they had deſerved ſo well of their Nation, and out of a ſervile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with ſome Seditious Miniſters, finding their opportunity, when many, whom they knew to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded than themſelves, having been ſent by the Houſe it ſelf to ſuppreſs the Presbyterians, who began already to be Turbulent, were abſent in the ſeveral Counties, with a ſtrange Levity, not to ſay perfidiouſneſs, Vote, that that inveterate Enemy of the State, who had nothing of a King, but the Name, without giving any Satisfaction or Security, ſhould be brought back to <hi>London,</hi> and reſtored to his Dignity and Government, as if he had deſerved well of the Nation by what he had done. So that they preferr'd the King before their Religion, their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and that very celebrated Covenant of theirs. What did they do in the mean time, who were ſound themſelves, and ſaw ſuch pernicious Councils on foot? Ought they therefore to have been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nation, and not provide for its ſafety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Infection had ſpread it ſelf even in their own Houſe? But, who ſecluded thoſe ill affected Members? <hi>The Engliſh Army,</hi> you ſay: ſo that it was not an Army of Foreigners, but of moſt Valiant, and Faithful, Honeſt Natives, whoſe Officers for the moſt part were Members of Parliament; and whom thoſe good ſecluded Members would have ſecluded their Country, and baniſhed into <hi>Ireland;</hi> while in the mean time the <hi>Scots,</hi> whoſe Alliance begin to be doubtful, had very conſiderable Forces in four of our Northern Counties, and kept Gariſons in the beſt Towns of thoſe Parts, and had the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Cuſtody; whileſt they likewiſe encouraged
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96415:125"/>
the tumultuating of thoſe of their own Faction, who did more than threaten the Parliament, both in City and Country, and through whoſe means not only a Civil, but a War with <hi>Scotland</hi> too ſhortly after brake out. If it has been always accounted praiſe-worthy in private Men to aſſiſt the State, and promote the publick Good, whether by Advice or Action; our Army ſure was in no fault, who being ordered by the Parliament to come to Town, obey'd and came, and when they were come, quell'd with eaſe, the Faction and Uproar of the King's Party, who ſometimes threatned the Houſe it ſelf. For things were brought to that paſs, that of neceſſity either we muſt be run down by them, or they by us. They had on their ſide moſt of the Shopkeepers and Handicrafts-men of <hi>London,</hi> and generally thoſe of the Miniſters, that were moſt factious. On our ſide was the Army, whoſe Fidelity, Moderation, and Courage were ſufficiently known. It being in our Power by their means to retain our Liberty, our State, our Common-ſafty, do you think we had not been fools to have loſt all by our negligence and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? They who had had places of Command in the Kings Army, after their Party were ſubdued, had laid down their Arms indeed againſt their Wills, but continued Enemies to us in their hearts; and they flock'd to Town, and were here watching all opportunities of renewing the War. With theſe Men, tho they were the greateſt Enemies they had in the World, and thirſted after their Blood, did the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> becauſe they were not permitted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a Civil, as well as an Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction over all others, hold ſecret Correſpondence, and took meaſures very unworthy of what they had
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96415:125"/>
formerly both ſaid and done; and they came to that Spleen at laſt, that they would rather enthral them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the King again, than admit their own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to ſhare in their Liberty, which they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had purchaſed at the price of their own Blood; they choſe rather to be Lorded over once more by a Tyrant, polluted with the Blood of ſo many of his own Subjects, and who was enraged, and breath'd out nothing but revenge againſt thoſe of them that were left, than endure their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Friends to be upon the ſquare with them. The <hi>Independents,</hi> as they are called, were the only men, that from firſt to laſt kept to their point, and knew what uſe to make of their Victory: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, (and wiſely, in my opinion), to make him King again, being then an Enemy; who when he was their King, had made himſelf their Enemy: Nor were they ever the leſs averſe to a Peace, but they very prudently dreaded a new War, or a perpetual ſlavery under the name of a Peace.

For you and I are arguing, not writing Hiſtories, and both ſides will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our reaſons, but not our narrative; and indeed the nature of the things themſelves is ſuch, that they cannot be related as they ought to be, but in a ſet Hiſtory; ſo that I think it better, as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaid of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> Rather to ſay nothing at all, than to ſay but a little of things of this weight and importance, Nay, and I ſcorn ſo much as to mention the praiſes of great men, and of Almighty God himſelf, (who in ſo

wonderful a courſe of Affairs ought to be frequently acknowledged) amongſt your Slanders and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. I'le therefore only pick out ſuch things as ſeem to have any colour of argument. You ſay, <hi>the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Scotch <hi>promiſed by a Solemn Covenant, to preſerve the Majeſty of the King.</hi> But you omit upon what terms they promiſed it; to wit, if it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the ſafety of their Religion and their Liberty. To both which, Religion and Liberty, that King was ſo averſe to his laſt breath, and watcht all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gaining advantages upon them, that it was evident that his life was dangerous to their Religion, and the certain ruin of their Liberty. But then you fall upon the King's Judges again: <hi>If we conſider the thing aright, the concluſion of this abominable action muſt be imputed to the</hi> Independents, <hi>yet ſo as the</hi> Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>may juſtly challenge the glory of its beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</hi> Hark, ye <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> what good has it done you? how is your Innocence and Loyalty the more cleared by your ſeeming ſo much to abhor the putting the King to death? You your ſelves in the opinion of this everlaſting talkative Advocate of the King, your <hi>accuſer, went more than half-way towards it; you were ſeen acting the fourth Act and more, in this Tragedy; you may juſtly be charged with the King's death, ſince you ban'd the way to it; 'twas you and only you that laid his head upon the Block.</hi> Wo be to you in the firſt place, if ever <hi>Charles</hi> his Poſterity recover the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> aſſure your ſelves, you are like to be put in the Black Liſt. But pay your Vows to God, and love your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who have delivered you, who have prevented that calamity from falling upon you, who have ſaved you from inevitable ruin, tho againſt your own wills. You are accuſed likewiſe for that <hi>ſome years ago you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by ſundry Petitions to leſſen the Kings authority,

that you publiſht ſome ſcandalous expreſſions of the King himſelf in the Papers you preſented him with in the name of the Parliament;</hi> to wit, <hi>in that Declaration of the Lords and Commons of the 26th. of May 1642, you declar'd openly in ſome mad Poſitions that breath'd nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, what your thoughts were of the King's authority:</hi> Hotham <hi>by order of Parliament ſhut the Gates of</hi> Hull <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King; you had a mind to make a trial by this firſt act of Rebellion how much the King would bear.</hi> What could this man ſay more if it were his deſign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the minds of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men to one another, and alienate them wholly from the King? for he gives them here to underſtand, that if ever the King be brought back, they muſt not only expect to be puniſht for his Father's death, but for the Petitions they made long ago, and ſome acts that paſt in full Parliament, concerning the putting down the Common-Prayer and Biſhops, and that of the Triennial Parliament, and ſeveral other things that were Enacted with the greateſt conſent and applauſe of all the people that could be; all which will be look'd upon as the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and mad Poſitions of the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> But this vain fellow changes his mind all of a ſudden, and what but of late, <hi>when he conſidered it aright,</hi> he thought was to be imputed wholly to the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> now that <hi>he conſiders the ſame thing from firſt to laſt,</hi> he thinks the <hi>Independents</hi> were the ſole Actors of it.

            <p>YOu ſeem to begin this Eleventh Chapter, <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> though with no modeſty, yet with ſome ſenſe of your weakneſs and trifling in this Diſcourſe. For whereas you propoſed to your ſelf to enquire in this place, by what authority, ſentence was given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King? You add immediately, which no body expected from you; that <hi>'tis in vain to make any ſuch enquiry;</hi> to wit, <hi>becauſe the quality of the perſons that did it, leaves hardly any room for ſuch a queſtion.</hi> And
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96415:128"/>
therefore as you have been found guilty of a great deal of Impupence and Saucineſs in the undertaking of this Cauſe, ſo ſince you ſeem here conſcious of your own impertinence; I ſhall give you the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwer. To your queſtion then; by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the Houſe of Commons either condemn'd the King themſelves, or delegated that power to others; I anſwer, they did it by vertue of the Supreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on earth. How they come to have the Supreme Power, you may learn by what I have ſaid already, when I refuted your Impertinencies upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. If you believed your ſelf that you could ever ſay enough upon any Subject, you would not be ſo tedious in repeating the ſame things ſo many times over. And the Houſe of Commons might delegate their Judicial Power by the ſame reaſon, by which you ſay the King may delegate his, who received all he had from the people. Hence in that Solemn League and Covenant that you object to us, the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſolemnly proteſt and engage to each other to puniſh the Traytors in ſuch manner as <hi>the Supreme, Judicial Authority in both Nations, or ſuch as ſhould have a Delegate power from them,</hi> ſhould think fit. Here you hear the Parliaments of both Nations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with one voice, that they may Delegate their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Power, which they call the Supreme; ſo that you move a vain and frivolous Controverſie about De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legating this power. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>there were added to thoſe Judges that were made choice of out of the Houſe of Commons, ſome Officers of the Army, and that never was known that Soldiers had any right to try a Subject for his life.</hi> I'le ſilence you in a very few words: You may remember that we are not now diſcourſing of a Subject, but of an Enemy; whom if a General of an Army, after he has taken him Priſoner reſolves to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96415:128"/>
diſpatch, would he be thought to proceed otherwiſe than according to cuſtom and Martial Law, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome of his Officers ſhould sit upon him, and try and cendemn him? An enemy to a State made a Priſouer of War, cannot be lookt upon to be ſo much as a Member, much leſs a King in that State. This is declar'd by that Sacred Law of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> which denies that a bad King is a King at all, or ought to be called ſo. Whereas you ſay, it was <hi>not the whole but a part of the Houſe of Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ons that try'd and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the King,</hi> I give you this anſwer: The number of them, who gave their Votes for putting the King to death, was far greater than is neceſſary according to the cuſtom of our Parliaments to tranſact the greateſt Affairs of the Kingdom, in the abſence of the reſt; who ſince they were abſent through their own fault (for to revolt to the common enemy in their hearts is the worſt ſort of abſence) their abſence ought not to hinder the reſt who continued faithful to the cauſe, from preſerving the State; which when it was in a tottering condition, and almoſt quite reduced to Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and utter ruin, the whole body of the people had at firſt committed to their fidelity, prudence and courage. And they acted their parts like men; they ſet themſelves in oppoſition to the unruly wilfulneſs, the rage, the ſecret deſigns of an inveterate and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated King; they prefer'd the common liberty and ſafety before their own; they out-did all former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, they out-did all their Anceſtors in Conduct, Magnanimity and ſteddineſs to their cauſe. Yet theſe very men did a great part of the people ungratefully deſert in the midſt of their undertaking, though they had promiſed them all fidelity, all the help and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they could afford them. Theſe were for Slavery and peace with ſloth and luxury upon any terms:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96415:129"/>
Others demanded their Liberty, nor would accept of a peace that was not ſure and honourable. What ſhould the Parliament do in this caſe? ought they to have defended this part of the people, that was ſound and continued faithful to them and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or to have ſided with thoſe that deſerted both? I know what you will ſay they ought to have done. You are not <hi>Eurulochus,</hi> but <hi>Elpenor,</hi> a miſerable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Beaſt, a filthy Swine, accuſtomed to a ſordid Slavery, even under a Woman; ſo that you have not the leaſt reliſh of true Magnanimity, nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Liberty, which is the effect of it: You would have all other men ſlaves, becauſe you find in your ſelf no generous, ingenuous inclinations, you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, you breath nothing but what's mean and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile. You raiſe another ſcruple, to wit, <hi>That he was the King of</hi> Scotland <hi>too, whom we condemn'd;</hi> as if he might therefore do what he would in <hi>England.</hi> But that you may conclude this Chapter, which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is the moſt weak and inſipid, at leaſt with ſome witty querk, <hi>There are two little words,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that are made up of the ſame number of Letters, and differ only in the placing of them, but whoſe ſignifications are wide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, to wit,</hi> Vis <hi>and</hi> Jus, (might and right.) 'Tis no great wonder that ſuch a three letter'd man as you, <hi>(Fur,</hi> a <hi>Thief,)</hi> ſhould make ſuch a Witticiſm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three Letters: 'Tis the greater wonder (which yet you aſſert throughout your Book) that two things ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to one another as thoſe two are, ſhould yet meet and become one and the ſame thing in Kings. For what violence was ever acted by Kings, which you do not affirm to be their Right? Theſe are all the paſſages that I could pick out of nine long Pages, that I thought deſerved an anſwer. The reſt conſiſts either of repetitions of things that have been anſwered more
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96415:129"/>
than once, or ſuch as have no relation to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand. So that my being more brief in this Chapter than in the reſt, is not to be imputed to want of diligence in me, which, how irkſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are to me, I have not ſlackned, but to your tedious impertinence, ſo void of matter and ſenſe.</p>

            <p>I Wiſh, <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> that you had left out this part of your Diſcourſe concerning the King's crimes, which it had been more adviſable for your ſelf and your party to have done, for I'm afraid leſt in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you an anſwer to it, I ſhould appear too ſharp and ſevere upon him, now he is dead, and hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his puniſhment. But ſince you choſe rather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe confidently and at large upon that Subject, I'le make you ſenſible, that you could not have done a more inconſiderate thing, than to reſerve the worſt part of your cauſe to the laſt, to wit that of ripping up and enquiring into the Kings Crimes; which when I ſhall have proved them to have been true and moſt exorbitant, they will render his memory unpleaſant and odious to all good men, and imprint now in the cloſe of the Controverſie, a juſt hatred of you, who undertake his defence, on the Readers minds.

And what would thoſe things have been to us, if he had been a private perſon? But ſince he would be a King, as he could not live a private life, ſo neither could his Vices be like thoſe of a private perſon. For in the firſt place, he did a great deal of miſchief by his example: In the ſecond place, all that time that he ſpent upon his luſt, and in his ſports, which was a great part of his time, he ſtole from the State, the Government of which he had undertaken. Thirdly and laſtly, he ſquandered away vaſt Sums of Money, which were not his own, but the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revenue of the Nation, in his Domeſtick Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury and Extravagance. So that in his private life at home he firſt began to be an ill King. But let us rather paſs over to thoſe Crimes <hi>that he is charged with on the account of miſgovernment.</hi> Here you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his being condemned as a Tyrant, a Traytor, and a Murderer. That he had no wrong done him, ſhall now be made appear. But firſt let us define a Tyrant, not according to vulgar conceits, but the judgment of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and of all Learned Men. He is a <hi>Tyrant</hi> who regards his own welfare and profit only, and not that of the people. So <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines one in the Tenth Book of his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and ſo do very many others. Whether <hi>Charles</hi> regarded his own or the peoples good, theſe few things of many that I ſhall but touch upon, will evince. When his Rents and other publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown would not defray the Expences of the Court, he laid moſt heavy Taxes upon the people; and when they were ſquandred away, he invented new ones; not for the benefit, honour, or

defence of the State, but that he might hoard up, or laviſh out in one Houſe, the Riches and Wealth, not of one but of three Nations. When at this rate he broke looſe, and acted without any colour of Law to warrant his proceedings, knowing that a Parliament was the only thing that could give him check, he endeavoured either wholly to lay aſide the very calling of Parliaments, or calling them juſt as often, and no oftner, than to ſerve his own turn, to make them entirely at his devotion. Which Bridle when he had caſt off himſelf, he put another Bridle upon the people; he put Garriſons of <hi>German</hi> Horſe and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot in many Towns and Cities, and that in time of Peace. Do you think he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to look like a Tyrant? In which very thing, as in many other Particulars, which you have formerly given me occaſion to inſtance in, (though you ſcorn to have <hi>Charles</hi> compared with ſo cruel a Tyrant as <hi>Nero)</hi> he reſembled him extremely much. For <hi>Nero</hi> likewiſe often threatned to take away the Senate. Beſides, he bore extreme hard upon the Conſciences of good men, and compelled them to the uſe of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Superſtitious Worſhip, borrowed from Popery, and by him re-introduced into the Church. They that would not conform, were impriſoned or Baniſht. He made War upon the <hi>Scots</hi> twice for no other cauſe than that. By all theſe actions he has ſurely deſerved the name of a Tyrant once over at leaſt. Now l'le tell you why the word Traytor was put into his Indictment: When he aſſured his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Promiſes, by Proclamations, by Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he had no deſign againſt the State, at that very time did he Liſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſent a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Embaſſie to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to beg aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from him of Arms, Horſes and Men, expreſly

againſt the Parliament; and was endeavouring to raiſe an Army firſt in <hi>England,</hi> and then in <hi>Scotland.</hi> To the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he promiſed the Plunder of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to the <hi>Scots,</hi> that the four <hi>Northern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould be added to <hi>Scotland,</hi> if they would but help him to get rid of the Parliament, by what means ſoever. Theſe Projects not ſucceeding, he ſent over one <hi>Dillon</hi> a Traytor, into <hi>Ireland</hi> with private Inſtructions to the Natives, to fall ſuddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that inhabited there. Theſe are the moſt remarkable inſtances of his Treaſons, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up upon hear-ſay and idle reports, but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Letters under his own Hand and Seal. And finally I ſuppoſe no man will deny that he was a Murderer, by whoſe order the <hi>Iriſh</hi> took Arms, and put to death with moſt exquiſite Torments, above a hundred thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who lived peaceably by them, and without any apprehenſion of danger; and who raiſed ſo great a Civil War in the other two Kingdoms. Add to all this, that at the Treaty in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> the King openly took upon himſelf the guilt of the War, and clear'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Confeſſion he made there, which is publickly known. Thus you have in ſhort why King <hi>Charles</hi> was adjudged a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>why was he not declared ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither in that Solemn League and Covenant, nor afterwards when he was delivered to them, either by the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>or the</hi> Independents, <hi>but on the other hand was receiv'd as a King ought to be, with all reverence?</hi> This very thing is ſufficient to perſuade any rational man, that the Parliament entred not into any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of quite depoſing the King, but as their laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, after they had ſuffered and undergone all that poſſibly they could, and had attempted all other ways
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96415:131"/>
and means. You alone endeavour maliciouſly to lay that to their charge, which to all good men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but evidence their great Patience, Moderation, and perhaps a too long forbearing with the King's Pride and Arrogance. But <hi>in the month of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>before the King ſuffered, the Houſe of Commons, which then bore the only ſway, and was governed by the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, wrote Letters to the</hi> Scots, <hi>in which they acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that they never intended to alter the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that had obtain'd ſo long in</hi> England <hi>under King, Lords, and Commons.</hi> You may ſee from hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, how little reaſon there is to aſcribe the depoſing of the King, to the principles of the Independents. They, that never uſed to diſſemble and conceal their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, even then, when they had the ſole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affairs, profeſs, <hi>That they never intended to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Government.</hi> But if afterwards a thing came into their minds, which at firſt they intended not, why might they not take ſuch a courſe, tho before not intended, as appear'd moſt adviſable, and moſt for the Nation's Intereſt? Eſpecially when they found that the King could not poſſibly be intreated or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to aſſent to thoſe juſt demands that they had made from time to time, and which were always the ſame from firſt to laſt. He perſiſted in thoſe perverſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents with reſpect to Religion and his own Right, which he had all along eſpouſed, and which were ſo deſtructive to us; not in the leaſt altered from the man that he was, when in Peace and War, he did us all ſo much miſchief. If he aſſented to any thing, he gave no obſcure hints that he did it againſt his will, and that whenever he ſhould come into power again, he would look upon ſuch his Aſſent as null and void. The ſame thing his Son declared by writing under his hand, when in thoſe days he ran away with part
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96415:132"/>
of the Fleet, and ſo did the King himſelf by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſome of his own Party in <hi>London.</hi> In the mean time, againſt the avowed ſenſe of the Parliament, he ſtruck up a private Peace with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> the moſt barbarous Enemies imaginable to <hi>England,</hi> upon baſe diſhonourable terms; but whenever he invited the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Treaties of Peace, at thoſe very times with all the power he had, and intereſt he could make, he was preparing for War. In this caſe, what ſhould they do, who were intruſted with the care of the Government? Ought they to have betrayed the ſafety of us all to our moſt bitter Adverſary?

God put a better mind into them, of preferring, purſuant to that very ſolemn League and Covenant, their Religion, and Liberties, before thoſe thoughts they once had, of not rejecting the King; for they had not gone ſo far as to vote it; all which they ſaw at laſt, (tho indeed later than they might have done), could not poſſibly ſubſiſt, as long as the King continued King. The Parliament <hi>ought</hi> and muſt of neceſſity be entirely free, and at liberty to provide for the good of the Nation, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; nor ought they ſo to be wedded to their firſt Sentiments, as to ſcruple the altering their minds, for their own, or the Nation's good, if God put an opportunity into their hands of procuring it.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96415:132"/>
the putting a Tyrant to Death a <hi>moſt ſacred</hi> action. Then you pick holes in the King's Charge, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly penn'd; and you ask <hi>why we needed to call him a Traytor and a Murtherer, after we had ſtiled him a Tyrant; ſince the word Tyrant, includes all the Crimes that may be:</hi> And then you explain to us gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically and critically, what a Tyrant is. Away with thoſe Triſles, you Pedagogue, which that one definition of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s, that has lately beeen cited, will utterly confound; and teach ſuch a Doctor as you, That the word Tyrant (for all your concern is barely to have ſome underſtanding of words) may be applied to one, who is neither a Traytor nor a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer. But <hi>the Laws of</hi> England <hi>do not make it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the King to ſtir up Sedition againſt himſelf or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Nor do they ſay, That the Parliament can be guilty of Treaſon by depoſing a bad King, nor that any Parliament ever was ſo, tho they have often done it; but our Laws plainly and clearly declare, that a King may violate, diminiſh, nay, and wholly loſe his Royalty. For that expreſſion in the Law of St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> of <hi>loſing the name of a King,</hi> ſignifies neither more nor leſs, than being deprived of the Kingly Office and Dignity; which befel <hi>Chilperic</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe example, for illuſtration-ſake, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in the Law it ſelf. There is not a Lawyer amongſt us that can deny, but that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Treaſon may be committed againſt the Kingdom as well as againſt the King. I appeal to <hi>Glanvile</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whom you cite, <q>If any man attempt to put the King to death, or raiſe Sedition in the Realm, it is High Treaſon.</q> So, that attempt of ſome Papiſts to blow up the Parliament-Houſe, and the Lords and Commons there with Gunpowder, was by King
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96415:133"/>
               <hi>James</hi> himſelf, and both Houſes of Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> not againſt the King only, but againſt the Parliament and the whole Kingdom. 'T would be to no purpoſe to quote more of our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, to prove ſo clear a Truth; which yet I could eaſily do. For the thing it ſelf is ridiculous, and abſurd to imagine, That High Treaſon may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the King, and not againſt the people, for whoſe good nay, and by whoſe leave, as I may ſay, the King is what he is: So that you babble over ſo many Statutes of ours to no purpoſe; you toil and wallow in our Ancient Law-Books, to no purpoſe; for the Laws themſelves ſtand or fall by Authority of Parliament, who always had power to confirm or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal them; and the Parliament is the ſole Judge of what is Rebellion, what High Treaſon <hi>(Iaeſa Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas)</hi> and what not. Majeſty never was veſted to that degree in the Perſon of the King, as not to be more conſpicuous, and more Auguſt in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I have often ſhown: But who can endure to hear ſuch a ſenſeleſs Fellow, ſuch a <hi>French</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank as you, declare what our Laws are? And you <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fugitives, ſo many Biſhops, Doctors, Lawyers, who pretend that all Learning and Ingenuous Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is fled out of <hi>England</hi> with your ſelves, was there not one of you that could defend the King's Cauſe and your own, and that in good <hi>Latin</hi> too, to be ſubmitted to the judgment of other Nations, but that this brain-ſick, beggarly <hi>Frenchman</hi> muſt be hired to undertake the Defence of a poor indigent King, ſurrounded with ſo many Infant-Prieſts and Doctors? This very thing I aſſure you, will be a great imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you amongſt Foreigners; and you will be thought deſervedly to have loſt that Cauſe that you
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96415:133"/>
were ſo far from being able to defend by Force of Arms, as that you cannot ſo much as write in behalf of it. But now. I come to you again, good-man gooſe-cap, who ſcribble ſo finely; if at leaſt you are come to your ſelf again; for I find you here towards the latter end of your Book, in a deep ſleep, and dreaming of ſome voluntary <hi>Death</hi> or other, that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. Then you <hi>deny that 'tis poſſible for a King in his right wits to embroil his people in Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to betray his own Forces to be ſlaughtered by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and raiſe Factions againſt himſelf.</hi> All which things having been done by many Kings, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by <hi>Charles</hi> the late King of <hi>England,</hi> you will no longer doubt, I hope, eſpecially being addicted to Stoiciſm, but that all Tyrants, as well as profligate Villains are downright mad. Hear what <hi>Horace</hi> ſays, <q>Whoever through a ſenſeleſs Stupidity, or any other cauſe whatſoever, hath his Underſtanding ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as not to diſcern truth, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> account of him as of a mad-man: And ſuch are whole Nations, ſuch are Kings and Princes, ſuch are all Man kind? except thoſe very few that are Wiſe.</q> So that if you would clear King <hi>Charles</hi> from the Imputation of acting like a Mad-man, you muſt firſt vindicate his integrity, and ſhow that he never acted like an ill man. <hi>But a King,</hi> you ſay, <hi>cannot commit Treaſon againſt his own Subjects and Vaſſals.</hi> In the firſt place, ſince we are as free as any People under Heaven, we will not be impos'd upon by any Barbarous Cuſtom of any other Nation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. In the ſecond place, Suppoſe we had been the King's Vaſſals; that Relation would not have obliged us to endure a Tyrant to Reign and Lord it over us. All Subjection to Magiſtrates, as our own Laws declare, is circumſcribed, and confined within

The Obligation betwixt a Lord and his Tenants, is mutual, and remains ſo long as the Lord protects his Tenant; (this all our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers tells us) but if the Lord be too ſevere and cruel to his Tenant, and do him ſome heinous Injury, <hi>The whole Relation betwixt them, and whatever Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tenant is under by having done Homage to his Lord, is utterly diſſolv'd and extinguiſh'd.</hi> Theſe are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta.</hi> So that in ſome Caſe, the Law it ſelf warrants even a Slave, or a Vaſſal to oppoſe his Lord, and allows the Slave to kill him, if he vanquiſh him in Battle. If a City, or a whole Nation may not lawfully take the Courſe with a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; the Condition of Freemen will be worſe than that of Slaves. Then you go about to excuſe King <hi>Charles</hi>'s ſhedding of Innocent Blood; partly by Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed by other Kings, and partly by ſome Inſtances of Men put to Death by them lawfully. For the matter of the <hi>Iriſh Maſſacre,</hi> you refer the Reader to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and I refer you to <hi>Eicono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſtes.</hi> The Town of <hi>Rochel</hi> being taken, and the Townſ-men betray'd, aſſiſtance ſhown, but not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them, you will not have laid at <hi>Charlos</hi>'s door; nor have I any thing to ſay, whether he was faulty in that buſineſs or not; he did miſchief enough at home; we need not enquire into what Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors he was guilty of abroad. But you in the mean time would make all the Proteſtant Churches, that have at any time defended themſelves by force of Arms againſt Princes, who were profeſs'd Enemies of their Religion to have been guilty of Rebellion. Let them conſider how much it concerns them for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and aſſerting their own Integrity, not to paſs by ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity

offered them by a Perſon bred up by and amongſt themſelves. That which troubles us moſt, is, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> likewiſe were betray'd in that Expedition. He, who had deſign'd long ago to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Government of <hi>England</hi> into a Tyranny, thought he could not bring it to paſs, till the Flower and Strength of the Military Power of the Nation were cut off. Another of his Crimes was, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome words to be ſtruck out of the uſual Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-oath, before he himſelf would take it. Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abominable Action! The Act was wicked in it ſelf; what ſhall be ſaid of him that undertakes to juſtifie it? For, by the Eternal God, what greater breach of Faith, and Violation of all Laws can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be imagin'd? What ought to been more ſacred to him, next to the Holy Sacraments themſelves, than that Oath? Which of the two do you think the more flagitious Perſon, him that offends againſt the Law, or him that endeavours to make the Law equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty with himſelf? Or rather him who ſubverts the Law it ſelf, that he may not ſeem to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? For thus, that King violated that Oath which he ought moſt religiouſly to have ſworn to; but that he might not ſeem openly and publickly to violate it, he craftily adulterated and corrupted it; and leaſt he himſelf ſhould be accounted perjur'd, he turn'd the very Oath into a Perjury. What other could be expected, then that his Reign would be full of Injuſtice, Craft, and Misfortune, who began it with ſo deteſtable an Injury to his People? And who durſt pervert and adulterate that Law which he thought the only Obſtacle that ſtood in his way, and hindred him from perverting all the reſt of the Laws? But <hi>that Oath</hi> (thus you juſtify him) <hi>lays no other Obligation upon Kings, then the Laws themſelves
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96415:135"/>
do; and Kings pretend that they will be bound and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Laws, tho indeed they are altogether from under the Power of Laws.</hi> Is it not prodigious, that a Man ſhould dare to expreſs himſelf ſo ſacrilegiouſly, and ſo ſenſeleſly, as to aſſert that am Oath ſacredly ſworn upon the Holy Evangeliſts, mary be diſpenſed with, and ſet aſide as a little inſignifi cant thing, without any Cauſe whatſoever! <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf refutes you, you Prodigy of Impiety: Who thinking that Oath no light matter, choſe rather by a Subterfuge to avoid the force of it, or by a Fallacy to elude it, than open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to violate it; and would rather falſifie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Oath, then manifeſtly forſwear himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had taken it. But, <hi>The King indeed ſwears to his People, as the People do to him; but the People ſwear Fidelity to the King, not the King to them.</hi> Pretty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention! Does not he that promiſes, and binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by an Oath to do any thing to, or for another, oblige his Fidelity to them that require the Oath of him? Of a truth, every King ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ears <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the People, with reſpect to the performance of whatever he promiſeth upon Oath to do. Then you run back to <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, who was forced more than once to ſwear to perform, not what he himſelf would, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If the King by not taking an Oath be at Liberty, the People are ſo too. And that part of the People that has ſworn, ſwore not to the King only, but to the Realm, and the Laws, by which the King came to his Crown; and no otherwiſe to the King, than wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Go now and complain, That thoſe Fugitives who pretended to furniſh you with matter out of our Statutes, impoſed upon you in it; and let other People in the mean time ſtand aſtoniſh'd at your Impudence and Vanity, who are not aſham'd to pretend to be throughly vers'd in ſuch Books, as it is ſo evident you have never look'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor ſo much as ſeen. And that Clauſe in the Coronation-Oath, which ſuch a brazen-fac'd Brawler as you call fictitious, <hi>The King's Friends,</hi> you ſay your ſelf, <hi>acknowledge that it may poſſibly be extant in ſome Ancient Copies, but that it grew into diſuſe, becauſe it had no convenient ſignification.</hi> But for that very reaſon, did our Anceſtors inſert it in the Oath, that the Oath might have ſuch a ſignification as would not be for a Tyrant's conveniency. If it had really grown into diſuſe, which yet is moſt falſe; there was the greater need of reviving it; but even that would have been to no purpoſe, according to your Doctrine: <hi>For that Cuſtom of taking an Oath, as Kings now-adays generally uſe it, is no more,</hi> you ſay, <hi>then a bare Ceremony.</hi> And yet the King, when the Biſhops were to be put down, pretended that he could not

do it by reaſon of that Oath. And conſequently, that reverend and ſacred Oath, as it ſerves for the Kings turn or not, muſt be ſolemn and binding, or an empty Ceremony. Which I earneſtly entreat my Country-men to take notice of, and to conſider what manner of a King they are like to have, if he ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And indeed all manner of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is ſcandalous and diſgraceful to a freeborn inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Perſon; but for you, after you have recovered your loſt Liberty by God's Aſſiſtance, and your own Arms; after the performance of ſo many valiant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and the making ſo remarkable an Example of a moſt Potent King, to deſire to return again into a Condition of Bondage and Slavery, will not only be ſcandalous and diſgraceful, but an impious and wicked thing; and equal to that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who for deſiring to return to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery, were ſo ſeverely puniſh'd for that ſordid, ſlaviſh Temper of mind, and ſo many of them deſtroy'd by that God, who had been their Deliverer. But what ſay you now, who would perſwade us to become Slaves? <hi>The King,</hi> ſay you, <hi>had a Power of pardoning ſuch as were guilty of Treaſon, and other Crimes; which evinces ſufficiently, that the King himſelf was under no Law.</hi> The King might indeed pardon Treaſon, not againſt the Kingdom, but againſt himſelf; and ſo may any body elſe pardon wrongs done to themſelves; and he might, perhaps, pardon ſome other Offences, tho not always; but does that follow, becauſe in ſome Caſes he had the Right of ſaving a Malefactor's life, that therefore he muſt have a Right to deſtroy all good Men? If the King be impleaded in an inferior Court, he is not obliged to Anſwer, but by his Attorney: Does it therefore follow, that when he is ſummon'd by all his Subjects to appear in Parliament, he may chuſe whether he will appear or no, and refuſe to Anſwer in Person? You ſay, <hi>That we endeavour to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96415:137"/>
juſtify what we have done by the</hi> Hollander'<hi>s Example;</hi> and upon this occaſion, fearing the loſs of that Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend with which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> seed ſuch a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine and Peſt as you are, if by reviling the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you ſhould conſequentially reflect upon them that maintain you, you endeavour to demonſtrate <hi>how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like their Actions and ours are.</hi> The Compariſon that you make betwixt them, I reſolve to omit (tho many things in it are moſt falſe, and other things flattery all over, which yet you thought your ſelf obliged to put down, to deſerve your Penſion.) For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> think they need not alledge the Examples of Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for their Juſtification. They have Municipal Laws of their own, by which they have acted; Laws with relation to the matter in hand, the beſt in the World: They have the Examples of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, Great and Gallant Men for their imitation, who never gave way to the Exorbitant Power of Princes, and who have put many of them to Death, when their Government became inſupportable. They were born free, they ſtand in need of no other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they can make what Laws they pleaſe for their own good Government. One Law in particular they have a great Veneration for, and a very Ancient one it is, enacted by Nature it ſelf, That all Humane Laws, all Civil Right and Government muſt have a reſpect to the ſafety and welfare of good Men, and not be ſubject to the Luſts of Princes. From hence to the end of your Book, I find nothing but Rubbiſh and Trifles, pick'd out of the former Chapters; of which you have here raiſed ſo great a heap, that I cannot imagine what other design you could have in it, than to preſage the ruin of your whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.

And I pray by whom were you deſired? By your Wife, I ſuppoſe, who, they ſay, exerciſes a Kingly Right and Juriſdiction over you; and whenever ſhe has a mind to it (as <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> is made to ſpeak in that obſcene Epigram, that you collected ſome <hi>Centoes</hi> out of, <hi>Pag.</hi> 320.) cries, <hi>Either write, or let's fight;</hi> That made you write per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, leſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

publick, I think the beſt courſe that you can take will be, for this long Book that you have writ, to take a Halter, and make one long Letter of your ſelf. So <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> repented, to whom you are like; and that young <hi>Charles</hi> knew, which made him ſend you the Purſe, <hi>Judas</hi> his Badg; for he had heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and found afterward by experience, that you were an Apoſtate and a Devil. <hi>Judas</hi> betray'd <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and you betray his Church; you have taught heretofore that Biſhops were <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and you are now revolted to their party: You now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Defence of their Cauſe, whom formerly you damn'd to the pit of Hell: Chriſt delivered all men from Bondage, and you endeavour to enſlave all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Never queſtion, ſince you have been ſuch a Villain to God himſelf, his Church, and all mankind in general, but that the ſame fate attends you that befel your equal, out of deſpair rather than repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to be weary of your life, and hang your ſelf, and burſt aſunder as he did; and to ſend before-hand that faithleſs and treacherous Conſcience of yours, that railing Conſcience at good and holy men, to that place of torment that's parpared for you. And now I think, through God's aſſiſtance, I have finiſhed the Work I undertook, to wit, the defence of the Noble Actions of my Country-men at home and abroad, againſt the raging and envious madneſs of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Sophiſter; and the aſſerting of the common Rights of the People againſt the unjuſt domination of Kings, not out of any hatred to Kings, but Tyrants: Nor have I wittingly left unanſwered any one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alledged by my adverſary, nor any one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or authority quoted by him, that ſeem'd to have any force in it, or the leaſt colour of an argument. Perhaps I have been guilty rather of the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96415:138"/>
of replying to ſome of his fooleries and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, as if they were ſolid arguments, and thereby may ſeem to have attributed more to them than they deſerved. One thing yet remains to be done, which perhaps is of the greateſt concern of all, and that is, That you, my Country-men, refute this adverſary of yours your ſelves; which I do not ſee any other means of your effecting, than by a conſtant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to out-do all men's bad words by your own good deeds. When you laboured under more ſorts of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion than one, you betook your ſelves to God for refuge, and he was graciouſly pleaſed to hear your moſt earneſt Prayers and Deſires. He has gloriouſly delivered you, the firſt of Nations, from the two greateſt miſchiefs of this life, and moſt pernicious to Vertue, Tyranny and Superſtition; he has endued you with greatneſs of mind, to be firſt of mankind, who after having conquered their own King, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had him delivered into their hands, have not ſcrupled to condemn him Judicially, and purſuant to that Sentence of Condemnation, to put him to death. After the performing ſo Glorious an Action as this, you ought to do nothing that's mean and little, not ſo much as to think of, much leſs to do any thing but what is great and ſublime. Which to attain to, this is, your only way; As you have ſubdued your Enemies in Field, ſo to make appear, that unarmed, and in the higheſt outward peace and tranquility, you of all mankind are beſt able to ſubdue Ambition, Avarice, the love of Riches, and can beſt avoid the corruptions that Proſperity is apt to introduce; (which generally ſubdue and triumph over other Nations) to ſhow as great Juſtice, Temperance and Moderation in the maintaining your Liberty, as you have ſhown courage in freeing your ſelves from ſlavery.
