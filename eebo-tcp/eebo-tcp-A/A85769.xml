            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O omit any generall or prolix diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the utility and delectation of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and in ſpeciall of theſe regiſtred in Holy
Scripture, and to come in particular to this
preſent Hiſtory contained in this ſecond of
<hi>Samuel.</hi> In it we have the pattern of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and prudent prince, and in the eſtate of
the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>David</hi> we have
typified the eſtate of the Church militant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But before we come to the particular explication of this Book, we
will ſpeak. 1. Of the Author and penman thereof. 2. Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
and reaſon thereof. 3. Of the Subject and matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
and 4. The utility and profit thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, there is no doubt of the Author, but as is ſaid of the
whole Scripture in generall: ſo of this in particular, that the ſame
is by divine inſpiration, and that the ſpirit of God is the Author and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119120:5"/>
indyter thereof. But as for the penman, ſome ſuppoſe that the ſame
was written by the Prophets <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> who lived in the reign
of <hi>David.</hi> Others that <hi>Samuel,</hi> from whom it hath the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was the writer of it till the 25. chapter (where his death is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded)
and the reſt ſupplied by ſome of the forenamed Prophets.
But the moſt probable is thought to be that it was the office of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt
to regiſter the Hiſtory of the Jewiſh church and what fell out
every one in his own time. But herein ſeeing Scripture is ſilent, we
need not curiouſly inquire further hereof.</p>
               <p>2. Concerning the title and inſcription. The Hebrews give this
reaſon thereof, becauſe they containe the whole courſe of the life of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and of theſe two Kings <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> whom he (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods ordinance) anointed. But the Greeks (as the 70.
or ſeptuagint) whom <hi>Jerome</hi> and moſt part of the Latines do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
rejecting the inſcription of theſe two bookes from <hi>Samuel,</hi> they
call theſe two, the firſt and ſecond book of the Kings, becauſe of the
life and acts of the Kings that are ſet down therein, to wit, <hi>Saul</hi>
and <hi>David:</hi> as in the other two bookes that followes the lives and
acts of the reſt of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſet down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>3. As for the argument or matter contained in this ſecond book
of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the ſame is the whole Hiſtory of the eſtate of the Church
of God, of their Kings and Commonweale, from the death of <hi>Saul</hi>
to the decrepit age of <hi>David,</hi> which is the ſpace of 40 yeares, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is declared, the noble acts of <hi>David,</hi> his entrie to the kingdome,
and how he inlarged the ſame, alſo what troubles he had both inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
and forraine, from all which at laſt the Lord did deliver him,
and gave him victory over all his enemies, and how in the end, in peace
and reſt, he finiſhed his daies.</p>
               <p>4. The utility and profit which this Hiſtory affords is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
which may be reduced to two heads, the firſt for confirmation
of Faith, the ſecond for example of Life, which <hi>Paul</hi> joyneth. 2. <hi>Tim:</hi>
3. 10. The firſt appeareth in the verifying of the promiſe made by
<hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>David</hi> in the Lords name, that he ſhould be King after
<hi>Saul,</hi> albeit (for the triall of his faith) after many great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and deſperate like dangers, the ſame came to paſs, and he all
this while did relye on the Lords promiſe. The ſecond appeares in
the prudence, piety, zeale, humility, equity and good government
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119120:5"/>
of <hi>David,</hi> and all other his heroick and godly virtues worthy of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
As alſo is ſet down <hi>David's</hi> infirmities and fall's, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the weakneſs of the beſt when they watch not over themſelves,
or are left to themſelves, proponed to be eſchewed, <hi>ut majorum rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
ſit minorum cautela,</hi> as likewiſe his repentance to be imitated,
and the ſharp corrections notwithſtanding, as medicinall corraſves,
wherewith he was chaſtiſed: as we ſee in the Lords dealing with his
deareſt ſonnes and ſervants. <hi>Heb:</hi> 12. 6, 7. And therefore what
ſharper puniſhments may the impenitent, and Satans ſlaves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect?</p>
               <p>In this Hiſtory likewiſe of <hi>David's</hi> reign and kingdome, we have
typified Chriſt Jeſus the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> his condition, and eſtate of
his Church to the end of the world. for,</p>
               <p>1. As <hi>David</hi> was anointed to be king over <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſo was Chriſt
anointed to be King over his Church.</p>
               <p>2. But as <hi>David</hi> endured many troubles, perſecutions and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
before he entred into his kingdome, ſo did Jeſus Chriſt here
on earth before he entred in his.</p>
               <p>3. After his entry he was mightily oppoſed and oppugned by them
of <hi>Saul's</hi> houſe, his enemie by armes force and violence, and ſo was
Chriſt Jeſus, and his Church, and Goſpell, by the bloody perſecution
of the heathens <hi>Roman Emperors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Notwithſtanding <hi>Davids</hi> houſe waxed ſtill ſtrong and <hi>Sauls</hi>
houſe weake: ſo the Chriſtian Church and profeſſion did the more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and heatheniſh, idolatry, and hereſies decay.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Hiram</hi> alſo a Gentile, and King of <hi>Tyrus</hi> joyned in Amity

               <p>6. Then doth <hi>David</hi> bring home the Arke of God, and ſet it in

               <p>THe principall argument of this chapter, is the report of the
event of the battle between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Saul</hi> upon mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> which generally comprehends theſe
two particulars. 1. The report it ſelfe from the firſt verſe to the
17. The ſecond is, what fell out thereon, from the 17. verſe, even
to the end.</p>
               <p>In the report we have to conſider. 1. The matter and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
thereof. 2. The triall and how it was accepted. And 3.
the juſt reward of the reporter and actor therein.</p>
               <p>1. The matter reported is the loſſe of the battle on <hi>Iſraels</hi>
ſide, and death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi> The firſt circumſtance ſet
down in the report, is, of the time, to have been the third day
after <hi>Davids</hi> victory againſt the <hi>Amalikites,</hi> wherein the ſwiftneſs
of the fame of the battle on <hi>Gilboa</hi> is to be noted, ſeeing in leſs then
the ſpace of three daies; It is divulged from <hi>Gilboa</hi> which is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the territory of <hi>Iſachar,</hi> at the border of <hi>Jordan,</hi> in the eaſt
march of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> in the land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> dwelling
then at <hi>Ziklag</hi> ſituate neer to the mediterranean, upon the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> eſteemed to have been each part diſtant from
the other, the bounds of a hundred miles or thereabout in the
latitude of the land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119120:6"/>
Next, the perſon reporter is called herein generall, one, and
there after in ſpeciall, an <hi>Amalekite,</hi> probably the Son of one of
that Nation whom <hi>Saul</hi> had formerly unlawfully ſpared in his
expedition againſt <hi>Agag,</hi> and therefore God had reſerved him
now to be his murtherer.</p>
               <p>2. His carriage or behaviour is very crafty and cunning, he
covereth his head with aſhes, he rents his garments, and doth
moſt humble curteſy to <hi>David,</hi> as to his King. This geſture of
his was uſed ever by ſuch, who were diſpleaſed for the publick
calamity of the Lords People, as may be ſeen in the example of
<hi>Joſhua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioſhua 7. 1 Sam. 4.</note> and of the meſſinger that came to report the event of the
battle to <hi>Heli.</hi> But as they uſed this forme uprightly, ſo doth
this <hi>Amalekite</hi> uſe the ſame Hypocritically.</p>
               <p>3. His Oration teſtifies his further Hypocriſy, which he uſeth
very elaboratly and artificially, by degrees beginning at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and coming to the particulars, aſcending from that
which was moſt grievious, and ending with that which he
thought unto <hi>David</hi> ſhould be moſt acceptable, and good news.
in this manner, the People are fled, and many of them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
alſo <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Son, are dead, ſo that both
the King thy perſecutour, and Enemy, and <hi>Jonathan</hi> though
thy friend, yet apparent Heir, between thee and the Kingdome,
are both out of the way, and therefore this laſt news may aſſwage
the grief of the former, the ſlaughter to wit, of thy Countrymen
and People, (a crafty flatterer indeed.)</p>
               <p>The King alſo as a prudent Prince, not facile to credit rumours,
inquires, once and again, the certainty, he anſwers, that he
ſpeaks as an ejewitneſſe that which he ſaw, and he affirmes the
thing which he asked, and to ſeal up the truth of his ſpeechs, he
makes a reall exhibition of the royall ornaments of the crown,
and bracelet whereby he concludes with himſelf, liberally to be
rewarded of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the matter of his report and verity thereof there
are divers opinions amongſt the learned, ſome thinking it a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
lie, made to gain favour, thanks, and reward, in reſpect
that it ſeems directly contradictory to the verity of the forme
of <hi>Sauls</hi> death, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Others (as ſundry of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> holdes the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119120:7"/>
opinion) that he ſpake truly, granting (as is ſaid in the
forenamed places) that <hi>Saul</hi> runne himſelf upon his owne
ſword, and of that wound eſpecially he dyed, and that the
Archers had formerly hit him, and wounded him likewiſe,
but that immediatly not dyeing of theſe wounds eſpecially by
this laſt given by himſelf, not entring ſo deep into his body, as he
ſpeaks himſelf, (<hi>nam detinuit mè</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The Hebren word is, <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batz, &amp;c.</hi> See, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 4. 11. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>haec ocellata chlamys v.</hi> 9. And
life being as yet within him, as he alſo in the ſame verſe teſtifies,
therefore he deſires this <hi>Amalekite</hi> to ſtand upon him, (as being
formerly fallen) and to kill him outright, which he performs, and
thereby altogether is made to give up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>David</hi> hath tryed, and found it to be of truth that
<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> are dead, with great heavineſſe and regret
doth he receive this news, and with great mourning and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he bewails <hi>Saul, Jonathan,</hi> and the People, which mourning
is upon two reſpects, the one naturall, the other godly and
ſpirituall, this firſt was the ſorrow, 1. for the King, his Father
in Law, and Lord, 2. for <hi>Jonathan</hi> his faithfull friend prevented
by immaturity of violent death, before he could get occaſion of
acquitting his former favours, and 3. for his People, his deareſt
kinſmen and of one country with him. The ſpirituall, is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of Gods wrath thus puniſhing Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
for ſin, and making his People to fall ſo before their
Enemies whereby the honour of the name of God would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
and blaſphemed amongſt the heathen.</p>
               <p>The reward of this meſſenger, is death, by orderly proceſſe,
firſt <hi>David</hi> accuſes, how durſt thou put thy hand on the Lords
anointed? Next, he convicts him by his own confeſſion, which
uncoactedly given, and not enforced by torture, is by all Laws
holden <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> then he condemneth and commandeth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
upon good reaſons, the crime was capitall, the party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<hi>David</hi> was a Judge, in <hi>Siklag,</hi> and the title by the death of
<hi>Saul</hi> is increaſed, to the Kingdome.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 1. BEfore, <hi>David</hi> had newly gotten a notable Victory
over his Enemies the <hi>Amalekites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.</note> and recovered the
prey of <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and now the Lord takes <hi>Saul</hi> his perſecutor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
out of the way, and makes the news thereof ſpeedily to be
brought unto him, by whoſe death he is promoted unto the
Kingdome, ſo that the Lord heaps good things upon his choſen,
and renewes his benefits to the godly, who rely upon him, and in
patience poſſeſſeth there ſouls, witneſſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a cloud of
others, that may be brought out of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>2. That Victory over the <hi>Amalekites</hi> was not without a
preceding heavy diſaſter, and this news containes likewiſe a ſad
theame, <hi>Jonathan</hi> his truſty friend and the Lords People, his
dear Countrymen over whom he was to reigne, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
overthrown with <hi>Saul</hi> in battle, thus temper's the Lord
the Cup that he gives his owne, comfort with the croſſe,
and the mixture of ſome tartneſſe with his ſweeteſt morſels,
leaſt they ſhould overcloy us, or we too much delight in
them, therefore with extraordinary Revelations <hi>Paul</hi> muſt
have ſome buffetings of Satan, leaſt he ſhould be puft up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
meaſure, and leaſt we ſhould put our felicity in them
here, or not thankfully with <hi>Job,</hi> be content, when he takes
them back from us again, our ſweeteſt roſes muſt have there
ſharp prickels.</p>
                  <p>3. God ſtirreth up an <hi>Amalekite, (vers</hi> 8.) an infidell in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
an adverſary to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and particular Enemy to <hi>David,</hi> to
become his favourer, and with all diligence to carry this meſſage,
whereupon we collect the generall, that when the Church of
God, or any members thereof, hath been in greateſt adverſities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
forrain Enemies, then God hath moved the hearts of
there very adverſaries to be there beſt friends. Examples, <hi>Abraham</hi>
with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the Patriarches with the firſt <hi>Pharoah Moſes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the Daughter, and brought up in the court <hi>David</hi> with
the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> of the Prophets of God in <hi>Achabs</hi>
time fed by the governours of his houſe, <hi>Obadiah, Daniel,</hi> the
3. <hi>Children, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ester, Mordecai,</hi> and ſundry others;
Then let us not fear the loſſe, or want of friends, the Lord who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119120:8"/>
framed the heart, hath the hearts of Kings and private men in his
hands, which he will turne (as he did the heart of <hi>Eſau</hi> in an
inſtant) to the comfort of ſuch as depend with <hi>David</hi> upon his
protection and providence.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Vers</hi> 2. This meſſinger is a pattern of a cunning Hypocrite,
&amp; crafty flatterer, brought up in the Atheiſt Schools of prophane
courts, temporizing in Religion, and in matters of ſtate compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his ingenie, geſture, manners and ſpeech to the perfiting of
that altogether which he thought ſhould pleaſe the Prince, upon
the reſpect of his own advantage without all care of conſcience.
Such an intelligencer was <hi>Doeg</hi> unto <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; ſuch are may cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
about Princes and great men now adayes, few <hi>Mordecaies,
Nehemiah's,</hi> or <hi>Daniels</hi> being promoted, or few <hi>Ebed-melech's,</hi>
or <hi>Obadiah's</hi> to be found in courts.</p>
                  <p>5. In his firſt report, of the fall of Prince and People in Battle,
we ſee what is the miſerable eſtate of a People under a wicked
King, oftimes they imitate his example, as is ſaid <hi>Regis ad exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum,</hi>
&amp;c. and are puniſhed with him, yea, he is puniſhed in the

dyeth himſelf alone, but the people of the Lord are overthrown
with him, on the contrary, O happy people that hath a godly
Prince.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Vers</hi> 10. <hi>Saul</hi> dyeth by the edge of the ſword, even by
that ſame death which he had intended againſt <hi>David,</hi> and yet,
<hi>David</hi> is alive, thus is it verified that the wicked dig a pit for the
godly but they themſelves ſhall fall therein, and the ſouls of the
Lords choſen ſhall eſcape as a bird out of the ſnare, witneſſe,
<hi>Hamans</hi> Gallowes, <hi>Daniels</hi> Lyons denne, the 3. <hi>Childrens</hi> firy

good then for us, ever to have our eyes with good <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>
towards the Lord, and his protecting providence, committing
our cauſes to him, for he will repay, and we expecting his good
time to poſſeſſe our ſouls in patience. Alſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 18. He

ſlew the Lord Prieſts and Levites with the ſword, and now by the
ſword their blood is avenged on him.</p>
                  <p>7. The wonderfull providence of God herein likewiſe may be
ſeen, that <hi>David</hi> being amongſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and in ſuch credit
with the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> yet his hand is kept clean of the blood
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being commanded by the remanent
Princes of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> to go back, becauſe they diſtruſted him,
which albeit he thought it a diſgracefull reputation, yet at laſt he
found that it turned to the beſt (as all things do to the godly)
being hereby delivered from the guilty imputation of the blood
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the provident grace of God, which he
ſhould have incurred, if he had gone foreward, and in reſpect
that he went back by command, eſchewing on the other part
either the blame of timorous cowardlineſſe, or any other of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
or whatſoever the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> could charge him withall.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>David</hi> in his frequent inquiſition, is here an example to all
men (but to Judges eſpecially) not to truſt before they diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trye, for too haſty credulity and facility to credit whatſoever
is obtruded to believe, whether in temporall, or ſpirituall things,
without due tryall foregoing, is and ever hath beene hurtfull.
Therefore the men of <hi>Berea</hi> are commended for ſearching the
Scriptures, if thoſe things which <hi>Paul</hi> taught were ſo, or no,
and it is the Apoſtles command to trye the Spirits whether they
be of God, or no, before we believe them, <hi>Salomon</hi> would wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>10. We ſee here, that blood requires blood at Gods hands be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119120:9"/>
what priviledged Perſon a man will be before the World, <hi>Saul</hi>
had ſhed innocent blood, eſpecially that of the Lords Prieſts, upon

though a King, his blood muſt be ſhed partly by the hand of his

                  <p>11. The fearfull terrour of a deſperate accuſing conſcience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in <hi>Sauls</hi> death, making him weary of his life; for anguiſh is
upon me (ſaith he) and makes mee greedily to expoſtulat and ſeek
after death, thinking ſomewhat thereby to be eaſed, but (alaſs)
that worm dyeth never, the gnawing thereof rather beginning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death, then ending by death, witneſſe the like terrour &amp; torture
of this fury, <hi>Judas,</hi> and many more, who have become reuthleſſe
butchers and burrean's of themſelves, <hi>fugare conſcientiam,

from the conſcience, as if it were poſſible to flie from themſelves,
and falling in the flame (as we ſay) by flying the frying pan.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Vers</hi> 8. Herein is the juſt judgement of God manifeſt, that
<hi>Saul</hi> is now murthered by an <hi>Amalekite,</hi> whom he had againſt

then God, but ſpare where he commands to ſpare, and
ſtrik, where he commands ſo to doe, otherwiſe they ſhall find it
to be true, which experience too well hath taught, that thoſe
whom Magiſtrates ſpare is by indulgence, and abuſe of the ſword
they become their cutthroats, or griefs, as the <hi>Cananits</hi> which
being tolerated in the Land, were to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thornes in their
ſides, and prickes in their eyes, to condemne therefore the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and let the guilty go free, are both alike abomination to
the Lord, (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) and this <hi>David</hi> alſo found in ſparing

                  </p>
                  <p>13. <hi>V.</hi> 9. This <hi>Amalekite</hi> obtrudes <hi>Sauls</hi> own deſire to be the
warrant of his fact, which hereafter we ſee is admitted no excuſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119120:9"/>
by <hi>David,</hi> wherein as we ſee the nature of the wicked to be ready
to commit villany upon ſlender motives, ſo we ſee that a wicked
command upon no pretext ought to be obeyed, neither can it be
free from the check of conſcience, nor puniſhment of upright ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
all pretenſes being but like <hi>Adams</hi> figtree leaves, or his

                  <p>14. The reſpects of <hi>Davids</hi> mourning for <hi>Saul, Jonathan,</hi> and
the People, both internall, or ſpirituall, and externall, or naturall,
I mentioned before, onely this is to be obſerved, that there is a
double death to be lamented of Magiſtrates, the one corporall, as
here, the other ſpirituall, which is the corruption of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and as it is moſt prejudiciall, to Church, or Commonwealth,
ſo is it moſt to be deplored of all,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 35.</note> and this made <hi>Samuel</hi> to go
home to <hi>Ramah,</hi> and lament for <hi>Saul,</hi> all his dayes, this ſpirituall
death is a ſure fore runner oftimes of a fearfull temporall.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>V.</hi> 15. We ſee here the happy beginnings of a godly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in the reward of this reporter, conſiſting in two points. 1. in
the rejecting of diſſimulate Hypocriſy, &amp; cunning flattery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
this <hi>Amalekite</hi> had covered his greedy deſign of reward by
counterfeiting the behaviour of thoſe who deplored a publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
by doing humble obſervance to <hi>David,</hi> by reporting a
peece of acceptable ſervice done unto him as he ſuppoſed, and by
bringing <hi>Sauls</hi> Crown unto him, 2. In executing upright Juſtice
upon him, who had confeſſed with his own mouth Ceſ-majeſty,
or treaſon, whereby <hi>David,</hi> doth as he would be done to, and
cleareth himſelf hereby of all deſire he had of <hi>Sauls</hi> death by any
indirect means, confirming ſo his innocency, ſo frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
atteſted to <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf, and the integrity of his heart.</p>
                  <p>16. It is not Lawfull then (we perceive) to any one ſubject for
what cauſe ſoever to put violent hands on their Lawfull Prince
&amp; ſupream Magiſtrate, for if he be evill it is for our ſins, therefore
returne to God by unſained, repentance, and pray for him &amp; then
he will either remove, or reform him in his good time, and if he
command things unlawfull, let us obey rather God then man, and

ſuffering, therein let our care be that we ſuffer not for evil doing,

all this lifting up our hand againſt the Lords anointed, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting

by violence, but according to <hi>Davids</hi> example in all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
towards this wicked King <hi>Saul,</hi> conforming our ſelves,
and according to the rule preſcribed unto us in the word of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>17. Laſt of all, we ſee how wonderfully the wicked are diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of their purpoſes, this <hi>Amalekite</hi> looked for favour,
thanks, and benefit, but by wickedneſſe and an unjuſt fact to attaine
thereto, eſpecially at the hands of a godly man, was the wrong way,
&amp; therefore he is juſtly rewarded according to his deſert, by
death, thus Satan ever blindes, &amp; deceives the wicked, like <hi>Laban,</hi>
making them to ſerve for one thing promiſed, but changing their
wages and giving them another thing in performance. You ſhall
be like God, (ſaid he unto <hi>Eve</hi>) but the contrary was found true,
and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought that he wrought wiſely, by burdens and
bondage to waſte <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; redact them to a few number, but they
increaſed the more, and when he had eſſayed all means, he proved
the fool notwithſtanding, making his Land to be plagued, his firſt
borne ſlain, and himſelfs with his people drowned.</p>
                  <p>11. Alſo we ſee the wicked are the cauſe of there own perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a guilty conſcience ſnares it ſelf, therefore doth <hi>David</hi>
conclude, thy blood be upon thy own head, for thy own
mouth hath confeſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>WE ſhew in the Preface before the Chapter that the generall
ſubject of this Book is the Hiſtory of the reign of <hi>David,</hi>
begun at the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> while the inſtitution of <hi>Salomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The utilitie declares itſelf in the particulars, as in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of faith by the infallible performance of Gods promiſe
to <hi>David,</hi> in the raiſing of his Kingdome, albeit after great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and in the example of life and manners, as in the patience,
piety, righteous government, magnanimity in adverſity, prudence
in proſperity, and others his vertues, and albeit as man feeble,
and ſubject to infirmities, and falls, yet riſing again by true and
earneſt repentance.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdome is the type of Chriſts Kingdome
in the compariſon we have the chief utility to be remarked, that

               <p>As for the generall ſubject of the firſt Chapter, and firſt part
thereof, with the three parts whereinto it was ſubdivided, we
have alſo treated of the ſame, which was the report, the triall
of the report, and the reward of the reporter, now followeth
the ſecond part of the Chapter from the 17 <hi>verſ.</hi> to the end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<hi>Davids</hi> diſpoſition upon the report, and in generall the
text ſaith, that he compoſed a lamentation upon the miſeries of
this battle, and eſpecially upon the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This lamentation is proponed, as we ſpeak <hi>cicloeidos,</hi> circular
waies, or by circumductions of periods and ſentences, and amplified
according to <hi>Davids</hi> manner poetically, and therefore hath a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
reduction to a certain order or method, Yet all that is diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
ſpoken here, may be reduced to two heads: the one, is the
lamentation for the calamities fallen upon all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> taken from
the events of the battle, from the 17. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 22. The ſecond
is the ſpeciall lamentation for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> taken from the
commendation of their virtues, from the 22. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 27. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is added the concluſion poetically ſet down, and by way of
Threnodie.</p>
               <p>In the firſt period we have the title or inſcription of this fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
oration called the <hi>lamentation</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan.</hi>
It was the cuſtome of all Ages that the friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
lamented the defunct, as in the examples of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch's,
<hi>Abraham</hi> lamented <hi>Sarah, Jacob, Rachel,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
whom he thought to have been dead, ſo his ſonnes with the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
lamented him in <hi>Abel-mizraim, Iſrael</hi> lamented <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron, Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Samuel, Jeremiah</hi> by his Threnodies la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the death of <hi>Joſias,</hi> ſo in the Goſpell <hi>Mary</hi> lamented <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
her brother, yea our Saviour wept alſo, the diſciples la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Chriſt,<note place="margin">John. 10. Act. 8.</note> the godly lamented <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the ancients
had anniverſary lamentings for the Martyrs in the primitive
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119120:11"/>
Church, with recordation of their deaths, conſtancy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
for the imitation of others who ſhould be likewiſe called to
ſeale the truth by their ſufferings, and with regret of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
want of ſuch excellent and painfull Men, and holy patterns
of life, without any invocation of their names, which corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teſtifies) was not in his daies crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church of God, <hi>nomina enim martyrum apud nos (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit)

of the heathen, <hi>de pluralitate deorum,</hi> which by the honouring
of the Martyrs memories, they would have the Chriſtians likewiſe
guilty of.</p>
               <p>As for the cauſes of this lamentation, or twofold reſpect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the ſame hath been already ſpoken of in the explication of the
12. verſe.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond period, it is ſaid that <hi>David</hi> propoſes this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that thereby <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould learne to ſhoot in the bow, as
is written in the book of Juſtice, which ſentence becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
not to agree with the purpoſe, therefore the Hebrewes
excluded this verſe by parentheſis out of the lamentation, yet
conſidering aright, we ſhall find this period to agree well with
the inſcription, as the recents reſolve, <hi>David</hi> proponing this
lamentation to be a warning to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to learne the exerciſe of
Archery, becauſe by that forme of armour eſpecially (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 3.) the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> had ſlaine <hi>Saul,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Lords people, and whom herein in time coming he
would have to match their enemies in the military skill of uſing
that ſort of armour.</p>
               <p>By the book of <hi>Jaſher,</hi> or righteous, is to be underſtood moſt
probably, the book of the common Lawes which then was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for the formall proceeding in Judgment and warfaire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the art and diſcipline militarie, together with the record
of the Lords battles, as mention is made likewiſe thereof. <hi>Joſhua</hi>
10. 13. Which book, with diverſe others that were compoſed
by <hi>Salomon</hi> were burned in the firſt deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by
the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and ſo the whole <hi>Bibliothek hebraick</hi> fell not into
the hands of <hi>Eſdras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third period we have the generall pathetick propoſition
of this lamentation proponed by poeticall figures of <hi>Apoſtrophe,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:119120:11"/>
turning his ſpeech to God and the people in a verſe interrogative,
which the Greek poets call <hi>Amoebeus,</hi> by fiction of perſons, which
we call <hi>Proſopopeia,</hi> and by a deſcription of the calamity, which is
called <hi>Periphraſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The verſe is, <hi>O honour of Iſrael, in thy high places how are the
mighty ſlaine and overthrowne!</hi> by interpretation, O God who
art the honour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>O Iſrael</hi> that had the honour to
have ſo many mighty men, how miſerable is thy calamity, by
the which thy God is diſhonoured, and thou art ſpoiled of ſo
many honourable and ſtrong men? the cauſe of all this (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs)
is thy manifold ſinnes. For we muſt underſtand that the
ſcope of this oration is to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> to underſtand that this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
proceeds from ſinne, and can not ceaſe but by unfained
repentance.</p>
               <p>In the 20. and 21. <hi>verſes,</hi> which is the fourth and fift periods,
he amplifies this calamity by the events, the firſt in the twenty
verſe, containing a deprecation, proponed by <hi>Enallage</hi> of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
mood, for the Optative after the manner of poets, <hi>Tell it
not in Gath, nor publiſh it in the ſtreets of Aſhkelon,</hi> by which as
the capitall Cities, he meanes the whole land, the reaſon aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is, leſt the daughters of the uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtims</hi> rejoice,
and in praiſing their <hi>Idol</hi> gods, diſpraiſe the name of the true
God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo the end of this deprecation is the glory of
God, which he doth tender.</p>
               <p>But how doth he will here, a thing which is impoſſible, in
ſaying, <hi>tell it not, or let it not be told?</hi> It is anſwered, this comes
from a perturbed mind, wherein falls no certain deliberation, and
to teſtify his care of the glory of God, is ſpoken not as aſſured
of performance, but optative, and as he would wiſh it.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Daughters,</hi> ſome meanes the little townes of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> but
the common opinion and literall ſenſe is more ſimple, and better,
and confirmed by the cuſtome uſed after victories in thoſe daies
both amongſt the faithfull. 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 18. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And amongſt the
infidels. <hi>Judg:</hi> 16. 23. By the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> rejoycing over <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>

<hi>verſ.</hi> 21. An imprecation, againſt <hi>Gilboa,</hi> by the figure of

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119120:12"/>
befell to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with drougth and barrenneſs to remaine ſo, as
monuments of that calamity.</p>
               <p>In the five verſes following is the ſpeciall lamentation for <hi>Saul</hi>
and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> taken 1. From their couragious acts againſt
Gods enemies, and happy victorious ſucceſs. 2. From their
mutuall love, and lot to dye together. 3. From their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
diligence and undaunted courage in proſecuting the affaires.
4. From the effects of the government, that thereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
their ſubjects. 5. From his private intereſt and dammage
received by the loſs of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> with whom he had ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
that he compares his love which he did beare to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
to the love of brothers, and preferreth <hi>Jonathans</hi> love
towards him to the vehement love of women, which they can
or do beare to Husbands, Children, or any others, whereunto
he ſubjoynes the concluſion by way of interrogation, called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moebeus,
O Iſrael,</hi> againe I muſt ſay, how great is thy calamity,
whereby thy God is ſo diſhonoured, and thou ſpoiled of men of
ſuch qualities? ſurely ſinne hath thus provoked God to deale
with thee, therefore timely and truely reconcile to him, leaſt he
altogether conſume thee: where, as we ſaw upright juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſo here is true piety, O happy beginnings therefore of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. V. 17. WE ſee here, by the example of <hi>David,</hi> and practice
of the primitive Church, that the uſe of funerall
orations amongſt Chriſtians is indifferent and lawfull, if without
flattery, partiall affection, and oſtentation, they be made to the
glory of God, encouragement and example of virtue and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſtirring up to the conſideration of our mortality, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of repentance, and for confirmation of the doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
all tending to the inſtruction of the living, and not to
the ſuperfluous or unjuſt praiſe of the dead.</p>
                  <p>2. Here is a moſt Godly and imitable example in <hi>David,</hi> who
mourneth not only for the death of <hi>Jonathan</hi> his friend, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for <hi>Saul</hi> his foe, and adverſary, whereby we ſee that the rule
of godly or Chriſtian love, extends not only to thy friends natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119120:12"/>
or civill, but to all men, (albeit in the firſt place to the
family of Faith,) yea to thy very enemies, as is confirmed by
Chriſt in the diſputation he had with the corrupted <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
Math: 5. 44. The chiefe cauſe hereof is the honour of God which
we ought to tender, and the enlargement of his kingdome, which
by the fall of men in defection is hindred, Gods truth ſlandered,
and the Lord ſtirred up in wrath for to puniſh, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
by their converſion God is glorified, the kingdome of
Chriſt ſo farre amplified, and the Church comforted, But what
ſhall we ſay of the unnaturall world now, and the manners of
men, who would be called Chriſtians in this latter age, who
not only attaines to the Chriſtian perfection, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
proponing their particular paſſions to Gods glory are not
only rejoyced at the calamities of men, their adverſaries, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
are void of naturall affection to parents and friends, and are ſo
full of envy and ungodly emulations, that they are ſorry for the
good ſame and eſtimation of their very brethren, theſe are they
of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. 3. Let us learne then to
be compaſſionate with the calamities of all men for Gods cauſe,
following the example of the godly herein, and that Apoſtolicall
precept, 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 3. 8. But eſpecially mourning for the affliction of
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> Amos, 6. 6.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>David</hi> teaching <hi>Iſrael</hi> to learne the exerciſe of
the bow, gives the argument of the right uſe of armes as lawfull
to invade or defend in lawfull waies, againſt the erronious opinion
of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and agreeing with the chiefe part of a Kings
office, to whom is ſaid to be given the ſword, by which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Juriſdiction and power, and the execution thereof
at home and abroad as juſt cauſe requires, Examples, of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> the <hi>Judges: Samuel, David,</hi> and conſtant
practice received in <hi>Iſrael</hi> by divine command warranting the
ſame. Let no man doubt therefore in lawfull cauſes to follow
the Supreame Magiſtrate and lawfull Authority in juſt perſuit or
defence, where they are required.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. The honour of every Nation conſiſts in theſe
two; God, and valiant men, or true religion, and righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
piety and courage, the diſhonour in the oppoſite, A rule then
to diſcern between honourable kingdomes, eſtates and houſes, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119120:13"/>
the contrary,<note place="margin">Math: 5. 35 s &amp; 27. 52.</note> for theſe two, it was then, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called
the glory and beauty of the whole earth, the Holy City, and City
of the great King, of which many excellent things were ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
and for the want of the true worſhip of God without which
no true fortitude can be, <hi>Eliſha</hi> diſdaines ſo an <hi>Idolatrous Jehoram,</hi>
(though a King) that he proteſts were it not for the preſence of
good <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> he would not have looked towards him. 2 <hi>King:</hi>
3. 14. As alſo for the ſame defect and guiltineſs, the Nations were
then called, the dogs of the Gentiles, Then if men would have
themſelves or their houſes truly honourable, ſeek God, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:
otherwiſe without him they are but mancipat ſlaves to
Satan, ſinne and their own beaſtly affections.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. In <hi>Davids</hi> deprecation we ſee what care the
godly ſhould have of the Lords glory and honour of his name, that
the ſame be not blaſphemed amongſt the adverſaries, ſo farre as
we may hinder or ſtop the ſame, being jealous over the ſame
with a Holy zeale, that thereby we may ſhow our ſelves affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and true Children to our heavenly Father, and not by our
words or actions to open their mouths againſt that holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his bleſſed truth, to the triumphant rejoycing of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
and ſcandalizing of the weake: as we would eſchew that
fearfull condemnation of Hypocrit's, and that terrible woe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt all thoſe by whom offence cometh.</p>
                  <p>6. The rejoycing of the wicked is evill, and in the calamities
and affliction ever of the godly, as this ſame propheticall prince
teſtifieth and ſheweth plainly alſo in the 41 <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job: 30. 9, 10. &amp;c.</note> of his enemies
and falſe friends, thus <hi>Shimei</hi> railed againſt <hi>David</hi> in his flying
from <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev: 11. 10.</note> and thoſe that were more vile then the earth made
their ſong and talk of holy <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, and took pleaſure at
his calamity, ſo did the earthly ſort (ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>)
rejoyce over the Lords Prophets that were ſlaine by the
beaſt, and left unburied, and were glad and ſent gifts one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for theſe two Prophets vexed them continually, which
rejoycing proceeds from the hatred of the Godly, and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
from the diſſimilitude of their manners, no ſociety being
between light and darkneſs, and an inveterate enmity being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Serpent, and the ſeed of the woman.</p>
                  <p>7. The right conſideration of all calamities whether publick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119120:13"/>
or private, but eſpecially ſuch as befall the eſtate of a whole
Nation as this, is in the right reſpect of the cauſes, conſequents, and
right remedy, the materiall being ſinne, or procurer the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
being the efficient or juſt inflictor, the forme is puniſhment,
and the finall cauſe, to bring men to repentance, the ſequell that
followes upon our ſinning, and procuring God ſo to puniſh, being
the ſlander of Gods glory, diſgracing of our profeſſion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the name of God to be blaſphemed amongſt the adverſaries
and the taking away of good men, with everſion of republicks.
No remedy being to amend all this, but ſpeedy repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of our Lives.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. The bleſſings and priviledges of places are not
perpetuall, but temporall and alternative, ſometimes to be monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

ſometime the glory of the earth, and now for it ſinnes,

deſolation. <hi>Chorazim</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> let them teſtify the ſame.</p>
                  <p>9. Wickedneſs or ſinfull facts committed in places, is the
cauſe which bringeth alterations and curſes upon them, curſed
therefore (ſaith the Lord) ſhall the earth be for thy cauſe, to
<hi>Adam,</hi> when he tranſgreſſed, conſider likewiſe what made that
pleaſant valley where <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> with the other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

and induration brought plagues upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> the iniquity and
pride of <hi>Babylon</hi> literall,<note place="margin">Revel: 18.</note> brought utter devaſtation upon her, and
as is is ſurely propheſied, the ſame for the like cauſes, ſhall be the
lot of that Citie myſticall, even as for the ſlaughter of the people

as here againſt mount <hi>Gilboa.</hi>
                  </p>

we ſee them altered and changed to the contrary, ſhould give us
an example to beware leaſt we procure the like by our ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and ſhould make us to lament their fall, and to acknowledge
in any temporall thing, that befalls to man, that there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity
whereof he ought to dreame or preſume, but as the Moon
our life is led by changes, and time goes by turnes, thus <hi>Jonathans</hi>

11. A notable example of <hi>Davids</hi> godly modeſty who with
dead <hi>Saul</hi> buries the remembrance of all his faults and infirmities,
ſpeaking only good of him, albeit his foe, and reporting theſe
things only that tended to his praiſe, whereby he ſhewes his heart
(out of the abundance whereof the Mouth ſpeaks) to be void of
all malice or hatred ever carried towards him, although he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
ſought his life, and hunted him to and fro, as a Partridge
in the wilderneſs, and therefore as before his hand would not
touch his perſon, ſo neither will he have his tongue now for to

teſtify not only his great griefe, which makes him to exhort others
to aſſiſt him, (eſpecially that ſex which by nature are moſt prone
to be pitifull, in a matter chiefly ſo nearely concerning themſelves)
but alſo thereby he would ſhew what loyall love, and reſpective
duty affectionate ſubjects owe to their Prince, rejoycing for
his happy life over them, and mourning for his dolefull death

after the death of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The hiſtory is divided in two parts, the former is the hiſtory
of the elections, <hi>David</hi> to be King over <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi>

of the civill warres between them, and the event thereof,

Now to return, firſt to <hi>Davids</hi> conſultation, It is probable
that <hi>David</hi> and his followers were wearied in the long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
troubles of <hi>Sauls</hi> perſecution by the ſpace of 18. years,
and now being a long time exiles, had a great deſire to return to
their native Country, as alſo that <hi>David</hi> after the death of <hi>Saul</hi>
called to minde the promiſe of <hi>Samuel</hi> and right made to him of
the Kingdome, by the Ceremony and Sacrament of holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and now reaſoned with himſelf, that God had offered
the opportunity, which wiſe men ſhould not neglect, but becauſe
he conſidered that it was not enough to have a good cauſe, but
the ſame likewiſe ſhould be rightly managed, or uſed, and albeit
the ſubſtance of his title was good, yet the circumſtances of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
thereto being uncertain, therefore godly <hi>David</hi> for his
own, direction and confirmation of his aſſociats, begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
with God, of the time and place, where and when he ſhould
make entrance into his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This cuſtome to conſult with God before weighty enterpriſes
in all times hath been practiſed by the godly, as before the Law
the Patriarches without the warrant of Gods inſtinction and
Revelation attempted no matter of any moment, as at large we
may view the truth hereof in their lives and actions, and after
the Law it was ſet down by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 27. <hi>of Numbers vers</hi> 21.
That <hi>Joſhua</hi> and his ſucceſſours ſhould undertake nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conſultation with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> by the mediation of
<hi>Eleazer</hi> the Highprieſt and his ſucceſſours, which alſo by all the
faithfull was carefully followed, as a cloud of witneſſes may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
in the Regiſter of holy writ, while the exhibition of the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true Highprieſt who is the perfect light and lamp of the World,
who after his aſcenſion gave his Spirit to his Apoſtles, and now
preſently by his word and ſpirit ceaſeth not to reveall the will
of his Father to his Church with whom he hath promiſed to
be preſent till the conſummation of the World. The gentiles
and infidels, as their Maſter Satan is a counterfeiter of God, ſo
were they herein apes of the godly, they attempted in like manner
no warres nor no weighty matter, as they ſpeak, <hi>in auſpicato,</hi> ſo
that it was an opinion amongſt the heathen, <hi>a Jove principium,</hi>
as well as amongſt the godly, albeit they varied in the forme, and
knowledge of the right God, and that nothing ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119120:15"/>
without conſultation with the ſacred oracle which
ſhould firſt go before; And there is many examples in all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that even good matters have not proſpered when this form
hath been neglected. But whether this conſultation of <hi>Davids</hi>
was by the extraordinary way, of Prophets, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> thinks,
or by the more ordinary way of conſulting with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
by mediation of the Highprieſt <hi>Abiathar,</hi> who was with
him, or by both, for his greater confirmation, it is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted,
onely this is enough, that we know that <hi>David</hi> in this
action would do nothing, by his own wiſdome, or will, but by
the Counſell of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> as <hi>Jacob</hi> did in his flight from <hi>Laban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the firſt interrogation is, ſhall I go up? or is it fit time?
and the ſecond is whether? or which is the moſt convenient
place? to both which conceſſively, or affirmatively the Lord,
anſwers, <hi>Go up,</hi> to <hi>Hebron;</hi> This City of <hi>Hebron,</hi> was famous
for the ſepultures of the Patriarches (and called <hi>Kiriath arba</hi>)
to whom the promiſes of the Kingdome was made and it was
in the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſhua 21. and 14.</note> diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 20. miles, that
place where the ſpies <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> came, and was a City of
refuge there after, which did fall in lot to the Levits, and was
poſſeſſed by the poſterity of <hi>Caleb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this City then, according to divine direction <hi>David</hi>
goeth up, together with his wives, whom he would not leave
in <hi>Ziklag,</hi> being an unſure place for them to abide in, without
his preſence and protection, as late experience had taught, as
alſo he takes his men with him, whom wiſely and carefully he
places, diſtributing them and their families amongſt the Cities,
or Suburb's of <hi>Hebron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus being come up to <hi>Hebron,</hi> by the men of <hi>Judah</hi> (whoſe
hearts the Lord had inclined towards him, and prepared) <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
is anointed King, which is done by divine providence, for
his further confirmation in the aſſured expectation of the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

their approbation and willing conſent to receive him to rule
and reign over them.</p>
               <p>His firſt action enſeving, is, upon the report of the fact of
the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> in burying <hi>Saul,</hi> (after whoſe bodies

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119120:16"/>
to beſtow upon them honourable buriall, and by this occaſion
got notice of this peece of kinde ſervice) he ſendeth a loving meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
unto them, wiſhing mercy and truth from God, which is,
that they might have their part in the Lords gratious promiſes,
and aſſured performance, and promiſing reward and recompenſe
on his part towards them and ſubjoyning withall, a comfortable
exhortation to be of good courage, ſeeing the Lord had not left
them deſtitute, but had raiſed him up, as a head and Protectour
over them.</p>

and arrogant perſon, to make <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> a ſhaddow, being of a

of <hi>Sauls</hi> poſterity, <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> eldeſt Son

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 1. WE ſee here in <hi>David,</hi> holy prudence and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in not omitting that fit occaſion of entry
to the Kingdome, which the Lord by the death of <hi>Saul</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
but embracing the ſame, and addreſſing himſelf to make
good uſe thereof, for as the Lord will have us not to runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, but patiently to wait while he offer occaſion, and open
a dore of entry, ſo likewiſe will he have us not to ſlip occaſions
offered, but laying hold on the hoary fore head thereof, to
work and walk with him in Chriſtian wiſdome and ſerpentine
prudence, having a judicious eye to mark them, a holy heart
to reverence them, and a diligent hand to make uſe, and lay hold
of them, and this both in the occaſions and offers of grace, with
the wiſe virgins, and of our temporall eſtate, with <hi>Salomons</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
man in his affaires, who ſtandeth before kings, we may ſee
cleerly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 24.</p>
                  <p>2. In that orderly he beginnes at God, we ſee that it is not
ſufficient to have good cauſes publick, or private, but in like
manner it is requiſite to proſecute them aright, otherwiſe a good
cauſe in the matter may become evil in the prepoſterours forme,
albeit the reciprocant be never true, that a good forme, may
make an evil cauſe good in ſubſtance,<note place="margin">Gen. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>bona bene ergo agantur.</hi>
The cauſe which the Sonnes of <hi>Jacob</hi> had to revenge the rape
and abuſe of their Siſter was good, but the forme wicked, to doe
it by private revenge, and under truſt and cloake of circumciſion,
the cauſe likewiſe of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> was good, but
the forme, in conſulting with a Witch in the perſecution
thereof unlawfull. So the cauſes of <hi>Joſias</hi> againſt <hi>Necho</hi> King
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of <hi>Jeconias</hi> and <hi>Jehojakim</hi> againſt <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
with ſundry others. Let all men therefore know the
right warrant of their cauſes to be in the matter, and then in
the forme; the right rule whereof is to be had in the ſacred oracle
of Gods will and word, which we ought reverendly to conſult, &amp;
not to proceed without the warrant thereof, otherwiſe men will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119120:17"/>
be diſappointed of their expectations and aimes, as in <hi>Ioſhuas</hi>
example againſt <hi>Hai,</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and in <hi>Saul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
with a <hi>Pythoneſſe,</hi> and in all them who conſults fleſh and
blood.</p>
                  <p>3. As <hi>David</hi> inquires, ſo the Lord anſwers, yeelding he ſhould
go in generall, and in particular directing him to <hi>Hebron,</hi> where
we may behold the great clemency of God, who is moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
unto the ſuits of his own, and more redy to give a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
anſwer, and reſolution to his Children in their perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
then they are bent to crave the ſame of him, and will ever
give the direction of his word and Spirit to all thoſe who earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call upon him for the ſame, witneſſe a heap of teſtimonies con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained
in holy Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 22. 32. 28. 46. 1. 2. &amp;c.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 9. and 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>4. In that he inquires not once onely, if he ſhould go? But
again, whether he ſhould go? We perceive how preciſely in each
thing he deſires to have a warrant and information, and how
fully he would follow the Lords direction, that he would have
every ſtep, as it were, of his progreſſe in this purpoſe pointed
out by God, and would not in any thing lean, or rely to his
own brain, or wiſdome, in holy humility diſtruſting thus the
counſell, or courſe of fleſh and blood, and ſubmitting himſelf,
as a Child, to be led by the hand of ſo wiſe and carefull a Father,
whom if he obediently followed, he was ſure he ſhould neither
ſtumble nor ſtray, but ſhould ſee a proſperous ſucceſſe and end of
the matter he had in hand, whoſe example herein every Child
of God ought to imitate in all the courſe of their lives, and actions
of any importance eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>5. As he inquires often, ſo is he to every interrogation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
for we ſhall firſt be weary and (like <hi>Abraham</hi> ſueing for
the Sodomits preſervation) leave of to ſpeak, before the Lord
ceaſe to hearken, or be weary in anſwering and granting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
of his own, if we ask it ſhall be given us, if we ſeek,
we ſhall finde, and if we yet knock it ſhall be opened unto us,
and whatſoever we ſhall deſire of the Father in Chriſts name,
if it be according to his will and our will, it ſhall be granted
to us, No importunity then can trouble this righteous Judge,
therefore pray continually, and let this comfort be, as that ſtone
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119120:17"/>
ſet under <hi>Moſes</hi> heavy hands, to uphold our hearts, that we ſaint
not, and weary not in prayer.</p>
                  <p>6. In all this proceeding of <hi>Davids,</hi> we ſee, that he was
void of a greedy minde to the Kingdome, or any gain, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thereof, not uſing prepoſterous haſt as many doe, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
God nor conſcience, but walking in a right and in a ſlow
courſe, expecting by inquiſition and direction, the Lords thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him forward to undertake that place and function upon him,
where unto formerly by <hi>Samuel</hi> he had been anointed. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well, where the warrant of Cods direction is had in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
there the comfort of his aidfull protection ſhall never
be wanting in the execution of an office, which ſhould teach us
how to behave our ſelves in the entry to our particular callings
in like ſort, and not to runne before we be ſent.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Vers</hi> 2. According to the Lords direction, ſo <hi>David</hi> goeth
up to <hi>Hebron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jerem. 42. 5. 43. 2.</note> ſo, as he is carefull to know Gods will, ſo is he
diligent to practiſe, and to obey the ſame, Not like to <hi>Johanan</hi>
and his company, who would enquire the Lord by <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
what way they ſhould walk in, and what they ſhould do, with a
ſolemne proteſtation, to obey the Lords direction, whatſoever it
were, but when the Lords direction was declared unto them,
they ſaid unto the Prophet that he ſpake falſly, and that they
would do what pleaſed themſelves, like moſt men now adayes
in like manner, who will hear, but neglect to doe; labour for
ſcience but omity conſcience, are whole, in words of profeſſing,
but nothing in works of practiſing, and will acknowledge
Chriſt to be a Prieſt who hath offered up himſelf for them, and
a Prophet to teach, but will not admit him to be a King, and
to rule over them, ſubdueing their affections unto his holy
obedience; thoſe, and their faith are alike, dead, though they
would ſeem to live, let us practiſe then, as we pray, <hi>Fiat volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
tua,</hi> and do as we are directed.</p>
                  <p>8. In bringing up his wives and men with him with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
to <hi>Hebron</hi> he ſhewes his equitable and thankfull minde,
in that, he would have thoſe who were Portioners with him in
his adverſity, pertakers likewiſe with him in his proſperity and
preferment, his honours not changing his manners, much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to the arrogant formes of many ingratefull great men and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119120:18"/>
courtiers and others now a dayes, who are forgetfull (like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
Butler) of curteſies and good deeds formerly done unto
them, when they were ſhrubs like other, albeit they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſince, like tall cedars, and in their advancement conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
neither from whence preferment cometh, nor yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Joſeph.</hi> As we ſhould be thankfull therefore to God
for his benefits, and carefull of the firſt table, ſo let us be
likewiſe unto men, as good inſtruments, and practiſe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the ſecond, God hath joyned them, let no man then ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Vers</hi> 3. <hi>David</hi> diſtributeth his men and followers with their
houſholds amongſt the villages of <hi>Hebron,</hi> wherein his royall,
wiſe, and loving care at his firſt entry appears towards his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in reſpect that he will not over burden <hi>Hebron</hi> it ſelf,
nor any other one part with a multitude, but ſo prudently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the places of their habitations, that both they ſhould be
eaſed, and thoſe amongſt whom their abode ſhould be, ſhould
have no overcharging, whereby he ſaves himſelf from giving
occaſion of grudging, and gaines greatly the love of their
hearts, as afterwards appeares. A good example for all
Princes and Magiſtrates to follow, and not like fooliſh <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
to be reguardleſſe of their eaſe, and not to overburden
their ſubjects, or like tirannous <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to make them marks,
to deal ſo in holy diſcretion, and loving prudence, with others,
as having a due and compaſſionate regard to the ſtrength and
ability of every one, not ſtraining nor ſtraitning them above the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Vers</hi> 4. <hi>David</hi> is no ſooner come up to <hi>Hebron,</hi> but the
men of <hi>Judah</hi> came alſo and there they anoint him King, where
we ſee, that to them who obey Gods direction, all things
ſhall ſucceed, albeit though <hi>Laban</hi> be following after, and <hi>Eſau</hi>
be meeting <hi>Jacob</hi> before, both of a cruell intention towards
him, yet ſeeing he was following the Lords direction in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
<hi>Labans</hi> tongue and <hi>Eſaus</hi> hand is ſo reſtrained, that the one
is commanded to ſpeak nothing but good to him, and the others
heart ſo turned, that he embraces <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his journy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
proſperous, let every one therefore who would have
a bleſſing and happy ſucceſſe in their callings, or affaires obey
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119120:18"/>
the Lords direction, and then things expected, yea and things
unexpected to their comfort ſhall fall out and come to paſs, and
who doth otherwiſe contrary to that direction, ſhall with <hi>Jonas</hi>
find croſſings and diſappointments unawares, ſo that they ſhall
never attaine to their aimes, more then he did to <hi>Tarſis,</hi> but was
forced to go unto <hi>Niniveh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. In that he is formerly here elected and accepted to be
the King, by the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> and albeit that <hi>David</hi> had the
undoubted right, yet he will not proceed but by the conſent and
the ordinary way, his practice herein ſerves ſufficiently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all theſe who intrude themſelves in any eminent place in
Church or policy, Magiſtracy or Miniſtry upon whoſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and labours a bleſſing cannot be expected, nor in their
croſſings can they be ſure of comfort, witneſs, <hi>Abimelech</hi> and
the men of <hi>Sechem,</hi> becauſe they entered not in an orderly
way.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Judah</hi> who doth anoint <hi>David</hi> King, diſſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
from all the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who refuſe him, and accept
<hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> and yet <hi>Davids</hi> right and election is better then <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſeths,</hi>
neither doth <hi>Judah's</hi> paucity ſerve to improve <hi>Davids</hi>
title, nor <hi>Iſraels</hi> multitude to approve <hi>Iſhboſeth's</hi> perſonall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
therefore multitude is no ſure note of the true Church,
nor of a good cauſe, therefore a wiſe caveat is ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
follow not the multitude to do evill, but try the quality and
warrant of the cauſe, and reſolve with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> albeit all ſhould
forſake the Lord, yet for thy part ſtill to obey and ſerve him,
<hi>Ioſhua,</hi> 24. 15.</p>
                  <p>13. In reſpect likewiſe that <hi>Iudah</hi> apart from all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointeth
<hi>David</hi> their King, being warranted herein, both in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
by the promiſes of God, made concerning the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of that tribe, and in particular by the manifeſt declaration
of Gods will concerning <hi>David</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> therefore
having and following the warrant of Gods will and Word herein,
they are not the diviſion or Schiſme-makers, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame though the greater multitude by farre. It is not
they then, who ſeparate themſelves from the company or
perſons of men, but who ſeparate themſelves from the truth,
and Gods Word (which is the touchſtone thereof) that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119120:19"/>
are ſchiſmaticall or rent-makers in the Church, and all thoſe who
follow the direction of it (as <hi>Iudah</hi> doth here) aſſuredly ſhall
goe aright, where ſuch as contemne the ſame, and with <hi>Iſrael</hi>
glorie in multitude ſhall be ſeduced and goe aſtray.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>David</hi> long ago had gotten title unto the kingdome, but
after many yeares till now, he gets no entry unto the ſame, and
not now unto the whole, but a ſmall part, till afterwards, but
at laſt he getteth poſſeſſion of all; So by degrees doth the Lord
performe his workes, to exerciſe the faith, the hope, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and conſtancy of his choſen, but at laſt to the full he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth
whatſoever he promiſeth, that ſtill we may learn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon him without fainting, being aſſured in his own time
he will come, and not delay, mercy and truth ſhall kiſſe one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and one jot of his word ſhall not faile, let that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the promiſes made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning his ſeed,
<hi>Joſephs</hi> preferment, <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance and many others be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
hereof.</p>
                  <p>15. In all the foreſaid things, we have the kingdome of Chriſt
repreſented, for, as by <hi>Sauls</hi> tyranny, <hi>David</hi> was perſecuted, ſo
was Chriſt and his Church: yet as <hi>Saul</hi> was overthrowne and an
entry made to <hi>David,</hi> ſo were the Churches perſecutors taken
out of the way, and ſhe began to be advanced, as <hi>David</hi> did not
his own will, but followed Gods, ſo Chriſt wrought not his own
will, but his fathers, as <hi>David</hi> aſcended to <hi>Hebron,</hi> ſo hath Chriſt
to heaven, as <hi>David</hi> carried thither with him his wives and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
ſo hath Chriſt made his Church and ſervants participate
of all his benefits, and doth daily bring them to that ſame place
to which he hath gone before them, as <hi>David</hi> was received only
by <hi>Judah,</hi> but rejected by the greateſt part, ſo is Chriſt and his
kingdome, as <hi>Davids</hi> kingdome is not accompliſhed at one time, ſo
neither Chriſts, as it had ist own competitours, ſo hath Chriſts,
but as the kingdome of <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> is ſhort and declining, but <hi>Davids</hi>
longer and flouriſhing, ſo is it between Chriſt and Satans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and as <hi>David</hi> was often times anointed, by <hi>Samuel,</hi> by
<hi>Judah,</hi> and at laſt by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo was Chriſt, which <hi>Paul</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to three, the Spirit of power, ſanctification, and firſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. Concerning the report made of the men of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſh
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119120:19"/>
Gilead</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> concerning their burying of <hi>Saul,</hi> after
whoſe body probably he had cauſed to inquire (as is aforeſaid)
others are of opinion, that it was to inflame him againſt them,
others that he ſhould beware of them (ſeeing they were profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
favourers of <hi>Saul</hi>) or reconciled with them, but <hi>David</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all ſiniſtrous opinions and ſuſpitions of them aſide, charitably
conſtruing their fact, and for their fidelity and kindneſs to their
Lord, he honours them with an embaſſage congratulatory, and
a promiſe of his favour and aſſiſtance, whereby we are taught
not to give eare and credit to detraction, but being ſlow to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive
of mens actions, rather charitably to make the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of them, till more manifeſt experience prove them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
thus greatly ſhall we diſappoint Satan that ill ſeed ſower,
ſtop diſſention, maintaine unity, approve our ſelves to God, and
readily winne our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>17. In the men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> we ſee the loyall and ſinceer love
of ſubjects to their prince obeying him being alive, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him being dead, which fact, as pleaſing to God, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by man, is regiſtred in Scripture, (like <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Chriſt) to be recorded for ever, for the memoriall of the
juſt ſhall flouriſh, that the name of the wicked ſhall be put out,
either with the ſilence of oblivion, or elſe the black daſh of the
record of their foule deeds, innumerable examples hereof may
be collected in holy writ, where they are recorded.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. That which <hi>David</hi> wiſheth to them from God,
is mercy, and truth in the aſſured performance, but that which
he himſelfe promiſeth, is reward, the one is free, the other of
debt, no merit then will he aſcribe unto them at Gods hands,
but will yeeld the ſame at his own, in regard by his princely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
he was bound to cheriſh the good, as well as to chaſtiſe the
bad, and not to ſuffer ſuch kind loyalty to his Father-in-law,
and predeceſſour, which they with ſuch care and hazard of their
lives had ſhewne, to be misknowne, uncommended and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as being aſſured, that they who were loyall to one would
be ſo to another. Let this therefore informe aright the minds of
all men, how to eſteeme of their own actions, in all holy and
humble ſobriety, never urging merit upon God, howſoever we
deſerve at the hands of man, but ſuiting free mercy, and with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119120:20"/>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> profeſſing our ſelves unworthy of the leaſt of his mercies,
being but unprofitable ſervants, and our goods deeds (wherein
as in the way to the kingdome ever we ſhould walke) extending
no waies to him, but to the Saints on earth (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
ſayeth) <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16. 2. And availing our own ſoules, but not God,
as we likewiſe ſee, <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 2. and 31. 7.</p>
                  <p>19. We have alſo in <hi>David</hi> here, the patterne of a good King
and loving, who as he was carefull before to execute juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Amalekite</hi> for his wicked fact, ſo is he diligent here to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
kindneſs to the men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> for their godly deed, thus
ought all Magiſtrates who are the Lords deputies, and gods on
earth, cheriſh virtue, and chaſtiſe vice, that ſo the one may grow,
and the other may be repreſſed, being as an awfull Lyon to the
one, and a mild Lamb to the other, rewarding the vertuous and
godly, and puniſhing the vicious and wicked, ſo ſhall their throne
be eſtabliſhed, their Crowne gliſter, and their Scepter flouriſh,
In the Church let <hi>Abiathar</hi> therefore be caſt out and <hi>Zadok</hi> ſet in
his roome,<note place="margin">1 King. 2. 34, 35.</note> and let <hi>Joab</hi> ſuffer for his fault, and <hi>Benajah</hi> in the
policy be ſurrogat in his place.</p>
                  <p>20. In reſpect that he promiſeth unto them protection and
therefore exhorteth them not to be diſcouraged, by the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi>
late victory, or <hi>Sauls</hi> death, ſeeing God had raiſed him up,
and he was anointed King, we ſee not only the duty of a lawfull
prince, which is to maintaine and defend his ſubjects, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that the Lord ſuffers never his own to be altogether deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of comfort, for if he humble with the one hand, he will raiſe
with the other, and if he take one benefit from us, he will give
us another in the place thereof, yea perhaps a greater as he did
here <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Saul,</hi> or as he reſtored holy <hi>Job,</hi> if with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
patience, and conſtancy we depend upon him.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. In the election and anointing of <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> who
was made King by <hi>Abner,</hi> we ſee no conſulting of God, againſt
whoſe ordinance, and expreſs notified will (confeſſed c. 3. 18.)
they were going an indirect courſe, therefore they knew, either
with <hi>Saul</hi> they would get no anſwer, or elſe contrary to
their intended proceedings; thus againſt God, conſcience, and
right, they rebelliouſly proſecute that courſe which turned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to their own ruine, like many now adaies, who if they may

attaine to a pretended right, and poſſeſſion, by policy and power
to defraud the right owners, and withhold their due from them,
whether it be holy things ſeperate from the common uſe, or mans
good and prophane, they will never conſult Gods Word, nor
conſcience, how lawfully they attained or detaine the ſame, yea
although the oracle of the one, and prick of the other, moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
contradict and convince them, yet <hi>Achan</hi> will take the

               <p>THe election of theſe two Kings by whoſe contrary authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
great diſſention was raiſed in <hi>Iſrael</hi> being formerly
treated of, till the 12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> Now from the 12. to the end, we
have the hiſtory of the firſt civill debates between <hi>Abner,</hi> Generall
of <hi>Iſhboſeths</hi> Army, and <hi>Joab</hi> Generall of <hi>Davids.</hi> In the which
we have proponed theſe particulars; firſt, the ſingular combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
12. on every ſide of the companies conducted by <hi>Joab</hi> for
<hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> for <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> and the circumſtances thereof. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
from the 17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> to the 24. We have the battles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Armies, and the event thereof, which is a bloody vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
which befell to <hi>Joab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the 24. <hi>Verſ.</hi> to the end, we have the retreate
from the battle, occaſioned by the conference between the two
Captaines <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt, which is the ſingular combat, from the 12. <hi>Verſ.</hi>
to the 17. are to be conſidered theſe circumſtances, the perſons,
place, time, occaſion, act, and conſequence.</p>
               <p>The time is obſerved to have been after the election of both
the Kings, <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the which time
<hi>David</hi> appeares to have dedicate himſelfe to quietneſs for three
reaſons, Firſt in regard of his oath made to <hi>Saul</hi> concerning his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119120:21"/>
poſterity. 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 24. 22. The ſecond is grounded upon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
ſeeing he was followed as yet by the fewer number,
whom he would not hazard, as being prodigall of their lives.
The third is from faith, patiently abiding Gods time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
his further advancement (whereof he was aſſured)
unto Gods opportunity and work, where <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
breaks Faith, and depends upon the opportunity and
power of his forces.</p>
               <p>The perſons occaſioners are <hi>Joab, Davids</hi> ſiſters ſonne, and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
kinſman to <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> the one provoking, the other yeilding,
both men of great courage and experience, the one having an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
cauſe, and relying on carnall reſpects, the other defending a
good cauſe, and relying on God, and the equity thereof, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
are 12 on each ſide.</p>
               <p>The place is at the poole of <hi>Gibeon</hi> in the lot of <hi>Benjamin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The occaſion is <hi>Abners</hi> provocation, <hi>Joab</hi> being defender.</p>
               <p>The act is a ſingular combat, 12. againſt 12. with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and cruelty fought.</p>
               <p>The event is, they are all ſlaine, and therefore the place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a new impoſed name in memory of the fact, aud the two
Armies mutually joyne in battle.</p>
               <p>It is to be reſolved then whether this forme of ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
be lawfull amongſt Chriſtians and the godly, or not. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I anſwer it is ſimply unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is altogether without warrant of Gods Word,
and therefore is an action without Faith and conſequently ſinne,
whereof alſo it followes, that doing it without Gods command
we cannot look for his aide or protection therein.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is altogether againſt Gods command, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not murder,</hi> which thou hereby committeſt on thy neighbour if
thou kill, and ſo is ever after haunted with the conſcience of
blood, or of thy ſelfe if thou be killed, deſperately running thy
body on the ſword of thy enemy, and thy ſoule on the ſword of
Gods puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly as it is without precept, yea againſt precept, ſo is it
without laudable practiſe in all Gods Word, never a one but a
barbarous <hi>Philiſtine</hi> making offer thereof, and <hi>David</hi> by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
providence and motion, upon extraordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119120:21"/>
experience, by an extraordinary weapon and way, for the
glory of God, and honour of Gods people, being brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſtirred up, doth undertake the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is againſt the law of man, likewiſe in all Chriſtian
and well eſtabliſhed kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is altogether brutiſh, ſeeing that is the forme of beaſts
to puſh, and teare, or kill each one another, from whoſe practiſe
man endued with reaſon, but much more with grace ſhould alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
abhorre.</p>
               <p>Sixtly yet more, it is diveliſh ſeeing he hath been a man-ſlayer,
and defacer of Gods image from the beginning, and all man-ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are his children, and conſequently inheritors of his portion
reſerved for him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> it directly impugnes that evangelicall command of
Chriſt Jeſus forbidding privat revenge, and ſo is an antichriſtian
practiſe.</p>
               <p>Eightly, it is a high wronging of God, and contempt of the
Magiſtrate to whom he hath committed the ſword, diſturbing
them both from their places (as it were) of repaying revenge,
and ſo is a practiſe hatefull to heaven and to earth.</p>
               <p>As for the maintaining of thy credit thereby, let the credit of
thy perſon, yeild to the credit of thy profeſſion, which above all
things thou ought to maintaine and obey, and as for triall in
doubtfull caſes, there are 4 waies in Gods Word, by witneſſes
<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6. By writ, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. By confeſſion, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. And by
oath of the party, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 11. Beſides theſe there is none other
lawfull, but the party and matter muſt be left to Gods juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and time of further light, and better that ſome truths a while
be unknown, then unlawfully ſearcht.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. IN theſe troubles that are raiſed by <hi>Abner</hi> againſt <hi>David</hi> and
his people, we ſee the truth of that royall ſentance which he
afterwards upon manifold experience pronounced, many are the
troubles of the Godly, but the Lord delivers them out of them
all, as our maſter Jeſus Chriſt affirmes, In the world you ſhall have
affliction &amp;c. And as the Apoſtles teſtifie, whoſoever will live
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119120:22"/>
Godly in this preſent world muſt ſuffer perſecution, and by many
tribulations we muſt enter into the kingdome of heaven, this is
confirmed by reaſon and éxperience, the firſt reaſon is taken from
Gods Fatherly care, by this way exerciſing his children, and his
gifts in them, that like <hi>Moab</hi> they ſettle not upon their lees, and
containing them in diſcipline to make them conformable in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
with their Saviour here, that they may be ſo in glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
yea and to witneſs thereby (which is ſtrange!) his love
to them, for whom the Lord loves, them he chaſtiſes, the other
reaſon is from the nature of Satan and the world, ever oppoſite
to the quietneſs of the faithfull, which experience taken from all
ages of the Godly, and conſideration of the eſtate, eſpecially from
<hi>Davids</hi> in this preſent hiſtory, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the
Goſpell, doth evidently confirme.</p>
                  <p>2. In reſpect that <hi>David</hi> is only defender, his intention is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
not meaning to amplify his kingdome by trouble, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
blood, and faith-breaking but by Godly, peaceable, and
honeſt meanes referring the work to God, for the farther promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and amplifying of his kingdome, But <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> are
the contrary, and uſe the contrary meanes, whoſe example, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the moſt part follow them) in inlarging the bounds of their
commandment, ſhould be eſchewed, therefore alſo it is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
like unto them fall and decay, and as few follow <hi>David,</hi> ſo
few ſtand and grow like unto him, as may be amplified by the
fall of ſundry <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and ſtanding of Godly princes. An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
therefore to conquer by lawfull and conſcionable meanes,
not joyning houſe to houſe, nor field to field by iniquity, leaſt ſo,
(as the Prophet ſaith) they conquer ſhame and deſtruction to
themſelves; as the Pſalmiſt likewiſe found by experience, I looked
after the ungodly, and he was not, but the juſt inherit the earth.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. The cruell and barbarous nature of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is ſeen in <hi>Abner,</hi> delighting to feed his eies with bloodſhed and
ſlaughter, and counting no more of it but as a game, whereas the
Godly man regardeth the life of his beaſt, but the very mercies of
the wicked are cruell, this nature they participate, of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
maſters; the Godly who are called the meek of the earth, of
that meek Lamb Jeſus, and the wicked, the gyants of the earth,
of that roaring Lyon Satan, who ever goeth about ſeeking whom
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119120:22"/>
he may deſtroy, and hath been a manſlayer from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. The ſad and unfortunate event of this ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
all of them on both ſides being ſlain, proveth the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſuch practiſes, whether they obtrude the triall of a title,
or right, that otherwiſe cannot be decided, for a warrant,
or a meanes to ſtay further effuſion of blood, neither of which is
here effectuate, for albeit <hi>Davids</hi> title be undoubtedly good, yet
all of his men here doe fall, as oftimes in Monomachies it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
the innocent to receive the foil, not that hereby we

that he puniſheth preſumption, and will not be holden to bleſſe
with good ſucceſſe unlawfull practiſes, without and againſt a
warrant of his approbation, not ſtaying for his time of clearing
what is in doubt, but thruſting ourſelves into his room, and
as for the battle it joyneth hereupon preſently, ſo that it was

               <p>COncerning the enſueing battle, we have to reſolve, whether

and piety may be obtained. The Anabaptiſts hold the contrary,
becauſe it is forbidden (ſay they) to revenge, or reſiſt evil, and
it is againſt Chriſtian patience, recommended by Chriſt and his

                  <p>5. <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. In <hi>Abners</hi> dehortation to <hi>Aſahel,</hi> containing a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to meddle with any other ſouldier of the hoſt, rather than

irritation of his Brother <hi>Ioab,</hi> whereby he ſhewes his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe

ſlow in revenge, or loath to ſhed blood, ſo firſt, that it is a very
evill thing, to be ſo careleſſe of thoſe that followed him, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

ſhould have more thought of this, How he ſhould hold up his face

let the godly be contrarily minded.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Vers</hi> 23. In <hi>Aſahels</hi> death, who was ſo eager and wilfull in
perſuit, we ſee, that it is good to uſe Victory with mediocrity,
and not with too great cruelty and eager perſuit of the yeelding
and intreating adverſary, by making their minds deſperate and
to reinanimate them (as it were) with new courage to aſſault,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119120:24"/>
and ſeeing no courteſy to be had, to hazard that altogether,
which otherwiſe they cannot ſave; Therefore it was the wiſe

               <p>THe retraite is cauſed by four reaſons, 1. Gods providence,
gathering the clouds and night, whereby he declared that it
was not he will, that more blood ſhould be ſhed, otherwiſe he
might have protracted the day as he did to <hi>Joſhua.</hi> 2. The ſtay
and gazing of the people at the body and death of <hi>Aſahel,</hi> which
greatly moved them, the 3. was the recollection of <hi>Abners</hi> forces
on the hill, taking ſo the opportunity and advantage of the place,
4. the ſpeech of <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Ioab,</hi> taken from three places. 1. <hi>Shall
the ſword devoure for ever?</hi> The meaning whereof is, of things, that
are not good in themſelves, but for the reſpect of another, and
have the conjunction of perill, there ſhould be ſome meaſure,
but warres are ſuch, therefore an end ſhould be put unto them,
the argument is taken from the right fine of warre, which is the
eſtabliſhing of peace, and from humanity. The ſecond argument
is from the conſequent of commodity and incommodity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
in this forme, knoweſt thou not <hi>Ioab,</hi> that the end of all
civil warre is but ſorrow, and albeit thou haſt the Victory, yet
thou haſt not paſt the perill, for if the battle be renewed, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
may change, and it is hard to bring men to the point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpare,
for fury miniſtrates armour and bitterneſſe willbe in the
end. The third, is from naturall and ſpirituall neceſſitudes, we have
<hi>Abraham</hi> one common Father, one God, one faith, one ſort of
Sacraments, and are all Brethren, therefore it is moſt charitable
and beſt ſeeming, to deſiſt.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 26. A Fit argument of diſſuaſion we have here, againſt
all civil diſſentions within any Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
profeſſing the truth, amongſt whatſoever Perſons within
Church, or commonwealth, let the <hi>Midianites</hi> thruſt their ſwords
in to one anothers bowells, and <hi>Sampſons</hi> foxes carry firebrands
between them looking diverſe wayes; but let <hi>Abrahams</hi> voyce be

It greiveth <hi>Rebecca</hi> then the ſtrugling of her two Sonnes

rent in Church, or Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Abner</hi> provoked, hoping aſſuredly to have given the foile

                  <p>3. <hi>Vers</hi> 27. <hi>Ioab</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Abner</hi> turning over the blame
upon him, witneſſeth what was <hi>Davids</hi> part in this battle, towit
defenſive onely, and that he would never have made perſuit, nor
ſought by bloodſhed, or cruelty violently to have enlarged his
Kingdome, but contented him ſelf with his lot, and ſuffered that
wrong of withholding and uſurping his right, till the Lord had

violent in nothing, but by holy zeal taking the Kingdome of

though his adverſary teacheth us, to receive the truth at who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoevers

                  <p>6. <hi>Vers</hi> 29. In <hi>Abner</hi> likewiſe, we ſee the laudable diligence of
a faithfull ſervant journying all the night time, albeit wearied in
battle to report the ſucceſſe of this late conflict, of the which
his Maſter was greatly longing to hear, ſo carefull and painfull
was he to gratify his Maſter, and to reſolve his minde which was
held in ſuſpence.</p>
                  <p>7. We ſee here likewiſe the truth of that Apoſtoticall aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. All things work together for the beſt, to them
that fear God, for by this battle and Victory, <hi>Abners</hi> pride is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
and his intention diſappointed, <hi>I ſhboſeths</hi> power is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and his mind daſht, and <hi>Davids</hi> faith and repoſe in Gods
promiſe is more confirmed by this new proof of Gods aide and
delivery. Let this therefore comfort Gods Children in all ſtraites,
or croſſes, and teach them never to cenſure Gods workes by their
beginnings, or firſt progreſſe, but patiently and confidently to
behold the end, for we ſhall ſee oftimes that it is meer darkneſſe,

from the 22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> to the 28. of theſe then in order.</p>
               <p>The propoſition or generall argument of all this hiſtory, is the
firſt <hi>Verſ. There was long warre &amp;c.</hi> This is not to be underſtood
of battles, becauſe we read not of ſuch to have intervened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe houſes, except that one mentioned in the former
chapter. As to <hi>David</hi> he had deliberated to commit the ſucceſs
of his kingdome to his God, and therefore abſtained from inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and violence. And as to <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> their forces by
the former foile were weakened, and their minds daſht, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would not perill the whole cauſe upon the uncertaine hazard
of a battle, Therefore theſe warres are to be underſtood of the
jealouſies, envies, hatred, diverſity of minds, counſells, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile
practiſes between theſe houſes, whereby the whole inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were divided into factions, and contrary parties, And theſe
warres are called long, becauſe they continued all the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
reigne in <hi>Hebron</hi> after the firſt two yeares of <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> which
was the ſpace of five yeares and ſix moneths. The end of which
warres was, the houſe of <hi>David</hi> increaſed, but the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi>
decreaſed. The reaſon of this diverſity was the contrary nature
of their cauſes and proceedings therein. The cauſe of <hi>David</hi> was
the maintenance of a juſt kingdome, received from God: The
cauſe of <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> was the maintaining of an uſurped tyranny, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of man. The forme of <hi>Davids</hi> proceeding was by faith
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119120:27"/>
and confidence in his God, but <hi>Iſhboſeths</hi> was in the arme of man,
<hi>David</hi> fought, and overcame by patience, and <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in trouble periſhed through deſpaire.</p>
               <p>This is the difference of the kingdome of God, &amp; the kingdome
of Satan, both fight, but in great diverſity, in cauſes, forme, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
conductours, and therefore in great diverſity of end, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
likewiſe, for albeit Satan fought againſt God and his Chriſt,
yet daily (in ſpight of his ſuppoſts) the kingdome of darkneſs
declines: and ſhall decay: and the kingdome of light increaſe, till
at length (as <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth) in that glorious triumph, Satan
ſhall be trodden under foot, and then ſhall be accompliſhed, that
which the Father ſpeaketh to his Chriſt <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 110. <hi>The Lord

                  <p>1. IN the type between the kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, we have to conſider, that like as there was
perpetuall warre between the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
Even ſo in the kingdome and Church of Chriſt, there is not
only hoſtility between the ſame and the manifeſt enemies thereof,
but even in her ſelfe, and own boſome, there hath been, is, and
ſhall be (for the tryall of the elect) perpetuall debates, ſects,
ſchiſmes, and variances, and therefore the wombe of the Church
is fitly reſembled to <hi>Rebecca's,</hi> wherein is much wrangling, and this
is correſpondent to our Saviours warning and prediction of the
eſtate of the Church in the latter daies, as the Apoſtle likewiſe
plainly foretold, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And may be amplified by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of all ages, before the flood, between the ſeed of <hi>Seth</hi> and
<hi>Cain</hi> who were brethren: after the flood between <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Cham:</hi>
before the law, between <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
and his brethren: between <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Kora's</hi> company, after
the law <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe here, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim:</hi> and
under the Goſpell, between Chriſt and his diſciples, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt
and doctors of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> between the Fathers in
the primitive Church and hereticks: and this day between us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
reformation, of religion, and our adverſaries maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119120:27"/>
corruption and mens inventions, and the like debates ſhall
continue till that glorious coming of Chriſt Jeſus to the full
triumph over Satan and hereſie. In the meane time let us with
<hi>David</hi> and all the faithfull prepare our ſelves for the battle, with
conſtant faith, and couragious patience: that having fought
that good fight, and finiſhed our courſe, being faithfull unto the
death, we may obtaine the crowne of life.</p>
                  <p>2. The diverſe ends of theſe two houſes offer to us, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ends of the warfare of Gods children, and their eſtate, and of
the children of the world. The one leads to proſperity, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
runnes to decay, for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>bleſſed is the man, that
putteth his truſt in God, for he ſhall not be aſhamed in the day of
trouble,</hi> and on the contrary as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> affirmeth, <hi>curſed is the
man who putteth his truſt in man, and maketh fleſh his arme.</hi> This
diverſity is proved in the preſervation of <hi>Noah, Lot, Abraham,</hi> the
patriarches, <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> and the remanent good kings in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
alſo of <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelfe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Church of
Chriſt in all ages, <hi>preſſa nunquam oppreſſa,</hi> whoſe bow hath abiden
ſtrong through the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and is ſo built on
her rock, that the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt her,
whereby <hi>Daniels</hi> ſtone hewed out without hands, ſhall and hath
bruiſed all her enemies into aſhes, as thoſe ſudden and fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
and wonderfull alterations of the eſtates of the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the world do teſtify, (like mighty Iſlands moved out of
their places) ſometime by water, by fire, by ſword, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by other extraordinary plagues, and puniſhments, being
waſted (as it were) thereby, examples hereof both in holy
and prophane hiſtories do teſtify. Upon the hope of which end,
let us be encouraged in our Chriſtian warfare, that even ſo ſhall
the eſtate of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and that <hi>Roman Antichriſt,</hi> have the like
decay.</p>
                  <p>3. The reaſon of this diverſity was both in the matter of the
cauſe, and forme of proceeding, whereupon is noted what is the
reaſon of the increaſe and ſtanding of all eſtates, and what is the
true reaſon of their fall and decay: righteous conqueſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
behaviour is the one: and unjuſt uſurpation and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is the other, this is manifeſt by examples of all ages, and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and agrees with the nature of Gods righteous Judgments.</p>

Now after the generall propoſition, the particular meanes of
the increaſe of <hi>Davids</hi> houſe are ſet down, The firſt whereof is

that ſhe merited not to have her progenie nominated, ſome ſaid
that ſhe was moſt noble, and therefore has the chief attribute,
being ſuppoſed to been <hi>Micol Sauls</hi> daughter who was reſtored
to him, fruitfull now, but barren only after that reproach of
<hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20. And ſome, becauſe this woman was beſt

or whether it be ſtrength, wiſdome, honour and riches, as in the
examples of <hi>Goliah, Sampſon, Achitophel, Haman, Baltazar,</hi> and

happy. Then let us pray to God not only to grant us his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
but the right uſe of them, that ſo they may tend to our

forth <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who was a great trouble to him, whereupon we
mark, that conjunctions with parties of contrary and corrupt
religion, is, and ever hath been moſt dangerous, therefore ſuch
was well forbidden in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the Apoſtle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
us to marry in the Lord, this may be confirmed in <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
David, Salomon,</hi> and in the common miſeries of the primitive
world, when the Children of <hi>Seth,</hi> married with the poſterity
of <hi>Kain;</hi> therefore the Patriarches cared for wives to their ſonnes
of their own kindred, and <hi>Eſdras</hi> in the reduction of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from
captivity, cauſed all the people to put away their ſtrange wives,
which they had married in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Then in all conjunctions,

               <p>The time is, when <hi>Abner</hi> was moſt occupied in the defenſe of
<hi>Sauls</hi> houſe, the cauſe is, that <hi>Abner</hi> had defiled <hi>Sauls</hi> concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,
which act was wicked in all reſpects: for if <hi>Abner</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the fact, to abuſe the Kings concubine, as a whore, that
was diſgracefull, and intollerable: otherwiſe if it was to have her
to his wife: it was an argument of affecting the kingdome.
For ſo read we of <hi>Adoniah</hi> affecting the kingdome of <hi>David</hi> by
the like practiſe. And therefore <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> albeit he conſidered not
the right opportunity, had juſt cauſe to uſe this reprehenſion as
if he would ſay, why <hi>Abner</hi> haſt thou preſumed either to make
my Fathers concubine, thy harlot, or elſe hereby why meaneſt
thou to attempt my kingdome?</p>
               <p>

they may import more hur than profit, as we ſee here in <hi>Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeths</hi>

the rebuke of ſinne, that they altogether misregarding God, and
authority, cannot be appeaſed till they be avenged on them who
reprove them; this is our corrupt nature till we be reformed by
grace, and that ſtrong man who rageth within us (being loath to

Let Gods ſervants then be free of them, that they may be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  <p>8. Alſo in upbraiding to <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> ingratitude, let us learn never

thereby we ſhall make ourſelves vile in their accompt, and their

the benefit of ſucceſſion, by Children borne to him in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and
that variance which fell out between <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſeth.</hi> Now
followeth, the reſt of the means of the waxing ſtronger of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
houſe, and the weakning of <hi>Sauls,</hi> the firſt whereof is the
reſtitution of <hi>Michol, Davids</hi> firſt wife, from the 12. <hi>Verſe to the</hi>
17. The ſecond, the declyning of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> to <hi>David</hi>
by <hi>Abners</hi> perſuaſion to the 19. the third, is an amity contracted
between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> from the 19. <hi>to the</hi> 22. <hi>Verſe.</hi> and
the laſt is the ſlaughter of <hi>Abner</hi> by <hi>Joah,</hi> from the 22. <hi>to the</hi>
28. Whereof <hi>David</hi> purgeth himſelf, lamenting him, to the end
of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the firſt we have the Hiſtory of a legation, or meſſage ſent by
<hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> full of all infidelity, preſumption and flattery, the
words albeit yet few, are full of perſuaſion and very pithy. Firſt is
ſet down, as ſome affirme the manner: and others, the occaſion
of the ſending of theſe meſſengers. <hi>Rabbi Chimchi</hi> interprets
thus the Hebrew relative <hi>tahtau,</hi> by the adverb, <hi>ſecretly,</hi> and
gathers thereof that <hi>Abner</hi> uſed great ſubtility in his meſſage,
which he made in private manner, that he ſhould not be ſuſpected
before his friendſhip with <hi>David</hi> ſhould be concluded, which is
an argument of his double and crafty dealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tremellius</hi> exponeth this relative <hi>propter hoc,</hi> and refers the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of this meſſage to the impatient and vindicative minde
of <hi>Abner,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Iſhboſeths</hi> former reprehenſion, which is an
argument of his implacable ire, and rebellion againſt correction,
or repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Others referre it to the Perſon of <hi>Abner, pro ſe,</hi> he ſent in
his own name, or for himſelf onely, any of which expoſitions
may be ſafely followed.</p>
               <p>The firſt Article he gives his meſſengers in inſtruction, is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119120:32"/>
this, <hi>whoſe is the Land?</hi> Whereby he will approve <hi>Davids</hi> title
to the whole Kingdome, as in more copious manner they ſhould
ſay, our Maſter <hi>Abner</hi> grants in his conſcience, that the whole
Kingdome is thine by juſt title, made to thee by God, conferred
be <hi>Samuel,</hi> confeſſed by <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> alſo thou haſt given
thy travels for the preſervation of the republick hitherto, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<hi>Iſrael</hi> from their Enemies. And therefore with thy title are
joyned thy merits, ſo that by undoubted right, and good deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
our Maſter hath given us to grant in his name, that the
Kingdome pertaineth to thee. This is an argument of his crafty
flattery, for this is done by him to <hi>David,</hi> not in ſimplicity,
love, or conſcience, but in doubleneſſe, for revenge, and his own
promotion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Article is, <hi>make a league with me,</hi> he calleth his
corrupt and treaſonable dealing, a league, as the wicked co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
their ungodly doings by honeſt names, and fair ſhewes.
<hi>Joſephus</hi> affirmeth the capitulation of this league was, that <hi>David</hi>
ſhould promis to <hi>Abner</hi> the like greatneſſe and promotion, as
he had with <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> which is an argument of <hi>Abners</hi>
exceſſive pride and ambition.</p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>my hand or aide ſhall be with thee, and I ſhalt
reduce all Iſrael to thy obedience,</hi> an argument of his arrogant
ſelf-confidence and treaſonable infidelity to his Maſter <hi>Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</hi>
Howſoever God converteth it to the advancement of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> anſwereth, allowing and accepting the conditions,
he perceived they were profitable ſervice for eſchewing of blood,
and eſtabliſhing of his quietneſſe: and it might be that <hi>David</hi>
was weary after ſo long delay and expectation, but he joynes a
condition, of the reſtitution of his wife <hi>Michal,</hi> which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
deſires for many reſpects. 1. She was his firſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
wife, and he had experience oftimes of her reciprocall
love. 2. She was not divorced by any Law from him, but
coacted to obey her Fathers empire and commandement. 3. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
would have her delivered from reproach of infamie, now
bruted as an adultereſſe. 4. This was a help to <hi>Davids</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
and confirming him in that Kingdome, ſeeing ſhe was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119120:33"/>
the Kings daughter, and thereby the people would be the
ſooner moved, for her cauſe to encline to <hi>David.</hi> 5. By this
way he would have a proof of <hi>Abners</hi> fidelity, for if <hi>Abner</hi>
had mean't preſently falſhood, or hereafter deſertion, he would
not reſtored <hi>Michal.</hi> Alwiſe becauſe (as appeareth) this reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not altogether in <hi>Abners</hi> hands, therefore <hi>David</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a meſſage to this effect to <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> whereunto <hi>Abner</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
his aſſiſtance. And <hi>David</hi> herein ſheweth his ire not to be
implacable ſeeing he directs to his adverſary a reaſonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
the requiſition towit of <hi>Michol,</hi> whoſe reſtitution he
urgeth by two arguments, the one is from the Law of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
ſhe was his Wife, and by force and coaction onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully
given to another; the other, is from the Law of pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he had bought her with the dowry of an hundred fores<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinnes
of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> (albeit <hi>David</hi> gave 200. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. Yet
here he retaines onely the number craved and covenanted for.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> divorces his Siſter Lawfully from the ſecond unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Husband and ſendeth her under the conduct of <hi>Abner</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>David, Phaltiel</hi> followeth with mourning for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
of ſo noble, vertuous and comely a Wife, to <hi>Bahurim,</hi>
which is a City in Territory of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> not farre from <hi>Bethleem,</hi>
but is ſent back by the command of <hi>Abner,</hi> by whoſe artifice all
this is done, whereby he ſnareth ſimple <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> and meaneth
likewiſe to circumvent <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ariſeth a queſtion, whether this covenant, or condition
between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> be Lawfull, or no?</p>
               <p>It is anſwered, there are two parts in the fact, the one is
the conditions offered by <hi>Abner,</hi> and accepted by <hi>David;</hi> the
other, is the offerer himſelf, and the Amity which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
maketh with him, which we may call the prodition, and
Perſon of the proditor. As to the conditions, or prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there are two conſiderations; firſt is, the nature of
the fact. The ſecond is, the minde of the Author. As to the
firſt it appeareth that it was not evill, becauſe it was to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto <hi>David,</hi> but his owne title and Kingdome, hitherto
uſurped. But as to the minde of <hi>Abner</hi> either towards <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi>
as vindictive, and treacherous: or towards <hi>David,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119120:33"/>
onely for his owne preferment, it was ſimply evill,
whereupon followeth that the accepting of the condition, which
in it ſelfe was Lawfull (howſoever it proceeded from an evill
author) was Lawfull likewiſe: and by this reaſon is excuſed the
fact of <hi>Rahab,</hi> ſurrendring <hi>Jericho</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> as their owne
City.</p>
               <p>But hereon reſulteth another doubt, if <hi>David</hi> conſents to
that which on <hi>Abners</hi> part is evill and ſinne, by the ſentence of
the Apoſtle, he falleth in the like guiltineſſe with the worker of
ſinne, Anſwer, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his writing to <hi>Publius,</hi> and in that
diſputation of his, whether an infidels oath may be received by
a Chriſtian, cleareth this doubt, where concluding affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
that it may, he ſheweth that a godly man without ſinne,
may make uſe of that which in the actor is ſinne; approving the
ſame by the example of <hi>Iacobs</hi> league with <hi>Laban,</hi> and accepting
of his oath by the God of <hi>Nachor,</hi> for conſervation of civil
peace; and by <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that ſome preacht
the Goſpel upon envy and evil minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet affirmes
that he is glad that Chriſt be preached, upon whatſoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe,
for every one ſhall render their owne accompts, and ſo
the anſwer of the ſecond queſtion is conformed to the firſt, that
Lawfull conditions ſhould be received, by whatſoever inſtrument,
or of whatſoever minde, they be offered. But touching the
Lawfulneſſe of the contracting of a ſpecial amity with <hi>Abner,</hi> we
ſhall ſpeak of it hereafter.</p>

matter of his meſſage to <hi>David,</hi> we ſee the crafty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the wicked, and that they are wiſer in their generation
then the Children of Light, but all their wiſdome is like that of
Achitophels, themſelves oftimes are inſnared therewith, and the

crying out that he had done wickedly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27.</p>

rotten Sepulchers with pleaſant paintings: like the wicked
who give honeſt names to unhoneſt actions, and call vertue vice,

brings order from confuſion, light from darkneſs, honour from
ignominie, and advancement from dejection, over ruling ever
all the courſes of the wicked, and directing them to his own end;

imitation, for as men are ſaid to contemne God who relye

ſo that albeit with <hi>Achan,</hi> they know that without a heavy curſe,
they cannot poſſeſs the execrable things, yet with perill of ſoule,

hath in it three arguments uſed by <hi>Abner, à jucundo,
à pio, &amp; ab utili.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>A jucundo,</hi> It was your own ſuit formerly, and your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to have <hi>David</hi> to be your King, and in deliberation between
<hi>David,</hi> and any of <hi>Sauls</hi> poſterity, you chooſed rather and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
him, (as <hi>Abner</hi> well knew in his familiarity with them)
now therefore take your pleaſure and chooſe him.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>A pio,</hi> It is the will of God that ſo it ſhould be, and that
by <hi>Samuel</hi> plainly declared, and notified unto all, for God hath
ſaid it, whoſe word is moſt true, and which (without gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding)
it becometh you in piety to embrace.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>A commodo,</hi> He will ſave you from all your Enemies, which
is a great advantage, and for that end God hath appointed him
to rule over you, whoſe promiſe is your warrant. And in all this
he perſwadeth moſt carefully and particularly, the <hi>Benjamites,</hi>
who were harder to be induced in regard of their naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the houſe of <hi>Saul.</hi> But at laſt having cunningly
effectuate his purpoſe at all hands, he goeth accompanied with
20 ſpecialls of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Hebron unto <hi>David,</hi> by preſence to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
that, which by meſſage he had covenanted, and to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>David</hi> his diligence, credit, and convoy of the errand, and
what he had effectuated. Unto whom <hi>David</hi> maketh a royall
banquet, as a ſymbole of their new contracted amity. Wherein
for ſatisfaction of the doubt rejected to this place, we affirme
plainly that <hi>David</hi> erred. 1. In temeritie or forme, not conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God, according to the command, and practiſe of the
Godly. And 2. In ſubſtance or matter, in entring in familiarity,
and entertaining a notorious wicked man, with whom (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the apoſtolik Canon) he ſhould not have eaten.</p>
               <p>In the end, <hi>Abner</hi> goeth, and promiſeth to reduce all <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
arrogantly challenging unto himſelfe ſo great a place in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119120:37"/>
where there was a King of ſuch ſimplicity and puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. IN <hi>Abners</hi> perſwaſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to defection from <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> to
<hi>David,</hi> firſt, as we ſee the nature and practiſe of many am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
and crafty wicked men, who place their chiefe ſtanding
and promotion, in the diſquieting of other mens eſtates, and fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ever beſt in diſturbed waters, by the weakening and variance
of others, ſtrengthening and enriching themſelves. So againe, we
note the wonderfull working of God, in making that ſame man
who perſwaded <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to adhere to <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> now
from <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> to make defection, and adhere to <hi>David;</hi> and ſo
to undoe that, which he had formerly done, and turne his courſe
contrary: ſo powerfull is God in overruling the wicked, and
here his Children want comfort, or his work for them, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,
he will make their and his Enemies the workers. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
therefore in his Court ſhall bring up <hi>Moſes</hi> to be a deliverer
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Achab</hi> ſhall entertaine in his houſe an <hi>Obadiah,</hi> to
be a hider and feeder of the Lords Prophets. Out of <hi>Sauls</hi> bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els

                  <p>2. In that <hi>Abner</hi> ſheweth it was their former ſuit to have
<hi>David,</hi> we ſee what it is to have a juſt cauſe, even the Lord will
incline the hearts of men, whom we know not; and who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
adverſaries, to favour the ſame: as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did here <hi>Davids</hi>

when the waies of a man pleaſe the Lord, he will make

hearts of men in his hands, and turneth them which way he
pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>3. We note likewiſe in <hi>Abner,</hi> damnable hypocriſie, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Scripture ſerve his turne, and abuſing Gods Word to ſell
<hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> and buy <hi>David,</hi> which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>cauponari
verbum dei,</hi> and under a pretext of reverence to Gods ordinance
(which hitherto he had neglected) and of obedience to the
Lords appointment now concerning <hi>David,</hi> he will alleadge a
divine warrant out of malice againſt <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> ſeeking his ruine,
and his own promotion; this was the fault of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi>
ſo odious to <hi>Jacob;</hi> and the practiſe of Satan in the tempting of
Chriſt, and the followers of this diveliſh and deteſtable example
are they who cloake their particular affections and ambition
with Gods Word, and will make religion, to ſerve their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
in favour or ſeade, to deſtroy or preſerve; not conſidering
that as a heavy curſe abides on them who adde or impaire, ſo
likewiſe doth it on thoſe who throwe and abuſe the ſame; let ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Gods Word to be forced to ſerve man, yea worſe, to ſerve ſinne

                  <p>4. In the contracting of this amity with <hi>Abner,</hi> we find not
that <hi>David</hi> conſulted with God, as he had formerly done <hi>Chap.</hi>
2. therefore the ſucceſs of this, is not as the former, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of griefe, through <hi>Joabs</hi> fact, enſueth unto <hi>David.</hi> Whereby
we learne not to relye upon the arme of fleſh, or in purpoſes of
any importance to be unconſulted with God, who more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifeſteth now his will in his written Word, then ever he
did before by Prophet or viſion, ſo that we need not to goe
farre, but to the teſtimony, and to the word which is amongſt
the midſt of us, elſe look for no happy ſucceſs in the end. The
cauſe of all ſinne, and puniſhments for ſinne, is and hath ever
been the omiſſion of this duty, amongſt all ſorts and degrees of
men, when not making God their direction, they have fallen
in his correction, and deſpiſing his counſell, they were defrauded

with a wicked man, which ſociety of the Godly with the
wicked hath ever been diſpleaſing unto God, as in the alliance of

the poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Kain,</hi> which procured the deluge is

King of <hi>Egypt, Hezekiah's</hi> familiarity with the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
with ſundry others; and <hi>Davids</hi> league here with a treacherous
<hi>Abner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. In <hi>Abners</hi> pollicitation to <hi>David</hi> at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we ſee not only his arrogant ſelf-confidence (noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
but likewiſe that there is nothing more perillous, than to
put wicked men in places of great credit; therefore <hi>Achitophell
Davids</hi> counſellour, giveth counſell againſt him, and for <hi>Joabs</hi>
authority in the camp, <hi>David</hi> dare not execute Juſtice for the
blood of <hi>Abner.</hi> So <hi>Haman</hi> had almoſt brought <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> in a
fearfull guiltineſs of bloodſhed. And <hi>Rehoboam's</hi> wicked young
Counſellours made him looſe his kingdome. The <hi>Roman Senat</hi>
was likewiſe troubled by this meane. And the accident by <hi>Phocas,</hi>
Author of the Popes creation.</p>
                  <p>7. In like manner we ſee that the puſillanimity of a Prince
makes hardy Rebells, therefore <hi>Abner</hi> knew well enough that
<hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> who durſt not anſwer for timourouſneſs, his words of
proud threatning. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. doth farre leſs ſeek to repreſs his
deeds, of this his headſtrong practiſing. In a Prince then, the
foxes wit to rule wiſely, and Lyons heart to rule valiantly
ſhould ever dwell together, <hi>parcere ſubjectis, &amp; debellare ſuperbos;</hi>
politick carriage, and polemick courage being as two twinnes:
which like <hi>Gemini</hi> ſhould be in a Princes <hi>Zodiack.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. And in regard, as is probable, by wine and good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
his courage was the more ſtirred up, ſo to brag, and
preſumingly to ſpeak, having attained likewiſe to <hi>Davids</hi> favour
and high account, in being royally banqueted. Let us learne in
proſperity not to be inſolent, but look for alteration, as in the
examples of <hi>Haman, Balthaſſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> their banquetings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

is honourable in <hi>Judah,</hi> and hath the whole power of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Army, to whom he is joyned in neer conſanguinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſiſters ſon. The motives whereby he is impelled to
this murther are two, the one is a vindictive mind, moved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſlaughter of <hi>Aſahel</hi> his brother. The ſecond is envy;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119120:39"/>
which <hi>Joab</hi> conceiveth upon the ſuſpition of <hi>Abners</hi> friendſhip
and familiarity appearing with his Maſter <hi>David,</hi> to the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or outſtripping of him: ſo that private revenge and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for honours, are the cauſes impelling <hi>Joab</hi> to this Murther
of <hi>Abner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſecret cauſes, are covered with two cloakes, the one is
the zeal pretended to the preſervation of the Kings Perſon and
eſtate. The ſecond (when that colour is not ſufficient) is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
of a falſe amity, meaning by the former to evert <hi>Abner</hi>
by the Kings authority, and by the ſecond under diſſimulate
friendſhip aſſuring himſelf that <hi>Abner</hi> ſhall not eſcape either by
one ſnare, or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joabs</hi> ſpeech to perſuade <hi>David</hi> of the evill of <hi>Abner,</hi> is very
ſententious, taken from the ſuſpitious ingyne of <hi>Abner, ab ante
actis,</hi> and from the upright dealing of <hi>David,</hi> who meaſured every
one by his own foot and manners, and therefore might be eaſely
circumvented. And when <hi>David</hi> replyeth not, partly ſuſpecting
that <hi>Abner</hi> might be ſuch a one as <hi>Joab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> deſcribed him, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>Joab</hi> for other reſpects might calumniate; then <hi>Ioab</hi> goeth
to the ſecond work, which is his own ſubtility, and authority in
execution, and ſo under colour of his friendſhip, and the Princes
authority, he recalleth <hi>Abner</hi> back from the Well of <hi>Siriah.</hi>
Which <hi>Ierome</hi> reckoneth to be diſtant from <hi>Hebron</hi> the ſpace of
20. ſtades, where going aſide with him into the gate, which is the
publick part of the City where Juſtice was miniſtred, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
friendly conference, there he murthereth him, joyned (as
appeareth by the Text) with his Brother <hi>Abiſhai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ariſeth a doubt to be reſolved, whether did <hi>Ioab</hi> lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or unlawfully in the Murther of <hi>Abner?</hi> For the affirmative,
firſt the Law of God ſeemeth to make, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. <hi>Whoſoever he
was who after ſlaughter purged not himſelf, and abode not in the City
of refuge, might be ſlain by the neareſt kinſman,</hi> but <hi>Abner</hi> did not
ſo after the ſlaughter of <hi>Aſahel,</hi> therefore <hi>Ioab</hi> the Brother of the
defunct might lawfully have ſlain him. Secondly, the Law
Common, where in warres is permitted the ſlaughter of unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
Enemies, at leaſt, by the hand of the publick Commander,
as was <hi>Ioab.</hi> And thirdly, the will of God it ſhould be ſo, and the
good that followed thereon ſeemeth to approve the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:119120:40"/>
The negative in the contrary is eſtabliſhed, by theſe anſwers.
1. The priveledge of refuge was no appointed for him that ſhed
blood in publick denounced warres, and open contradictions,
but onely in private and accidentall manner. 2. Albeit warres,
had been ſometimes between <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> yet now they were
compoſed by the authority of the ſupream Magiſtrate <hi>David,</hi> and
<hi>Abner</hi> had received the Kings ſafe conduct, wherefore it was not
Lawfull for the Lieutenant, by the Laws of warres to attempt any
thing, which might prejudice the publick authority, or infringe
the faith which was plighted. And as to the will of God, albeit it be
true, that in reſpect of Gods will, <hi>Abner</hi> was juſtly puniſhed; yet
in reſpect of <hi>Ioabs</hi> perverſe will, oppoſite to Gods, and having its
own wicked end, <hi>Abner</hi> was unlawfully ſlain. And albeit good
came of evil, that was by Gods extraordinary providence, which
cometh rather in admiration than allowance, and the rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
is, the revealed will of God, and not his ſecret, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in reſpect that this fact militates againſt the revealed rule of
God Juſtice, and will, it is altogether to be condemned.</p>

is of Gods Children, not to backbite, and uncharitably to

actions, but to be carefull to abſtaine as well from the Murther
of the tongue, as of the hand it ſelf, knowing that the ſurviving

                  <p>4. <hi>Vers</hi> 26. Likewiſe, <hi>Ioab</hi> laboureth firſt to make his particular

This then is the nature of Atheiſts, and ungodly world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
firſt to colour their wicked pretences by the cloake of

5. In that he diviſeth one ſnare that aſſuredly ſhall intrap <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
(as is aforeſaid) if another fail, we ſee how plentifull and
ripe the wicked are in their impious inventions to accompliſh
their godleſſe purpoſes; and how diligent they are, and reſtleſſe
in their executions, that one way ſhall not ſooner miſgive, but
preſently they ſhall attempt another, that old experienced Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
being their crafty ſchoolmaſter, and they docile in his
Doctrine. Thus when bondage and burdens cannot waſte <hi>Iſrael,
Pharaoh</hi> can finde out a way by the Midwives to kill their male
Children, and when that ſucceeds not, cauſes his Souldiers to
drowne them in the River. So look to <hi>Herods</hi> wayes and plots
how to apprehend Chriſt, the Highprieſts and Scribes how to
inſnare him, and put him to death, and their Counſels. With the
practiſes of heathen Emperours, how hereafter to ſuppreſſe his
Goſpel, what nets were likewiſe ſpread by <hi>Saul</hi> to intrap <hi>David?</hi>
by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to get their adverſary <hi>Sampſon?</hi> and by <hi>Achab</hi>

are caught at laſt in their own ſnares, and are made faſt by the
fetters of their own deviſes; the true wiſdome of God in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
having the contrary ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Abner</hi> had <hi>Davids</hi> protection and ſafe conduct,
whereunto he truſted, but he wanted the Lords: and therefore
is murthered. Let men therefore labour to be reconciled with
God principally, and to have his powerfull protection to watch
every where over them, otherwiſe that of man ſhall be found in
vaine. Seek <hi>Abrahams</hi> buckler therefore, and unto <hi>Davids</hi> tower

7. <hi>Abner</hi> was a bloody man, and therefore dieth a bloody
death: ſo that blood cryeth for blood, though Magiſtrates draw
not the ſword, yet it is impoſſible that the gyants and centaures
of the world ſhall eſcape Gods puniſhments, howſoever they be
able to eſcape the ordinary corrections of men. Examples in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,
Adoni-bezek, Saul, Joab, Sinacherib, Achab, Antiochus,
Herod</hi> and ſundry others, that were puniſhed. Then let not
wicked men boaſt, in their favours, remiſſions and overſights,
which they have of worldly Princes, for without ſerious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to prevent Gods juſt judgments, the Lord hath <hi>Joabs,</hi> and
ſuch like inſtruments to raiſe up and correct when he beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                  <p>8. The time when <hi>Abner</hi> is ſlaine, is immediatly after his
reconcilement with <hi>David,</hi> and his coming from the royall ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
that was made unto him, even when he was aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of peace, then ſuddenly came his deſtruction. Thus are the
wicked in the midſt of their ſecurity puniſhed, and when they
leaſt look for it, cometh their viſitation. Examples, the primitive
world, <hi>Sodome, Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſmothering by <hi>Sampſon,
Eglons</hi> death. <hi>Balthaſſars</hi> overthrow and ſentence thereof, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
dejection. <hi>Siſera's</hi> humbling, the rich fooles departing,
<hi>Herods</hi> conſuming, and that glorious whore, ſpirituall <hi>Jeſabel,</hi>
her abaſing <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 8.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Joab</hi> killeth <hi>Abner,</hi> thus is one wicked man made to be
anothers ſcourge; Thus alſo are the <hi>Midianites</hi> made to kill one
another. <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> to riſe up firſt againſt Mount <hi>Seir</hi> or
the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> and then each one of deſtroy another in <hi>Mizpah,
Sinacheribs</hi> ſonnes to ſtab him in the Temple of his God <hi>Miſroch,
Iſhboſeths</hi> two ſervants to kill him on his bed. And where God
want ſcourges, he ſhall make the ſame not only to proceed out
of their own bowels, as is ſaid of <hi>Sinacherib;</hi> but ſhall make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to be ſo to themſelves, ſharp whips, and cruell burrean's;
as in the examples of <hi>Saul, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. In all this, we ſee <hi>Davids</hi> kingdome is not promoted by
<hi>Abners</hi> treaſon, as <hi>David</hi> ſo expected, but rather by the away
taking of <hi>Abner.</hi> Thus the Lord in the promotion of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
chooſeth not the inſtruments, nor alloweth ever the
meanes, which appeare good to men; but by the contrary he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119120:42"/>
taketh away the ſame inſtruments and meanes in whom men have
moſt confidence, and by others more unlikely without mens expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
he advanceth the cauſe of his Church, and worketh great
things. For God will not be ſubject to mens counſells, but will
have them to depend upon his wiſdome, that the whole glory of
executions of great cauſes may turne to his own praiſe. Examples
in <hi>Joſephs</hi> advancement, <hi>Iſraels</hi> delivery, <hi>Gideons</hi> victory, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah's</hi>

<hi>Davids</hi> ſolemne purgation of himſelfe from the guiltineſs of
that fact, made by many arguments. 1. By proteſtation. 2. By
imprecation. 3. By injoyning publick lamentation. 4. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of his funerall himſelfe. 5. By his own deploration. 6.

the revenge to God, ſeeing for the preſent he was too weake
to take it in hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he proteſts then according to the forme then uſed by
lifting up his hands, and purging himſelfe, by the witneſſing of
Heaven above and Earth beneath; that himſelfe, his Counſell
(which he calleth his kingdome) or eſtate, are innocent of this
murther, and all this is done by <hi>David</hi> to ſatisfie the people, who
might be in opinion that it was committed by <hi>David</hi> his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
ſeeing <hi>Joab</hi> was his officer and kinſman, and ſo might take
occaſion to make inſurrection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he maketh his imprecation upon <hi>Joab</hi> by five ſorts
of puniſhments. 1. The bloody iſſue which was a diſeaſe filthy
in it ſelfe, and bringing with it the extenuation and conſumption
of the body, as alſo ſuch were excluded from the conventions
and ſacraments in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. Is leproſie a horrible diſeaſe in all
the ſorts thereof, and for the contagious filthineſs thereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſuch to be ſecluded from the ſociety of men to live in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119120:43"/>
and in deſert places. 3. Are the palſie, gout, and ſuch
like, impeding and taking away the pleaſant part of mans life,
which conſiſteth in free motion and operations of the body, and
tying man in the tormenting fetters as it were of ſelf-captivity,
and which leaveth to men, not ſo much as bodies, but rather dead
and pained carcaſes. 4. Is that ſort which cutteth down the
unripe harveſt of life as it were, violently, by the cruell ſyth of
the murthering ſword. The laſt is famine which of all paines is
the greateſt, for eviting whereof ſome have put violent hands
on themſelves, and have become <hi>ſelf-Cannibals.</hi> And ſome more
than monſtrouſly have devoured their owne infants, yea their
owne very dung, and loathſome beaſts and vermine; as ſundry
hiſtories beare record, but eſpecially that of the lamentable
ſacking and ſtrait of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He makes next a ſolemne lamentation, both by himſelfe and by

thereof, by treaſonable Homicid, tending to ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
as ſcandall, and perill of inſurrection. He expreſſeth
all the ſignes likewiſe of true dolour, by teares of his eyes, rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his cloathes, lifting up his voyce, and burſting forth in words
teſtifying his affection.</p>
               <p>He carryeth him then by the royall dignity of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
to the grave, even the honourable ſepulcher at <hi>Hebron,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

populary favour, and he feared the example of <hi>Abners</hi> defection,
from <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> impatient of a very reproof. In end, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
with an Epiphonema, or exclamation imprecatory, the
Lord reward, or God ſhall reward the wicked according to his
wickedneſſe, which is to be underſtood of the impenitent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in equality, or proportion of meaſure, for God rewardeth
more, then the meaſure of good deſervings, and leſſe than that of
evill doth merit, neither yet, are good deſervings, the cauſe of
life, or the reward of glory, the ſame being a gift and a free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
as evill are properly the cauſes of eternall puniſhment,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth two queſtions. I. Did <hi>David</hi> charitably in
theſe imprecations? The Hebrewes anſwer, not. But uttering
them in wrath carnally, they fell ſeverally upon his poſterity, as
<hi>Rehoboam</hi> had the iſſue, <hi>Oſias</hi> the leproſie, <hi>Aſa</hi> the gout, <hi>Joſios</hi>
fell by the ſword, and <hi>Joachin</hi> by hunger, but ſeeing thoſe were
puniſhed ſo for their own private offences, we reject the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Others approve <hi>David</hi> herein, that he ſpeaketh here
prophetically; and that he pronounceth the words of the Law,
wherein ſuch curſings are contained, and ſome conclude in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
that imprecations may be lawfully conceived; if theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
be obſerved. Firſt, Gods ſpirit muſt be the mover, and
not the ſpirit of man: next, the forme muſt be conditionall, in
care of impenitency. And the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd muſt be, to Gods glory and not
our vindict. Then concerning this fact of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe his
mind is not knowne, therefore the reſolution muſt be conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and diſjunctive according to the ſaid rules.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion, was this omitting of <hi>Joabs</hi> execution
by <hi>David</hi> lawfull or not? Some anſwer it was, moved by theſe
arguments, 1. It was perillous at that time to execute <hi>Joab,</hi> in
reſpect of the foreſaid reaſon alleadged by <hi>David,</hi> and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
2. The Law of capitall executions aſtricts not to
a certain, or prefixed time. 3. Chriſts nature is to remit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119120:44"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> was a type, and we are commanded to remit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
unto God, as <hi>David</hi> in his laſt words here doth.</p>
               <p>Refutation, <hi>Ioab</hi> was ſtrong. 1. But <hi>Davids</hi> ſtanding depended
upon God who was ſtronger, and upon his infallible promiſe
confirmed by an oath, which no fleſh could diſanull, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
former deliverances out of farre greater perills evidently
doth teſtify 2. Is is true, executions ought not to be ſudden, and
may be, upon better cognition of the crime, and further triall of
others, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſervants in his Eccleſiaſticall Kingdome, but <hi>David</hi> had a politicke.
And the argument from the type to the ſubſtance doth not ever
follow, not yet from compariſons; and as for revenge it is indeed
to be referred to God, where no other redreſſe can be had, and
that by private Perſons; but not by publicke Magiſtrates, who
are his deputies on Earth. Again this fact of <hi>David</hi> is againſt the
office of a Magiſtrate, deſcribed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. <hi>and</hi> 21. And againſt

proteſtation, flowing. 1. From the teſtimony of
a good conſcience, which, unrequired maketh him to burſt forth
ſo, and lay open his innocency to all men. This teſtimony making
ever bold, and not to be a hamed, as we ſee in <hi>Iob ch.</hi> 31. 2. From
piety and deteſtation of the fact, this ever being the nature of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119120:44"/>
the godly not onely to eſchew wickedneſſe themſelves, but to hate
&amp; deteſt the ſame in others, ſo that ſinne both in action &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
dies to them, and they to it. 3. From wiſdome, leaſt the people
ſhould rebell, counting <hi>David</hi> cruell, diſſimulate and falſe, or
treacherous, therefore, he ſolemnly by many arguments and
evidences cleareth himſelf before them of any ſuch ſuſpition, or
that in any ſort by knowledge, deviſe, or practiſe, he is any way
guilty of the blood of <hi>Abner.</hi> An example of imitation to all
men but eſpecialy to ſuch as beare publicke offices, in Church,
or Commonwealth, that they be carefull and provident they fall
not in ſuſpiſion, or juſt ſlander of publicke offences like the
Sonnes of <hi>Eli.</hi> For how the ſame ſeverely hath been puniſhed,
not onely in the wicked, as in <hi>Saul, Achab</hi> and ſundry others,
but likewiſe in the deareſt elect, the example of <hi>Davids</hi> correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for his whoredome with <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> and the blood of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi>
moſt clearly doth teſtify.</p>
                  <p>2. It is, before the Lord for ever, that he atteſts here himſelf
and his Kingdome to be guiltleſſe. So that it is to <hi>Iehovah</hi> that
the godly have ever their chief reſpect. For he is the Judge of
the whole World to whom we ought to approve our ſelves, and
if not to him it matters not to whom elſe, this was <hi>Iobs</hi> comfort,
that concerning his innocency, his record was on high, and the
care of his approbation before God, was his reſtraint from evill,
therefore, doth not he behold my wayes (ſaith he) and tell all
my ſteps,<note place="margin">Job 31. 4. 23.</note> for Gods puniſhments were fearfull to me, and I could
not be delivered from his Highneſſe. Therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> nameth him,
the fear of his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 53.</note> and <hi>Abraham</hi> feared wrong in <hi>Gerar</hi>
for <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, onely becauſe the fear of God was not in

to aſſure them that he would deal uprightly with them,
then that which reſtrained him from whoredome with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Wife: For I fear God (ſaith he,) and no better aſſurance can
he give alſo of Brotherly dealing after his Fathers death, unto his
Brethren who feared juſt recompence of their doing to him, then
this,<note place="margin">Gen. 50. 19. Exod. 5. 2.</note> fear not, for am not I under God? And comptable unto him?
Where on the contrary, <hi>the fool hath, ſaid in his heart, there is no

that unpartiall and eternall Judge being now, and ever hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
the onely cauſe of the deſperate courſe and continuance
in ſinne, as if there were no God, no judgement, no reward.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Vers</hi> 29. In his imprecation, by laying over the blood, to
abide upon the head of <hi>Ioab,</hi> and on his Fathers houſe, we ſee
1. The nature of ſin, the act whereof is ſoon accompliſhed; but
the abiding guiltineſſe of the act not no ſoon tranſitory, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
upon the <hi>eaters of the ſowre grape, afterwards to ſet their
teeth on edge.</hi> Let the ſhort indurance of the pleaſure, and the
long extended guiltineſſe of the firſt trangreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eva,</hi> even unto their poſterity teſtify the ſame, together with
other examples, as of <hi>Kains</hi> bloodſhed crying for a curſe, <hi>Sodoms</hi>
luſt for fire, <hi>Pharoahs</hi> oppreſſion for plagues, with many more
ſuch like. And let us learn hereby not to be deluded therefore,
by the momentary pleaſure of ſwallowing the alluring bait, that
hath annexed with it ſo ſharp and permanent a hook of guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and deſtruction, but remember when the pleaſure is ſoon
gone, the never dying worm ſhall then begin to gnaw and the
record of the fact, enrolled in the book of our conſcience, &amp; Gods
regiſter ſhall recently abide in the guiltineſſe thereof upon us, unto
fearfull puniſhment, and inevitable judgement for ever.</p>
                  <p>4. Next, in that he wiſheth the guiltineſſe of this blood, not
onely to abide upon <hi>Joab,</hi> but upon his Fathers houſe alſo,
(both the Brethren as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30. being culpable thereof) we ſee the
propagation of the puniſhment, and fruit of ſin according to that
threatning of the Law; <hi>I will viſit the ſinnes of the Fathers upon
the Children unto the third and fourth generation of them, that hate,
me.</hi> Being thus as an evil blood, or ſpreading leproſy, a conſuming
mothe, and eating canker, making not onely the heart ſick, but
troubling the bowels, and the rod ſeaſing not onely on the back,
but alſo on the Loyns. Thus we ſee the ſinne of <hi>Amalek,
Exod.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> 17. 15. long after in their poſterity, called unto remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
before the Lord, and <hi>Saul</hi> commanded to go, and by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
pnniſhment to avenge the ſame.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 32.</note> So for the ſinne of <hi>Eli,</hi>
becauſe his Sons came in ſlander and he ſtayed them not, the Lord
pronounceth,<note place="margin">Judg. 8. 27.</note> that in all his houſe, or poſterity, there ſhould never
be an old man for ever. <hi>Gideons</hi> ephod likewiſe, after which <hi>Iſrael</hi>
went a whoring, was not onely his deſtruction, but of his houſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119120:45"/>
after him, and <hi>Salomons</hi> poligamy and Idolatry was puniſhed by
the rods of men in <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his Son and all his ſucceſſion. As on
the contrary,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 22. 15. Numb. 25. 13. See 1 King. 15. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord will ſhew mercy upon thouſands of them that
love him, &amp; keep his commandements.</hi> As in that promiſe concerning
<hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, and <hi>Phineas</hi> zeal evidently may be ſeen, O
happy gain therefore is godlineſſe, and bleſſed conqueſt is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
left unto poſterity which the Lord hath promiſed.</p>
                  <p>5. Amongſt the puniſhments that he wiſheth to befall unto
<hi>Joab,</hi> and his houſe he imprecateth blood twiſe, either that the
hand of God do it by a bloody iſſue: or that the hand of man
ſhed it, by the edge of the ſword. Where we ſee that like ſins crave
alike puniſhments frequently, as I have done, therefore ſo hath the
Lord rewarded me,<note place="margin">Iudg. 1. 7.</note> (ſaith <hi>Adonibezeh</hi>) thus the firy luſt of <hi>Sodom</hi>
was purged by fire, <hi>Kain</hi> feareth killing, becauſe he had killed,
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> males of his Land are deſtroyed becauſe he deſtroyed
<hi>Iſraels</hi> males, he ſhed their blood, and his waters are plagued with
blood, and as he drowned them, ſo is he and his hoſte drowned.
So <hi>Saul</hi> killed the Lords Prieſts with the ſword, and ſo is he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the ſame. And <hi>David</hi> as he had abuſed the bed of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi>
ſo is his bed abuſed by his Son <hi>Abſolom,</hi> even as <hi>Job,</hi> if he where
guilty, wiſheth the ſame retribution, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 9, 10. And our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
declareth, <hi>That with what meaſure, we meaſure to others,
with the ſame, it ſhall be meaſured to us again.</hi> See alſo <hi>Revel.</hi>
16. 6.</p>
                  <p>6. Theſe viſitations we ſee are imprecated and were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for ſinne, to learn us what fruit that bitter coloquintida
bringeth forth, and when any kind of temporall judgement, or
viſitation cometh, to acknowledge that it is our ſinnes that hath
procured the ſame. And therefore by true repentance (as the
neareſt way to have them taken away) to turne unto God that he
who hath wounded may make whole again. Not that all troubles
come for ſinne, ſome being trialls, onely for exerciſe, as theſe
which did befall unto holy <hi>Job,</hi> being both honourable, as not
inflicted for iniquity; and profitable as tending to the ſtirring up,
manifeſtation, and greater grouth and ſtrengthning of Gods graces
in the elect, to the glory of Gods mercy and confuſion of Satans
malice. And ſuch are ſeldome now adays, ſo few being ſuch as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Job,</hi> who may ſay, that their ſins hath not procured their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſment,
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

ſome again are diſhonourable as inflicted for ſin, but yet
profitable as tending to converſion like thoſe afflictions whereby
<hi>David</hi> was reduced home, and the poor prodigall. And ſuch are
all the ſanctified corrections of the Lords choſen. And laſt of all,
ſome are both diſhonourable; being for ſin, and improfitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they tend not to converſion, but rather finall everſion, ſuch
as <hi>Sodoms</hi> overthrow, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> drowning and the like. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
two ſorts being in love, God dealing with the elect either as
a goldſmith with the fine gold, or as a Father with the Child. But
this laſt, which is properly called a puniſhment, being in wrath,
as the Axe in the hand of the juſt Judge, or executioner to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the malefactor, and cut down the evil Tree.</p>
                  <p>7. In the method that <hi>David</hi> uſeth before that by theſe impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
he will ſhew his deteſtation of the fact; in that firſt he
purgeth himſelf to be altogether guiltleſſe of the ſame. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that it is the duty of a rebuker, or of one who would
ſeem to be a deteſter of any wickedneſſe in others; firſt to labour
to be free thereof himſelf, <hi>turpe enim doctori, cum culpa redarguit
ipſum.</hi> Thus <hi>Iudah</hi> ought to have been free himſelf of that fault
which ſo ſeverely he would have puniſhed in <hi>Tamar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 38. See 2 King. 9. 31.</note> and <hi>David</hi>
in pronouncing that ſentence againſt the man who took his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
one ſheep unto <hi>Nathan,</hi> ought to have been carefull, that he
had not been pointed at, himſelf to be the man. <hi>Thou therefore
that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteal, doeſt thou ſteal? thou that
fayeſt, a man ſhould not commit adultery, doeſt thou commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?
And thou that abhorreſt Idols, committeſt thou ſacriledges.</hi>
Rom. 2. 21.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Vers</hi> 31. <hi>David</hi> commandeth <hi>Ioab</hi> with the people, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize
a publicke lamentation for <hi>Abner,</hi> and by a cuſtome then
uſed to expreſſe their grief, which is injoyned to <hi>Ioab,</hi> either as
a part of puniſhment, that he is forced to lament him, whom in
his rage he had ſlain, and for the greater deteſtation of the fact, as
<hi>Moſes</hi> cauſed the people to drink of the water, whereupon the
pouder of their Calf was ſtrawed. or elſe hereby to bring <hi>Joab</hi>
to a deeper conſideration of his ſin; ſeeing the great lamentation,
that the whole people that were guiltleſſe thereof altogether
made for the ſame, and therefore much more ſhould he lament
grievouſly his fact, <hi>David</hi> then in requiring him with mourngin
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119120:47"/>
and tokens of repentance to celebrat this funerall, (wherein if he
diſſembled, the fault was his own) doth herein as Princes and
Magiſtrates ought and may do, in the outward exerciſes of Gods
worſhip and Religion, to compell their ſubjects to give their
bodily preſence,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 13.</note> as we may ſee in the examples of <hi>Aſa, Joſiah; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
and other godly Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> wherein if there be
Hypocriſy,<note place="margin">2 King. 23. 21. 2 Chron. 30. 1. Matth. 22.</note> the blame reſteth upon the diſſembled themſelves, and
their condemnation with that gueſt, that was compelled unto the
wedding, and wanted the wedding garment, abides them.</p>
                  <p>9. In <hi>Davids</hi> mourning for <hi>Abner,</hi> we ſee here the nature of
the godly, not rejoycing, but compaſſionating the evil of their
very Enemies, even as <hi>Iob</hi> proteſteth the like of himſelf, <hi>If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
at the deſtruction of him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 31. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>that hated me,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or was
moved to joy when evil came upon him, neither ſuffered I my mouth to
ſinne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>by wiſhing a curſe to his ſoul. And according as</hi> the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth;
<hi>Be not thou glad when thy Enemy falleth, and let not thy
heart rejoyce when he ſtumbleth.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> did likewiſe ſhew at
the death of his perfecutor <hi>Saul.</hi> And went about all the day
mourning when his Enemies were viſited, and this is the ſureſt
badge of a true Chriſtian, whoſe heart is ſo free from malice,
that they love their very adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>10. In that <hi>David</hi> doth all thoſe duties to a foe, giving him
the honour of buriall, and that in ſo famous a place, and in ſo
ſolemne a manner, as that he himſelf will follow the beer. We ſee
not onely the humility of the godly, wherein they imitate Chriſt,
dimitting themſelves in duties towards their very inferiours, but
alſo that their practiſe is uſually, to recompence evil with good,
according to that precept of our ſaviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. And as the
Lord by <hi>Salomon commandeth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>If he that hate thee be hungry, give him
bread to eat, and if he be thirſty give him water to drink, for ſo thou
ſhalt lay coales upon his head, and the Lord ſhall recompence thee;</hi>
This recompence gave <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his Brethren in feeding them and
their families in the Land of <hi>Goſhen. David</hi> unto <hi>Saul,</hi> and here
unto <hi>Abner</hi> not remembring his former injuries, and our ſaviour
in healing the ear of <hi>Malchus</hi> who came againſt him, and praying
for thoſe that cruelly did Crucicy him.</p>
                  <p>11. In all this behaviour of <hi>Davids,</hi> he ſheweth that no wayes
he alloweth this ſin of <hi>Ioab,</hi> though importing his quietneſſe (by

                  <p>12. <hi>Vers</hi> 34. In <hi>Davids</hi> regrating the treacherous form of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
death, and commending his courage, we ſee the very wicked
have their own good parts, and many excellent naturall gifts,
wherewith God hath indued them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their greater conviction,
when they abuſe the ſame, and whereunto otherwiſe is due their

                  <p>13. <hi>Vers</hi> 35. In the peoples coming to refreſh <hi>David</hi> with
meat, as we ſee the loving and tender care of ſubjects towards
their Princes, worthy of imitation, ſo in his anſwer again, and
proteſtation, we ſee what true faſting is, not an abſtaining (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit)
after a Popiſh and ridiculous form from groſſer, and
ſome more common ſorts of meat, or fleſh, and in the mean

as he wiſhed ſo were the people ſatisfied, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſurely
acknowledge that it did not proceed any way from the King, ſo
to kill <hi>Abner.</hi> Where we obſerve what happy iſſue the Lord giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

by theſe meanes, that <hi>David</hi> was altogether innocent,
and ſo the perill of inſurrection upon any contrary ſuſpition or

Let us labour then to have a good cauſe, and lawfully with

ought to relye, and him they ſhould feare who can caſt ſoul and
body into hell fire. Wherefore the overſight of Magiſtrates, their
reſpits, reprivings, and remiſſions for blood are like odious and
capitall crimes, which can have no allowance by this unlawfull
example, and that becauſe in the morall law of God, and judiciall

the full and finall decay of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi>

lawfully deſcended of <hi>Saul,</hi> who could be conteſters with <hi>David</hi>

were borne of concubinage, and therefore according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,

<hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> is impotent in mind and unworthy; murthered by his

of <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> interjected in the 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> The third is the juſtice
and piety of <hi>David,</hi> in revenging of <hi>Iſhboſeths</hi> death, and bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his head; till the 12 and laſt <hi>Verſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the decay of <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> we have three things to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
1. Is himſelf. 2, His murtherers. 3. His murther. As to
himſelfe or his eſtate: It is ſaid, that after he heard of the death
of <hi>Abner,</hi> his hands were feeble and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeeing the puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
of their head: and that their captaine <hi>Abner,</hi> by whom
they hoped to be reconciled to <hi>David</hi> was ſlaine, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
now expoſed to a greevous danger, knowing the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of <hi>David,</hi> they are likewiſe afraid.</p>
               <p>By the feeble hands of <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> according to the Hebrew
phraſe, is ſignified the diſcouragement both of his heart, and
externall members of his body: as we ſay of a man altogether
dejected, he hath neither heart nor hand: ſo that here, he is ſet
forth as a man deſtitute of all help, or comfort either from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
being ſo affected; or from his people, being ſo afraid: and
ſo this uſurper now is fallen in extreame, and irremediable miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The cauſes of this his deſperate dejectedneſs, being 1. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
his guilty conſcience fighting againſt himſelfe, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
the ſword of <hi>David,</hi> the ſtroakes whereof he likewiſe did
feare. And 2. the awaytaking of <hi>Abner,</hi> on whom he repoſed for
defence, and on the force of the Army, and therefore when that
faileth him, he falleth into deſperation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered in him: is, that being thus
deſperate of his matters, he giveth himſelfe to ſleep, and ſluggiſh
ſecurity: The cauſe of which ſleep at noontide, ſome aſſigne
to the cuſtome ſo uſed in thoſe hot countries, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Some to the extream heavyneſs of his deſperate mind, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his eyes likewiſe heavy to ſleep, like <hi>Jonas</hi> in the ſhip, or
the diſciples in the garden, and others attribute it to his ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
and negligent nature, againſt the duty of a good Prince who
ſhould be vigilant, <hi>domi &amp; foris,</hi> to adminiſter his kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and to prevent both private and publick perills, either of
his perſon or eſtate, which he here doth not, as we may ſee in the
hiſtory of his murther.</p>
               <p>His murtherers are deſcribed. 1. From their names: <hi>Baanah</hi>
which ſignifieth affliction: and <hi>Rechab,</hi> a rydar; thus affliction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119120:50"/>
him, and that ſpeedily as a poſt or ridar. 2. They are
called his men, and of one tribe with him, ſo neerly were they
joyned with him, in ſervice and kindred. 3. They are ſaid to have
beene Captaines of bands, which ſome underſtand to be, of
companies in the Camp, over which they were ſet by <hi>Abner;</hi> and
others (as the <hi>Rabbines</hi>) expone theſe bands to have been
ſuch, as were, when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and when (as
<hi>Debora</hi> ſaith) <hi>the high waies were not occupied, and the travellers
went through by paths, even robbers and common oppreſſors of men.</hi>
4. Their parentage is pointed at, they were the ſonnes of <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and of the Citie of <hi>Beroth,</hi> which then was uſurped by the
<hi>Philiſtines,</hi> ſince the battle of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> albeit within the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> according to the diviſion, <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> 18. 25. From
hence theſe fled at that time to <hi>Gittaim,</hi> another towne in the
ſame tribe, as <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> 11. 33. 5. The carriage in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is diſſimulate; for they faine themſelves to be of the moſt
peaceable ſort of men, even merchants, whereby they might ſo
be into the leſs ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>The fact of the murther is very odious in all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
1. The perſon murthered is a King, and a Kings ſonne. 2.
The murtherers are of his own ſubjects, of one tribe with him,
and his men. 3. The place and time, is, even in his own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and bed: and while he is a ſleep, in the noontide of the day.
4. The form is by treaſon, and cruelly by cutting off his head.
5. The cauſe (as may be ſeen in their journey and ſpeech to
<hi>David</hi>) is to gratify him, whom they perceived entring in the
whole kingdome, and ſo to work their own promotion; being
incouraged to this fact by <hi>Davids</hi> banqueting of <hi>Abner</hi> for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
<hi>Iſrael</hi> to make defection from <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> and thinking
that much more will the killing of his perſon be acceptable and
rewarded; as alſo, by the impunity of <hi>Joab</hi> for the death of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi>
and ſo concluding, that if <hi>David</hi> did overſee the ſlaughter
of <hi>Abner</hi> who was reconciled; and now <hi>Davids</hi> ſworne ſervant,
to bring all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to him: aſſuredly he will reward the ſlayers of
<hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> who ſtood out, and had the only claime of the whole
kingdome.</p>
               <p>In the fourth verſe is interjected the hiſtory of <hi>Mephiboſeth,</hi>
how that upon the newes of the diſcomfiture of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan;</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:119120:50"/>
his nurſe flying with him, when he was a child of five
yeares old, he did fall: and thereby became lame of his feet; and
ſo by that impediment was made unable for royall government:
chiefly in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe King was required to be without inability
either in body, or mind, ſeeing they were compaſſed about with
ſo many enemies to withſtand. This fall of <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to ſhew Gods ſpeciall providence therein; that ſo the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
might come to <hi>David</hi> according to the promiſe. Some
think that this hiſtory is rather interjected; to let us underſtand
the government of the eſtate of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> when <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
and feeble in mind: and <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> ſo feeble in body;
therefore no marvell, that ſuch wicked men banded, and roſe

                  <p>1. IN the feebleneſs of <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> we ſee how powerfull the daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a guilty conſcience is, when any triall, or trouble oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
the terrour of this inward and homebred tribunall, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the very foundations of all the faculties, and powers of the

one againſt another, as did the knees of <hi>Belſhazzar:</hi> ſo bitter things
doth this ſpirituall hand write in the regiſter of that book: which
fully at that laſt day ſhall be opened: and by which every one
ſhall be judged. That the very glanſe of one account, given by
a wakening trouble diſquieteth, and diſmayeth ſo, that the perſon
touched, is like that houſe fooliſhly built upon the ſand: which,
when a ſtorme cometh, cannot abide the ſame, but falleth. Where
the teſtimony of a good conſcience on the contrary, is both a
feaſt and a fortreſs. Examples of this daſhing power, when triall
or trouble cometh, we ſee in <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, in <hi>Achan, Saul,
Belſhazzar, Judas,</hi> and many more.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond leſſon is inſtruction likewiſe, for confirming
of faith in Gods infallible promiſes, and is taken from this ground,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119120:51"/>
                     <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> in an evill cauſe and courſe, relying only upon <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er,</hi>
and the people: ſo ſoon as <hi>Abner</hi> is ſlaine, and the people are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
he falleth into deſpaire, whereupon we gather. That as in all
cauſes, and eſpecially evill, the way to deſperation is to contemn
Gods protection, and relye altogether upon man's, and worldly
meanes. As we may ſee in the examples of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> when
<hi>Goliah</hi> is ſlaine, in <hi>Haman</hi> when he looſeth <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> favour,
and others; ſo in all good cauſes the only way to conſtancy and
comfort, is to depend upon the aſſured promiſes of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and favour, and to uſe and eſteem the ſecond ordinary means,
whereby God worketh in their own rank and place: otherwiſe
they ſhall prove but like the rotten reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which ſhall
break, and wound the hand of him, who hath leaned thereon:
of this diverſity <hi>David</hi> propheſieth in the 1. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> and examples
of them who have found comfort relying upon God, when the
ſeconds hath failed them. We have, in <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Joſeph,
Moſes, Iob, David, Daniel,</hi> Chriſts Apoſtles, and ſundry others in
Scripture.</p>
                  <p>3. In the time when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is commanded by <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
man, without courage, negligent and ſleeping in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
and hath <hi>Mephiboſeth,</hi> young, and unable in body to travell:
then the land is poſſeſt with violences and wicked men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we gather a doctrine for reformation of manners. That
when ſuch as are the ſupreame Magiſtrates, or ſubordinate, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and great Men in any land or ſtate, are either ſimple or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
either ſleeping and neglecting their offices, either young
in yeares, or lame in feet, ſparing their travells; it is then that
oppreſſion, murther and every ſort of vice defileth the land, and
inquieteth the eſtate both in private and publick: and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
is in Gods juſtice, who threatneth in his ire to give a
people for their ſinnes, children and women to raigne over them.
Therefore the exhortation is that where ſuch miſgovernment is,
and ſuch inconveniencies fall out: ſubjects ſhould not betake
themſelves ſo much to the miſliking &amp; invection againſt their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
much leſs in putting violent hands on them. As was done
to <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> as to be diſpleaſed with themſelves, and their ſinnes;
whereby they have provoked God in his juſtice, thus to puniſh
them, and ſeek their reformation, by teares and prayers from God
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119120:51"/>
in mercy, who hath the diſpoſition of the hearts of all ſuperiours,
to make them fierce Lyons, Foxes, and ſuch like beaſts in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
and meek lambs, and couragious rulers againe in his favour.
Of this we have the examples of the firſt <hi>Pharaoh, Cyrus, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
and the like: and of the contrary, <hi>Abimelech, Saul, Achab,
Joas, Herod. Julian,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>4. Through the impunity uſed towards <hi>Joab</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> theſe
wicked men are encouraged to murther <hi>Iſhboſeth.</hi> Where we ſee,
what are the dangerous fruits, which grow from impunity of
any vice, eſpecially of blood. This was the fault laid to <hi>Eli's</hi>
charge, that he ſuffered his Sonnes to runne into a ſlander, and
by correction he ſtayed them not, therefore the Lord threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that he ſhould do to him a thing, whereof whoſoever heard
it ſhould make his eares to tingle. This impunity made <hi>Joab</hi>
thereafter to kill <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and <hi>Abſolom</hi> his brother <hi>Amnon:</hi> ſo that
the overſight and winking at any vice, and tolerating of ſinne by
Magiſtrate, or Miniſter, is nothing elſe; but the encouraging of men
to go forward in the further practiſe thereof, whereof they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be guiltleſs, nor free from the blood of ſuch, who grant
ſuch impunity.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Abner</hi> is ſlain, the people make defection, and now at laſt
<hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> himſelf is likewiſe murthered. Thus like <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers,
when God hath bent his bow, and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

redouble upon the wicked, till they be conſumed: exampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the plagues on <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Land, &amp; at laſt his own ſubmiſſion.
Which teacheth us not to abuſe his long ſuffering patience, which
ſhould not imbolden us, or harden our hearts, and make us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in ſinne, but rather in feare to break off our ſinfull courſe, and
lead us to repentance; for otherwiſe aſſuredly he cometh, and
his reward is with him.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> is murthered, and that by two men of his own,
Captaines of bands: and of that ſame tribe and kindred with
himſelfe. Where we ſee not onely that Kings are priviledged
from the Lords puniſhments, when they offend more than others:

likewiſe how that he draweth Arrowes out of their own quiver

viſited in his great <hi>Babell. Belſhazzar</hi> made ſtupefact at his
royall table. And <hi>Herod</hi> ſtriken with the hand of God on his

but of the vallies hath every where a reaching hand, and where
can a man flie from his fearfull preſence?</p>
                  <p>8. The time when <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> is murthered, is while he is a
ſleep on his bed; where we have to obſerve not onely how the
wicked oftimes into their greateſt ſecurity are viſited: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
how carefull men ought to be, to implore the watchman of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> even the Lords protection at all times: but eſpecially in
the time of our ſleep to be ſtretched over us, without which what
perills may over take us. The examples of <hi>Iſhboſeth, Siſera,
Olofernes</hi> and others may delare; but having the ſame, we may
in a joyfull aſſurance ſay with <hi>David, I will lay down, and ſleep
in peace, for thou O Lord onely makeſt me to be in ſafety,</hi> Pſalm. 4. 8.
As likewiſe where a ſleepy and negligent King is, we ſee here
what perill is both to himſelf, and the ſtate. Royall adminiſtation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119120:52"/>
is the Lords work, and wo be unto him that doth the ſame neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently.</p>
                  <p>9. Theſe two, (like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi>) Brethren in evil, and
like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> or the two wicked elders, agreeing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in wickedneſſe do not onely ſhew the unity, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
conſpiracy of the ungodly to do evil: whereof the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 18. And that agreement of <hi>Herod</hi> and
<hi>Pilate,</hi> (though at variance before) to Crucify Chriſt doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy,
but in their diſguiſing of themſelves, we ſee the crafty and
masked dealing of ſuch in their pretenſes, who Proteus-like, as
their Maſter can transform himſelf into an Angel of light, when
he intends to bring into greateſt darkneſſe: ſo can the the wicked
cover themſelves in their moſt impious proceedings, with leaſt
ſuſpicious, and beſt be ſeeming ſhewes, like <hi>Jael</hi> giving the ſweeteſt

                  <p>10. The fall of the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> after this manner in himſelf
and in his poſterity, repreſents laſt of all unto us, the example of
Gods Juſtice againſt Tyrants, and perſecutours of his Church,
and Kingdome of Chriſt, agreeable unto that in the firſt <hi>Pſalme.
The wicked ſhall not ſtand amongſt the juſt, but as the wind bloweth
the chaffe, and duſt to and fro, ſo ſhall the wicked periſh and decay,</hi>

Enemies of the Church cut down by the ſiccle of juſtice, and caſt

               <head>II SAM. Chap. 4. from the 8. Verſe to the end.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond part of this Chapter, which beginneth at the 8.
<hi>Verſ.</hi> hath the honeſt part of <hi>David</hi> in condigne revenge of
<hi>Iſhboſeths</hi> Murther, wherein are three things. 1. The oration
of the Murtherers. 2. <hi>Davids</hi> reply. And 3. the puniſhment
of thoſe, and the honour exhibited unto the head of <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> in
burying the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for the Murtherers, they carry with them the Kings head,
and in great haſt they flie from <hi>Mahanaim</hi> beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> in
the Territory of <hi>Galaad,</hi> and paſſing the River, through all the
Territory of <hi>Benjamin</hi> journing by night, they come unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and their diligence, as an argument of their good
will to <hi>David,</hi> thus travelling by night to be the firſt repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Being come they have a ſhort accurate ſpeech, the end whereof
is to perſwade <hi>David</hi> of their well doing, and good intention in
that fact to his advancement, and the butt whereat they aime, is,
hereby to acquire ſome high place, and authority, with the new
King, or elſe to get a rich reward from him.</p>
               <p>The perſwaſions are from three places of <hi>Rhetorick à Jucundo,
honeſto &amp; utili.</hi> 1. The fact (ſay they) is pleaſant, becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we have brought unto thee the head of thine Enemy, who
ſought they life: and there is nothing more pleaſant to naturall
man, than the deſtruction of his capitall Enemy. 2. God hath
wrought this by our hands, and there is no purpoſe more honeſt,
then that which he hath ordained, and is an actor in the ſame. 3.
By this work thou art fully avenged on the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo that
there is none left of his ſeed (ſave an impotent boy) to quarrell
with thee now in the Kingdome, or ſeek after either thy life, or
honour, which is to thy great profit and commodity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> anſwereth and refuteth their ſpeech by two arguments,
the former he taketh from the true cauſe of his preſervation, and
replyeth in this manner. It is not by your deed that my life is
preſerved, or by the taking away of <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> that ſo I am freed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119120:53"/>
from trouble, or adverſity, and henceforth may live ſecure. But
it is by <hi>Jehova,</hi> who lives by whoſe favour I have been raiſed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and protected in all my wayes hitherto, upon whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
I depend, and not upon any indirect means to have my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
or eſtabliſhment wrought thereby, and this argument
is couched in words ſet down in form of an oath, or ſolemne
proteſtation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is taken from an example, or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
by way of compariſon of the leſſe with the greater, in this
manner; Ye ſuppoſe (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) to abuſe my lenity, becauſe I
ſpared <hi>Ioab</hi> in the Murther of <hi>Abner,</hi> but I referre you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the execution, which I uſed upon the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> who ſlew
<hi>Saul,</hi> and brought me the firſt news with the royall ornaments,
hoping thereby to get a reward, but I took and ſlew him: how
much more then are you worthy of death, and of a greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
in reſpect your fact is much more odious, conſidering
all the circumſtances thereof. That man was an <hi>Amalekite,</hi> but
you are <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yea and of the ſame tribe with <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> he ſlew
<hi>Saul</hi> at his own deſire, but you by a deviſed treaſon have ſlain
your Maſter unwittingly; he helped him being wounded, and to
accelerate his death, which was a benefit; but you murdered your
Lord ſleeping on his bed being in his health, he did the one in the
field, and perſuit of battle; but you the other in your Maſters bed-chamber,
and in time of no other perill. <hi>Saul</hi> alſo was an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> but <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> a juſt man, and a loving Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to you; therefore in all reſpects your fact being more odious,
your puniſhment muſt be proportionable, and the greater. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accordingly he commandeth his ſervants to make the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
(ſeeing the office of a publicke executioner was not then
in uſe.) And in greater deteſtation of the fact, and ſtriking ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the hearts of others to do the like, he addeth a form of
ſeverity in cutting off their hands, and feet, inſtruments of that
cruelty, and as a publicke ſpectacle for example to others he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the ſame up in a open place.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>David</hi> honoureth the head of <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi>
and burieth the ſame, wherein he confirmeth three notable leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
marked before. 1. That a Prince, or noble man ſhould
not take pleaſure, or allow any vice. 2. That nothing can
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119120:54"/>
be profitable which is not godly and honeſt. And 3. that no man
ſhould inſult, or rejoyce in the miſery, or deſtruction of his very
Enemy.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 8. THe nature of the wicked is, ever to meaſure others
by themſelves, and therefore becauſe to fleſh, and
blood it is a pleaſant thing to be avenged on their Enemies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe two Murtherers think that even ſo here it will be unto
<hi>David,</hi> and that they both actours, and firſt reporters thereof
cannot miſſe both thanks and reward: but they meaſure <hi>David</hi>
by the wrong line, and find him contrarywiſe diſpoſed, for as the
naturall man knoweth not the things which are of God; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the work of regeneration wrought in the Godly; whereby
they think, they ſpeak, they do and deſire farre otherwiſe then
the Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> and maſs of blind corruption. Witneſs the
contrary diſpoſitions of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> (though Brethren) and
in this place of theſe <hi>Beerothites</hi> and <hi>Davids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The audacious impiety of theſe wicked Murtherers may
be ſeen, in that they will in this their vile practiſe make God to be
a worker, and chiefe actour of the deed: like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring
their bloody fact, with the vaile of Religion, and imbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divine mercy it ſelfe, in participation with Diveliſh cruelty.
The moſt odious ſin of any is to cover the Divell with Gods gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and taint the ſacred Majeſty of holineſs it ſelfe, with the
menſtruous pollution of monſtrous crimes. And too commonly
uſed now adaies, when rebellion againſt Lawfull authority, odious
treaſon, mercileſs maſſacres, and ſuch like are now obtruded for
conſcience ſake, and go currant under pretext of Religion, <hi>Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>
Doctrine teaching their emiſſaries and paricides that they
do merite thereby.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. In <hi>Davids</hi> words of proteſtation, We ſee that it is
the godlies lot to be in adverſity, and under the croſs, as his whole
life hitherto could have taught: (omitting other examples) but
there is their comfort, which with a thankfull acknowledgment
with this godly Prince here, the godly ought ever to record,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119120:54"/>
as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of his redeemer, ſo, the Lord liveth, who delivereth
their ſouls out of all adverſity, and though their troubles be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet he upholdeth them in them,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 23.</note> and from them in his good
time giveth them freedome, with Victory: like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who though
the archers grieved him, and ſhot at him, and hated him, yet his
bow abode ſtrong, and the hands of his armes were ſtrengthned,
by the hand of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Vers</hi> 12. In <hi>Davids</hi> adjudging them to puniſhment farre
contrary to their expectation; we ſee how being blinded by Satan,
they are greatly diſappointed of that they looked for: even as our
firſt parents being deceived by that crafty Serpent thinking to be
like God, became to be like the Divell, let none therefore look
for happy fruit of the forbidden Tree, nor think by doing evill
that good ſhall come of it, which ſerveth greatly to correct thoſe,
who by malefices and wickedneſſe pretend to attain to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Princes and great men. Let <hi>Balams</hi> blood, <hi>Doegs</hi> infamy,
<hi>Achitophels</hi> deſpare, <hi>Hamans</hi> hanging, and theſe mens execution,
bear witneſſe of the iſſue.</p>
                  <p>5. We have likewiſe here in <hi>David</hi> the patterne of a good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and upright juſtitiar, who hath an eye, not to his own
commodity in this ungodly fact, but to juſt judgement, and to
that which ought to be done according to the Law: ſhall I not
therefore (ſaith he) require his blood at your hand, and take you
from the Earth, not as uſually now it is, <hi>quo volunt reges, vadunt
leges, &amp; plus valet favor in judice, quam lex in codice.</hi> Farre
contrary to good <hi>Jehoſaphaths</hi> admonition to the Judges of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. <hi>Take heed what yee do, and let the feare of the
Lord be upon you, for yee execute not the judgements of man, but of the
Lord, and he will be with you in the cauſe and judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. In practices we may perceive what is to be followed. There
are two here in this matter of blood: the one is of <hi>David</hi> ſparing
of <hi>Ioab:</hi> the other is of his juſtice towards the <hi>Amalekite.</hi> Theſe
criminals though they preſume on pardon by the one, yet <hi>David</hi>
followeth the other; hid reaſon is, the one agreed with God, and
a good Law, the other diſagreed. Whereupon we obſerve in uſe
of practices what ſhould be followed, and what ſhould be
eſchewed by Magiſtrates, decrees given according to equity,
good Law, and conſcience ſhould onely, &amp; ever be followed, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119120:55"/>
the contrary rejected. Let Judges then beware, what decrees
they give out, that they prejudge not the courſe of upright ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
but if they do, let them not be aſhamed to retrait the ſame,
and follow the beſt practice.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>David</hi> joyneth that form of ſeverity, by cutting of their
hands and feet, and hanging of them up, for the terrour of
others: where we ſee what ſhould be the end of puniſhment aimed
at by the Magiſtrate, even to prevent offences amongſt the people:
and like a skillfull Phiſitian making the <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> of one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
a preſervative to the whole body, as they do in fevers,
plewriſies, and the like.</p>
                  <p>8. We ſee how the Lord maketh a requitall to be given to the
wicked, theſe men cruelly had deformed the dead body of their
Maſter by cutting off his head; and now juſtly are their bodies
deformed by the cutting off their hands and feet. This we ſee
in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as he killed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> firſt borne males, ſo are the
firſt borne of all his land: as he drowned their infants, ſo is he
and his Army. And this retribution, <hi>lege talionis,</hi> did <hi>Adonibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek</hi>
acknowledge juſtly to have been inflicted upon him, when the
thumbs of his hands, and his feet were cut off, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 7. Let men
beware then how they ſinne, or cruelly behave themſelves, and
think that there is a juſt God who will both require and requite,
this <hi>Job</hi> wiſheth of himſelfe, <hi>Job.</hi> 31. 9, 10. And this Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
confirmeth, <hi>For with what meaſure yee meete, it ſhall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
to you againe,</hi> Math. 7. 2. and this alſo we ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 6.</p>

of every tribe, who had the authority and place of the primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture.</p>
               <p>The Perſon to who in all theſe do come, is deſpiſed <hi>David</hi> in
time paſt, and now by Gods inſtinct, univerſally honoured, for
as God hath the hearts of ſuperiour Perſons at his diſpoſition, ſo
hath he the hearts of ſubjects, and inferiours to bow and bend
them at his godly pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The circumſtance of the occaſion, is of worthy conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> probably affirm: in the firſt place,
they confeſſe their errour, they purge themſelves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
their former diſobedience, craving pardon, and promiſing
loyalty in the time coming. In the next, they have an oration to
<hi>David,</hi> the end whereof is to perſuade him to accept the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Kingdome upon him, which they do voluntarily offer.
The places of perſuaſion are very proper, and in number three,
drawn out of the Law, containing the qualities of a King in
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> 1. We are thy bone and thy fleſh, by which phraſe
of ſpeech, the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſignified their conjunction in conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity,
<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 2. 29. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. This is grounded upon the
Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. The ſecond is taken from experience of
<hi>Davids</hi> qualities in that office, and ability to govern proved out
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119120:56"/>
of 1 <hi>Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 18. The third is from Gods choice and direction, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
likewiſe unto the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 5. That the people ſhould
make him their King, whom God ſhould appoint. This ſpeech
of theirs, no doubt was uttered by <hi>Samuel</hi> unto <hi>David</hi> in Gods
name: ſaying, <hi>thou ſhalt feed my people,</hi> when he anointed him,
and the word went with the ſeale, albeit though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
yet is repeated by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 78. 71.</p>
               <p>The ſolemnity of his inauguration was by the conſent of the
elders and people there, repreſenting the whole number and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Kingdome: a bond is mutually ſworne, wherein <hi>David</hi>
obligeth himſelfe to reigne over them as God commandeth, and
as he proteſteth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 101. And the people promiſe to obey his
lawfull commandments, ſo that the Law of God no doubt, was
the rule and ſquare of his government, whereunto both Prince,
and people are ſworne: which was a bridle againſt his abſolute
power, or their rebellious manners.</p>
               <p>He was anointed according to the received forme, and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the aſperſion of the ſacred oyle of the Tabernacle, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and conſerved for that uſe, by the hand of the high prieſt,
and that before <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is diverſly interpreted. Some
by mediation of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim:</hi> ſome by oblation of
ſacrifice upon the Alter in <hi>Hebron</hi> builded of old by <hi>Abraham.</hi>
Howſoever, they ſolemnly as in Gods preſence mutually atteſted
God, and required him to be witneſs to their covenant: Thus
<hi>David</hi> is thrice anointed: at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> by <hi>Samuell,</hi> in <hi>Hebron</hi> by
<hi>Judah;</hi> and now over all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this publick aſſembly, being
herein a vive type of Chriſt Jeſus, who is perfectly, and in full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Spirit: anointed King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as it were by a threefold unction.</p>
               <p>In the end it is ſaid in the Chronologie of his reign, that he was
30. yeares when he began to reigne in <hi>Hebron:</hi> (being of that
ſame age that our Saviour was of, when he took upon him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
his calling) which was a convenient age for Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
where otherwiſe God threateneth to give women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to reigne in his ire.</p>
               <p>But here ariſeth a doubt upon the Chronologie of <hi>Davids</hi>
reigne, in the generall it is ſaid that he reigned 40. yeares, and in
the particular it is reckoned that he reigned 7. yeares and 6.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119120:57"/>
moneths in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and 33. yeares in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is of the 6. excreſſing, or odde moneths: to which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is, omitting other conjectures, that this is ſpoken after a
cuſtomable forme of Scripture, by a figure called Synecdoche:
where the greater number is put to comprehend the leſs; the like
being, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 46. and elſe where.</p>

                  <p>1. THe promiſe which God made to <hi>David</hi> of the kingdome is
ſlowly, and after great adverſities now performed: where,

owne daies is commonly found in the experience of the eſtate of
many good men and Princes.</p>
                  <p>2. In the example of <hi>David</hi> patiently abiding the Lords lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and in adverſity neither doubting, nor grudging, neither
uſing any unlawfull means; we have the generall rule of the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that the Godly ſhould learne when they find themſelves in
the like condition, in good cauſes which God hath promiſed to
bleſs, and in following of the ſame; albeit the promiſe be ſlowly
performed, and the middes be troubleſome: let them not think
that God hath not a care over them, neither grudg, as do impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
men, neither doubt as do the weak in faith, neither uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
ſeconds as do the worldlings, neither deſpaire as do the
reprobate: but following the examples of <hi>David, Abraham, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Joſhua, Daniel,</hi> the Apoſtles, and ſuch: aſſure themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the concluſion of Chriſt, <hi>that heaven and earth ſhall periſh, but
one jot of Gods promiſe ſhall not alter:</hi> and remember what <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 39. <hi>That nothing whatſoever is able to ſeparate Gods
choſen Children from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> and
that all things in the end ſhall work together for their good who
love him.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. The whole people are moved by Gods inſtinction
to offer their voluntary obedience to <hi>David,</hi> and albeit they had
the word amongſt them, yet it was not followed, becauſe they
wanted the inward perſwader, till now, who is the holy Ghoſt:
ſo that the kingdome of <hi>David</hi> riſeth not by violence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
but by the inward perſwaſion of the holy Spirit: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we inferre in the generall literally, and then miſtically: that
the hearts of ſubjects to temporall princes are in the Lords
hands to harden, or mollifie them: as he thinketh expedient, to
ſhew in them his favour, or his wrath to their ſuperiours: and
therefore if they will have obedience of their ſubjects, let them
ſubject their ſcepters to the obedience of God; for he will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
them, that honourt him: and they that deſpiſe him ſhall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119120:58"/>
be deſpiſed: and therefore as the tiranny of theſe in authority is
Gods puniſhment for the ſinnes of inferiours, ſo the rebellion of
inferiours is a token of Gods ire againſt their Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>4. As this is true in <hi>Davids</hi> temporall, ſo it is true in Chriſts
ſpirituall kingdome: for it is not the externall hearing that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the heart: albeit that thereby the incredulous be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable:
but it is the inward operation of the Holy Ghoſt
which inwardly perſwadeth, and draweth the heart as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
doth the iron, to the obedience of the Lords Word, and
ſo erecteth the kingdome of Chriſt into the ſoule of man. No
marvell then, that the greateſt part of the world remaine in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and wickedneſs: albeit Gods Word plentifully ſounds in
their eares: becauſe as a ſound only, there it evaniſheth. And
<hi>as a feeling power deſcendeth not in the heart to take root downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and bring forth fruit upwards,</hi> as Chriſt therefore ſpoke
of his body, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 63. So, it is the ſpirit which quickneth the
Word, without the ſame, profiteth nothing.</p>
                  <p>5. In this occaſion, and election, or inauguration of <hi>David,</hi>
we inferre the generall rule of electing of Magiſtrates, as well in
regard of his qualities and forme of election: as of the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is to be elected. As for his qualities. 1. He muſt not be
a ſtranger in birth, much leſs in religion: but muſt be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
naturall and ſpirituall, with them whom he governeth;
otherwiſe there can be no ſympathy nor ſymbolizing between
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem. 2. He muſt be able to governe: which is called here, to
leade out and in. Next, the forme of his election ſhould be by
common and voluntary conſent, according to the conſtitution
of the ſtate and oath or obligation of right adminiſtration; the
rule whereof ſhould be the Law of God, and poſitive conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the realme. And laſt the end ſhould be to feed the people,
caring that they be ſpiritually fed in the food of life: and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
that they be not ſpoiled or bereft of their meanes of the
life corporall, to be their guider, protector, father, patron, and
to have a regard to all their neceſſities as the good paſtour hath
to his ſheep, and the Father to his family.</p>
                  <p>6. By all this hiſtory it is evident that he is rather compelled
and urged by the people to reigne over them, then they are ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by him to give unto him the government, for he ſaw that it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119120:58"/>
was not ſo much <hi>honos</hi> as <hi>onus,</hi> teaching hereby all thoſe who are
to undertake any function in Church or Commonwealth, not to
runne before they be ſent; nor to thruſt themſelves in at the
window, till they be lawfully let in at the doore: and as they
have the inward, and effective calling of God fiting them for the
work; ſo to expect the outward and declarative calling of man
ſuiting them to the work. The Lord will therefore give wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and skill to <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt call
them.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. The covenant of mutuall obſervance of duty,
which they make, it is before the Lord, who did heare not only
the words of their league: but did ſee the ſincerity of their hearts
therein; and whom they acknowledged not only as a ſolemne
witneſs to beare record, but as a juſt judge, and ſevere reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the breach. So before this ſame Lord, we ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that both we, and our ſecreteſt actions, yea the very thoughts
of our hearts are patent: and as in his preſence, (whoſe al-ſeeing
eye beholdeth all things) watchfully we ought to walk, fearing
to ſpeak or do, either wickedly or hypocritically, ſeeing as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi>
ſaid to <hi>Gehezi,</hi> his heart goeth ever with us, and he will
make no other, but our own wickedneſs to find us out.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. In the Chronology of <hi>Davids</hi> life, and reigne,
as we ſee that the people get a great benefit from God, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Prince given them of ripe age, experience, and ability to
governe, being 30 yeare old when he began to reigne: (where
women, and Children are given in Gods wrath) ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part we ſee alſo, that long life and a proſperous government
in a Princes perſon is a great bleſſing likewiſe: and old age (as
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) is a Crowne of Glory, when it is found in the
way of righteouſneſs, therefore <hi>honour thy Father and Mother</hi>
(ſaith the Lord) <hi>that thy daies may be long in the Land which the
Lord thy God hath given thee:</hi> the long life is a reward, and the
contrary, as a puniſhment is denounced againſt the houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi>

by the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> Idolators, enemies to God, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;

Citie he purpoſeth to reforme, and make it the Citie of the Lord,
and the Kings ſeat: being in reſpect of the ſituation thereof moſt
proper for that effect; (nobilitated by the habitation ſometime of
<hi>Melchizedek</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> ſituated in the marches between <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>

ſet upon their walls as monuments of the league between theſe
two, and <hi>Abimelech.</hi> Without violating whereof <hi>David</hi> could
not invade them; this aſſertion being altogether differing from
the truth of the ſtory, for <hi>Abimelech</hi> was King of the <hi>Philiſtines:</hi>
who was deſcended of <hi>Miſcam Cains</hi> ſonne progenitor of the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> and not of the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> who were of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſonne
to <hi>Cham</hi> progenitor of the <hi>Cananites.</hi> Some affirme that they
were the images of their tutelar gods, which <hi>David</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

this to be ſpoken from the confidence which they had in the

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119120:59"/>
inexpugnable though it had no other defenders but blind and
lame, and ſo this to be a hyperbolik ſpeech. Others (as <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi>)
following the letter of the text, think that they ſet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
blind and ſome lame men on their wall's to deride <hi>David</hi> in

               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> being thus deluded, or rather derided, he prudently

mount <hi>Sion</hi> comes into <hi>Davids</hi> hand; and being in his poſſeſſion,

furniture of timber for building his houſe, as alſo maſons and
Carpenters, we find the like affection of this King (or elſe his ſonne
of the ſame name) in the dayes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> for the edifice of the
temple. This City was firſt founded by the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> who being
expelled from a City, <hi>Sidonia,</hi> which they firſt inhabited by the
King of <hi>Askelon,</hi> taking the Sea, they landed in an Iſland where
they founded this City <hi>Tyrus</hi> out of which there came many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies

<hi>Sion,</hi> whereof <hi>David</hi> ſtood in need in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where we ſee 1. That
God in his wiſe diſpenſation hath not given all things to every
Land, or Perſon, but as the Apoſtles ſhew by the fabrike of the
body, there is a diverſity of diſpenſation that none may contemne
another, but keep a ſeemly and neceſſary unity and coreſpondence
together. 2. Whereupon followes the right rule of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is, each land and Perſon ſhould communicate with
others in the benefits of God the giver; that he may behonoured,
and Gods people mutually may be conforted and mutuall charity

memory ſhall be fleſh and fragrant to all ages, like ointment pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

many Wives and Coucubines, which did proceed from wordly
wit, &amp; which he chooſes as a fit means to confirm his Kingdome,
and ſetle it in his poſterity, and yet this diſagreed from Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

                  <p>The obſervatirn which we remarke on this, is, 1. How ready

entertained peace with him, being now grown ſo potent,
but by the ſecret counſell of God they are drawn to their own

                  <p>This warre is ſet forth from all the circumſtances, as, time,
place, perſons, occaſion, form of proceeding, battles, events and
finall end.</p>
                  <p>1. The time is when <hi>David</hi> looks for greateſt quietneſſe.
2. The place is the valley of <hi>Rephaim</hi> which is a fruitfull part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

                     </gap>uiring of the Lord, and the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi>
confiding in their multitude and idols, which ſhewes
that the godly in all their troubles, or enterpriſes conſult with
God and his mouth, and rely upon him, whereas Idolaters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in their Idols, and have their recourſe to creatures, and rely
on the arme of fleſh, as in 88. the Spaniſh did in their invincible
Armado.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Davids</hi> faith and obedience is ſeen herein that as God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects,
ſo he obeyes, not fearing the greatneſſe of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi>
hoſt, and on the Lords word he builds his confidence, as we
ſhould in like manner ours.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Vers</hi> 20. Though <hi>David</hi> ſmote them, yet he aſcribes all the
victory only to God, ſaying, <hi>The Lord hath broken out upon my
Enemies, as a breach of waters,</hi> ſuch is the humility of the Godly
looking ever up to the Lords hand, &amp; giving him the glory of all.</p>
                  <p>6. The calling of the place <hi>Baal perazim,</hi> or <hi>the breach of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

in freſh memory the mercies, and deliverances that hee gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>7. Alſo we ſee as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, though many be the
troubles of the godly, yet the Lord delivers them out of them all.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Vers</hi> 21. Whereas there they left their images and <hi>David</hi>
and his men burnt them, we ſee 1. the vanity of idols that can
not help in the day of diſtreſſe, as in 88. and 2. We ſee what ſhould
be done with idols, as the Lord hath commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
                  <p>9. Whereas <hi>Vers</hi> 22. the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> yet again came up againſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>David,</hi> we ſee 1. the reſtles and irreconciliable malice of the
wicked, driven on by Satan, which they have againſt God and his
Church. 2. how blind they are, in not ſeeing by their former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that the hand of God was againſt them and made a
breach upon them. 3. We ſee that Satan leades men in wicked
courſes to their own deſtruction in the end.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Vers</hi> 23. <hi>David</hi> will do nothing without direction from
God, and conſulting with him, this being the onely ſure way to
proſper, which wee alſo ſhould follow, and therefore the Lord
readily anſwers, and directs him of new what he ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Vers</hi> 24. The Lord not onely directs what <hi>David</hi> ſhould
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119120:63"/>
do, which he obeyes, but it is ſaid, that the Lord ſhould go out
before him to ſmite the hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> which is a great
comfort to the godly who follow Gods direction, that his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
preſence, as their generall, marches before them to proſper
them, and overcome their Enemies, as it is, or may be a terrour
to their Enemies, <hi>Joſua.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>12. God fights for <hi>David</hi> both by ordinary, and alſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
means, as the ſhaking of the tops of the mulberry Trees,
whence we gather how impoſſible it is for man to fight againſt
God, and his Church, ſeeing he is the Lord of hoſtes, who hath
ſo many armies, and by the moſt contemptible of his creatures
is able to overthrow the moſt mighty: as we ſee in the plagues of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> the Rams hornes, their ſound againſt <hi>Jericho, Gideons</hi>
pitchers, <hi>Herods</hi> lice, and here a ſhaking of the tops of Trees. A

where we ſee by way of Sacramentall ſpeeches, the ſigne
getting the name of the thing ſignified, as circumciſion is called
the covenant, and the Lamb the Paſſover, as likewiſe Baptiſme
the Laver of regeneration, and the bread in the Lords Supper

               <p>Now the firſt beginning of this Religious work in reforming
Religion and ſetling his Arke in <hi>Sion,</hi> who had ſetled him in his
Kingdome, he takes it from a publicke aſſembly of 30000. of the
choſen men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with whom he deliberates, and whom for
the better and more ſolemne performance he aſſociates, like a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as well as a pious Prince. But in the performance and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119120:64"/>
bringing of the Arke from its place where it was, the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God is not remembred, which was that the <hi>Levits</hi> ſhould
carry it on their ſhoulders, but they imitate the example of
the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>Who ſent it back on a cart drawn by beaſts,</hi>
which ſeems to be the fault of the <hi>Levi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

too much herein to their own eaſe. And <hi>David</hi> and all who were
with him, expreſt great Spirituall joy in the performance of this
Religious enterpriſe, but becauſe, though it was <hi>bonum,</hi> yet not
<hi>bene</hi> performed, therefore their joy is turned quickly into matter
of grief, and mourning, by the ſudden death of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> without
warrant for taking hold of the Arke, when it ſeemed to ſtumble
and fall, being ſhaken by the oxen that bore it, which as it
greeved <hi>David,</hi> ſo it greatly feared him to bring the Arke at that
time any further to his own houſe at <hi>Sion,</hi> and therefore carried it
aſide to the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> where it remained three
moneths, during which time <hi>David</hi> hearing that the Lord had
bleſſed the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> his fear thereby being removed,
he was encouraged to attempt of new the perfecting of what he
formerly intended, and to bring from thence the Arke to his
own houſe in <hi>Sion,</hi> which accordingly he performed with all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olemnity and expreſſions of joy and gladneſſe, and offering

                  <p>1. <hi>DAvid</hi> now being eſtabliſhed in his Kingdome &amp; enjoying
peace, he applies his minde to the eſtabliſhment of the
Lords Arke, and promoteing of his worſhip, a worthy pattern to
all Princes and Magiſtrates of imitation, which whoſoever have
followed, have proſpered, as on the contrary who have done
otherwiſe, they have been juſtly puniſhed. For who honours
God, them he will honour, and who diſpiſes him ſhall be diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>2. Hence we ſee the errour of ſuch who think, that the care and
reformation of Religion belongs not to Magiſtrates, or laiks, as
they call them, Princes being <hi>cuſtodes utriuſque tabulae,</hi> and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119120:64"/>
this having been ever the practiſe of the Godly Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
who as their power was from God, ſo they exerciſed it for God,
as the Godly Emperors did ſo in like manner.</p>
                  <p>3. This purpoſe of his touching the Ark and religion, he
puts to execution, by convocating the chiefe men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
eſtate, conſulting and concluding with them, that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent and concurrance, the ſame may be the better and
more ſolemnly done, every one aſſiſting according to his calling:
but eſpecially the chiefe part of this action belonging to the
<hi>Levites,</hi> where we have the example of a prudent King and of a
<hi>Godly Councell</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi> As we ſee was followed after by
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Nice, Theodoſius</hi> in <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> In
that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and in thoſe religious
Princes <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. We ſee that the Ark, which was a ſigne and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole
of Gods preſence, is called by the name of God himſelfe
(the Lord of hoſtes, which may ſerve to the comfort of his
own, and terrour of his enemies:) as in ſacramentall ſpeeches
the name of the thing ſignified is given to the ſigne (as has been
ſaid) ſo that it is a wrong and vaine reaſoning of the Papiſts to
argue from theſe words, <hi>this is my body:</hi> that therefore the bread
is turned in the ſubſtance of Chriſts body.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. The manner of carrying the Ark is by Oxen on
new cart: wherein we ſee two errours of the <hi>Levites.</hi> 1. They
leave the Word and ordinance of God, which commanded that
it ſhould be carried upon the <hi>Levites</hi> ſhoulders. And 2. They
follow the example of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> their ſending back the Ark
upon a new cart drawn by beaſts: which they do partly for cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and partly for their own eaſe. Where 1. we may ſee what
is the rule in reformation or ſetting up of religion, that it ſhould
not be by warrantable example or practiſe of others, but by the
direction and warrant of Gods Word. 2. We may ſee what is
the bane and ruine of religion, when men give themſelves to eaſe,
and the burthen of the Miniſtry is committed to laſie ignorant
and unworthy beaſts.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. The Ark is conveyed with muſick of ſundry ſorts
and great rejoycing, which ſhewes. 1. That the proſpering of
religion, and advancement of all lawfull courſes, for the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119120:65"/>
and eſtabliſhing thereof, ſhould be the matter of our greateſt
rejoycing. And 2. That muſick, and the art thereof is lawfull
in the Church of God for praiſing of the Lord in Pſalmes, and
Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>David</hi> is ſpecially and firſt here named, as ringleader in
this holy exerciſe: which ſhewes the duty of all Godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and others in Prime place, to go before Gods people in
a good and Godly example of piety and religious exerciſes: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as is ſaid, <hi>regis ad exemplum, &amp;c.</hi> And not to be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. In the midſt of this joy intervenes a ſad and
tragicall accident, which obſtructs the ſame, by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza'hs</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
laying hold on the Ark, when it was ſhaken by the
Oxen that bare it, and his being ſuddenly ſtriken dead for his
errour by the Ark of God. Where we ſee. 1. How ſoon may
our rejoycing, or joy in this life be changed into matter of
griefe, and mourning, ſuch is the viciſſitude whereunto we are here
ſubject unto, till we come to that fulneſs of joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.
Which we ſhall only without interruption enjoy in the heavens.
2. We ſee that <hi>

                     </gap>nd puniſhment. Neither will the good pretended intentions of
my in the manner of Gods worſhip, or other unwarrantable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
be an excuſe unto them, or free them from guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:
as we ſee in the example of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abthu,</hi> and all

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi>
was, ſo ſeverely puniſhed for ſuch a ſmall ſeeming errour; (as it
might be called) what may thoſe expect who boldly commit
groſſe and ſcandalous ſinnes? without any remorſe, or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Where it is ſaid, that for this fact of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi>
(though upon a good intention) the anger of the Lord was
kindled againſt him: and he ſmote him for his errour &amp;c. We
ſee that ſinne and errour kindles Gods wrath, and looſes his hand
of juſtice unto puniſhment: therefore how watchfull, and loath
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119120:65"/>
we ſhould be to ſinne, as we would be loath, and feare to kindle
Gods anger againſt our ſelves, and thereby to procure his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>10. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>God ſmote him and he died by the
Arke:</hi> we ſee that in the Lords hand is life and death, and how
ſuddenly he may inflict the ſame, eſpecially when we provoke
his wrath: and therefore we ſhould eſchew ſinne; the wages
whereof is death, and feare God (as our Saviour exhorts us)
<hi>Who when he has killed the body can caſt both ſoule and body in hell
fire.</hi> Likewiſe we ſee that the Ark brings death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah;</hi> but (as after) bleſſing to <hi>Obededom,</hi> even ſo the
right uſe, or abuſe of the Word and Sacraments, brings the like to
the right uſers or abuſers thereof. And we ſhould feare with a
prophane heart and hands to come and touch that holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is called Chriſts body and blood, as the Ark was
called the Lord of hoſtes.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. This ſad accident produces in <hi>David.</hi> 1. Grief
or diſpleaſure, that the Lord had been ſo offended, and made
ſuch a breach upon <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah.</hi> And 2. Feare to bring the Ark of
God at that time to his houſe at <hi>Sion.</hi> Where we ſee, 1. <hi>Davids</hi>
Godly griefe that God ſhould have been grieved at that which
<hi>Vzzah</hi> unwarrantably had done againſt the Law, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite,
that the <hi>Levites</hi> ſhould otherwiſe carry the Ark, but upon
their own ſhoulders, and not touch it otherwiſe, but only by
bearing it by the inſtruments and barres appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
2. That God ſhould have been moved by their not taking
heed to his ordinance and ſinning thereby to have ſmitten <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi>
by ſo ſudden and unexpected death, which ſhewes 1. The
griefe that Godly men have at the offence of God, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 136. And 2. The
ſympathy that they have with others who for their errours are
juſtly puniſhed or chaſtiſed by the hand of God, as fellow feeling
members of one body. And 3. How by the puniſhments of others
they are inſtructed, and feare to commit any like offence whereby
Gods anger may be kindled againſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>11. Whereas in remembrance of that puniſhment inflicted on
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> he called the name of the place <hi>Perez-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> or the
breach of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah.</hi> We ſee that not only the teſtimonies of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119120:66"/>
Lords mercy towards the Godly, and their deliverances ſhould
be remembred, but likewiſe the teſtimonies of his juſtice towards
offenders. The firſt to tye us to his obedience as by love cords,
the other to terrify us from offending his divine Majeſty, as we
ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 120.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. This feare that <hi>David</hi> had of carrying the Ark
at that time to his own houſe, makes him to carry it aſide to the
houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> a Gittite where it remained three months, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all which time the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> was bleſſed. To
teach us, that where religion, and the Word of God and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
gets footing: there is and will be the bleſſing of the Lord,
as when <hi>Jacob</hi> was with <hi>Laban, Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe, and
the widdow of <hi>Zarephath</hi> for her ſuſtaining of <hi>Eliah.</hi> Much more
alſo is that ſoule bleſſed where Chriſt himſelfe is ſuborned, or his
poore members</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 25. Where upon the report of
the Lords bleſſing <hi>Obed-Edoms</hi> houſe, becauſe of the Ark. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
of new againe enterpriſeth the bringing of the Ark unto his
houſe in <hi>Sion.</hi> We ſee that good purpoſes ſhould never be left
off altogether, although they find ſome rubs and impediments
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſt in the way, through the policy of Satan, or mens obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>14. One maine cauſe of this renewed enterpriſe is the report
of the Lords bleſſing of the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> not that <hi>David</hi>
envyed the ſame: but that he was deſirous to be partaker of this
bleſſing of the Lord, by harbouring the Ark in like manner in his
own houſe at <hi>Sion.</hi> Which ſhewes the diſpoſition of the truly
Godly, like <hi>Iacob</hi> they will wreſtle for the bleſſing of God, and
will endeavour by all meanes, and above all things to have the
Lord to bleſſe themſelves, and their families, and have the light of
his countenance to ſhine upon them, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. As alſo we ſee,
that it is good to be in a Godly family, for there is the bleſſing of
God.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. In the carrying of the Ark now this ſecond time
from the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> to the Citie of <hi>David:</hi> we ſee the
former errour amended; that the <hi>Levites</hi> bore the ſame, as the
Law commanded, and therefore it had the better ſucceſs. Where
we ſee that it is a token of great wiſdome and grace to conſider
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119120:66"/>
wherein any errour has been, for which God has been angry, and
puniſhed a land or perſons: and when they have found out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

here.</p>
                  <p>16. It is ſaid likewiſe that when they that bare the Ark, (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit,
the <hi>Levites</hi>) had gone ſix paces, <hi>David</hi> ſacrificed Oxen,
and Fatlings, being mindfull of the Lords anger that burſt forth
in a temporall judgment againſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> for his errour; that the
Lord by theſe legall Sacrifices might be appeaſed, if any like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or provocation ignorantly ſhould fal out in this ſecond bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ark from the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> as we ſee the like
practiſe of <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 5. Which teaches us to be ſtill in feare to
offend God in the meaneſt meaſure or manner, and by a
watchfull care ſo farre as in us lyes to prevent his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>David</hi> alſo danced before the Ark, girded
with a linnen Ephod: white being the colour of joy, and linnen
being light for uſe. Which fact of his was extraordinary, and
therefore not to be imitated. His dancing being a ſigne of the
great joy of his heart, upon this extrarodinary action of
bringing the Ark from the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> to his own houſe,
and this linnen Ephod not being a prieſtly, or leviticall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
but a covering of his royall under-apparell, made of
linnen, like to an Ephod, to witneſs his humility, as we ſee
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. And that he thought no diſgrace in the Ephod,
as many do the office of the Miniſtry. Whence we ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that with ſpirituall rejoycing, and with humility the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of religious duties ſhould be, but not from extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
outward practiſes: to argue for the like ordinary perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
that by <hi>Davids</hi> dancing before the Ark, immodeſt, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious
dancing ſhould be authorized, which is for exciting of
luſt, or other ſinfull ends, as that dancing was of <hi>Herodias</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>18. The joy and rejoycing that is made by the King, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at the bringing up of the Ark, ſhewes us what is, and ſhould
be the right cauſe of the Godlies rejoycing, even the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

not in things unſtable and tranſitory, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

his former victories ending now in devotion.</p>
                  <p>2. When <hi>David</hi> had ſetled the Ark, and performed his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to God by Sacrificing, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. He bleſſed the people in the
name of the Lord of hoſtes, which he did both as a Prophet, and
as a pious loving Princed praying to God for them, and wiſhing
from God a bleſſing to them. Wherein we ſee the patterne of a
Godly, and a loving Prince, which is not only to rule his people
by Lawes, and good Example: but likewiſe to pray for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of his people, (as they alſo ſhould do for him) and to beg
a bleſſing from God upon them, and upon his government over
them.</p>
                  <p>3. The Lord is called here by <hi>David,</hi> the Lord of hoſtes,
whereby he thankfully inſinuates, who was the Author of all his
former victories, and ſucceſs of his hoſtes, or Armies, even the
Lord, who is the Lord of hoſtes, and has innumerable hoſtes of
Angells and other inferiour creatures ready at his command, to
fight for his own, and be avenged on his Enemies, as we ſee in
<hi>Pharaoh's</hi> plagues, and <hi>Herods</hi> deſtruction, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
Which may be a comfort to the Godly, and a terrour
to their foes.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. With bleſſing of the people <hi>David</hi> joynes bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
and liberality in giving and dealing to the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well women as men, a quantity of bread, of
fleſh, and of wine for their entertainment; ſo it is a good thing
when <hi>benedicere</hi> and <hi>benefacere</hi> goes together. And when in a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119120:68"/>
Prince, is ſeen not only piety towards God, but love and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
towards his people, and that he is rather carefull to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their wants, and neceſſities, then any waies by ſad exactions and
the like, to bring them to want and neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>David,</hi> when he is quieted from externall troubles, and
as he had firſt bleſſed his people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Thus are the Godly ſtill exerciſed with ſome croſſe,

                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. It is ſaid, that <hi>Michal</hi> deſpiſed <hi>David</hi> firſt in her

ſpeeches of her mouth, wherein we ſee. 1. Where Satan and
ſinne firſt beginnes: towit, at the ſpring and root of the heart,
to poyſon the ſame; which therefore we ſhould watch over
with all diligence, and remember that which the Lord requires,
my ſonne give me thy heart. 2. We ſee that where the heart
is once poyſoned, and poſſeſt, ſinne and Satan never reſt till they
proceed further, and come to a ripe harveſt: as we ſee in our firſt
parents. In the luſting of the ſonnes of God before the deluge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>8. In <hi>Michal's</hi> fact we ſee the prophane diſpoſition of irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
perſons, who count all actions of zeal to be but folly, &amp; who
cannot content to be irreligious themſelves, but <hi>to ſit down</hi> (as
<hi>Pſa.</hi> 1. 1.) <hi>In the chaire of the ſcorner,</hi> and to be the mockers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and of a religious diſpoſition in others, which indeed is
the putting on the very kepſtone of wickedneſſe and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>9. In this fact of hers, we ſee alſo the groſſe breach of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
duty, who being <hi>Davids</hi> Wife, ſhould have reverenced
him, as her Husband, as is commanded, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 33. And was
done by the holy women of old, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. And not reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,

in all godly Wives, who ought to obey their Husbands
in all Lawfull things, but ſimply, alwayes to reverence them.</p>
                  <p>10. In this ſpeech of <hi>Michal's,</hi> we ſee likewiſe exorbitant
pride, cenſuring her Husbands Laudable, and godly practiſe, as a
baſe, ſhameleſſe and fooliſh fact, more be ſeeming the baſeſt, and
vileſt fellowes: then the dignity and gravity of a King, and ſo
ſhe would aſcribe to herſelf greater wiſdome, and care of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtate dignity then <hi>David</hi> had, and doth impute unto him
baſeneſſe and folly. Where we ſee how great and dangerous

this ſhould teach not onely humility to all Women, and
obſerving of matrimoniall duty herein, in being of a meek and

10. <hi>Verſ</hi> 21. In <hi>Davids</hi> anſwer to <hi>Michal</hi> he ſhewe, that
what he did, he did it out of humility, as before the Lord,
who had rejected the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> her Father, and had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
him to be ruler over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore in regard that
it was before the Lord, who had been ſuch a promoter of him to
ſo high a place, he could not be humble enough, and therefore
he would be more vile yet, and baſe in his own fight. Where
we ſee, that it is not the mocking of a Religious diſpoſition, or
bitter reproaching thereof, that will diſcourage the truly godly
to deſiſt from their duty, but that conſtantly they will the more
rather inſiſt therein, upon the motive of remembrance of Gods
goodneſſe towards them beyond others, and what he requires
therefore at their hands.</p>

in ones owne ſight is the readier way to be honoured of
others: then a puft up heart by pride, and hawty, and high looks,

               <p>Firſt then is ſet downe <hi>Davids</hi> deliberation with <hi>Nathan</hi> to
build a Temple to the Lord, and his Arke, which he had brought
to his houſe in <hi>Sion,</hi> of the which there are aſſigned three ſeverall
reaſons. 1. From the opportunite of the time, which is ſaid to bee,
when <hi>David</hi> was ſetled in his houſe, and God had given him reſt
round about from all his Enemies, and which has relation to
<hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 3. 2. From the duty of gratitude which has a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119120:70"/>
from the word of God, that ſeeing God had given him a
houſe, peace and ſuch preferment, therefore he would build a
houſe likewiſe to God. 3. <hi>Ab honeſto,</hi> or ſeemlineſſe, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<hi>a minori ad majus,</hi> that it is not ſeemly and honeſt that
he ſhould dwell in a houſe of Cedar, and the Arke of God ſhould
dwell within curtaines.</p>
               <p>Next followes <hi>Nathans</hi> approbation of ſo holy an intention,
and promiſe that the Lord ſhould be with him in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
but not having firſt conſulted, and had warrant from the
Lord, he ſhews herein his temerity &amp; raſhneſs, therefore the Lord
that very night reveales his will in the contrary to <hi>Nathan,</hi> and
by him to <hi>David;</hi> not that <hi>David</hi> did evill in this his intending,
for 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 18. The Lord ſaid to him, <hi>Whereas it was in thy
heart to build an houſe to my name, thou didſt well.</hi> But from the
performance thereof he diſſwades him, by three arguments. The
firſt is, <hi>Vers</hi> 5. by way of interrogation equivalent to a negative,
as if he would ſay, thou ſhalt not build an houſe to me, not having
a calling from me to that work: the reaſon whereof is elſwhere ſet
down, becauſe he was a man of blood, and had warres with
thoſe about him on every ſide, as we ſee, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 3. And ſo
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e was called to another work, to fight the battles of the Lord.
The ſecond argument is, from the practiſe of God &amp; <hi>Davids</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors:
Gods practiſe being, not to dwell in any ſuch materiall
houſe, ſince he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but walking in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
&amp; not commanding them to build any ſuch houſe unto
him, or quarrelling with them for not doing ſo, but onely injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, to feed his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they obeying. The third
argument is, after the rehearſall, of all Gods goodneſſe to <hi>David,</hi>
from a low eſtate advancing him to a royall dignity, and giving
him victory over all his Enemies, and his people reſt and peace
under him, as alſo that he ſhould eſtabliſh the Kingdome to him,
and his poſterity, then he tells him that he had appointed his Son
(meaning <hi>Solomon</hi>) to be the man that ſhould build the Temple,
<hi>Vers</hi> 13. To whom he promiſes to be a Father, <hi>Vers</hi> 14. And
he ſhould be a Son unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Onely in the words, <hi>Vers</hi> 16.
and elſwhere. <hi>That his Kingdome, and Throne ſhould be eſtabliſhed
for ever,</hi> lies a difficulty, ſeeing we ſee the contrary now, and
long ago when the Scepter departed from <hi>Judah, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119120:70"/>
1. This (<hi>for ever</hi>) is interpreted, <hi>Vers</hi> 19. not to ſignify proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an eternity of indurance, as in ſome other places; but (as the
words are) a great while to come, &amp; ſo the Scripture doth expone
it ſelf. 2. This eſtabliſhment (<hi>for ever</hi>) may be underſtood not of
the externall, and temporall Kingdome of <hi>David</hi> himſelf, who was
the type of Chriſt, who is called the Son of <hi>David,</hi> but of the
Spirituall Kingdome of Chriſt Jeſus under the Goſpel, who was
of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, and of whom it is

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 1. IT is ſaid, that the Lord gave <hi>David</hi> reſt from all his
Enemies, which ſhewes us that the godly have had, ſtill
have, and ſhall have Enemies to the Worlds end: this being the
emnity that was proclaimed in Paradiſe between the ſeed of the

                  <p>2. We ſee the curbing, and reſtraining power of God over all
ſuch, that as he calmed the ſtorm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 24. So he can calme
the rage of all the wicked againſt his Church in his owne good
time, as he did <hi>Eſau's</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> and as he gave reſt here to
<hi>David</hi> from all his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>3. It is ſaid that God gave him reſt, which ſhewes: That of reſt
from troubles, &amp; of all good things we ſhould acknowledge God
to be the Author, and therefore be thankfull to him. For which
it is ſaid, <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
them out of them all. And</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. <hi>call upon me</hi> (ſayes

                  <p>4. <hi>Vers</hi> 2. In <hi>Davids</hi> intention to build an houſe to God, we ſee
what ſhould be the right uſe of Princes, or others, their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and peace, towit, the giving of themſelves in teſtimony of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119120:71"/>
their thankfulneſſe to God, to the eſtabliſhment of Religion
within their dominions, or houſes.</p>
                  <p>5. In the intending to build a houſe to God, he conſults with
<hi>Nathan</hi> the Lords Prophet, to teach us. That in matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
Religion, or the worſhip of God, we ſhould conſult with
the true Prophets and Paſtours of God, <hi>whoſe lips ſhould preſerve
knowledge,</hi> and the people ſhould enquire of the Law of God at
their mouths.</p>
                  <p>6. We ſee in <hi>David</hi> a moſt religious diſpoſition; Laudable and
imitable, who thinks it an unſeemly thing that he ſhould dwell
in a houſe of Cedar, and Gods Arke ſhould dwell within cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
Which ſhould teach many great men to think ſo, that their
houſes ſhould not be like pleaſant, &amp; glorious pallaces, and Gods
houſe, or Church wherein he is worſhipped ſhould be ſo baſe
and beggerly, like cottages.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Vers</hi> 3. In <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution, as likewiſe <hi>Nathans</hi> approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, we ſee that both do erre, whereby we ſee. How unſure
is that warrant, or direction in matters of Religion, that is
grounded onely upon humane authority without the expreſſe
and clear warrant of the oracle of God, and of his Word. Though
the intention were never ſo praiſe worthy, or plauſible.</p>
                  <p>8. Likewiſe we ſee, that the beſt intentions even of the beſt are
dangerous to be approved, or followed, without a warrant from

<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Saepe enim coruſcat in conſpectu operant is, quod ſordefcit

                  <p>9. <hi>Vers</hi> 4. God reduces <hi>David</hi> from his errour, not immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by ſpeaking to <hi>David;</hi> but mediatly by ſpeaking to him by
<hi>Nathan,</hi> to ſhew. That this honour God will have his true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to enjoy, that by them, as his meſſengers, and Embaſſadors
he will his people to know his will: as by interpreters <hi>Joſeph</hi>
would ſpeak to his Brethren, though he could immediatly (as he
did at laſt) ſpeak to themſelves, and who heareth them heareth
him, and who deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth him.</p>
                  <p>10. The Lord manifeſts his will to <hi>Nathan,</hi> as a faithfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that ſo he may faithfully deliver the ſame to <hi>David,</hi> as there
after alſo he did in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> which was <hi>Davids</hi> great
happineſſe. So that happy is that Prince, and people that has a

faithfull Miniſtry, who will reveal to them the whole counſel of
God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Vers</hi> 5. <hi>David</hi> a King, is called here <hi>Gods ſervant</hi> who
is King of Kings, the faireſt flower in any Kings crowne, and
higheſt and beſt title they can claime; <hi>to be called the ſervants of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. The firſt arguments by which he inhibits him to be the
builder of Gods houſe, is, becauſe he had not a calling thereto,
which ſhould teach us. That although the work be good in it ſelf
which a man may do, yet if he have not a calling thereunto, he
ought not to meddle therewith, or run before he be ſent, as we ſee
in the examples of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah:</hi> and on the contrary, as
we ſee in Chriſt, the holy Prophets, and bleſſed Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Vers</hi> 8. The Lord remembers <hi>David,</hi> that he may be
humble &amp; thankfull, from what a low condition he brought him,
even from the ſheepcoat to ſo high and royall dignity: therefore
let not men marvell to ſee the like doing of the Lord, now adays,
in raiſing ſome, and throwing down others. And let ſuch with
whom the Lord ſo deals, remember their low eſtate, and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and what is their duty in their higher place, eſpecially to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, who has honoured them, and to be thankfull. Let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

ſervants.</p>
                  <p>14. V. 9. and 10. The Lord ſhewes that it was he, by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
and powerfull preſence with <hi>David,</hi> that had cut of his
Enemies, and made him great, and his people in a peaceable eſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

under him, to teach him, and all Princes, and others to aſcribe
their proſperity, and good condition to the Lord, and to give him
the glory of all.</p>
                  <p>15. V. 11. Where it is told <hi>David,</hi> that in reſpect he intended
to build a houſe to God, the Lord likewiſe ſhould make him a
houſe. We ſee that the Lord will not ſuffer the good and laudable
intentions of the godly to be unrewarded: much more their
pious and commendable actions, no, <hi>not a cup of cold water given
to one of his, which ſhall want its reward.</hi> Which ſhould be a great
encouragement to pious and good works.</p>
                  <p>16. As it is God that raiſes great houſes; ſo it is he that brings
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119120:72"/>
down great houſes for their ſinning againſt him, and this is the
cauſe why many great houſes in the Land are fallen, and their
honour laid in the duſt, becauſe they honoured not God, as they
ought in time of their proſperity.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Vers</hi> 12. Where it is ſaid, (<hi>when thy dayes are fulfilled</hi>)
we ſee the ſhortneſſe of mans life, numbred not like the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fools
Arithmetike by many years, but by dayes, as <hi>Jacob</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<note place="margin">Job 14. 1. and 14.</note>
and theſe few and evil, ſo did <hi>Job</hi> count his life, but by dayes,
as <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo taught the people to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 12.</p>
                  <p>18. Likewiſe we ſee here that your life is limited, and there
is a fulfilling of our dayes, which cannot beyond Gods pleaſure
be ſhortned, or prolonged, he being that ſecret <hi>Palmoni,</hi> or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berer,
which we ſee profeſſed by <hi>Job</hi> 7. 1. and 14. 14.</p>
                  <p>19. Where it is ſaid, when <hi>David ſhould ſleep with his Fathers,</hi>
we ſee, what the death of the godly is, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no more to be feared, then ſleep which makes us ly down in
our beds: or reſt to a weary traveller, or a hard labourer, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 2.
Which made the Apoſtle to deſire to be diſſolved that he might
be with Chriſt, and <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 13. to call <hi>it a reſt from our labours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. The Lord promiſes after <hi>Davids</hi> death to bleſſe his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
whereby we ſee that it is true which the Lord ſayes, <hi>Exod.</hi>
20. 6. <hi>That he will ſhew mercy to thouſands of them, who love him,
and keep his commandments,</hi> and that it is a happy bleſſing to come
of good, and godly parents, if their ofſpring inſiſt in their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Vers</hi> 13. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>Davids</hi> Sonne, towit, <hi>Solomon,</hi>
ſhould build a houſe to his name, which was a greater honour
to him, then the honour of his Kingdome, we ſee that in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it is the greateſt honour, that any Prince can attain unto, to
be the builder, not of a materiall houſe, but of the Church of
Chriſt, and promoter of his truth, like a nurſing Father to the
Church: as the godly Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were, and the godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
and Orthodox Emperours, which would to God, that all
Chriſtian Kings would now adayes conſider, and that they
would not prop up Antichriſts throne, and perſecute the true
Church of Chriſt. For this ſhould be the way of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Kingdomes, as is here promiſed to him who ſhould
build the Temple.</p>
                  <p>

22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. The Lord ſaies moreover that he ſhould be
his Father, and he his ſonne: which is the greateſt honour that
any King can have, and the only true nobility which Kings, or
any can claime unto, and wherein to their ſingular comfort the
pooreſt Godly houſe has a ſhare and perceive therein the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
love of God, as the Apoſtle ſhewes, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>23. But as this is the ground of ſingular, and manifold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
(as of his love to us, even when he is correcting us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
6. His care for us, his protection of us, and granting any good
thing to us &amp;c.) So this teaches us alſo our duty of ſonnes, to
love him, to obey him, to honour him, to ſerve him, to be
zealous, of his honour, to relye in him, and his Fatherly good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
for all things we ſtand in reach of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at laſt, for that

                  <p>24. And <hi>if he commit iniquity,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>I will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe

be watchfull over themſelves with prayer; and as is ſaid, <hi>Phil</hi>
2. 12. <hi>Be working out your owne ſalvation with feare, and wit
trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. Alſo here we ſee, what the committing of iniquity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,
even to the Godlieſt, towit, ſharp correction, as <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Salomon</hi> found. And therefore let not the wicked (though
ſpared for a time) expect impunity, but that dreadfull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
abides them, who neither repent, as the Godly do: and who
make a trade of ſinne as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 1. and as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 18.
Nor yet let any think that want of correction, and proſperity
here, is a mark of Gods Children.</p>
                  <p>26. We ſee alſo, when the Godly are corrected, that thoſe
whom the Lord permits to trouble, and afflict them, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Children of wickedneſs, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. They are nothing
elſe but like the rods of men, wherewith they chaſtiſe their
deareſt Children for their good: and therefore as the Godly
with <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Shimeis</hi> railing, and as <hi>Job</hi> ſpoke, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 21. They
ſhould look up to the hand of God: ſo when the Lord by ſuch
hath ſufficiently chaſtiſed them: he will caſt the rod in the fire;

which ſhould be a terrour to all wicked perſecutors, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

                  </p>

not uſing the meanes, nor yet diſtruſt God by confiding in the

                  <p>4. All this which was done by <hi>David</hi> unto theſe wicked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was (as is ſaid) fore-propheſied by <hi>Balaam,</hi> and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this performance 400. yeares and more had intervened,
whereby we ſee, 1. The Lords lenity and long ſuffering patience,
which ſhould have led them to repentance. 2. The truth of the
Lords threatnings at laſt, as well as of his promiſes: therefore
let not the Godly be diſcouraged that their enemies are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
or in ſhort time puniſhed; for the Lord ſuffers them to
fill their cup, and at laſt he will come, though with leaden feet,
yet with an iron heavy hand to cruſh them, as a pot harde in

                  <p>5. <hi>David</hi> ſlew the <hi>Syrians</hi> who came to ſuccour <hi>Hadade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi>

the wicked againſt the Godly, or to be pertakers with any in
an ill cauſe or courſe, as the example of <hi>Jehofaphats</hi> aſſociation
with <hi>Ahab,</hi> teſtifies, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 8.</p>

and as the Poet ſpeaks, <hi>Non minor eſt virtus quam querere,
parta tueri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Where it is ſaid that the Lord preſerved <hi>David</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he went: we ſee, 1. Who is the preſerver of the Godly
from all danger in the midſt of perill's, and from whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhould ſeek the ſame. 2. How good and carefull a
Maſter the Lord is of his ſervants, and their ſafety: as we ſee,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. Yea in death it ſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 4.
Which ſhould be a great motive, and encouragement to ſerve
him.</p>
                  <p>8. We ſee by Gods preſerving of <hi>David</hi> whetherſoever he
went, not only Gods generall omnipreſence withall, but alſo
his particular and ſpeciall preſence in mercy, and for their good
with his own: becauſe they walk in his waies, and as acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this his preſence, and alſeeing eye.</p>

9. <hi>Vers</hi> 11. <hi>Davids</hi> giving of the rich ſpoile of theſe nations
whom he ſubdued, and dedicating of them to the Lord, together
with the rich gifts of gold, ſilver and braſſe which <hi>Toi</hi> King of
<hi>Hamath</hi> ſent unto him; not onely clears him, that he undertook
not theſe warres for covetouſneſſe, but alſo ſhewes his thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to God, as author of his victories, and his religious, and
bountifull royall diſpoſition to Religion, and the advancement
thereof, worthy to be imitated by all Princes and others, and
farre contrary to the diſpoſition of moſt men now adayes who
have no publicke Spirits, or are for pious workes, but onely ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to their owne private commodity.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Vers</hi> 14. We ſee the <hi>Edomites</hi> are counted amongſt theſe
Enemies to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> ſubdued, who were come of <hi>Eſau,
Iſraels</hi> elder Brother, and yet, though of one blood from <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
and ſhould as Brethren been friends to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were their
infeſting Enemies. Whereby we ſee how weak a band of union,
or amity nature is without grace, which indeed is the ſtrongeſt
tie of love and true ſolid friendſhip, the communion of ſaints.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Vers</hi> 15. After he had ſubdued his Enemies <hi>David</hi> now
gives not himſelf to eaſe and ſport, or the like, as many Princes
do: but like a good King in his own Perſon he Miniſters Juſtice
unto all his people, and commits it not altogether, and onely to
other deputies under him. A worthy example for all Kings to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
as we ſee <hi>Solomon</hi> likewiſe did in judging between the two
harlots.</p>
                  <p>12. Where it is ſaid, that he executed judgement and Juſtice.
We ſee that it is not enough for Princes, onely to make good
Lawes, except alſo they put them in execution, as alſo where it
is ſaid, that he did this to all his people, the meaneſt as well as
the greateſt, it ſhewes that he did the ſame impartially, which is
the worthieſt part of a Judge ſo to do, for a good Judge ſhould.
1. Be void of affection and partiality. 2. He ſhould have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to hear. 3. Skill to cognoſce. 4. Wiſdome to decerne.
And 5. courage to execute, without partiality.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Vers</hi> 16. In this prudent and provident diſtribution of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
for government of both eſtates, civil and Eccleſiaſticall, and
ſetting ſuch over the <hi>Cherethites,</hi> and <hi>Pelethites,</hi> who were his
guard, we ſee the laudable care, that <hi>David</hi> had both of Church
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119120:77"/>
and Commonwealth, and which all godly Princes ſhould imitate
and follow.</p>
                  <p>14. We ſee alſo that every one hath his particular office aſſigned
unto him, wherein he is appointed to do his duty, without uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or intruſion upon the office of another: a worthy example
to be followed, for every one to be content with his own charge,
and to diſcharge it well, and to keep within their owne ſphere
and ſtation: the civil not to uſurp, or incroach upon the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall,
as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> did: nor the Eccleſiaſticall to uſurp civil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and meddle in civil affaires not belonging to them, after
Chriſts example, who ſaid to the two Brethren concerning the
parting of the inheritance, <hi>Who made me a Judge between you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. The Allegory of theſe victories of <hi>David</hi> and ſubduing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him theſe nations, and dedicating their ſpoils, and gifts to the
Lord: repreſents to us in figure, the victory that the Sonne of

of <hi>Davids</hi> further kindneſſe to him according to that covenant
made between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 16, 17. This

                  <hi>Ziba</hi> his ſervant, to be his favourer, or Chamber-lane. Again
in the firſt part, which is <hi>Davids</hi> inquiſition, we have ſet down all
the circumſtances, as likewiſe the anſwer, and reſolution thereof,
1. Is the time, when <hi>David</hi> (in the former Chapter) had paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Kingdome, by ſubdueing the bordering Enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
without; and within had eſtabliſhed the government both of
Church and ſtate, and ſo had prove a good Magiſtrate. Now he
ſets himſelf to ſhew likewiſe that he is a good man, which two
when they concurre, they make a Land happy. 2. The Perſons
at whom he asks, are not named, but it ſeems to be his counſell,
or neereſt courtiers. 3. The matter of the inquiſition is, if there
be any left of <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe. 4. The end is, not for evill to cut of
ſuch for his greater ſecurity, but to ſhew favour unto them for
<hi>Jonathans</hi> ſake. For reſolving of which queſtion, or inquiſition,
theſe of whom <hi>David</hi> inquired, call one unto the King <hi>Ziba,</hi> a
ſervant of <hi>Mephiboſheths,</hi> who tell <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Jonathan</hi> had a
Sonne, who was lame of his feet, <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> (otherwiſe called

which place, where he lived in an obſcure and private manner,
glad to have his life ſaved. 1. <hi>David</hi> ſends and brings him.
2. Beſide his obedience, is ſet down his humble reverence to
<hi>David,</hi> as his ſovereigne, both by geſture falling on his face, and
by word, profeſſing himſelf to be his ſervant. 3. Is ſet down
<hi>Davids</hi> kind, and gracious dealing with him. 1. Forbidding him
to fear. 2. Shewing unto him in the generall, that he would ſhew
kindneſſe to him for <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſake, and in particular. 1. He
would reſtore to him all the proper Land of his Grandfather
<hi>Saul.</hi> And 2. he would ſo farre alſo honour him, that he ſhould
eat at his table continually, where unto is ſubjoyned <hi>Mephiboſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eths</hi>

               <p>In the third part of this Chapter is ſet down <hi>Davids</hi> declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Ziba;</hi> what he had done, and was to do, to his Maſter <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and his appointing of him, his Sonnes, who were
15. and his ſervants who were 20. to till his Land for him, and
bring in the fruits thereof to him, providing ſo for his eaſe, as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119120:78"/>
well as for his honour and commodity, which charge <hi>Ziba</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
undergoes, and ſo <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> dwelt in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
did eat continually at the Kings table.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. WE ſee in this inquiſition of <hi>David, vers</hi> 1. And time
thereof, that honour changes not manners, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
he that kindneſſe now being King, which formerly he had
with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> when he was his Fathers ſubject, and therefore
ſeeing himſelf was dead, he reſolves to keep this kindneſſe ſtill,
and ſhew it to any of his ofſpring.</p>
                  <p>2. In this inquiſition and deed of <hi>Davids,</hi> we ſee three notable
vertues eminent in him. 1. Gratitude and thankfulneſſe to <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
for all his love, and favours, which in his life time he did
ſhew to <hi>David,</hi> which now ſurvives <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and he ſhewes
it to his Sonne, <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> Which ſerves to condemne this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
that is ſo ungrate both to the living, and to the dead.
2. Verity, which is the obſervation of what he promiſed to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi>
and to ſhew that his promiſe was a true promiſe, and not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lie, and his oath a true oath, and not perjury, both lying and
perjury being moſt odious in any, but chiefly in a Prince, the one
puniſhable by infamy, and the other by death.</p>
                  <p>3. Fidelity, which is different from verity, in that verity has
words as the ſubject, and fidelity has works. And as verity is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the agreement of the minde with the word, ſo fidelity is the
agreement of the word with the work.</p>
                  <p>3. In keeping promiſe and covenant, according to the Law,
we ſee that <hi>David,</hi> though a King and Lawgiver to others, yet
he ſubjects himſelf unto the Law, to be an obſerver thereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
as a good example to others to follow, as is ſaid, <hi>Regis ad
exemplum totus componitur orbis,</hi> and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 21. <hi>Thou that teaches another, teaches thou not thy ſelf?</hi> So thou
who wouldeſt have another obſerve Lawes, ſhouldeſt thou not be
examplar in obſerving the Lawes thyſelf? A neceſſary leſſon and
good example for all Princes, and Paſtours, Magiſtrates and
Miniſters to follow.</p>
                  <p>4. This kindneſſe that <hi>David</hi> would ſhew to any that is left
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119120:78"/>
(ſayes <hi>David</hi>) of <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe, ſhewes plainly hereby, and by the
finding out but of one poor lame man of it, that the Lord for
<hi>Sauls</hi> wickedneſſe &amp; cruelty, had quite deſtroyed that houſe of his,
though a potent King. Which ſheweth what ſinne does to the
greateſt houſes, (though royall) and to others inferiour, being
like the worm at the root of <hi>Jonas</hi> flouriſhing gourd, which made
it ſoon to decay.</p>
                  <p>5. This kindneſſe that he would ſhew, he ſayes, it is for <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi>
ſake, where we ſee. 1. That the fruit of wel doing lives
longer then himſelf who is the doer, and thereby he leaves a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and good treaſure behinde him to his poſterity. And 2. that
it is a happy thing to be the ofſpring of a good parent, chiefly,
if they inſiſt in their godly footſteps.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Vers</hi> 3. This kindneſſe is called the kindneſſe of God, which
<hi>David</hi> ſayes he was to ſhew for <hi>Ionathans</hi> ſake, to denote firſt the
greatneſſe of the kindneſſe, as ſundry things in Scripture has this
denomination for the ſame ſignification, as the montain of God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo 2. to ſhew that this was agreeable to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
that promiſes being Lawfull, and ſpecially oathes
ſhould be keeped, as we ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. And which ſhould be the
rule of all, our actions and motive thereto. And 3. that the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
would be acceptable to God, which ſhould be the ſcope of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
doings.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Vers</hi> 5. <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> being lame of his feet, and lurking in
an obſcure place, farre againſt his expectation, is called both to
riches and honour, ſo graciouſly doth the Lord deal with ſuch
whom he viſits one way, he comforts them another way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
though he ſuffer ſome a long time, to lie as it were low in the
duſt, yet at laſt he lifts them up, not looking for it, as he did
to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as he called <hi>Saul</hi> alſo to be King when he was ſeeking
his Fathers Aſſes, and <hi>David</hi> from the ſheepcoat, as alſo the
Apoſtles from their fiſh boates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. This humility which <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſhewes both in geſture
and words, being a Princes Sonne, gives a good and imitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to all others to follow, and verifies that of Gods Word,
<hi>That before honour goes humility, but God reſiſts the proud while he
gives grace to the humble,</hi> and ſpecially to be humble, when God
has humbled any, as he had done <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe. Therefore though
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119120:79"/>
he calls himſelf not onely a Dog, but alſo a dead Dog, fitter for a
ditch, or at beſt like a Dog to lie under a table, yet he is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſit as a Prince at a royall table.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Vers</hi> 7. We ſee here great liberality in <hi>David</hi> towards <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth,</hi>
which is a worthy vertue in a Prince, ſo that it be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
right Perſons, for good cauſes, and in a moderate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
not to exhauſt their own treaſure and lay heavy burthens on
their people, for the enriching of a few, perhaps not well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
as on the contrary covetouſneſſe and a niggardly diſpoſition
is moſt unſuteable to a Prince, or great man.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Vers</hi> 9. <hi>Davids</hi> not onely beſtowes upon <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi>
honour and riches, but alſo being lame and impotent to travell,
he provids for his eaſe, by laying the charge on <hi>Ziba</hi> of tilling his
Land, and gathering in the fruits thereof, which ſhewes <hi>Davids</hi>
care of him, as well as his kindneſſe to him, and his compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
diſpoſition to one, that had ſuch a bodily infirmity, as an
example to others to follow the like compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>11. Likewiſe, <hi>vers</hi> 11. Though he was lame on both his feet,
yet he is not therefore the more diſpiſed, or leſſe honoured by
<hi>David,</hi> to eat at his table as one of the Kings Sonnes. Teaching

               <head>II. SAM. Chap. 10. and 1 CHRON. 19.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter we have the further proof of <hi>Davids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in his begun courſe to gratify, and requit the favour of
them to whom he was addebted in the time of his troubles. This
Chapter is divided in three parts, in the firſt is <hi>Davids</hi> meſſage
to <hi>Hanun</hi> King of <hi>Ammon</hi> to comfort him after the death of his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119120:79"/>
Father. 2. Is ſet down the <hi>Ammonites</hi> barbarous uſage of <hi>Davids</hi>
meſſengers, <hi>Vers</hi> 4. <hi>and</hi> 3. We have the revenge that <hi>David</hi> took
of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and their aſſociates the <hi>Syrians,</hi> in two ſeverall
battles, the one with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and the <hi>Syrians, from the</hi> 6.
<hi>verſe to the</hi> 15. And the other with the <hi>Syrians, from the</hi> 15. <hi>vers
to the end.</hi> In both which <hi>David</hi> is ſtill victorious.</p>
               <p>Firſt then in the legation, or meſſage to the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> we
have. 1. The time, when this meſſage is ſent. 2. The action or
meſſage it ſelf, and the occaſion thereof. And 3. the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was ſent. Firſt then the time, is, when <hi>David</hi> was ſetled
in his Kingdome, &amp; had ſubdued all his Enemies both inteſtine &amp;
forrain, and was now a mighty victorious Monarch, and yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is neither puft up to deſpiſe a meaner neighbour Prince,
nor forgetfull of any duty of kindneſſe, or gratitude that was
requiſite on his part towards him. 2. The occaſion of this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
was the death of <hi>Nahaſh Hanun's</hi> Father, who in his life
time had ſhewn kindneſſe to <hi>David,</hi> and therefore now upon this
occaſion he would likewiſe ſhew kindneſſe to his Sonne. And
3. The end wherefore he ſends this meſſage is, to comfort <hi>Hanun</hi>
by the hand of his ſervants, for his Father, who was now dead?</p>
               <p>But <hi>David</hi> moſt ungratefully is requited, and his meſſengers
villanouſly and barbarouſly abuſed, wherein. 1. Is ſet down the
ground, or motive, towit, the unjuſt ſuſpition that the princes
of the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> had, and did apprehend of the end
of this meſſage of <hi>Davids,</hi> that it was not (as was pretended) to
comfort <hi>Hanun:</hi> but really and indeed to ſpie the City, and to
ſearch and deſtroy it: and ſo they cenſure <hi>David</hi> as a deep diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler
and Hypocrite, as alſo a covetous wicked man, ſeeking
after that which was his neighbours, not contenting with his
own, and imputing unto him cruelty, as intending deſtruction
howſoever he pretended friendſhip and love. And ſo they firſt
wrong <hi>David</hi> himſelf in his name, before they wrong his ſervants
in their Perſons. 2. It ſets down the barbarous abuſe of <hi>Davids</hi>
meſſengers by the pernicious and ill counſell of theſe Princes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the forenamed unjuſt groundleſſe ſuſpition, <hi>Vers</hi> 4. Which
was, the ſhaving off the one half of their beards, &amp; cutting of their
garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and ſending them
away. Whereupon is ſet down. 1. What <hi>David</hi> did, when he heard
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119120:80"/>
thereof, <hi>Vers</hi> 5. Towit, he ſent to meet his ſervants, becauſe they
were greatly aſhamed, and directs them to ſtay at <hi>Jericho,</hi> the
firſt bordering Town, untill their beards were grown, and then to
return. 2. Is ſet down what the <hi>Ammonites</hi> did, who were deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of that inceſtuous copulation of <hi>Lot</hi> with his younger Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.)
Towit, they prepare for warre againſt <hi>David,</hi> and for this
cauſe they hire the <hi>Syrians,</hi> with a thouſand talents of ſilver (as
we ſee, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6.) To aſſiſt them, whereas it had been better
and more wiſely done by them to have reſented their wrong, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
reparation, and ſought reconciliation with <hi>David,</hi> ſo potent
and victorious, and a valorous Prince, as the event proved. 3. We
have the motive that made them ſo to prepare this warre, which
was, becauſe they ſaw <hi>that they ſtank before David,</hi> a uſuall phraſe
in Scripture to expreſſe the hatefullneſſe of any to others, as <hi>Gen.</hi>
34. 30. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſayes to <hi>Simeon and Levi, yee have made me to ſtink
amongſt the inhabitants of the Land.</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 21. the people ſay
to <hi>Moſes, you have made our ſavour to be abhorred in the eyes of
Pharaoh.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Ammonits</hi> ſaw that they were become hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to <hi>David,</hi> and their fact abhorred by him. 4. Is ſet down,
<hi>Vers</hi> 7. <hi>to the</hi> 13. <hi>Davids</hi> preparation to meet them, and <hi>Joab</hi>
and his Brother <hi>Abiſhai</hi> their prudent and valiant managing of
the battle. Unto which is ſubjoyned, <hi>Vers</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 14. The
victory over the <hi>Syrians and Ammonits,</hi> 5. <hi>from the</hi> 15. <hi>verſe to
the</hi> 19. Is ſet down, the <hi>Syrians</hi> renewed battle againſt <hi>David</hi>
at <hi>Helam,</hi> a Town not farre from <hi>Iordan,</hi> and his victory over
them, whereby, <hi>Vers</hi> 19. they became wholly ſubdued, ſo
that they never helped the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> any more. From
all which we may ſee. 1. The cauſe of theſe warres that moved
them. 2. The perſons who were ingaged in them. 3. The
military diſcipline followed by both parties. And 4. the ſucceſſe
and end of them: but before we come to the obſervations. 1. We
will ſpeak ſomewhat of the perſons whom <hi>Hanun</hi> hired as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
ſouldiers to aſſiſt him. And 2. of their hire, firſt then
mention is made of the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Bethzehob,</hi> and of <hi>Zoba,</hi> who
were ſubjects to <hi>Hadarezar</hi> great King of <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> Who
were moved to follow <hi>Ammon</hi> for two cauſes, the one for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
the other to reject their ſworn ſubjection to <hi>David,
Chap.</hi> 8. 6. Next we have theſe of King <hi>Maacah,</hi> which were
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119120:80"/>
in that part of <hi>Syria,</hi> which lies betwixt <hi>Gilead,</hi> and on the eaſt,
towards that part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> called <hi>Trachonites:</hi> ſuppoſed to be
a part of the territory of <hi>Ammon</hi> above <hi>Jordan,</hi> neer to Mount
<hi>Hermon,</hi> Joſh. 13. Thirdly we have theſe of <hi>Iſhtob,</hi> at the eaſt
part from <hi>Ammon</hi> towards <hi>Arabia</hi> called the deſert, amounting
all to 33000.</p>
               <p>Next, then here is ſaid <hi>to be a thouſand talents of Silver,</hi> 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6. Which was a Hebrew weight, each Talent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
60. pound weight, and each pound, 25. common ſiccles,
reducing the ſiccle to a halfe ounce: ſo that the Talent will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
in our <hi>Scots</hi> money, to a thouſand and five hundred
pounds, or 120. <hi>lib. Sterlin</hi> and above, and the hundred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
to 150000. <hi>lib. Scots,</hi> ſo that the thouſand Talents of
Silver will amount unto 1500000. <hi>lib. Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the diſcipline uſed in this warre on both parts, the
ſame was very prudent, 1. On the part of <hi>Ammon</hi> and his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates:
they divide their Army in two, the <hi>Ammonites</hi> place
themſelves at <hi>Modeba,</hi> a towne in <hi>Arabia,</hi> belonging to <hi>Ruben,
Joſh.</hi> 13. 16. To be a retreate to them in caſe of overthrow,
(as they made the ſame, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.) As alſo to encounter with <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
in the front, as they had appointed the <hi>Syrians</hi> to charge the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> on their reer: and accordingly <hi>Joab</hi> in like manner, like
a wiſe and expert Generall perceiving his ſtratagem: he alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
his Army in two, the ſtrongeſt part whereof he takes to be
under his own conduct, againſt the greateſt number of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:</hi>
and the other part he gives to <hi>Abiſhai</hi> his brother to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> with a direction to help him, if he
ſaw the <hi>Syrians</hi> too ſtrong for him: and he to help <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> if he
ſaw the <hi>Ammonites</hi> too ſtrong for him.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 1. IT is ſaid that the King of <hi>Ammon</hi> died: where we ſee,
that death is the common condition of all man-kind,
Kings as beggers, wiſe as fooles, and rich as poore, ſo that <hi>

and great men ſhould conſider to humble them, and make them
think of the account of their ſtewardſhip afterward.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. In <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution to ſhew kindneſs to his Son,
as he ſhewed kindneſs to him, we ſee his vertue of gratitude, as in
the former Chapter to <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> this being the only tribute
that the Lord requires for all his benefits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 2. And
which we alſo owe to man, ſo that the naturall man ſaies that
we ſhould receive benefits, as the earth receiveth ſeed: and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to render the ſame with increaſe, <hi>Et ſi ingratum dixeris,
omnia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The time of <hi>Davids</hi> remembrance of the King of <hi>Ammons</hi>
kindneſs to him, when he was in exile, is now when he is ſetled
in a peaceable and potent kingdome, ſo that his high preferment
makes him not forget the favours which he received in his low
eſtate; as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> butler did, and as many do now adaies.</p>
                  <p>4. The kindneſs that he could not requite to the Father,
partly becauſe of his inability before: and partly becauſe of the
death of this King, he now reſolves to ſhew to the ſonne, where
we ſee, 1. That parents leave to their Children by their charity
and good deeds a good treaſure. As alſo, 2. That with honeſt
and thankfull perſons, the remembrance of benefits dieth not,
with the benefit receavers.</p>
                  <p>5. Where it is ſaid that <hi>David</hi> ſent to comfort <hi>Hanun</hi> by

them, whom we think to ſtand in need thereof, or to be in any

mourning with them who mourne.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. We ſee in the miſconſtruction of <hi>Davids</hi> meſſage,

                  </p>
                  <p>8. This miſconſtruction and miſcarriage that followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
did flow from an unjuſt ſuſpition of <hi>Davids</hi> intention, to trie,
and ſearch their City, that he might come againſt it, and deſtroy
it, ſo that unjuſt ſuſpition and miſconſtruction, is the very Child
of Satan, and whereby he procured the fall of our firſt parents,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. And that fearfull bondage and Tyranny againſt the
people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to his utter deſtruction, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 10.
And is ſo dangerous a peſt, that it diſſolves, where it once enters all
bonds of Society Politicke, or Oeconomicke, whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
a favourable conſtruction of mens meanings and actions
is a conſerver of peace and amity in all and every Society.</p>
                  <p>9. The firſt wrong that hereon enſues, is to <hi>David</hi> himſelf,
whereas by this ſupitious miſconſtruction they cenſure him as a
deep diſſembler, and a cruell and covetous Hypocrite, by ſending
under pretence of friendſhip to ſpie their weakneſſe, and to come
thereafter to ſubdue and deſtroy them. Which wrong done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to his name and fame is the greateſt wrong of any, as it is in
like manner to any other, the ſame being the murther of the
tongue, and of that which is deareſt to any ingenuous Spirit.</p>
                  <p>10. Upon this ſuſpition of <hi>Davids</hi> intention the Princes, of
<hi>Ammon</hi> gives a pernicious counſell to their young King, barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to abuſe <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants, which was the cauſe of there and
his ruine, in the ſubſequent warres that he had with him, and of
the expence of much treaſure and blood. Whereby we ſee in
this (and in that counſell that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> got their after, by his
young Counſellours) what bitter fruits evill Counſell to Princes
(ſpecially who are young &amp; unexperimented) produces. Both to the
givers, as alſo to the takers, whereas on the contrary it is a great
bleſſing to a Prince to have wiſe and godly grave Counſellers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and a pliable heart and eare to hearken to them, and
obey there Counſell, and to ſtop his eare to the contrary,
which bleſſing therefore all people ſhould pray for, to their Kings
and rulers.</p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:119120:82"/>
11. We ſee that this young King <hi>Hanun</hi> is farre unlike to his
Father <hi>Nahaſh:</hi> who ſhewed kindneſs to <hi>David,</hi> when he was in
exile. Which teaches us that goodneſs, nor grace, nor any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vertue, comes not by generation; as we ſee in <hi>Cain, Iſhmael,
Eſau, Ammon, Abſolom,</hi> and others: good parents oftimes having
bad Children.</p>
                  <p>12. In the abuſe done to <hi>Davids</hi> meſſengers, we ſee the very
Law of Nations (let them be Gods) violated, which ordaines no
wrong to be done to meſſengers, or embaſſadours: becauſe they
declare only the meſſage of their Maſter; and what wrong is
done to them, is counted done to them who ſends them: and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
no wrong ſhould be done to the meſſengers of an earthly King,
much leſs ſhould it be done to the meſſengers of the King of
Kings. Who will account the ſame done to himſelfe, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l
avenge it ſeverely on the doers, as <hi>David</hi> did on the King of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi>
eſpecially when they ſhave not the halfe of their bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
which would ſoon grow againe, or cut their garment by
the middle: but when they ſhave the moſt of all their living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
which by Gods law is due unto them: and makes them
go oftimes with a bare and thin garment.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>David</hi> ſending to meet his ſervants, who were
ſore aſhamed of their abuſe: and directing them to ſtay at <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
till their beards grew, and then to returne: ſhewes his tender
ſympathy towards them, and care to comfort and councell them
the beſt way: till he thereafter ſhould repare the injury; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſhewes a good and imitable example of a loving Prince to
his loyall ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. It is ſaid, that when the Children of <hi>Ammon,
ſaw that they ſtank before David,</hi> they prepared for warres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it had been more wiſely done, to reſent their errour, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
reparation, and ſought reconcilement: but herein we ſee
it to be true, <hi>quos deus vult perdere iis mentem adimit,</hi> and that
the wicked in Gods juſt judgment, runnes ever further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into ſnares and miſchiefe, going from ill to worſe. Satan
ſo drives them, as we ſee in <hi>Pharaoh, Judas</hi> and others; till they
come to utter deſtruction: and God in his ſecret juſtice hereby
meaning to puniſh their idolatry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:119120:82"/>
15. This fact of theirs, <hi>made them ſtink before David,</hi> and to
be hatefull, and abhorred by him. Then much more doth ſinne,
and abuſe of Gods meſſengers make men ſtink before God, and
to be hated and abhorred by him.</p>
                  <p>16. Upon this, that was done to <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants in their
beards, and garments (though no hurt was done to their perſons,)
we ſee beſide expence of treaſure, what bloody warres enſue.
Which ſhewes, of ſmall beginnings (as ſuſpition firſt, and then
ill Counſell, and thereafter this abuſe) what great miſchiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,
and therefore how warily we ſhould take heed to our words
and actions, the mother of miſchiefe (as the proverb ſaies)
<hi>not being greater than a midge wing, and that greateſt trees do grow
from the ſmalleſt ſeeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. <hi>David</hi> is againſt his will, and beyond his expectation for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to new warres. Which teaches, that no man may dreame
of long peace or proſperity, but when he lookes for greateſt peace
and tranquillity, as <hi>David</hi> did, when he ſent this meſſage, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
trouble and diſquiet may enſue, ſo mutable and uncertain is
our eſtate here.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>David</hi> revenges this wrong done to his ſervants by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
warres, the rule whereof is the puniſhment of ſinne, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
committed againſt God, and the Republick: and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
by the Authority of the lawfull Magiſtrate; this being
a part of the right uſe of the ſword, which is committed to him,
againſt the errour of the Anabaptiſts.</p>
                  <p>19. We ſee alſo here, that actions are not to be meaſured or
cenſured by their events, for <hi>Davids</hi> ſending to comfort <hi>Hanun</hi>
for his Father, was laudable and good: though ſad events fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
thereon, by the miſconſtruction of this his pious action
by thoſe who meaſured him by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>20. The <hi>Ammonites</hi> by hyring the <hi>Syrians</hi> to aſſiſt them. We
ſee, they confide in the arme of fleſh, and in their wealth and
confederacy, and therefore we ſee what was the end of ſuch vain
confidence: and as is ſhewne, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. And by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
regiſtred both in ſacred and prophane hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Ammon</hi> is joyned to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in conſanguinity by <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119120:83"/>
merits, nor oath has any place when they have occaſion to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>David.</hi> Whereon we obſerve, that it is impoſſible that the
true worſhippers of God can have firme or long peace with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.
The reaſon whereof is aſſigned by Chriſt, <hi>There can be
no agreement between God and Belial.</hi> The proof whereof is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
by infinite examples, and this in particular. Which ſhewes
to for-warne all ſuch who ſerve God, and feare him truly, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no quietneſs nor ſecurity from Idolaters, and Papiſts lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then they may have a fit occaſion to execute their cruelty, as
the <hi>Maſſacre of Paris, the Gun-powder-treaſon,</hi> and the late <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
of Proteſtants in Ireland</hi> can teſtify.</p>
                  <p>22. The <hi>Syrians</hi> for hire, joyne with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect either to honour, conſcience, danger, or death, that
might enſue, only for commodity. Which ſhewes that covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is the root of all evill, and produces ſad effects: as we ſee in
<hi>Achan, Judas,</hi> and theſe <hi>Syrians</hi> here. Which ſerves to warne men
to beware thereof, and ſpecially men who follow the warres, that
they engage upon warrant of conſcience, and a good cauſe, and
not meerly for hyre, or preferment: the one flowing from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
and the other from pride, and both from Satan, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe vices.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. In <hi>Davids</hi> preparation to meet the <hi>Ammonites</hi>
when he heard of their raiſing an Army. We ſee the vigilant care
that a good King ſhould have of the ſafety of his people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
their enemies, and of uſing lawfull meanes, beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in God.</p>
                  <p>24. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. In <hi>Joab's</hi> managing of this warre. We ſee wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
joyned with valour, both requiſite in a generall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and in the mutuall ſupport and help one of another, againſt
the common enemy, the ſtronger to help the weaker. We may
alſo learne a common Chriſtian duty to do the like, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
exhorts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. The rich to help the poore, and the
wiſe the ſimple, &amp;c. Eſpecially paſtours, and leaders of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to joyne as brethren in Unity, and lend their help one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
againſt their common enemy.</p>
                  <p>25. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. In <hi>Joabs</hi> oration to his Army, he joynes with
ſelfe-preſervation, the cauſe of religion (for the Cities of God)
that is, wherein Gods worſhip is eſtabliſhed and profeſſed, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119120:83"/>
which the enemies would pollute with idolatry, as the <hi>Romans</hi>
uſed to ſay <hi>pro aris &amp; focis.</hi> Whereby we ſee that in all lawfull
warres the cauſe of God, (who is the Lord of hoſtes and gives
the ſucceſs) and of religion is to be regarded, and then (as we
ſee here) the event proves the more proſperous and happy.</p>
                  <p>26. <hi>Joab</hi> here does according to his vocation, and leaves
the ſucceſs to God. Whereupon we collect, that the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one in his calling civill, or eccleſiaſticall is to labour faithfully,
and to commit the ſucceſs to God, as the husband man does in
ſowing his ground, and as <hi>Paul</hi> did plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> watered,
and left the grouth unto Gods diſpenſation. Which ſerves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
two errours; the firſt of thoſe who uſe not the lawfull means,
but relye on Gods providence, and live on idle ſpeculations. The
ſecond, who relye only on the means, without ſeeking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the Lords bleſſing on their labours.</p>
                  <p>27. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. The ſucceſs of the battle, which is victory on

1. What is the end of giving, and taking evill counſell, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy
in evill courſes on <hi>Ammons</hi> part, as alſo what is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of perjury and perfidy, as alſo of coveteouſneſs on the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
part. 2. The victory in <hi>Davids</hi> ſide ſerves for the comfort
of the Godly, that are in a good courſe, and have a good cauſe,
though in greateſt perills of enemies, and that it is juſt that they
who abuſe favours, ſhould ſmart at laſt with judgments.</p>
                  <p>28. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. The <hi>Syrians</hi> gather themſelves againe to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the ſecond time, to their greater deſtruction and fall, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
overthrow. Whereby we ſee what it is to perſiſt obſtinately
and proceed in an ill courſe, and that thereby they draw on upon
themſelves greater deſtruction: for they might have ſeen Gods
hand againſt themſelves before, when they were ſubdued, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.
As alſo now againe, when they were ſtronger, being joyned with
<hi>Ammon:</hi> but Satan ſo blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts
like <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> that no bygone puniſhments would make them wiſe,
being driven on by Satan to their own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>29. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. At laſt being overthrowne, they make peace
with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in granting whereof after ſo many provocations, and
perfidie, beſide this laſt victory, we ſee the peaceable and pious
diſpoſition of <hi>David,</hi> as alſo his noble and royall inclination, like

their late confederates, who hired them the <hi>Ammonites,</hi>
whom they reſolve not to help any more. Whereby we obſerve

               <p>In the expoſition of this tragicall hiſtory we ſhall conſider,
1. The circumſtances of time, places, and perſons, when,
where, and betwixt whom this Action is committed. 2. The
occaſion and antecedents of this ungodly fact, both on <hi>Davids</hi>
and the womans part. 3. The fact it ſelfe, adultery, and that of
the higheſt kind. 4. The conſequence and things coincident
with it, and fiftly lay down ſome obſervations, that ariſe there
from.</p>
               <p>Among the genuine circumſtances, that of time comes firſt,
expreſſed <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. When the yeare was expired, at the time when
Kings go forth to battle: that is, at the end of the former yeare,
and beginning of the yeare following: at which time the heavens
and aire beginne to be temperate, and the paſtures afford graſs for
horſes, which made the ſeaſon convenient for warre. Then <hi>David</hi>
had directed <hi>Joab,</hi> (whileſt himſelfe abode at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) with
the Army to go againſt <hi>Ammon,</hi> whom he deſtroyed, and beſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119120:84"/>
                  <hi>Rabbah,</hi> their <hi>Metropolitan</hi> City, called afterwards by the

and all his troubles neer an end, in place of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
to God therefore, he gives himſelf to eaſe, ſecurity and
uncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>2. The place, is his Palace, and plateform, or roof of his houſe,
from whence he beholds with luſting heart, and eye, <hi>Bathſheba</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Vriah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Perſons are <hi>David</hi> a great and godly King before,
whoſe life and manners were ſometimes a mirrour to his ſubjects,
and called <hi>a man according to Gods own heart,</hi> and who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
in his warres with externall Enemies, yet is overcome in
the battle betwixt the fleſh and the Spirit, and by his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and inward Enemy of his carnall corruption, as <hi>Lot</hi> was in
<hi>Zoar,</hi> who could not be overcome in the City of <hi>Sodom.</hi> The
ſecond perſon is <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> the Wife of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> called,

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> himſelf, called a <hi>Hittite,</hi> becauſe he was a ſtranger borne

<hi>Vers</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the antecedent cauſes which moves this ungodly
and unhoneſt fact, are as well on <hi>Davids</hi> part, as on the Womans.
On his part their be chiefly four. 1. His great proſperity, which
brings him to a careles ſecurity, as well in matters concerning
God, as in his office to the Republicke, the evidence whereof
is, that afternoone he gives himſelf to ſleep, and eaſe, when hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
ſubjects are in danger of their Enemies, farre contrary to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
care and duty. 2. His idleneſſe, Satans cuſhion and Mother
of all vices, and the ſinne of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as it is ſaid? <hi>Diuturna quies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis
alimenta miniſtrat.</hi> And eſpecially to uncleanneſſe, therefore
ſayes the Poet, <hi>quaeritur Egeſtus, quare ſit factus adulter? in prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptu
cauſa eſt, deſidioſus erat.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, <hi>otia ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
periêre Cupidinis arcus.</hi> 3. The looſneſſe and luſt of his eyes
looking with delight and concupiſcence upon the beauty of the
Woman, contrary to <hi>Jobs</hi> practiſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 1. And that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Gods to turne away our eyes from vanity, Chriſt tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us alſo <hi>that to look upon a Woman and to luſt after her,</hi> (though
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119120:85"/>
no more) <hi>is adultery for God.</hi> 4. The object of the eye, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
beauty. In it ſelf being good and the gift of God, as we ſee
in <hi>Joſeph, Moſes, David, Eſther Sarah Rebecca, Rachel</hi> and others,
but being abuſed either to pride, as in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> or to turpitude
as in <hi>Davids</hi> practiſe, and <hi>Potiphars</hi> Wifes, to be inſnared thereby,
or to inſnare, it turnes to ſuch a curſe, and drawer on of moſt
heavy judgments.</p>
               <p>In the Woman likewiſe we ſee theſe occaſions. 1. Immodeſty
in diſcovering her nakedneſſe, and waſhing herſelf in an open
view of the Kings pallace, which rather ſhould have been done in
her private Chamber. 2. Facility in yielding to <hi>Davids</hi> motion of
uncleanneſſe. 3. Arrogancy, counting it an honour to be courted
by a King, and to be his Concubine. 4. Breach of duty and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to her honeſt Husband. And 5. lubricity and ſinnefull frailty
was ſeen in the fact.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the act it ſelf was double adultery, a married man
with a married woman; alſo the man, a King who ſhould have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
good example to his ſubjects, as is ſaid, <hi>Regis ad exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum,
&amp;c.</hi> As likewiſe a Prophet, and ſo <hi>ſhould have been eminent
beyond others in holineſſe.</hi> And one who had not only one wife,
but many wives and Concubines, as <hi>Nathan</hi> told him. All which
aggravates this fact of his adultery.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the conſequence was, the matter is revealed by <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba</hi>
to <hi>David</hi> of her being with Child. Who ſtrives by many
wayes to cover his adultery. 1. Subtily by ſending for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi>
and moving him by indirect inticements to colour his crime. 2. By

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> to him, who now was at
the ſiege of <hi>Rabbah.</hi> 2. When he comes, <hi>David</hi> in all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy,
as intending to know by him how affaires went, he asks
of the eſtate of the Captain, and Army; and then intreats him more
familiarly, not after the manner of Kings, <hi>to waſh his feet,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in the Hebrew phraſe was ſignified, all which belongs to a
mans entertainment and eaſe, and ſo to viſit his houſe: and for
the more inducement he ſends after him a meſſe of his own meat.
But good <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> being governed by Gods providence, reſts that
night in the Kings gardhouſe. 3. Which when <hi>David</hi> perceives,
he uſes another ſlight, and feaſts him, and makes him drunk,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119120:85"/>
thinking thereby to make him lie with his wife, and ſo to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to a baſtard, or as the Law calls it, <hi>Partus ſuppoſitus,</hi> and
bring in an unlawfull heir into the inheritance of <hi>

worthy <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> guided by Gods Spirit, diſappoints this policy
of the King alſo, <hi>David</hi> by his worldly wiſdome and authority
thinking to colour vice, but God reſolving to bring it to light;
and therefore at even went out to lie on his bed with the ſervants
of <hi>David,</hi> but went not down to his houſe at all. Whereupon
<hi>David</hi> writes with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> to <hi>Joab,</hi> directing how he ſhould be

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> is killed:
and <hi>David</hi> advertiſed thereof; which when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> Wife under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands,
ſhe mourneth for him, and is thereafter taken by <hi>David</hi> to
Wife, and beares him a Son, but this thing diſpleaſed the Lord.</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. BY theſe falls of <hi>David, Peter</hi> and the like, let not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
themſelves in their ſinnes, for they are regiſtred not
for imitation, or excuſe of the like; but as Beacons for evitation,
and their repentance onely for imitation, <hi>Et ut majorum ruina
ſit minorum cautela,</hi> and that the beſt may ſee, how weak they
are, and how prevalent their naturall and ſinfull corruption will
be, if they be left never ſo little to themſelves, and to the force of
temptation, which finds time to lay ſiege to the ſecure heart of
<hi>David</hi> in his houſe, and ſurpriſes it, while <hi>Joab</hi> is laying ſiege to
<hi>Rabbah</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> in the field to take it.</p>
                  <p>2. If ſuch a ſtrong and tall Cedar as <hi>David</hi> did fall, how ought
weaker Chriſtians to fear, and pray; that God would deliver
them from temptation, and as we are exhorted, 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 12. <hi>To
work out our own ſalvation with fear, and trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. When <hi>David</hi> after divers Victories is now in peace
by the mercy of his God, he falls to fighting againſt God himſelf,
when he has ſubdued many nations to his great credit abroad,
to his farre greater ſhame, he is ſubdued by, and inſlaved unto his
own filthy luſt. Whereby we ſee, that proſperity is more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then adverſity, &amp; that ſanctified correction is more profitable,
then a proſperous condition, with a remiſſion of Gods aſſiſting
grace 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. <hi>&amp;</hi> 71. And as is further ſhewn to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
                  <p>4. We ſee that boſome Enemies, of our own ſinfull corruption
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119120:86"/>
and concupiſcence, are the worſt and moſt dangerous, like <hi>Dalilah</hi>
and <hi>Judas</hi> ready to betray us, and ſubdue us to them. Thus <hi>Saul</hi>
who at firſt overcame the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> was overcome thereafter by
his own pride, envy and cruelty, <hi>Sampſon</hi> by his luſt after ſo many
noble victories as alſo here, <hi>David</hi> is ſubdued by his carnall luſt.
5. <hi>V.</hi> 2. When <hi>David</hi> is idle and at eaſe not fighting the battles of
the Lord, nor miniſtring juſtice to his people, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 15.
Then Satan prevailes againſt him. Which teaches every one to be
diligently exerciſed in ſome lawfull and particular calling, if they
would eſchew temptation, and the ſnares of the Divell.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>David</hi> from the roof of his houſe beholds the beauty of
<hi>Bathſheba</hi> waſhing herſelf, and is inſnared. Which ſhould teach us
to watch, over our ſenſes that they be not like open doors to let in
temptations to our hearts, as we ſee by the eye and care Satan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the heart of <hi>Eve,</hi> by the eye likewiſe he entred into the
hearts of the <hi>Sons of God, who ſaw the daughters of men and took of
them to wives,</hi> which brought the deluge on the firſt world, ſo did
temptation enter into the heart of <hi>Potiphars</hi> Wife, into <hi>Achans</hi>
heart, and here into <hi>Davids.</hi> Whereas <hi>Jobs</hi> practiſe was contrary,
<hi>Job</hi> 31. 1.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Bathſheba's</hi> waſhing herſelf in ſo publicke a place gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of committing uncleanneſſe with her, &amp; of the murther of her
Husband. Which ſhould teach modeſty, and care to all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to eſchew the occaſions of ſin, &amp; that they make not their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty,
or curtizan dreſſings, or any other unſeemly behaviour to be
ſnares to uncleanneſſe, but that they be of a chaſt converſation,
coupled with fear, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2, 3. And whoſe adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may not be that outward of platting the hair, &amp; of wearing of
gold, or of putting on of apparell, but the hidden man of the heart,
in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek &amp;
quiet ſpirit, which in the ſight of God is of great price, &amp; to make
that diſcription of a vertuous woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 10 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A patterne

9. In this fact of <hi>Davids</hi> we ſee alſo the progreſſe of ſin till it
come to the higheſt perfection. 1. He is idle, then beholds a
woman waſhing herſelf, and luſts after her, becauſe of her beauty,
thereafter ſends and brings her, and at laſt he lies with her, as is
ſaid, <hi>hanc vidit, viſamque ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we ſee alſo in <hi>Achons</hi> ſacriledge, whereby we ſhould learn
to reſiſt the beginnings of ſin, to cruſh the Cockatrice in the egg,
and daſh <hi>Babels</hi> babes againſt the ſtones, choaking the ſeeds of ſin
in the bryer before it come to a ripe harveſt of guiltineſſe, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a harveſt of wrath.</p>
                  <p>10. It is ſaid that ſhe was purified from her uncleaneſſe, which
was Ceremoniall onely, but in the mean while ſhe was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a morall uncleaneſſe, to keep herſelf free from which ſhe was
not ſo carefull, being herein like the <hi>Phariſees who cleanſed the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the cup onely,</hi> and were like painted tombs. But had much
hid uncleaneſſe and corruption within, as there are likewiſe many
now adayes who content with an outward formality and ſhew
of Religion, who otherwiſe deny the power thereof.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Vers</hi> 8. <hi>David</hi> labours firſt with all ſubtilty to cover his
ſin from the eyes of the World, but conſiders not what this
would avail, when the all ſeeing God did know the ſame, and
whom he ſhould rather feare then man, ſeeing <hi>he has power both
of ſoul and body,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>to caſt both in Hell fire.</hi>
Therefore let no man ſin in ſecret, and think all is well if it be
concealed from men. For either God diſcovers it here, as he did
<hi>Davids,</hi> or elſe at the day of his account and judgment before
men and Angels, as he ſhewes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>For there is nothing

                  </p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Davids</hi> diſſembled kindneſſe to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and his meſſe of

Daughter for the ſame end was given to himſelf, and as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
diſſembled kindneſſe to <hi>Eve</hi> was to be a ſnare to her.
Even ſo the baits of unlawfull profite, or pleaſure, which Satan
holds out, they are but ſnares to intrap men in guiltineſſe.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> ſheweth a godly and tender ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with the Lords people and <hi>Joab,</hi> who with the Arke
were lying in tents, and in the open fields, and therefore he would
not take eaſe and daliance with his Wife. Which ſhould teach us
the like ſympathy with the Church of God in danger and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
and <hi>to regard the affliction of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. As we
ſee was the practiſe of <hi>Nehemiah, Daniel, Eſther</hi> and others, farre
contrary to yours, who if themſelves be well and at eaſe, they care
not for the diſtreſſe of Gods people and Church. As alſo we ſee,
as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. That there is a fit time for every thing, and that even
Lawfull and beſt actions are not ever ſeaſonable, therefore it is
ſaid, <hi>That a word ſpoken in due ſeaſon is like apples of gold with

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> ſayes to <hi>David</hi> that he would not do that

being inflamed with Wine, wherein alſo he is again diſappointed,
wherein <hi>David</hi> for covering one ſin falls into many, and which
we ſee to be the practiſe of Satan by one ſin to draw on men to
another, as from drunkenneſſe to draw to whoredome, or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and from unjuſt anger to draw to murther, as he did <hi>Cain,</hi>
and the like he does by covetouſneſſe. As we ſee in <hi>Judas.</hi>

may ſometimes fail and fall into ſin and exceſſe, as we ſee in <hi>Noah,</hi>

trade of ſin, and if they fall throw frailty, they riſe by grace, and
their faults are not regiſtred (as is ſaid) for imitation, but to be

OBSERVATIONS.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>DAvid</hi> now ſends a letter with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> to <hi>Joab</hi> to ſet
him in the front of the battle, that he might be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Where we ſee (as has been ſaid) that from one ſin he falls in
another, and in the laſt as the worſt of all, whereby we obſerve.
1. The nature of ſin that it never goes alone, but is like a chain
one link whereof is tyed to another. 2. That Satan where he
may once get in a foot will never reſt, till he get in his whole
body. And 3. we ſee that oftimes God puniſhes ſin by ſin, and
man by his own iniquity till there cup be full, and then followes
judgment, as we ſee in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> carries with him the letter to <hi>Joab</hi> which was his own
deſtruction, and ſo does the wicked carry in the boſome of their
own breaſt, there dittay and accuſation, of their own guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
before God in the day of their account, which in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner
is their owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>David</hi> began to cover his ſin by ſubtilty and fraud, and now
he comes from fraud to force and cruelty. Thus doth Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
act, firſt as an inſinuating and ſubtile Serpent, and who can
transforme himſelf into an Angel of light to deceive, and hereby
if he cannot prevail he turnes a bloody Dragon, by open perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as we ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. And thus to do he teaches others
whom he miſleads, as he did <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and in this place <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Hereby likewiſe we ſee that in the beſt of men their are the
ſeeds, and a naturall inclination to the groſſeſt ſins, <hi>all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the heart being onely evill continually,</hi> which ſhould ſerve
to keep us humble, and watchfull, and to be earneſt with God by
prayer for grace and ſtrength to reſiſt the temptations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
that we be not inſnared to commſit ſins, which otherwiſe we
would ſeem to abhorre in others.</p>
               <p>5. We ſee, as in this, ſo that adultery and unlawfull luſts is
the chief argument of all tragicall Hiſtories almoſt, as we may
ſee in the examples of the firſt World. <hi>Sodom, Sechem, Iſrael</hi>
with the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Women in the deſart, the warres between
<hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Benjamin, Sampſon,</hi> and here in the example of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119120:88"/>
                  <hi>David,</hi> omitting prophane Hiſtories, as the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,
Thebes, Carthage</hi> and others, which teaches us that whoredome
is not ſo light a ſin, as carnall men take it to be, who call it but a
trick of yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th, or the like, ſeeing we ſee it puniſhed with ſuch ſad
judgements here, and excluding from the Kingdome of Heaven
hereafter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 15.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Vers</hi> 16. As <hi>David</hi> directed <hi>Joab,</hi> ſo he obeyed this wicked
direction of the King, and ſo becomes guilty likewiſe of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> (which was avenged on him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 28.)
Which ſhould teach us, not to obey the unjuſt commandments
of ſuperiours, but as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29. We ought to obey ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God than man, and to give unto God that which is Gods,
and then to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> that which is <hi>Ceſars.</hi> Honour alſo is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> but death is meant, ſo doth Satan in his
temptations.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> an innocent man ſuffers and is killed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we obſerve, that it is not ever the will of God to give tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
deliverance, from the cruelty of Tyrants, or of Enemies,
as we ſee in the examples of the Prophets, Apoſtles and Martyrs,
the reaſon is, that thereby God will be glorified in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
integrity, good example of the like may be left behind them,
God may have juſt matter to puniſh Tyranny and cruelty, &amp; the
innocent ſufferers may be tranſlated to a better life in glory.</p>
               <p>8. We ſee in this fact firſt of uncleaneſſes, next of <hi>Davids</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
and laſt of cruelty, whereunto he was inſtigated by Satan
the properties of the Divell, that he is an unclean Spirit, full of
ſubtilty and cruelty, and that he makes them who obey him,
to take on his image, and to be like himſelf.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Vers</hi> 26. <hi>Batſheba</hi> mournes for her Husband when ſhe
hears of his death, as for a Worldly loſſe, but we reade not
that ſhe mourned for her ſinne that procured his death, which
ſhews that many will be more grieved for any Worldly loſſe, or
croſſe, then for that which ſhould grieve them moſt, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of God, the killing of their own ſouls, and the loſſe of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Kingdome, her ſinne then was more worthy of her ſorrow
then her loſſe.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Vers</hi> 27. Where it is ſaid; that the thing which <hi>David</hi>
had done diſpleaſed the Lord, which ſhould teach us the like
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119120:88"/>
diſpoſition to be ever diſpleaſed with ſinne in any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
and to hate the ſame: it being Satans image, but not to
hate the perſon who is created to the image of God, as the Lord
hated not <hi>Davids</hi> perſon, but his ſinfull action. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
affirmes <hi>That the end of excommunication</hi> (the laſt of diſcipline)
<hi>ſhould be to the deſtruction of ſinne, but that the ſoule may be pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119120:89"/>
his commiſſion to <hi>Nathan,</hi> and not that <hi>David</hi> ſeeks to God firſt,
by any act of his free will: but God by his preventing grace ſeeks
<hi>David,</hi> who had gone aſtray like a loſt ſheep, and followes him
with tender mercy to reclame him, and bring him back againe,
therefore faies Gods people, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Turne thou us unto thee,
O Lord, and we ſhall be turned.</hi> Next, the Lord doth this not
immediatly, but by the Miniſtry of his Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> with
which he did concurre by the ſecret operation of his ſpirit, and
converting grace: which is his uſuall dealing in reclaiming of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
whereby he gives repentance: as we ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. And
begets faith in their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. The impulſive cauſe of
this, next to the forenamed efficient and inſtrumentall, is Gods
free love, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. Without, yea, againſt <hi>Davids</hi> deſerving:
and the finall is, the glory of the riches of Gods mercy, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>

the Jawes of the Lyon) ſo he out of the power and pawes of the

               <p>The cauſe alſo wherefore the Lord did not ſend and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<hi>David</hi> ſooner, and before he did fall. Is, 1. That he would
let him have a proof of his own naturall corruption, and ſee how
ſoone and fouly he would fall, being left to himſelfe: and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſiſted by his ſpeciall grace; that ſo he might ever walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
watch carefully, and pray for grace more earneſtly. 2. That
others might with the greater feare and trembling work out their
own ſalvation: conſidering how ſo great a Cedar ſell, they being
but low ſhrubs. 3. That the greater glory and riches of his grace
and mercy might appeare, in his converſion and pardon: tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo none may diſpaire, either of pardon to themſelves if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or of the converſion of others in Gods own time.</p>
               <p>In this coming of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and excepting ſo perilous
a commiſſion, to ſo great a King, with a ſharp accuſation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion;
and commination, as we ſee his laudable and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obedience to God. So likewiſe we ſee. 1. His prudence in the
forming of his accuſation and rebuke: the ſcope whereof was to
make <hi>David</hi> out of his own mouth to pronounce ſentence againſt
himſelfe, therefore he propones it by way of parable. 2. We ſee
his dexterity in the amplification. 3. His courage and boldneſs
in the application. And 5. His fidelity in the denunciation.</p>

In this parable which he uſes, <hi>David</hi> is compared with the

To this generall as it was proponed, <hi>David</hi> anſwers with an oath,

Whereupon the Prophet makes a plaine application, ſaying, <hi>Thou

<hi>David</hi> himſelfe. thou ſaies, that ſuch a wicked and mercileſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender

die. Hereafter he aggravates <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne by many amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
1. From the argument of ingratitude, in repetition of Gods
benefits, formerly beſtowed upon him: and his readineſs to have
beſtowed more. 2. After this he ſets down the root of the ſinne
to be the contempt of God and his Word: which he amplifies
by the repetition, and particular accuſation of <hi>David</hi> of theſe
crimes. 1. That he had killed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> with the ſword. 2. Had
taken his wife to be his. And 3. That he had killed <hi>

the ſword of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> the common enemy of the
Lords people, and made them to be the inſtruments of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,

                  <p>1. IN this hiſtory of <hi>Davids</hi> riſing by repentance after his fall,
we ſee the difference between the Godly and the wicked,
they fall, but by grace they riſe again: but the wicked they fall,
and lye ſtill in impenitency and careleſs ſecurity, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Cain,</hi> the firſt world, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. In the Lords ſending <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David</hi> ſleeping

and <hi>Paul</hi> from a perſecutor. And that as our Saviour ſaies
to the obſtinate <hi>Jewes, How faine would I have gathered you as a
Henne doth her Chickens under her wings, but yee would not.</hi> So
how faine the Lord is to reclaime ſinners.</p>
                  <p>3. In the work of <hi>Davids</hi> converſion, inſtrumentally by the
Miniſtry of <hi>Nathan,</hi> and efficatiouſly by the concurrance and
cooperation of Gods ſpirit: we ſee that the Miniſtry of the Word,
is the ordinary meanes, by which the Lord will have men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from ſinne and damnation, to righteouſneſs and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
ſo that it is a great bleſſing where men injoy theſe meanes,
and profit thereby: as it is a great curſe and puniſhment, when
either the Lord removes the candleſtick thereof out of his place,
as he threatned <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2. 5. Or where the Miniſtry of the
Word is contemned: as we ſee, 2 <hi>Chron. laſt,</hi> 15. 16. Or where it
is unprofitable, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 6. and 20. 8.</p>
                  <p>4. With the externall Miniſtry of the Word and meanes of
converſion, we ſhould earneſtly beſeech God to concurre with
the operation of his bleſſed ſpirit to make the ſame powerfull, and
thereby to work in our hearts repentance and faith, elſe as <hi>Peter</hi>
fiſhed all night and caught nothing till Chriſt came: ſo <hi>Peter</hi> may
preach and not prevaile, till the hearts of his hearers be pricked
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119120:90"/>
by him who opened the heard of <hi>Lydia,</hi> while <hi>Paul</hi> did preach,
<hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>For Paul may plant and Apollos water, but God only
giveth the increaſe.</hi> And <hi>Nathan</hi> here might carry the Lords

                  <p>5. It is ſaid here, that the Lord ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> where
we obſerve the duty of all faithfull Miniſters of Gods Word, not
to runne unſent, or ruſh into that ſacred calling (as many do)

as he did, (though it would have ſeemed dangerou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

many ſingular vertues requiſite in the Miniſters of Gods
Word. As 1. Obedience to the Lords call, though the burthen
of the Miniſtry, and charge of ſoules, may ſeem juſtly formidable
to Angels, let be weak men. 2. Wiſdome in the diſcharge of their
meſſage, and in doing that which may beſt faſten a conviction
on the conſcience of ſinners, and bring them to a ſight of their
ſinne. 3. After generall doctrine to bring in the ſame to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
application, as the Chirurgian after the making of the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
doth apply the ſame to the ſore. 4. Courage and fidelity,
not only in the rebuking of ſinne, though in the greateſt without
partiality, but in denouncing Gods judgments againſt every ſort
of ſinne, whereof they have warrant in the threatnings that are
contained in the Word of God. 5. (As we ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) where
they ſee evidence of repentance, and humble confeſſion to be as
ready to comfort, as before to have rebuked and threatned, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
herein <hi>Pauls</hi> direction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. And our Saviours
practiſe <hi>Who would not brake a bruiſed reed, nor quench a ſmoaking
flax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. It is ſaid that <hi>Davids</hi> anger was greatly kindled
againſt the man, of whom <hi>Nathan</hi> ſpake in the parable, who had
done ſuch wrong to his poore neighbour: and declares that he

                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>David</hi> is ſevere in judging, and cenſuring another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the application of the parable, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. He is only guilty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
which ſhewes that oftimes men are like the <hi>Phariſe's,</hi> who
were clear-ſighted to <hi>ſpye the mote in their neighbours eye, but blind
in ſpying the beame that was in their own,</hi> or like <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> 38.
24. Who gave out a ſevere ſentence againſt <hi>Tamar</hi> for his whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
when he thought that it had been with another, till he
heard and knew thereafter that it was with himſelfe: which
ſhewes the deceitfulneſs of the heart of men, our own ſelf-love,
and hypocriſie, who ſhould rather ſearch themſelves, and their
own ſtuffe what is in them, and to judge themſelves, that they
might not be judged: (<hi>Omni enim vitio debet carere, qui in
alterum paratus eſt dicere,</hi>) rather than to be ſevere juſtitiers
in others, of the very crimes whereof they are guilty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Where <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaies, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> We ſee
that particular application is neceſſary, when men are not moved
or touched with generalls, ſo that the ſame be done wiſely for
the good of a ſinner his converſion, and not out of humour or
malice againſt the perſon: but out of love to the man, and only
hatered to his vice, which would be his ſelf-deſtroyer: and ſuch
prudent rebukes, ſeaſonable given, and particular applications, are
like medicinall potions, or wholeſome corraſives, neceſſary for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
health: though to fleſh and blood, bitter and ſharp: and
muſt be ſometimes applyed as the caſe requires by their ſoules
Phyſitian, as we ſee here in <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 6, 7.
And which is a part of the cutting the Word a right, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.
16. And the very life of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>10. In <hi>Nathans</hi> rehearſall of the Lords benefits to <hi>David,</hi> we
are taught what uſe we ſhould make of the benefits which the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119120:91"/>
Lord beſtoweth upon us: towit, we ſhould not only remember
them continually as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103, 2. And chiefly his ſpirituall
benefits, as there: but likewiſe they ſhould be to us, like ſo many
love-cords, to bind us to his obedience, which is the only true
and reall evidence of our thankfulneſs for them.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Nathan</hi> ſhewes to <hi>David,</hi> that by his ſinne he
had deſpiſed the commandment of the Lord, whereby he ſhewes
what is the very root of ſinne: towit, the deſpiſing of the Lords
commandments. Which if men did regard as they ought, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
whoſe commandments they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even his, who has power
both of ſoule and body, to caſt both in hell fire: and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
whereof they are bound by ſo many tyes: they would
not deſpiſe, nor break them as they do; eſpecially ſeeing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
of them, they deſpiſe alſo the Lord himſelfe: as we ſee,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 10. and how high a crime this is, a worme of the earth, to
deſpiſe the God of heaven, any one may judge, and what the
ſame deſerves, and yet ſinners are ſo blind, and misbelieving, that
if this were laid to their charge, that they are deſpiſers of God,
none would confeſs the ſame.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Nathan</hi> likewiſe tells <hi>David</hi> in the aggravating of his ſin,
that he was not only ungratefull, &amp; a deſpiſer of Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but a bold tranſgreſſour, in doing this evill in Gods ſight;
this being the blind boldneſs of all other ſinners and wicked men:
even when they commit ſinne ſecretly, as <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaies to <hi>David,
verſ.</hi> 12. Yet they do it in the ſight of God, whoſe all-ſeeing eye
beholdeth them, and all-reaching hand ſhall find them out, and
what boldneſs, yea deſperation, dacity would this be thought,
for a theefe to ſteale, even in the ſight of the judge? but hence
is it, that men ſinne ſo ſecurely, becauſe they think <hi>God to be like
the Idols who have eyes, and ſee not,</hi> or that he is not all-ſeeing, and
when they ſinne, that they are doing evill in his ſight.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Nathan</hi> alſo layeth this to <hi>Davids</hi> charge, that he had
killed <hi>Vriah,</hi> though it was their <hi>Ammonites</hi> that killed him: as
we ſee in this ſame verſe; becauſe <hi>David</hi> had written to <hi>Joab,</hi> to
ſet <hi>Vriah</hi> in the fore-front of the battle before <hi>Rabbah,</hi> and to
retire from him that he might be killed, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 15. Where
we ſee that the deviſers, counſellours or abetters, in any ſinne
or wickedneſs, or who have any hand in committing thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119120:92"/>
or indirectly, or are airt or pairt (as we ſay) they are
before God guilty of the deed: as we ſee alſo in <hi>Ahabs</hi> murther
of <hi>Naboth,</hi> 1 King. 21. 19. Where it is ſaid, thou haſt killed, and
taken poſſeſſion: though it was, by a formall proceſs of Law, and
the ordinary executioners, ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10, 11. In <hi>Nathans</hi> denunciation of puniſhment
for <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne. We ſee that ſinne draweth ever puniſhment,
as we ſee in our firſt parents, firſt world, <hi>Sodome, Egypt,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
other examples Scripturall, and prophane hiſtories. And
therefore ſinne may be compared to theſe <hi>Locuſts,</hi> Revel. 9. 7, 8.
<hi>Which had mens faces, and the alluring haire of women, but Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
tailes,</hi> verſ. 10. With ſtings that did both hurt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or like that little book, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>Which was ſweet
in the mouth like hony, but bitter in the belly.</hi> Therefore let none
who ſinne, dreame of impunity: how long ſuffering ſoever the
Lords patience be, to ſuffer them for a while, but in the end
reſolve if they eate the ſower grapes, that their teeth ſhall be ſet
on edge. At fartheſt in that place, <hi>where there is weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. Judgment here is denounced againſt <hi>David</hi> a King, from
the Lord as the inflicter. Which ſhewes that albeit Kings and
great men may eſcape puniſhment by men, in reſpect of their
place and power: yet they ſhall not eſcape at the hands of God,
as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Saul,

to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, whereby we ſee, what
advantage the ſcandalous ſinnes of Profeſſours give to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

which ſhould make all Profeſſours of the truth to walke the

and therefore are not to be deſpiſed, as thoſe did of the firſt world,
and others, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. But made uſe of for our humiliation.
2. That ſickneſſe is the Lords rod wherewith he ſtriks either

and remove the Lords temporall judgements, or any corporall
viſitation on our ſelves, or ours, is prayer, and faſting and the
humbling our ſelves before the Lord, as we ſee we are exhorted,
<hi>Joel.</hi> 2. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 14. And was practiſed by <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. And
here, as alſo by the King of <hi>Niniveh, Jonah.</hi> 3. And by others.</p>

to comfort him, as he alſo comforted his Wife, <hi>vers</hi>
24. Which ſhewes unto us that it is a charitable and Chriſtian
duty, to comfort ſuch who are any way afflicted, as we ſee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sonnes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 35. and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Vers</hi> 18. The Childe dies the ſeventh day, before it
could be circumciſed, (as likewiſe being ſicke before) and yet, as
we ſee, <hi>vers</hi> 23. <hi>David</hi> doubts not of the ſalvation thereof, which
ſhewes us that it is not the want of Babtiſme (anſwerable to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
then) that is any way damnable to the infants, (Gods
mercy not being tyed to the outward means,) but it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

ſuch ould be any way profitable to them, as they are not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is true that they are profitable for the maſſe Prieſts who
are living, and who get great gain thereby.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>David</hi> repines not at the Lords doing, but patiently and
humbly acquieſces to his good pleaſure therin, and firſt of all
goes to the houſe of God and worſhips, and thereafter to his
own houſe, and takes bodily refreſhment. Where we ſee how
in likemanner in all eroſſe diſpenſations we ſhould do the like, by
reverencing Gods providence, humbly ſubmitting to his will as
our well, and in all things giving him thanks. And to preferre

only a laudable remembrance of mortality and death in <hi>David,</hi>
but alſo a good reſolution to be imitated by the living towards
the dead of neereſt relations, whether Wivers, Children, or friends,
which ſerves greatly to ſetle immoderate mourning, and the
mindes of ſuch who ſurvive the dead.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Vers</hi> 24. In place of the Childe that dyed, God gives to
<hi>David</hi> another Sonne by <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> who was <hi>Solomon,</hi> which
ſhewes us, what is the fruit of a humbly, patient and thankfull
acquieſcing to Gods will, and that the Lord is ready if he take
one benefit from us, if we depend upon his mercy, to give us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and a better, as we ſee in his dealing with <hi>Job Chap.</hi>
42. 10.</p>
                  <p>15. It is ſaid here of <hi>Solomon</hi> newly born (as is ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi>

that he was loved of God, which ſhewes, (as is ſaid <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4.)
The freedome of Gods love, according to the election by grace,
and that the ſame is onely of his meer mercy and no merit of

or any in high preferment, and which alſo ſhould teach us,
much more in all our actions to be zealous of the honour of God
our heavenly King and Maſter, and of his glory to make it the

ſtood out againſt <hi>David,</hi> and would not make peace

<hi>Ammonites,</hi> &amp; their ſubduing: which had been matter of joy, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
now that which is matter of ſorrow. 2. We have to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the actours firſt in this fact of inceſt, and of the crime it ſelf,
and thereafter we ſhall come to the actours in the murther that
followed thereon: the firſt perſon who is agent in this ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous
crime is <hi>Amnon Davids</hi> eldeſt Sonne, begotten on his
Wife <hi>Ahinoam</hi> the <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> His firſtborne, and ſtrength of his
youth. His delight and hopefull ſucceſſour to him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and he on whom all <hi>Iſrael</hi> looked, as the Sunne riſing
after the death of <hi>David,</hi> and finally whoſe appearing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhould have moved him to follow vertues agreeable to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119120:96"/>
his eſtate: yet he falls into this filthy crime to the diſhonour of
God, griefe of his Father, diſgrace of his Sifter, his own utter
ruine, and the regret of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And in his perſon, (next to
the death of the Child, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 14.) is <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne puniſhed.
The ſecond agent, or rather patient in this crime is <hi>Tamar,</hi> the
Kings daughter: and whoſe mother was daughter to the King of
<hi>Geſhur,</hi> and ſhe <hi>Abſolons</hi> ſiſter german: a virgine, and forced
by <hi>Amnon:</hi> who is deſcribed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Not only by her name, but
alſo from her beauty, whereby <hi>Amnon</hi> was allured ſo to luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her. For fulfilling whereof, he takes that wicked courſe which
followeth: but firſt is ſet down, how this rage of luſt worketh on
himſelfe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 4. That he was ſo vexed, that he fell ſick
for <hi>Tamar,</hi> and waxed leane from day to day: whereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Jonadabs</hi> pernicious counſell, how he ſhould fulfill his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
and ſo he comes in as the third actour in this tragedy and
wicked crime; and is diſcribed, 1. From his name. 2. From his
friendſhip to <hi>Amnon.</hi> 3. From his conſanguinity with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Davids</hi> brothers ſonne: and ſo, they being brothers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
And 4. From his ſubtility, which was ſeen after, like that
of <hi>Achitophels</hi> in his wicked counſell, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. The occaſion
whereof is ſet down, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Towit, his queſtioning <hi>Amnon</hi> why
he waxed leaner daily, being the Kings ſonne, and ſo not having
any probable cauſe to be ſo: and <hi>Amnons</hi> revealing to him that
it was his love to <hi>Tamar,</hi> whereupon enſueth <hi>Jonadabs</hi> perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
counſell, how he might eaſily compaſs his deſire, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.
Which <hi>Amnon</hi> greedily embraces: and does follow, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. By
lying down, and making himſelfe ſick: upon the hearing whereof,
<hi>David</hi> as the fourth actor in this tragedy, out of Fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
coming to viſit <hi>Amnon:</hi> he deſires that his ſiſter <hi>Tamar</hi>
might come, and dreſs him ſome meate, which he might eate from
her hand; whereunto he raſhly and inconſiderately conſents, and
directs his daughter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. to go to <hi>Amnons</hi> houſe, to dreſs
him meat: not conſidering the perill, which might and did enſue:
by reaſon of youth and lubricity of that ſex, where there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
had of enticement and provocation. So that as we ſee the
foure actours in this tragedy, ſo we may ſee the foure antecedent
occaſions provoking and promoting this wicked fact of inceſt:
which are, 1. <hi>Tamars</hi> beauty alluring, and coming to <hi>Amnons</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:119120:97"/>
houſe: whereas abefore ſhe was carefully keeped at home, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cuſtome of Virgins; ſo that as, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Amnon</hi>
thought it hard to come at her, to do any thing unto her. 2.
<hi>Amnons</hi> luſt inraging. 3. <hi>Jonadabs</hi> counſell promoving. And 4.
<hi>Davids</hi> indulgence and facility throw circumvention, conſenting
to <hi>Amnon</hi> his ſonnes petitioning. After this, followeth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the committing of this wicked fact. 1. By removing the
impediments which might hinder, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. Commanding all who
were in his bed-chamber, to go out from him. 2. By intaeating
of her, to lye with him: and when ſhe could not be ſo moved,
but had refuſed. 3. By forcing her, which deniall of her's, and
diſſwading of him, is grounded upon foure arguments. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.
<hi>and</hi> 13. 1. From naturall neareneſs of conſanguinity, <hi>he was her
brother,</hi> and therefore it would be inceſt. 2. From being againſt
the law which makes it <hi>capitall,</hi> Levit. 18. 9. Whereunto <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
Gods people are bound to obey, and therefore to do no ſuch
thing. 3. From the conſequents of this ſinne. 1. That <hi>Amnon</hi>
ſhould be counted a foole in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and ſo, unworthy to reign
after his Father. 2. It ſhould bring not only ſinne, but ſhame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her: which a brother ſhould not wiſh; let be, to be the doer
thereof. And 4. That it were better to ſpeak to the King, to give
her to him in marriage: which (ſhe ſaies) he would not refuſe.
All which arguments have this event, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. 1. He would not
hearken to her. 2. Being ſtronger then ſhe, he forces her, and lyes
with her. Whereupon enſueth theſe ſad ſequells 1. Having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
his luſt, he hates her more then ever he loved her, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.
2. Uncivilly, and unbrotherly, he not only bids her begone, but
alſo commands his ſervant, that waited on him, to put her out
violently, and bolt the dore after her: although ſhe ſhew him
that the doing of this unto her, would be a greater wrong then
the other: becauſe the former might be either covered by ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or cured by future marriage: whereas this diſgracefull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of putting her away, would tend to her ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and make any remedy impoſſible: upon which this his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
uncivill, and unnaturall dealing. 2. She fall's into deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
lamenting, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. Putting aſhes on her head, as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of ſuch was: and tearing her garment, and crying. 3. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi>
her brother, comforts his ſiſter, and receives her into his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119120:97"/>
houſe, where ſhe remained deſolate: but conceives a deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
againſt <hi>Amnon,</hi> for this wrong done to his ſiſter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.
<hi>and</hi> 22. And the fourth ſad ſequell or conſequence, is <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.

                  <p>1. IN this tragicall hiſtory of the performance, what <hi>Nathan</hi>
had threatned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10, 11. We ſee that one jot of
Gods Word, and threatnings ſhall not faile: as we ſee in that of
our firſt parents, the firſt world: againſt the Idolatrous <hi>Jewes,</hi> and
the incredulous in our Saviours time: and here, &amp;c. beware,
then to ſinne, and to hearken to Satan, to put the day of the
Lord farre from us, as he ſaid to our firſt parents, yee ſhall not
dye at all. But by ſpeedy repentance, either to prevent Gods

                  <p>2. Theſe tragicall accidents fall out after that notable victory
over the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> triumphant returne to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
which ſhewes the viciſſitudes that are in this life, as are in
the ſeaſons of that yeare: ſummer and winter, night after day,
ebbing after flowing, and hereafter rejoycing, ſorrowing: no
ſublunary thing being permanent, nor perfit, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be truſted unto, or delighted in, but only in God, and
only to expect elſewhere plenitude of joy and perpetuity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. The motive and inducement to <hi>Amnon</hi> to luſt
after <hi>Tamar,</hi> is her beauty, wherewith he is allured and inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a luſtfull looking thereon, as we read the like, <hi>Gen.</hi>
6. 2. Whereby we ſee, the wrong uſe that many make of the
benefits of God either beſtowed on others, as in the forenamed
examples, or on themſelves, as <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength, <hi>Achitophel's</hi>
wiſedome, <hi>Hamans</hi> preferment, and the like: and that we ſhould
watch over our ſelves, and the uſe of our ſenſes, as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>chap.</hi>
31. 1. For it was no fault in <hi>Tamar</hi> to be beautifull (it being a
good gift if joyned with grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13.) but the fault was
in <hi>Amnon,</hi> luſting thereby: as it is no fault in the candle it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119120:98"/>
but in the flie that ſcorches it ſelfe in the flame, he making
it the occaſion of her diſgrace, and his own ruine. Alſo we ſee,
whither will not luſt carry the inordinate minds of pamper'd and
unruly youth's, if grace do not reſtraine.</p>
                  <p>4. We ſee here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that <hi>Amnon</hi> loved <hi>Tamar,</hi> (not with a
chaſt love, but a luſtfull and unchaſte love.) Where ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes,
towit, at the heart and affections: which are the root
and ſpring, and not being ſanctified, and ſet on the right object
ſends forth rotten and filthy ſtreames, and brings forth wicked
and ill fruit: which ſhould make us to watch over our hearts
with diligence, and to beſeech God to ſanctify our affections, to
love what he loves: and hate, what he hates.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. It is ſaid, <hi>that this unlawfull luſt vexed him, that
he fell ſick:</hi> which ſhewes what an ill gueſt this was, as we ſee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
was to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and pride to <hi>Haman,</hi> and as theſe and
the like vices, are to thoſe who harbour them, and thereby makes
them become like thoſe demoniaks in the Goſpell, before that
Chriſt diſpoſſeſt them, and which ſhall vex them farre worſe
hereafter in eternall torment.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Amnon</hi> likewiſe is ſenſible of the ſickneſs of his body, and
growes leaner day by day, but he was not ſenſible of the ſickneſs
of his ſoule: and ſo are many more. But we ſhould pray to God
that we may be as ſenſible of our ſpirituall ſickneſs, as we are of
our corporall, which ſhould drive us to repentance, and faith to
Chriſt, to heale our back-ſlidings, as we ſee it promiſed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi>
14. 4. But the cauſe why we are not ſenſible of the ſoules ſickneſs,
nor death thereof, is the want of the life of grace, which only
makes the ſoule ſenſible of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>7. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>Tamar</hi> was a Virgine, and <hi>Amnon</hi>
thought it hard for him to do any thing unto her: towit, ſo long
as ſhe was carefully keeped, as Virgins were accuſtomed to be
from acceſs, and private company of men. Which teaches that as
ſinne ſhould be eſchewed, ſo all the occaſions, and provocations
to ſinne, ſhould likewiſe be avoided: which when in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they are neglected, or (as in this example of <hi>Tamars</hi> going
to <hi>Amnons</hi> houſe through <hi>Davids</hi> ſimplicity) afforded. We ſee
in this (as alſo in <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nah's</hi> example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.) what the ſame
through ſinfull corruption, and force of temptation produceth.</p>

                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:119120:98"/>
8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. It is ſaid, that <hi>Anmon</hi> had a friend, named <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
(but who really and truly was his greateſt foe, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
counſell which he gave him, how to ſatisfy his inceſtuous
luſt with his owne ſiſter) ſo that he was rather a friend to his
vice, and a foe to his perſon or ſoule: whereas a true friend,
whoſe friendſhip is grounded on God and vertue, will be a foe
to their friends vice, by wholeſome admonition and rebuke, and
a friend to their ſoules ſalvation: therefore ſaies <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov:
27. 6. <hi>Faithfull are the wounds of a friend, but the kiſſes of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
are deceitfull:</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>He that rebuketh a man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſhall find more favour, then he that flattereth with his
tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. This <hi>Jonadab</hi> alſo is called a very ſubtile man, a property
whereof many do glory, <hi>But their glorying is their ſhame,</hi> for wit
or ſubtilty, without true wiſdome: the beginning whereof is
the feare of God, is but the Serpents property: making men wiſe
only to do evill, as he did <hi>Amnon</hi> here, and as <hi>Achitophel</hi> taught
<hi>Abſolon,</hi> and as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alſo ſpoke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 10. All which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and tended to deſtruction, therefore if we have any quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of wit or qualities of mind, beyond others, let us beſeech
God to ſanctify the ſame, that they prove not a ſnare to us, or
others, as <hi>Joſephs</hi> cup was, which was found in <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſack,
or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah's</hi> letter which he carried with him to <hi>Joab</hi> in his owne
boſome.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Amnon</hi> as readily obayes <hi>Jonadabs</hi> wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
to do evill, as <hi>Jonadab</hi> was to give it, whereby we ſee the
corruption of nature, ready like flax to take with fire: and how
ſoon, youth eſpecially, who feares not God, nor are not truly
wiſe themſelves, are apt to follow rather evill counſell than good,
and flatterers adviſe, nor reall and true friends to their own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and deſtruction: as we ſee here, and in <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. In <hi>Davids</hi> facility and conſent to <hi>Amnons</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Tamar</hi> might come to his houſe and dreſs him meat,
that ſo he might get opportunity to put his wicked intention and
<hi>Jonadabs</hi> counſell to execution, we ſee that the too great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of Parents is the occaſion of Childrens much ſinning, and
in the end of their deſtruction, as we ſee here in <hi>Amnon,</hi> and the
ſonnes of <hi>Eli's,</hi> which ſhould be an admonition to Parents, not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119120:99"/>
be too indulgent to their Children, but to bring them up in aw,
vertue, correction and in the feare of God. Alſo we ſee here
that even Kings daughters in thoſe times, did not ſcorne to put
their fingers to ſome works of houſe wifery, as here in cooking
of meate.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. Where <hi>Amnon</hi> commands that all men ſhould
go out of his chamber before he enterpriſed the fact. We ſee, that
many think ſhame that men ſhould ſee or know that, which they
neither feare, nor are aſhamed, that God ſhould ſee: ſuch is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs
and naturall Atheiſme of the heart of man, therefore
the Scripture tell's us, <hi>That the foole hath ſaid in his heart, that
there is no God,</hi> an example alſo of this we ſee in <hi>Judah,</hi> Gen. 38.
23. That unlawfull acts ſeek the ſhelter of ſecrecy.</p>
                  <p>13. At laſt, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Amnon</hi> diſcovers his intention in his
petition to his Father, and requiring all to go out from him, and
having taken hold of <hi>Tamar,</hi> he ſaies to her, <hi>come lye with me, my
Siſter:</hi> which ſhewes the progreſs of ſinne from luſt in the heart,
to perſuaſion by Word, and at laſt performance in the deed. And
how impudent the wicked become at laſt, ſhaking off all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
or ſhamefaceneſs: as we ſee alſo in <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7.
As alſo (as the proverb ſaies) <hi>That time, place, and opportunity
makes many whore and theefe,</hi> and therefore for avoiding of ſinne
ought to be eſchewed. Likewiſe we ſee how unjuſtly do carnall
men miſplace their affections: though they be of neereſt relation,
where grace is not to reſtraine and direct them.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. Where <hi>Tamar</hi> ſaies to <hi>Amnon,</hi> that no ſuch
thing ought to be done in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Which was the only Church
of God, and therefore whom holineſs doth become, as is ſaid,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 5. We learne that our lives and actions ought to be
ſutable to our profeſſion, and ſeeing it is holy, and the Church
whereof we count our ſelves members, is the holy Catholick
Church, and the head thereof is holy, <hi>Therefore we ſhould be
holy, as he is holy, without which holineſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb.
12. 14.</p>
                  <p>15. Next, where ſhe calles the ſinne, folly, and in committing
thereof, that he ſhould be as one of the fooles in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> We ſee
what ſinners are, eſteeme of themſelves as they pleaſe, they are
in Gods account, and all truly Godly, but <hi>fooles:</hi> as they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119120:99"/>
ſtyled in Scripture, and eſpecially in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 18. 6.
23. 9. 26. 1. and elſe-where, therefore the worldly wiſe man
in the Goſpell is called, the rich foole: and ſo they may, becauſe
they forecaſt not: nor provide for the time to come, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
momentary ſinfull pleaſures, or profit to everlaſting: and ſo
makes a fooliſh and unwiſe choice.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. Where ſhe ſaies, <hi>Whither ſhall I cauſe my ſhame
to go?</hi> We ſee that ſinne brings ſhame, as we ſee in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and has brought many to ſhamefull deaths, and to be
ſhamefull ſpectacles: which though they eſcape here, they ſhall
not eſcape before men, and Angells hereafter.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. It is ſaid notwithſtanding all her arguments
of diſſwaſion, he would not hearken to her, but forced her, and
lay with her, and ſo committed that vile act of inceſt againſt the
lawes, both of God and man: and which the baptiſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in <hi>Herode,</hi> and which the Apoſtle alſo, 1 Cor. 5. condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as <hi>deſerving excommunication and giving over into the hands of
Satan,</hi> where we ſee that where Satan prevailes, no arguments
neither from reaſon, equity, dammage, or the Word of God will
prevaile: but what God or man ſaies is deſpiſed, as we ſee is ſaid,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 9. Yea God himſelf is contemned, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. is ſhewne.</p>
                  <p>18. It is ſaid that <hi>Amnon</hi> forced her, he being ſtronger then
ſhe. Where we ſee, when gifts of body or mind, or any other
benefit that God gives, is abuſed to ſinne, againſt the giver; from
bleſſings, or benefits they turne to curſes, and to their deſtruction
in the end, who are the abuſers of them: as we ſee in the ſtrength
of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the wiſdome of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> he preferment of <hi>Judas,</hi>
the riches of the rich glutton, and foole, the beauty of <hi>Abſolon,</hi>
and here the ſtrength of <hi>Amnon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. Then <hi>Amnon</hi> hated her exceedingly, more
then he loved her. Which ſhewes the ſhortneſs of unlawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
enduring no longer then the ſinfull act, and for which like
fooles they hazard, and looſe pleaſures for evermore: and next,
wherein the fulfilling of unlawfull luſt, and carnall ſinfull pleaſure
(as alſo all ill grounded love and friendſhip) at laſt doth end;
when once the conſcience is touched and awaked, towit, in a
bitter hatred, more then ever they loved ſinne, as we ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 11. The ſame being as thoſe locuſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:119120:100"/>
20. Herein alſo is a reſemblance of true repentance, when
we are not only grieved for the committing of ſinne, but alſo
hates the ſame exceedingly, and puts it to the dore from us in the
practiſe of our lives, and bolts the dore upon it, that it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after returne to us, nor we to it, <hi>like the dog to the vomit, or
the ſow to the puddle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. In <hi>Abſolons</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Tamar,</hi> ſaying that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
is her brother, and not to regard that thing (for which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
conceaved a deadly hatered againſt <hi>Amnon,</hi> and reſolved to
kill him though he was his brother) we ſee the pattern of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and dangerous diſſembling hypocrite, who ſpoke ſo faire,
extenuating the matter to <hi>Tamar,</hi> and in that particular ſpoke
neither good nor evill to <hi>Amnon,</hi> but on the contrary thereafter
invited him to a feaſt, where he cauſed crually to murther him:
as hereafter alſo, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. He played the cunning hypocrite, as
ſhall be ſhewne in their own place, whereby he ſtole the hearts of
the people from his father firſt, and next would have ſtolen his
Crowne.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. When <hi>David hard of theſe things he was very
wroth.</hi> Doubtleſs, both at himſelfe, for his own ſimplicity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence:
the ſad fruit thereof he now ſaw; as alſo at his ſonne
<hi>Amnon,</hi> for his wicked fact of inceſt, which proceeded from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
pampering the fleſh, and carnall delight in the beauty of
women, the peſts of Kings courts. Wherein we ſee that oftimes
the Child which the father loves moſt: as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Amnon</hi> (as
we ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. <hi>and</hi> 37.) becomes their greateſt griefe through
too much indulgence towards ſuch. As we ſee in the ſonnes of
<hi>Eli,</hi> in <hi>Amnon</hi> here, and <hi>Abſolon</hi> hereafter.</p>
                  <p>23. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>Abſolon</hi> hated <hi>Amnon,</hi> becauſe he
had forced his ſiſter: as this teaches us that ſuch wrongs ſhould
not be done, leſt we incurre the hatred of thoſe, whoſe love ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ſhould ſeek to injoy. So likewiſe this ſheweth where ſin,
and eſpecially murther here beginnes, towit, at the heart: as we
ſee in <hi>Cain.</hi> And therefore we ſhould reſiſt beginnings, and watch
over the heart, with all watchfulneſs and diligence. It being like
the fort, or citadell, which if Satan once take in, he will the more
eaſily command all the reſt.</p>

               <head>II. SAM. Chap. 13. from the 23. verſ. to the end.</head>
               <p>FOllows now the ſecond part of the Chapter, &amp; in it, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
hiſtory of <hi>Abſolons</hi> murthering of <hi>Amnon</hi> for the forcing
of his Siſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> and as an accompliſhment of that threatning
in part of <hi>Nathan,</hi> againſt <hi>David</hi> for the killing of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> whoſe
blood did crye like <hi>Abels</hi> for revenge. In which Hiſtory we have
to conſider. 1. The haynouſneſſe of this ſinne of fratricide, and
muther. 2. The perſons actors in this Tragedy. 3. Their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vices, or errours. 4. The manner of this murther and acting
thereof. And 5. the conſequences.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what a haynous ſinne murther is, we may ſee not onely
in the prohibition thereof in Gods Word, and the puniſhments
that enſueth thereon, as we may perceive in theſe wherewith <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riahs</hi>
blood was avenged, and <hi>Naboths,</hi> &amp; the Lords Prieſts whom
<hi>Saul</hi> cauſed to be killed, &amp;c. the ſame making a man like to Satan,
<hi>who being a murtherer from the beginning,</hi> and innocent blood
crying ever to heaven till the ſame be avengend, as we ſee in <hi>Abels,</hi>
and <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10. And debarring from the Kingdome of Heaven, as
we ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. But of all ſorts of murther paricide and fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
is the moſt haynous, as we ſee that of <hi>Cains</hi> murthering of
his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Abemelechs</hi> murthering of his Brethren,
<hi>Judg.</hi> 9. And therefore periſhing thereafter ſhamefully, and of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolons</hi>
murthering here, of his Brother <hi>Amnon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the perſons actours in this Tragedy are. 1. <hi>Abſolon</hi>
King <hi>Davids</hi> third Son procreat upon <hi>Maacha</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Talmai</hi> King of <hi>Geſhur</hi> an infidell, &amp; who is the principall actour,
deviſer, commander, and avower of this cruell murther. 2. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
the King, in his ſimplicity and indulgence to his Children,
albeit by circumvention, yet he is the expoſer by his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Sonne <hi>Amnon</hi> to this murther. 3. <hi>Amnon</hi> the Kings
eldeſt Sonne incircumſpectly (and yet by Gods juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
is he who is murthered. 4. <hi>Abſolons</hi> ſervants are the
burreans and executers of this murther. 5. The Kings other
Sonnes were ſpectatours, being invited and preſent at this bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
banquet. 6. <hi>Jonadab</hi> acts the part of an inconſtant cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
(his friend <hi>Amnon</hi> now being ſlain) implying, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 32.
That the fact was a juſt revenge of the forcing of <hi>Abſolons</hi> Siſter
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119120:101"/>
                  <hi>Tamar,</hi> notwithſtanding that he had plotted the way how it
ſhould be done, and therefore now he turnes to <hi>Abſolons</hi> part
who was living, the other being dead and gone. 7. Gods part
is not to be a bare ſpectatour in all this, or a permitter onely; but
alſo a worker, directing all theſe evills to a good end. As he did
all that which was done to <hi>Joſeph</hi> by his Brethren, towit, to his
own glory, in the puniſhment of vice; and fatherly correction of
his ſervant <hi>David,</hi> and ſo to performe what his word was by
<hi>Nathan</hi> threatned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the vices of theſe actouns are. 1. In <hi>Abſolon,</hi> we ſee
hatred. Groſſe diſſimulation, implacable malice, deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
ambition to the next to the Crown, treaſon; effeminate
cruelty, commanding others to do, what he durſt not himſelf,
and want of all reverence, or duty to his Father, or his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and herein alſo his ſubtilty appears. That <hi>Vers</hi> 22. he never
ſpoke good, or bad to <hi>Amnon,</hi> towit of that ſubject, of the rape,
or forcing of his Siſter, by quarrelling with him for the ſame:
that ſo he might conceale his malice, till he found occaſion to
put the ſame in execution, and ſo he was paſt Maſter in the rule
of courteous diſſimulation: and in all this, and above all, we ſee
his irreligious contempt of God, or his commandements, and that
he regarded onely the wrong that was done to <hi>Tamar,</hi> but not
the offence that was done to God.</p>
               <p>2. In <hi>David,</hi> we ſee his errours were. 1. His too great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to his Sonnes, whereupon proceeded his facility without
ſuſpition to believe, and obey them. And 2. his negligence in his
office as a Magiſtrate, who ſhould have puniſhed <hi>Amnon</hi> for his
inceſt deſerving death; and which he neglecting, is thus puniſhed
and revenged by <hi>Abſolon</hi> to his great grief, and in Gods juſt
judgement.</p>
               <p>3. In <hi>Amnon</hi> his errour was, the want of the remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
for his inceſt, and his ſleeping in ſecurity, ſeeing for the
ſpace of two years, nothing was ſaid unto him by <hi>Abſolon,</hi> or
done unto him, nor expected by him.</p>
               <p>4. In <hi>Abſolons</hi> ſervants, we ſee their vice and wickedneſſe was,
their baſe ſlavery whereunto they ſubject themſelves to betray,
and murther the Prince, upon the onely warrant of their Maſters
command, and authority; miſregarding both Gods command,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119120:101"/>
and the Kings authority, or conſidering the cauſe, on conſequence
of the fact:</p>
               <p>5. In the reſt of the Kings Sonnes, we ſee their imprudence, to
have committed themſelves all at one time to have been at ſuch
a banquet, as alſo their negligence in being onely ſpectatours, and
not ſeeking any way to hinder the fact.</p>
               <p>6. In <hi>Jonathan</hi> we ſee the patterne of a temporiſing, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
courtier, favouring and following them, by whom they may
beſt ſtand, and framing his ſpeeches all to that end.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the form of the practiſing, and execution of this bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
fact is extended in all the circumſtances thereof. 1. The time
was after two full years, and at the ſhearing of ſheep, which was
uſually celebrated with a publick feaſt, as we ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. and
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. At which time <hi>Abſolon</hi> takes occaſion to invite the
King, and his Sonnes, and particularly <hi>Amnon,</hi> to his feaſt of ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhearing,
and then to murther <hi>Amnon.</hi> 2. The place is <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazor</hi>
which bordereth with <hi>Ephraim.</hi> 3. The occaſion, is <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolons</hi>
earneſt invitation of the King and all his Sonnes to his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet:
which when the King had refuſed to go, he preſſes him,
that <hi>Amnon</hi> ſhould go; which at laſt the King grants, and that all
his other Sonnes ſhould alſo go with him. 4. The manner of the
acting is, when all are come, the banquet is begun with great
mirth, and liberall entertainment, eſpecially in drinking of Wine:
that <hi>Amnon</hi> being drunk might make the leſſe reſiſtance, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abſolon</hi> gives commandement to his ſervants, when they ſaw
him ſo, that then they ſhould kill him, upon his warrant and
authority, which accordingly they wickedly perform.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the conſequents are, the Kings Sonnes flie, <hi>David</hi>
and all his ſervants mourne: <hi>Jonadab</hi> mitigates the firſt report,
and in a manner excuſes <hi>Abſolon</hi> for the fact, and <hi>Abſolon</hi> flieth,
and goeth to <hi>Geſhur,</hi> where he remained three years.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. IN <hi>Amnon</hi> before, and now in <hi>Abſolon,</hi> both <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and
profeſſours of the true worſhip of God, and members of the
viſible Church. We ſee groſſe and wicked crimes of uncleaneſſe in
the one, and cruelty in the other, which ſhewes us, that it is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119120:102"/>
not enough to be profeſſours of the truth, &amp; of the Chriſtian name,
or will ever that avail us to ſalvation, if our practiſe be contrary
to our profeſſion, but our guiltineſſe is the greater that we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
our holy profeſſion by our unholy life, mocks God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him words, but our reall ſervice to Satan, makes the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to blaſphmy, and brings deſtruction upon our own ſouls.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. Two full years <hi>Amnon</hi> ſleeps in ſecurity before his
inceſtuous fact is puniſhed, whereby we ſee. 1. The Lords long
ſuffering patience all this while, which he abuſed and ſhould have
led him to repentance. And 2. albeit ſinners through Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
lie ſleeping in ſecurity, yet the Lords juſtice and their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
puniſhment ſleeps not, but though he come with leaden feet,
yet he comes at laſt with an iron hand to cruſh them in pieces.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Amnon</hi> had eſcaped puniſhment which <hi>David</hi> as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
ought to have inflected impartially according to the Law,
which was one of the cauſes of his ſecurity, but he could not
eſcape that puniſhment which God in his juſt judgement had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for him, therefore let none, though never ſo great Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

as <hi>Amnon</hi> was, or others, dreame of impunity for ſinne, for aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
howſoever they may eſcape the hand of man, the hand of God
in his own time ſhall reach them.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Abſolon</hi> had all theſe two years harboured in his heart, this
hatered and inveterate malice which he had againſt <hi>Amnon,</hi> and
which now he was to put in execution, whereby we ſee where
Satan once gets poſſeſſion of the heart, as he got alſo of <hi>Cains,</hi> and
<hi>Iudas,</hi> he will never reſt till he bring that wicked ſeed ſown and
rooted there, till a full harveſt &amp; perfection, as he did this invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
hatered of <hi>Abſolons</hi> towards <hi>Amnon.</hi> Which ended in a cruell
murther. And that evill determined courſes die not, as oftimes
the good does. Before their performance.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Abſolon</hi> invited all the Kings Sonnes to a banquet, and in
ſpeciall, <hi>Amnon</hi> whom he intended to murther, as we ſee <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26.
So that it is no new thing to ſee fouleſt practiſes varniſhed over
with fair pretences, as in that fact of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> againſt the
<hi>Sechemites,</hi> the faſt indicted by <hi>Jeſabells</hi> means for killing of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi>
and here <hi>Abſolons</hi> inviting of <hi>Amnon</hi> to a feaſt, intending to
murther him. This alſo is the practiſe of Satan in tempting to
ſinne, he layes before them pleaſure, or profite, and the like, and

therefore Children ſhould earneſtly deſire that with parents bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
which is onely optative, the Lord would joyn his bleſſing

                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. After that <hi>David</hi> had denyed, that <hi>Amnon</hi> ſhould
go, yet through <hi>Abſolons</hi>

all other his Sonnes, ſhould go. Where we ſee what importunity
doth produce, and eſpecially by ſervent and frequent prayer, and
waiting what is produced at the hands of God, our heavenly
King and Father: as we ſee in the anſwer to the Canaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>itiſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
at laſt, and the parable of the importunate friend, and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. Where <hi>Abſolon</hi> directs his ſervants to marke,
when <hi>Amnons</hi> heart was merry with Wine, that then they ſhould
kill him. We ſee 1. what is the fruit oftimes of drunkenneſſe
when men are beſotted thereby, and both rendred incapable
of perceiving of danger, and unable to reſiſt violence, as is ſaid by
the Poet, <hi>enervat vires, debilitatique pedes,</hi> then they become an
open prey to any invader. And 2. we ſee that it is a fearfull
thing for men, to be taken away in the very act of ſinning, as
<hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Coſby,</hi> were, <hi>Core</hi> and <hi>Dathan,</hi> and here <hi>Amnon</hi> in the
very act of drunkenneſſe. Wherein alſo appeareth <hi>Abſolons</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cruelty, by making him drunk firſt to murther his ſoul, and
thereafter in his ſecurity to murther his body.</p>
                  <p>9. In the executing of this cruell fact, <hi>Abſolon</hi> ſayes to his
ſervants, fear not, ſpeaking of the fear of man, but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
to ſpeak of the feare of God: and again, have not I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you? (ſayes he) as if his command was a ſufficient
warrant, though contrary to the commandement of God. So
that we ſee hereby, that in all wayes of the wicked God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119120:103"/>
is no wayes before their eyes, and that preſumptuouſly they
preferre themſelves unto him, and their unjuſt obſequie, to his
juſt obedience.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Abſolon</hi> likewiſe calls the execution of this baſe cruelty in
his ſervants, courage and valour, being indeed but treacherous
and cowardly murther. Which ſhewes, that vices are oftimes
coloured with the name of vertues; as drunkenneſſe is called good
fellowſhip, avarice good Husbandry, ſubtilty to deceive, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and pride magnanimity; as treacherous murther is here
called courage and valour: and ſo on the contrary vertues fair
face is beſmeared with the foule aſperſion of vice, as humility is
counted baſenes, modeſty hypocriſy, and charity, profuſion, as
<hi>Judas</hi> called that which was beſtowed on Chriſt to be waſte. This
being Satans policy to make vice owned, and vertue counted
odious.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. It is ſaid that the ſervants of <hi>Abſolon</hi> did as their
Maſter commanded them, and killed <hi>Amnon.</hi> Being hereby rather
ſlaves to his vice and to Satan the inſtigator. Where we ſee the
proverb verified, <hi>ſuch Masters, ſuch Man,</hi> a godleſſe, bloody and
diſſembled Maſter, and they godleſſe, bloody and diſſembled ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
miſregarding the fear of God, or his holy commandement,
to pleaſe man, and obey his wicked commandment; whereas
they ſhould onely obey the Lord, and their Maſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
ſo farre as it was agreeable to Gods, as is ſaid,
<hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29. And as we ſee a worthy example here of in <hi>Sauls</hi> foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 17. Who at their Kings commandement would
not kill the Prieſts of the Lord, which wicked <hi>Doeg the Edomite</hi>
did thereafter, in a moſt cruell and barbarous manner, as alſo in
the Midwives of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 31. 36. <hi>and</hi> 37. Upon the hearing of the tragicall
newes of <hi>Abſolons</hi> bloody and cruell fact, <hi>David</hi> rents his cloathes,
lies on the Earth, weeps ſore, and mourned every day. Where
we ſee, that parents too great indulgence to their Children, (as
<hi>Eli's</hi> was, and <hi>Davids</hi>) who ſpare the rod which in time ſhould
be uſed, procures much ſorrow and grief to themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of their Children, whom they ſpare and indulge.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>David</hi> alſo not being onely a parent, but a publicke Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,

or Allegoricall oration, which ſubtily <hi>Ioab</hi> had put

whoſe rebuke of the King after this form had the better

event. 2. The ſcope whereof is to bring <hi>David a ſimili,</hi> to grant
to <hi>Abſolons</hi> reduction. 3. The oration it ſelfe conſiſts of a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or <hi>Protaſis;</hi> and next of an application or <hi>Apodaſis.</hi> The firſt
is in the perſon of her own ſonne. The ſecond in the perſon of
<hi>Abſolon,</hi> for whoſe reduction both is intended. The one is <hi>from
the</hi> 5. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 12. The other <hi>from the</hi> 12. <hi>to the</hi> 18. This ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hers, the King heares patiently, and anſwers graciouſly.
1. In the generall, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. 2. More particularly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. And
3. Moſt ſpecially, and plainly, and for her better ſatisfaction,
and aſſurance, ſealing it with an oath. <hi>That as the Lord liveth,
There ſhould not a haire of her ſonnes head, fall to the earth.</hi> After
which words of the King, followeth the application, or <hi>Apodoſis:</hi>
wherein after a cunning conciliating of a patient audience, ſhe out
of his own mouth (as <hi>Nathan</hi> did) makes him to convict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of cruell and hard dealing againſt <hi>Abſolon,</hi> in not reducing
him from exile. In which application <hi>David</hi> is, as the widdow
who had the two ſonnes: whereof the one, towit, <hi>Abſolon</hi> had
killed the other <hi>Amnon:</hi> and that, being greatly provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
by the indignity done to his ſiſter. Now the reſt of the Kings
ſonnes neereſt after <hi>Abſolon</hi> to ſucceed to the Crowne, they are
as the friends of the dead, craving revenge. For whoſe ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Abſolon</hi> has remained three full yeares in exile, therefore what
<hi>David</hi> has granted to his poore ſubject, concerning her ſonne,
who is alive, he cannot with honour and equity refuſe to his
own ſonne and ſucceſſour: ſeeing the Kings judgment ſhould
be a like to all in like caſes, and his oath inviolable. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which more particularly ſhe uſes: are theſe, 1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13.
It is againſt Gods people, their honour and good, to have the
ſucceſſour to their King, living in exile amongſt Gentiles, and
Infidells in <hi>Geſhur.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. Their griefe is ſuch, that they
are like a people ready to dye, and like water powred on the
ground, which cannot be gathered up againe, by the exile of
their Prince, whoſe reduction would both eaſe and pleaſe them.
3. The Lord has appointed, and diviſed meanes for his reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he remaine not ſtill in exile from him, and theſe meanes
how weak, or ſmall ſoever, ſhould not be miſregarded. 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi>
15. It is the Kings gracious diſpoſition, to admit the meaneſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner
to ſpeak unto him, in behalfe of them who are diſtreſt:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119120:105"/>
ſuch is his goodneſs, though his greatneſs might make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.
5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. A <hi>ſimili,</hi> the Kings granting favour, to the
ſonne of a poore widdow, and ſubject: much more muſt move
him, to ſhew favour to his own ſonne, and ſucceſſour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> And 6.
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. The Kings pity, and piety in comforting thoſe, that are
in diſtreſs: and his prudence, like an Angel of God, in diſcerning
between good, and evill muſt ſhew it ſelfe in comforting his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by reduction of their Prince; and in comforting his exiled
ſome himſelfe, which he cannot but think the ſame to be the beſt
courſe. And 7. By way of concluſion, in doing ſo, the King will
find that herein the Lord will be with him, and proſper
him.</p>
               <p>The effect or event of this oration, is 1. The Kings asking this
woman of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> if <hi>Joabs</hi> hand was not in this, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Who
ſimply and truly grants the ſame. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. Subjoyning as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of her granting, by way of commendation of <hi>David,</hi> that
he was wiſe, as an Angell of God: and knew all things that are
in the earth. And therefore it was in vaine, for her to deny, or
conceale this thing from him. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. The ſecond effect was,
the Kings conceſſion to <hi>Joabs</hi> deſire by this woman, and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to him, to bring back <hi>Abſolon</hi> from exile: but upon this
condition, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. That he ſhould go to his own houſe in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>IOab</hi> perceiving the Kings heart to be towards <hi>Abſolon,</hi>
reſolves to deale for his reduction: where we ſee the
nature of Courtiers; that for the moſt part, whatſoever they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> think
will be pleaſing to their Prince, though not agreeable to God, or
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119120:105"/>
a good conſcience: that they will ſtrive to do. As we ſee in that
wicked practiſe of <hi>Doeg,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 18. And here in the practiſe
of <hi>Joab.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. There is no ill cauſe, but it will find ſome, for to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for it: eſpecially in the Courts of Kings, and great men:
as <hi>Joab</hi> was here for an unnaturall and bloody murthering <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon,</hi>
doing ſo for their own ends. Whereof therefore Kings,
and others ſhould beware, conſidering what it brought on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
at laſt, his giving eare thereto.</p>
                  <p>3. That which gives <hi>Joab</hi> hope to prevaile, we ſee is <hi>David</hi>
the Judges favour, that his heart was towards <hi>Abſolon.</hi> So, that
which gives us hope to prevaile in our ſuits towards our ſelves,
or others: although grievous ſinners; is the favour that our
heavenly King, and judge, caries towards mankind: his heart in
fatherly affection, and pity, being towards us; whereas he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the fallen Angells, and ſent his own ſonne to fallen man,
and gave him to the death for us.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Joab</hi> for accompliſhing his purpoſe, chooſes a fit
inſtrument to bring it to paſs, by fetching a wiſe woman from
<hi>Tekoah,</hi> and ſuborning her what ſhe ſhould ſay. As Satan made
choice of the Serpent in tempting of <hi>Eve.</hi> Which ſhould teach
men, much more in good cauſes, and for effecting good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
either in Church or Commonwealth: to chooſe fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the work, which may tend to Gods glory, and the
good of his people.</p>
                  <p>5. This woman is called a wiſe woman, and yet ſuffers her
wiſdome to be abuſed, by <hi>Joabs</hi> ſuborning her to plead for an ill
cauſe. Which ſhould teach ſuch, who have gifts beyond others,
to take heed that they abuſe them not to ill ends: but to uſe
them aright to the glory of God; and advancing of good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.
Elſe they may be admoniſhed by the Example of <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phell,</hi>

And therefore he ſubtily employes, and ſubornes this wiſe
woman of <hi>Tekoah.</hi> Where we ſee oftimes in Courtiers more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,

13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 16. This woman would perſwade the King
to bring back <hi>Abſolom,</hi> by reaſoning <hi>a ſimili,</hi> from that which
was granted to her, for her own ſonne. Whereas juſt judgment
ſhould be ruled not by examples, but by lawes: as it is ſaid, <hi>We

We ſee the neceſſity of our mortall condition, and that

It ſhould teach all alike to feare to ſinne, againſt God, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

                  <p>19. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>David</hi> in the reduction of <hi>Abſolon</hi> has inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a great debate betwixt two Counſellours. The one fleſh, blood,
and affection, moving him to pardon, and reduce his ſonne on
the one part: and the law of God, of good conſcience, and duty
of his office to puniſh him on the other part. In which debate
<hi>David</hi> yeilds to affection, <hi>makes ſhipwrack of conſcience,</hi> and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his office. Which example may be applyed by reprehenſion,
to the greateſt part of the world, who in the like deliberations
follow fleſh, and blood, pleaſure, or profit in ſinning, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
both God, a good conſcience, and their own good in the end.
As we ſee in the firſt world. In <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſonnes their cruelty towards
the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> and their brother <hi>Joſeph:</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that <hi>Achab</hi> had been guided by <hi>Eliah, Rehoboam by the old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours:</hi>
and when the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were ruled by the
true prophets, for then was the eſtate of the republick happy and
proſperous.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Joab</hi> humbly thanks the King, for fulfilling his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119120:107"/>
requeſt, though in an unlawfull thing: that (as we heare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)
tended to his hurt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. How much more then ſhould
we be humbly thankfull to the King of Kings: who ſo often ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth
our requeſts in pardoning us, and in many things that tend
to our good here, and eternall ſalvation hereafter.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>Joab</hi> being the Kings Generall of his Armies,
goeth himſelfe to <hi>Geſhur:</hi> and with great ſolemnity brings back
<hi>Abſolon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> who ſhould rather have ſuffered death
there, for the murther of his brother, then to have been ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
But oftimes this is the cuſtome of the world, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
ſuffers when vice is rewarded. Whereas the duty of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is to cheriſh vertue, and chaſtiſe vice: as is ſaid, <hi>tolle
malos, extolle pios.</hi> Theſe being the two pillars of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
the reward of vertue, and puniſhment of vice: elſe who
ſhall follow the one, and flie the other.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Davids</hi> condition upon which he grants to

people, like <hi>Sauls</hi> ſparing of <hi>Agag, and the beſt of the cattle for

which required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the murtherer ſhould dye the death;
and the land thereby be purged of blood. Which ſhould teach
all Magiſtrates to make Gods Word, and the lawes, to be the

with Gods law through humane policy and wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>24. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Abſolon</hi> is here commended for his beauty
of body, which was outward: but wanted that inward beauty
ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. <hi>and</hi> 110. 3. And <hi>without which the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is but like a ring of gold in a ſwines ſnout:</hi> Whereas beauty
with vertue (eſpecially humility and chaſtity) is like a pearle
in a gold ring. Wherefore let every one that has bodily beauty,
ſeek for the inward beauty of grace and vertue, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> had:
without which it will be more hurtfull than profitable; as we ſee
in <hi>Dinah,</hi> and <hi>Tamar,</hi> and here in <hi>Abſolon.</hi> And ſuch as want bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
beauty, ſtrive to have ſpirituall beauty, that ſo they may
be like the vine: which though it want outward beauty, yet brings

it is the juſt judgment of God, that worldly things wherein men

in that domeſtick exile from his fathers preſence, which he either
deſires, or elſe that he would put him to a legall triall and kill

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 26. <hi>ABſoloms</hi> ambitious heart is mightily grieved (as we
ſee <hi>V.</hi> 32.) That he is reſtrained from the court, &amp;
the Kings preſence. Which ſhewes us the torture and diſquiet of
proud Spirits, that cannot attain to their ambitious deſires: ſo that
it may be ſaid of pride, as is of envy <hi>Intactis vorat oſſibus medullas,</hi>
and that it is a puniſhment to it ſelf, whereas the wiſe man ſayes,
<hi>Bene vixit, qui bene latuit.</hi> As alſo what torture ſhall it be to be
deprived of his preſence for ever, who is the King of Kings, and
of that fulneſſe of joy that is therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>Abſolom</hi> extorts by force and violence what he
could not obtain otherwiſe. Wherein we ſee the nature of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
that where they cannot allure men to meddle with them
in ill courſes they menace, or oppreſſe them, as experience
teaches. And ſo does enforce them.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Abſoloms</hi> ſervants do as their Tyrannous Maſter commands
them, and burne <hi>Ioabs</hi> barly field. Where we ſee a new example
of a wicked Maſter, and of wicked ſervants, as we ſaw before in
the murther of <hi>Amnon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. We ſee here likewiſe that <hi>Ioab</hi> receives a juſt recompence

<hi>David,</hi> followes now in the foure ſubſequent Chapters

conſpiracy againſt the life, and royall authority of the

part of this generall, the treaſonable conſpiracy of <hi>Abſolon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
King <hi>David,</hi> which I divide in four parts. 1. The means
whereby he prepares and perverts the hearts of the people, <hi>from
the</hi> 1. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 7. 2. The act of this mighty conſpiracy, <hi>from
the</hi> 7. <hi>to the</hi> 14. <hi>verſe.</hi> And under what pretence he goes to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi>
where he acts the ſame. 3. <hi>Davids</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eeing from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
upon hearing of the news, and <hi>Ittai's</hi> reſolution not to leave him
in this his diſtreſſed condition, <hi>to the</hi> 24. <hi>verſe.</hi> And 4. <hi>Davids</hi>
prudent deliberations that he takes in this matter, <hi>from the</hi> 24.
<hi>verſe to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then for Illuſtration of this matter: We ſhall follow this
order. 1. We ſhall ſpeak a little of the nature of this crime of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
conſpiracy, or leſ-majeſty. 2. Of the occaſions that moved
<hi>Abſolon</hi> to commit this crime. 3. Of the ſubtile practiſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he alienates the peoples favour from the King, and acquires the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119120:109"/>
ſame to himſelf. 4. Of the particular fact of this conſpiracy it
ſelf in all the circumſtances thereof.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt. 1. This crime is directly againſt the fift
precept of the morall Law, where under the name of Father and
mother is comprehended the Magiſtrate. Who is <hi>parens patriae,</hi>
and of whom we are prohibited in <hi>Deutronomie,</hi> not to ſpeak evil,
much leſſe to do evill to him: yea, againſt whom to deviſe, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
evill, although no execution follow, is criminall and capitall in
the higheſt degree, by all Lawes, and the puniſhment whereof
extends not onely to the committer being alive, but being dead,
and to his very ofspring. Yea, though they be wicked, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are to be counted ſacred, and ſo not to be touched, as we
ſee in the example of <hi>David</hi> towards <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5, 6. Or
of a contrary profeſſion, yet that looſes not the band of loyall
ſubjection, as our late confeſſion of faith by the Scripture ſhewes:
and if they ſhould command that which is unlawfull, howſoever
active obedience may be refuſed, as the three Children and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
did, yet no conſpiracy is to be uſed againſt either their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or eſtates, but prayer and tears to God, to convert their
hearts, or diſſipate their Counſells.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the motives that moved <hi>Abſolon</hi> to attempt this
treaſonable conſpiracy, was principally ambition and deſire to
raigne, which ſpurres him on with ſuch inſatiable veheme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cy,
like <hi>Jehu's</hi> march, that he cannot abide till his Fathers naturall
death, and the time of his juſt claime; but as out of ambition, as
well as vindict he had made away <hi>Amnon, Davids</hi> eldeſt Son, and
neereſt to the Crown, he would now alſo by paricide take his
Father out of the way, that ſo he might raigne, beſide this he
ſtomochated his exile. 3. yeares in <hi>Geſhur,</hi> and two yeares
after, for his debarring from court, when he was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
laſt he was ſuſpitious that (as it was rumored) <hi>David</hi> would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
at his death <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſucceed him, being a pious and a
prudent Prince, and beloved both by God, and his Prophet
<hi>Nathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the means whereby he prepares and perverts the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſubtily, are. 1. his Princelie attendance, of chariots and
horſes, and 50. men to runne before him, the novelty whereof
and ſight was pleaſant, and it is ſaid, that people delight in ſuch
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119120:110"/>
ſhewes and novelties. 2. His popularity, for gaining whereof he
uſes both words, and deeds inſinuating himſelf by both into the
peoples favours, and in doing whereof his reſtles diligence was
ſuch, that when others were at reſt and aſleep, his reſtleſſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
ſuffers him not to reſt, but he riſes early, and to catch all
occaſions, ſtands beſide the way of the Kings gate. And 1. By
words, when men had any controverſy, and came to
the King for judgement. 1. He kindly calles upon them, <hi>and asks
of what city they were.</hi> Next, he inquires of their errand and gives
them an approbation of the equity of their cauſe. But blames his
Fathers negligence of his royall duty, that no man was deputed by
him to Miniſter juſtice. Then he ſimulates his love to juſtice and
care of doing the ſame to all if he once were in place, and veſted
with authority. 4. By deeds, or geſture, ſimulating great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
he carries below his rank to his inferiours: and when any
came nigh, and did obeyſance to him, he put forth his hand and
took him and kiſſed him. Whereby he deceived the people, and
ſtole their hearts, for albeit externally he gave a ſhew of humility
and curteſy; yet inwardly he foſtered all pride and cruelty, which
he ſhewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>The third mean, which he uſes to effectuate his rebellion, is his
pretence of piety in going to <hi>Hebron. To pay his vow, which he
had made in</hi> Geſhur, <hi>that if the Lord brought him back from
thence to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>he would ſerve the Lord.</hi> An uſuall cloake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and to palliat fouleſt practiſes under ſuch fair pretences.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the particular circumſtances of this wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
are theſe. 1. The time which was (<hi>verſ.</hi> 7.) After 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
years;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 4.</note> reckoning after the beginning of <hi>Davids</hi> raigne in <hi>Hebron;</hi>
which I confirme by this demonſtration, the whole years of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
were 70. next, <hi>Solomon</hi> was eleven years old when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to raigne.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 22, 5.</note> Who was begotten after <hi>Davids</hi> adultery with
<hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and ſo <hi>David</hi> is thought to be 58. or. 59. when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
<hi>Solomon;</hi> after this we aſſigne two years before <hi>Amnons</hi> inceſt,
and other two years between the inceſt of <hi>Amnon</hi> and his kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by <hi>Abſolom,</hi> to which adde. 3. years, that <hi>Abſolom</hi> was in
<hi>Geſhur,</hi> and two in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> before his reconciliation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the reconciliation we aſſigne two years for the practiſe of
this conjuration, which added makes eleven yeares, and ſo
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119120:110"/>
this rebellion falls in the laſt year of <hi>Davids</hi> life, or thereabout,
when this unhappy Childe ſhould have comforted his Fathers
age, he then becomes to him his greateſt croſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond circumſtance, is the place where he beginnes to
act his treaſon, which is <hi>Hebron</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Judah.</hi>
15. <hi>Miles distant from Jeruſalem,</hi> where the ſepulture of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
was, belonging to the <hi>Levites,</hi> which place he chooſeth,
not as he pretended for any act of Religion, or ſerving of God
there, but as fitteſt to act his conſpiracy there, and to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
down in the throne, that ſame place were <hi>David</hi> his Father
beganne his raigne, and ſo to ſerve Satan and his owne ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The third circumſtance, is the manner how he advances his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
which is. 1. By taking with him in company 200. men from
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom he had invited to take part of his feaſt, at the
paying of his vow in <hi>Hebron, who went with him in the ſimplicity
of their hearts,</hi> knowing nothing of his treaſonable deſign. 2. He
ſends ſpies through the Land to try the diſpoſition of the people,
and who were on his ſide, or no, and with them he ſends Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters;
and that theſe ſpies might inform the people, that as
ſoon as they heard him proclaimed King, they might joyn with
him. 3. He ſends for <hi>Achitophel Davids</hi> prime Counſellour, the
better to colour and promote his conſpiracy, and that the people
might ſee that the wiſeſt of the Kingdome, and his Fathers chief
Counſellour was on his ſide. Whereupon a great confluence
of people comes unto him, and the conſpiracy becomes ſtrong
thereby. Some being deceived, and thinking it had been by his
Fathers appointment, as was <hi>Solomons</hi> afterwards, others affecting
novelty, and their own advancement; and others who were not
anſwerable to the Lawes being glad of alteration, and as we ſay,
to fiſh in troubled waters.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. IN the obſervations, or application of this Hiſtory I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the method of the actours and perſons, which are five.
1. <hi>David.</hi> 2. <hi>Abſolom.</hi> 3. The ſpies. 4. The people. 5. <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:119120:111"/>
1. On <hi>Davids</hi> part in Hiſtory, we ſee in this act the juſt
judgement of God on the perverters of juſtice, eſpecially in the
matter of murther, and bloodſhed, in not puniſhing the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law, therefore <hi>Abſolom</hi> who firſt took <hi>Amnons</hi> life
the Son, being ſpared, now hunts after the life alſo, and eſtate
of the Father. Let Magiſtrates therefore if they love their own
ſecurity draw the ſword of juſtice againſt vice (and eſpecially
againſt that crying ſinne of bloodſhed) impartially.</p>
                  <p>2. In the Myſtery, in <hi>Davids</hi> troubles and his adherents here,
we ſee typified the condition of Chriſt, and his Church, againſt
whom not onely open Enemies aroſe and bloody perſecuters, but
alſo domeſticke Enemies, as pernicious Heretickes profeſſing the
Chriſtian name, and yet oppugning the truth of Jeſus Chriſt, and
perſecuting the true profeſſours thereof, as did the <hi>Arrians</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
and as now do the <hi>Pope, and Papiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Next in the Perſon and actings of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> in the Hiſtory,
we ſee the example of a youth poſſeſt with all ſort of vices, like
a legion of Divells, as pride, cruelty, diſſimulation, fraud, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy,
unnaturall rebellion, Athieſme, and in a word a Maſſe
of monſtrous impiety. Whereupon we learn what man is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being unregenerate. As we ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. And that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
comes not by generation, but by grace and regeneration.
As we ſee in the ſimilitude of the pure grain that is ſown, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
groweth that which hath both a win, chaffe and ſtraw. Which
ſhould teach parents to pray for grace to their Children, to curb
vice in them timely, and to bring them up in vertue, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
not being too indulgent, and to remember that which is
ſaid, <hi>Quod nova teſta capit, inveterata ſapit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Abſolom</hi> likewiſe and his followers, in Myſtery repreſents the
malignant Church, perſecuting the true, and the riſing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
(reſembled here by him) by counterfeit profeſſion of great
humility: as a ſervant of ſervants, and ſimulate piety, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
therefore his holyneſſe, and going about in deep hypocriſy to
act the Myſtery of iniquity, thereby to dethrone Chriſt, who is
the onely head, and King of his Church, and to inthrone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as head and monarch thereof: for which he has his ſpies and
Trumpeters, as his emiſſary <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in all Lands,
whereby multitudes, (which he makes a note of his Church)
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119120:111"/>
are made to follow him, which many do, like the 200. that went
with <hi>Abſolom) in the ſimplicity of their hearts,</hi> and ſuch a few num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
who follow Chriſt, and his truth (like theſe who followed
<hi>David</hi>) he cruelly did ever perſecute to the death, as the two
witneſſes were, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. Having not onely policy (like <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phels</hi>
wiſdome) but alſo power on his ſide, as we ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi>
17. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Abſolom</hi> likewiſe we ſee riſes not in open rebellion at firſt,
nor to the hight of his impiety, but by degrees, getting Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
horſes, and a Princely attendance firſt; and then preparing
the peoples affections and fitting all other things for his purpoſe.
This being Satans craftines ſowing firſt the ſeeds of ſinne in the
heart, (which therefore we are exhorted to keep with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence:
<hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23.) As he did the tares in the Lords field,
and then fomenting the ſame by all means poſſible, till at laſt it
come to the ripe harveſt, and burſt forth openly: as we ſee <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
covetouſneſſe did in betraying Chriſt, <hi>Abſoloms</hi> hatred in
killing of <hi>Amnon,</hi> and his pride here in rebellion againſt his
Father. And in Myſtery, as we may ſee in that defection of
the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to groſſe idolatry, of worſhipping of images,
and reliques, prayer to ſancts, and Angels, going in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
adoration of the hoſte, and the like; all which roſe
from ſmall beginnings at firſt, and plauſible pretences, as we
ſee, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
                  <p>Theſe qualities alſo which being ſingle, grace others, ſeem
to have conſpired to meet in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> goodlineſſe of perſon,
magnificence of ſtate, gracious affability, humility in greatneſſe,
fellowfeeling ſympathy, love of juſtice, care of the Commonwealth,
and exemplary piety, and yet all in hypocriſy, playing with God,
that he may deceave men. O damnable vice juſtly therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to the loweſt Hell.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Abſolom</hi> to promove his purpoſe riſes up early eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day. Which ſhewes us, the reſtleſſenes of inſatiable pride till it
attain its intent; and how buſy an agent, the Divell is in driving
on wicked men to the acting of wicked courſes, like <hi>Jehu</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
furiouſly, till they have accompliſhed their deſigne: as we
ſee here in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Judas</hi> ſelling of Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
him, and as is ſaid, <hi>Prov:</hi> 4. 16. Of the wicked
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119120:112"/>
that they ſleep not except they have done miſchief.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 5. In <hi>Abſoloms</hi> flattering ſpeech, and putting
forth his hand to them that came neer him, and taking of them
&amp; kiſſing them. We ſee the nature of wicked men, who will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to uſe moſt baſe flattery, and diſſimulation, and to ſtoope farre
under their rank, thereby to attain to their own ends. Of which
therefore it is prudence to beware.</p>
                  <p>8. In his accuſing his Father of negligence in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of juſtice; and ſo to bring him in diſguſt, and malgrace
with his ſubjects. We ſee that it is the very firſt precept and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
in the black art of ſedition and rebellion, to flatter the
people, and to accuſe the Magiſtrate, and lay upon him the
fouleſt aſperſions that they can deviſe, that by blameing the
preſent Government, and calumniating boldly them who are in
place, they may firſt, (as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did here) ſteale the hearts
of people from them, and ſo make them naked, and thereafter
engage them to themſelves, and ſo work the point of their own
preferment. But as is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 3. a man ſhall not be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Abſolom</hi> vaunts greatly, and promiſes much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
if he wee made Judge, whereby howſoever he pretended great
humility in his geſture, yet he diſcovers great pride in his words,
for vice cannot hide it ſelf long, and in a moſt unſeemly way
he praiſes himſelf, where <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 2. It is ſaid; <hi>Let another
man praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth, a ſtranger and not thine
own lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Neer after 40. years that his Father had raigned,
<hi>Abſolom</hi> hatches and brings forth this monſtrous brood of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
in his Fathers old age and latter time of his raigne, which as
it ſhewes his great impatiency who could abide his fathers death,
and his ambitious thirſt to raigne: ſo it ſhewes a wicked diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Son croſſing his father moſt, when moſt he ſhould have
comforted him.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Abſolon</hi> pretends that his going to <hi>Hebron</hi> was to pay
there a religions vow to God, and to ſerve him. Where we
ſee, that the pretending of Religion has been ever made a cloake
to palliatall treaſonable and wicked deſignes, like Satan who
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:119120:112"/>
when he intends greateſt miſchiefe, he transformes himſelfe into
an Angel of light, and Antichriſt to deceive Gods people the more
ſubtilly, is deſcribed <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>By that beaſt that is horned
like the Lamb, but ſpeaks like the Dragon.</hi> This alſo we may ſee in
that cruell practiſe of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> againſt the <hi>Shechemites:</hi>
and here in <hi>Abſoloms</hi> againſt his own Father, ſo that the fouler
fact is, it ſeeks ever the faireſt viſard.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. Thirdly, in the ſpies and trumpeters that were
ſent out by <hi>Abſolom,</hi> through all the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to proclaim
him King. We ſee that rebellion and wicked courſes, never wants
wicked inſtruments to promote the ſame, as we ſee not only in
Scripturall examples but in later times, whereof <hi>Sleidan</hi> in his
<hi>Commentaries, lib.</hi> 5. makes mention. And how that <hi>Luther</hi> in
his ſpeech, and anſwer, to the deſires of the commons in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
who roſe up in rebellion againſt their Princes: ſpeaking of
certain preachers who ſtirred up, and fomented that rebellion: he
ſaies, <hi>Satanas enim ſub Evangelii pretextu, multos hoc tempore ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſos,
&amp; plane ſanguinarios excitavit doctores,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Pope</hi>
alſo ſends forth that <hi>Jeſuiticall</hi> brood, who are thoſe uncleane
ſpirits like froggs, which go forth unto the Kings of the earth,
to gather them to battle to the great day of the Lord, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.
13, 14. And which I would to God we had not ſuch, even in
our times amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>13. In the 200 alſo that followed <hi>Abſolom in the ſimplicity
of their heart,</hi> not knowing any thing of his conſpiracy. We ſee
in former times, and even now likewiſe, how many follow that
<hi>Roman</hi> Antichriſt, in like manner in the ſimplicity of their hearts,
not knowing the depth of Satan, nor the miſtery of iniquity,
and being only of the number, and name of the beaſts, that is
counted and called <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> but not having the marke
of the beaſt, and the deep impreſſion thereof, as we ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi>
13. 17.</p>
                  <p>14. Laſtly, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. In <hi>Achitophels</hi> joyning with <hi>Abſolom.</hi>
We ſee the image of a temporiſing Polititian and Courtier, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his loyalty to his old Maſter <hi>David,</hi> and now cleaving to
him, whom he thought to be the ſunne riſing, and joyning his
wit with <hi>Abſoloms</hi> forces to promote an ill cauſe, which brings
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119120:113"/>
him therefore at laſt to an ill end. Alſo we ſee what truſt
can be in fleſh, and blood; when not only <hi>Davids</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour
turnes traitour; but alſo he is not ſafe from one of his
own loynes.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>II. SAM. from the 13. Verſe to the 30.</head>
               <p>FOllowes now the other two parts of this Chapter. The firſt
whereof is <hi>Davids</hi> patience, and courſe that he takes by flying:
whereby he declines the fury of his ſonne <hi>Abſolom.</hi> And 2. <hi>Ittai</hi>
the <hi>Gittite,</hi> his conſtant and faithfull cleaving to <hi>David</hi> in his
diſtreſs, (as <hi>Ruth</hi> did conſtantly cleave to <hi>Naomi,</hi> and would not
leave her, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 1. 16.) and this is to the 24. <hi>verſ.</hi> The ſecond
is, <hi>Davids</hi> prudence. 1. In ſending back <hi>Zadok</hi> with the Ark to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and appointing his ſonne, and the ſonne of <hi>Abiathar,</hi>
(who went back with their fathers) to be <hi>Davids</hi> intelligencers.
And this to the 31. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. In ſending likewiſe <hi>Huſhai</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chite,</hi>
to inſinuate himſelfe into <hi>Abſoloms</hi> favour, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the counſell of <hi>Achitophel:</hi> and by the ſonnes of <hi>Abiathar,</hi>
and <hi>Zadok</hi> to certifie him of every thing which he heard.</p>
               <p>In proſecuting of the firſt part of <hi>Davids</hi> patience, and flieing
for the time. We ſhall conſider, 1. If flieing in the time of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
be lawfull, or agreeable to Chriſtian fortitude. 2. The
cauſes of <hi>Davids</hi> flieing at this time. 3. The fact it ſelfe, and
circumſtances thereof. And 4. The company or aſſociates of
<hi>David</hi> herein. For reſolution then of the firſt, we diſtinguiſh flie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in time of perſecution, in three kinds. The firſt is <hi>deſertion.</hi>
The ſecond, <hi>defection.</hi> The third is <hi>retreat.</hi> I call <hi>deſertion</hi> a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
abandoning, and deſerting of a good cauſe. I call <hi>defection,</hi>
not only a deſertion of a good cauſe: but alſo the profeſſion of
the contrary. And I call <hi>retreat,</hi> a neceſſary giving place, or ceding
to violence, or flieing therefore for time and place. As for the
firſt two ſorts, there is no queſtion but they are unlawfull: as well
in cauſes civill, as religious. But as for the third, 1. We have
Chriſts precept to his diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>If they perſecute you in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119120:113"/>
one Citie, flie to another.</hi> 2. We have the examples of <hi>Jacobs</hi> flie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Laban</hi> from the furie of <hi>Eſau,</hi> Gen. 27. <hi>Moſes</hi> flieing from
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the land of <hi>Midian,</hi> Exod. 2. <hi>David</hi> from <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam.
19. And here from <hi>Abſolom, Eliah</hi> from <hi>Ahab, Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>
from <hi>Herod,</hi> to <hi>Egypt</hi> with the Child Jeſus, and his diſciples from
one place to another, as they were commanded. Which muſt be
done, notwithſtanding upon theſe cautions. 1. That above all,
reſpect be had to the glory of God, and good of his Church
which muſt be preferred to our perſonall ſafety. 2. That reſpect
be had to our lawfull calling. And 3. That in all theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
be eſchewed, to wit, <hi>Temeritie,</hi> and <hi>Timiditie:</hi> that men
neither expoſe themſelves to unneceſſary dangers, neither yet for
carnall feare refuſe thoſe that are neceſſary, when God calls them
thereto, for witneſſing of the truth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, the cauſes which moved <hi>David</hi> at this time to
flie: which are, 1. The furie of the firſt motions of a deceived,
and fiery incenſed people; and of an inſolent young Prince now
their head, and leader: which fury <hi>David</hi> like a prudent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
warriour reſolves for the time to avoide. 2. <hi>David</hi>
in this rebellion lookes to the correcting hand of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Nathans</hi> propheſie, and therefore flies the fury of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument:
and (as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30.) humbles himſelfe bare-footed, and
weeping for his ſinne that had procured the ſame, that ſo God
might be firſt appeaſed, and then that he might the ſooner be
rid of the rod. 3. <hi>David</hi> chooſes rather to flie, than to hazard a
number of innocent people their lives, either who loyallie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
himſelfe: or who in ſimplicity of their hearts had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Abſolom,</hi> like a tender father who looked to the good of his
Children more then to his own credit or ſafety. 4. <hi>David</hi> being
now aged, and like the ſunne ſetting, he ſaw that the multitude
of the people, their eyes were on <hi>Abſolom,</hi> as the ſunne riſing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>That the conſpiracy was ſtrong, and the
people increaſed continually with Abſolom:</hi> and therefore it was
not ſafe with the few, that followed him, to encounter with ſo
great a multitude. And 5. He was exerciſed in mind between fear
and hope, his feare not being ſo much upon the conſpiracy of
<hi>Abſolom,</hi> as upon the apprehenſion of Gods juſtice, and with
this he had hope of deliverance, looking and truſting in his mercy,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119120:114"/>
and relying on his promiſe made to him concerning the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the action it ſelfe, is <hi>Davids</hi> flieing for the cauſes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
the antecedent and firſt motive whereof, is a meſſenger
that came to him. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. With newes that all the people were
following <hi>Abſolom</hi> heartily, and willingly. Whereupon <hi>David</hi>
preſently reſolves withall his ſervants, to flie out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily:
the reaſons whereof are two. 1. The eſchewing of their
own danger. And 2. The danger of the Citie if they remained
therein, till <hi>Abſolom</hi> came unto it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. Whereunto is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the yielding of <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants to this his reſolution, and
his and their departure from <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> leaving only ten of his
Concubines behind him to keep his houſe, whom <hi>Abſolom</hi>
afterwards defiled publickly; that <hi>Nathans</hi> propheſie might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 11. The manner of his flieing is ſet down, <hi>verſ.</hi>
30. In a penitentiary way, beare-foot and weeping, for his ſinnes,
that had procured this puniſhment: with whom in a compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
manner, all the people that were with him alſo did weepe.
The way by which he went is ſet down, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. over brook
<hi>Kidron,</hi> which was in a valley between <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and Mount <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livet,</hi>
famous in the hiſtory of Chriſts paſſion, where he removed
till the people who followed him joyned with him. With whom
thereafter (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.) he went up by the aſcent of Mount <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livet,</hi>
and from thence to the wilderneſs towards <hi>Jordan,</hi> and
afterwards to <hi>Mahanaim</hi> in <hi>Gilead</hi> where the battle was fought,
as we ſee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 27.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The company which followeth <hi>David</hi> are, 1. His
ſervants or domeſticks who prove loyall to him. 2. His guard the
<hi>Cherethites,</hi> and <hi>Pelethites,</hi> verſ. 18. 3. The people that joyned
with him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. 4. 600 <hi>Gittites</hi> that came with him from
<hi>Gath,</hi> with their Captain <hi>Ittai:</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> perſwades to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

he was a ſtranger, and in exile, and it was the Kings office, not
to trouble or indanger ſuch: but rather to provide and care for
their peace and quietneſs; which would be by his abiding with
<hi>Abſolom,</hi> whom by a Catachreſtick forme of ſpeech he calleth
King, becauſe he gave himſelfe out to be ſo: as <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>David</hi> had no certain place to abide in, nor proviſion, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119120:114"/>
therefore <hi>Ittai</hi> and his men, would be rather a burthen to him.
3. <hi>Ittai</hi> was but newly come, and his men to him: and therefore
no reaſon that after their late travells, they ſhould be put to new
trouble, and travelling. Wherefore by way of concluſion he gives
him, and them, a kind and curteous valediction, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. But
<hi>Ittai</hi> (like <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi</hi>) will not be diſſwaded from going
with <hi>David,</hi> and therefore he, and his men, they go forward
with him. 5. The fifth ſort of perſons that follow <hi>David:</hi> are,
<hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the prieſts, with the <hi>Levites</hi> bearing the Ark.
And as example to others they joyne with <hi>David</hi> according to
their office: and owne (without regard of danger) his juſt
cauſe, and they bring the Ark with them, for conſulting with
Gods oracle if neceſſity required: for encouragement alſo of the
people that were with <hi>David</hi> that Gods preſence would be with
them, whereof the Ark was a ſymbole: and for making prayers
for <hi>David,</hi> and his deliverance. Whom <hi>David</hi> directs back again,
upon three ſeverall grounds. 1. His ſubmiſſion to God, and hope
of returne to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 2. From the prieſts office which he will
have them to attend there. And 3. From a better ſervice they
may do him there, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. Whereupon they do obey.</p>

2. <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Davids</hi> flieing for the time from the furie of his
ſonne, and his followers. Shewes the great care he had of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
preſervation, both thoſe who were with himſelfe, and thoſe
alſo who were deceived and miſled by <hi>Abſolom:</hi> and that, though
he had a good cauſe, with many to defend it by force of Armes;
and was a skilfull, valiant, and victorious Prince himſelfe, yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then he will hazard ſo much blood, and ſo many lives of
the Lords people, he will cede for the time, and flie from unjuſt
furie, and preferre that which is <hi>Salus populi</hi> and <hi>ſuprema lex</hi> to
his own particular ſtanding. A worthy example of a pious and
prudent Prince, which ſerves to condemne them who for their
own ſtanding and preferment, care not to involve Kingdomes, and
Commonwealths into moſt cruell warres, and to ſhed oceans of
blood with the expence alſo of millions of Chriſtian men's lives.
As we read in thoſe battles betweene <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> the
bloody warres alſo of many <hi>Popes</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes,
and as we ſee the bloody miſeries of this age every where teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>David</hi> feares and flies, yet deſpaires not, for the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of true fortitude are preſumptuous confidence, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
diffidence: the mideſt being moderate feare with hope: the
one whereof breeds tempting of God, and diffidence is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of deſpaire. Therefore let men in afflictions feare God
as a puniſher of ſinne in juſtice, but yet hope in God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>4. Where <hi>David</hi> ſaies to his ſervants, <hi>make ſpeed to depart,
leſt Abſolom over take us ſuddenly, and ſmite the Citie with the
edge of the ſword.</hi> We ſee, that it is the part of a prudent Prince,
or any other who are wiſe: timely to fore ſee, and prevent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
before they come, and neither to contemne appearances of
what may befall, or to ſleep in careleſs ſecurity, as thoſe of <hi>Laiſh</hi>
did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. 27. As alſo to be carefull for the good and ſafety
of their people.</p>
                  <p>5. We ſee here alſo <hi>Davids</hi> condition contrary to <hi>Abſoloms,
Davids</hi> being like a comedy, with a ſad and ſorrowfull begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but having a happy deliverance and joyfull ending, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Abſoloms</hi> condition is like a tragedy, a pompous and joyfull
beginning, with joyfull acclamation as King, and a great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119120:115"/>
but a tragicall and ſorrowfull ending, and even ſuch
is the caſe, and condition of the Godly, and the wicked: as we
ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. And in the example of <hi>Joſeph, David</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> the
<hi>rich glutton</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp;c. And here of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſolom:</hi>
therefore let no man judge of the Godly by their croſſes and
afflictions, that they who are not in Gods favour are unhappy,
neither let any man Judge of Gods Works by their beginnings, as
the former examples may teach us: but look to their end; and as
we may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>David</hi> has a good cauſe, but few followers, in reſpect
of thoſe who followed <hi>Abſolom,</hi> with whom was the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. and 13. And yet in the end is
victorious: even ſo it fareth oftimes with good cauſes. And
in ſpeciall with the cauſe of God, which in the time eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of Antichriſts prevailing (as before in the time of <hi>Eliah,</hi>
under <hi>Ahab</hi>) had few followers: therefore compared unto
two witneſſes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. And as it was likewiſe when the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
hereſie ſo prevailed, that as <hi>Jeronie</hi> teſtifies, the whole
world groaned under the ſame, and wondered that it was
turned <hi>Arrian:</hi> but in the end, the truth has prevailed, and
in the end ſhall prevaile more and more: when that myſticall
whoore ſhall be made naked, and her fleſh eaten, and ſhe burnt
with fire, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16. <hi>and</hi> 18. 8.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>Davids</hi> leaving of his ten Concubines to keep
the houſe, (which was his only intention) was not without
divine and ſecret providence, that by their defiling by <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
the Lords Word by <hi>Nathan</hi> might be fulfilled, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 11. and
his polygamie puniſhed. So that many things falls out beyond
mens intention or expectation for the puniſhment of ſinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we ſee not the finger of God, and performance of his word,
till they come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. In <hi>Davids</hi> ſending back the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi>
with the Ark to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we ſee the Juriſdiction that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Magiſtrate has over Church-men, according to that <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi>
precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. To command them to do their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and puniſh them if they tranſgreſs, either in negligence in
their ſpirituall function, or againſt the lawes of the republick: as
we ſee in <hi>Salomon</hi> puniſhing <hi>Abiathar</hi> for his conſpiracy with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniah,</hi>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:119120:116"/>

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> likewiſe in puniſhing the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>David</hi> commanding the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> to returne to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
to execute their office.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>David</hi> likewiſe for his preſervation, relyes only on the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, and that God would work that work without the
preſence of the Ark, albeit it was the externall ſacrament and
ſigne of Gods preſence, whereupon we ground this generall. That
grace or remiſſion of ſinnes, comes from the free mercy of God in
Chriſt, and is not tyed to ſacraments: which as they ought not
to be contemned, being neceſſary, as we ſay, <hi>neceſſitate precepti:</hi>
but not that they are ſo neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate medii:</hi> that grace and
ſalvation ſhould be thought to be tyed unto them.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. Where <hi>David</hi> ſaies, <hi>Let the Lord do to me what
ſeemeth good to him.</hi> In him we ſee the duty of a Godly ſoule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any croſs to ſubmit humbly to the good will of God, as our
Saviour ſaid, <hi>Let this cup paſs from me, notwithſtanding not my will
be done but thine, O Father:</hi> and indeed this is the work of one tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbled and mortified, and is a preſage of comfort and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the end.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30. Likewiſe in <hi>Davids</hi> going bare-foot and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he went: we ſee his right apprehenſion that this proceeded
from the hand of God, correcting him for his former ſins, before
whom therefore he humbles himſelfe after this manner. Which
teaches us the right uſe of corrections that they ſerve us as a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogy</hi>
to repentance for our ſinnes, <hi>for there is no evill</hi> (towit, of
puniſhment) <hi>in the Citie which God does not,</hi> and therefore as <hi>Hoſ.</hi>
6. 1. <hi>We ſhould turne to him who ſmites us, and whoſe fatherly hand
chaſtiſes us for our good,</hi> as we ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. And therefore the
Lord uſes bloody tyrants, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria,
Herod,</hi> and others as <hi>Abſolom</hi> here, but as rods in his hand
to execute his judgments, as he does ſometimes inſenſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
againſt the wicked, as water, fire, the aire, the ſea, the earth,
and the baſeſt creatures, as lice and vermine, wherewith he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Herod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. Having ſpoken and obſerved all the former
in <hi>David:</hi> we ſee next in the perſons of his Servants a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and worthy example of fidelity to their Maſter, and of
obedience to his juſt commands, with all promptitude being
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119120:116"/>
ready, and offering to do what he ſhould direct them. The like
we ſee in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. And which is injoyned to
all others, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. In <hi>Ittai</hi> the <hi>Gittite</hi> and his 600. men that were
ſtrangers, their conſtant reſolution to abide with <hi>David,</hi> and take
part with him in life and death, when his own Son had unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
rebelled againſt him, and ſought after both his life, and eſtate.
We ſee, and collect an argument of courage and comfort to the
godly afflicted, that when thoſe who are neereſt foreſake them,
or become their Enemies, the Lord will never forſake them, but
ſtirre up ſtrangers to aſſiſt them, and be their trueſt friends, and
comforters. As we ſee in <hi>Joſeph</hi> when he was hated, and ſold by
his brethren, in the friendſhip likewiſe of <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath</hi> to
<hi>David,</hi> when he was perſecuted by his own Father in Law <hi>Saul,</hi>
of <hi>Jethro</hi> likewiſe Prince of <hi>Midian</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was put
in ſuch danger by one of his own people, of <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi>
favour to <hi>Jeremie, chap.</hi> 38. And of <hi>Ittai's</hi> aſſiſtance here
of <hi>David</hi> in his greateſt diſtreſſe and deſertion. For the Lord has
the hearts of all men in his hands, and if he be our friend we
ſhall not want friends.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>and</hi> 30. In the people, and all the countries
weeping with <hi>David.</hi> We ſee the tender ſympathy that we ſhould
have with thoſe who are in diſtreſſe, eſpecially who neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
us in any ſort of relation, as we are commanded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
15. to weep with them who weep, and to rejoyce with them that
rejoyce: and a wo is denounced againſt ſuch who rejoyce when
the Church of God, or the members thereof are in diſtreſſe, or
who regard not the affliction of <hi>Joſeph, Amos</hi> 6. 6. This want
of ſympathy ſhewing that they are not of the communion of
Saints.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. In the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> their loyall cleaving
to <hi>David.</hi> We ſee a worthy and imitable example for all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
perſons to follow, in ſiding with a good cauſe laying
aſide all feare of danger, and in being exemplar to all others
by word, and practiſe of love, &amp; loyalty to their Prince, and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne

From the</hi> 31. <hi>verſe to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then <hi>Davids</hi> piety appears in theſe two actions. 1. In his
ſorrowfull weeping for his ſinnes, that had procured this ſharp
correction, which we ſee alſo expreſt in the ſixt Pſalme and the
other penitentialls. The manner of which his humiliation is not
onely ſet down by his weeping. But by the other circumſtances.
1. of the place, towit, while he is going by the aſcent of mount
<hi>Olivet.</hi> 2. By the manner of his going barefoot. 3. With his head
covered. Which was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtome of mourners, as we ſee,
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>and chap.</hi> 13. 12. 4. It is deſcribed from the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of this weeping by the whole people that were with him, ſo
that it might have been called, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 11. A great mourning
to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> 2. His piety appears in his prayer which he
made to God. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 31, Upon the hearing that <hi>Achitophel</hi> was
joyned with the conſpirators, that the Lord would turne his
wicked counſell into fooliſhnes.</p>
               <p>Next, <hi>Davids</hi> prudence herein appears that with prayer he
uſes the means whereby <hi>Achitophels</hi> counſell may be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore when <hi>David</hi> was come to the top of the mount,
where he worſhipped God (being ſtill exerciſed in piety and
prayer) and that <hi>Huſhai</hi> the <hi>Archite, Davids</hi> faithfull friend and
Counſellour, came to him in a ſorrowfull and lamenting manner,
he ſends him back to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for three reaſons. 1. If he
ſhould paſſe on with him, he ſhould be no benefit, but on the

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119120:117"/>
his ſervice to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> he might do him better ſervice by defeating
and countermining the crafty Counſell of <hi>Achitophel.</hi> 3. He
might be a good <hi>Intelligencer</hi> unto him, by revealing whatſoever
he heard in <hi>Abſoloms</hi> houſe to the Prieſts <hi>Zadok,</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiathar,</hi> who

himſelf greatly, and has his recourſe to God by
prayer, who onely could deliver him, and overthrow the courſes

of <hi>Achitophel</hi> to fooliſhnes. Where we ſee the great overruling
power of God in all humane affaires, that he not onely knowes
the ſecreteſt counſells of men, as we ſee, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 9. But alſo
that he can diſappoint them, and turne their wiſeſt counſells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

did, ſo that as he prayes to God, <hi>to turne his counſell into fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
ſo he uſes alſo the ordinary means to have it ſo done. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we learn, that with prayer to God for any good, corporall,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119120:118"/>
or ſpirituall, or avoyding any evill in either we ſhould not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

               <p>IN this Chapter we have. 1. What befalls to <hi>David</hi> in his fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
both from a profeſſed friend <hi>Ziba,</hi> and from a profeſſed

Next we have <hi>Abſoloms</hi> proceedings after his entrie in <hi>Iervſalem.</hi>
1. In accepting of <hi>Huſhai Davids</hi> fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd. And 2. in committing
that inceſtuous fact with his Fathers Concubines by the wicked
counſell of <hi>Achitophel. From the</hi> 15. <hi>verſe to the end.</hi> So that this
whole Chapter comprehends fouractions, the firſt between <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Ziba,</hi> the ſecond between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Shemei,</hi> the third,
between <hi>Abſolom</hi> and <hi>Huſhai,</hi> and the fourth between <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
and his Fathers Concubines.</p>
               <p>This firſt action of <hi>Davids</hi> between him &amp; <hi>Ziba,</hi> is amplified by
theſe circumſtances. 1. Of the time, when <hi>David</hi> was paſt a little
the top of the hill <hi>Olivet,</hi> which comprehends alſo the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet upon that mount in his journey towards <hi>Iordan,</hi> and

                     </gap>phiboſheth,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. And <hi>David</hi> the King,
<hi>Ziba</hi> his action being his meeting <hi>David</hi> now on his journey
with his Army, with a couple of Aſſes loded with proviſion for
him, and them: a ſmall gift indeed if we conſider either the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the King, or number of his Army; but yet, great, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the preſent neceſſity and condition of <hi>David</hi> now flying in
haſte, &amp; deſerving thanks if it had been offered of his own goods
and of an honeſt minde, and not as a ſhare. 1. To abuſe the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the King. And 2. by this means craftily to hunt after
a greater prey, which was the whole eſtate of his Maſter, and ſo
the ground and motive of his coming was neither love to <hi>David,</hi>
nor yet liberality, but ſelf love and coveteouſneſſe: for ſatiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, upon <hi>Davids</hi> asking him, where <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Jonathans</hi> Sonne was, moſt falſly he calumniats and delaites
him, as one who abode at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon expectation to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to his Grandfather <hi>Saul's</hi> his Kingdome, and ſo he accuſes
him of the greateſt and moſt incenſing crime of leſema jeſty, where
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119120:119"/>
as, like a faithfull and honeſt ſervant, he ſhould rather excuſe his
Maſters abode at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe (being lame) of his inability.
Whereupon followed <hi>Davids</hi> raſh action of adjudging to the
falſe accuſer the whole eſtate and poſſeſſions of <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accuſed. Wherein he commits theſe groſſe errours. 1. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
the party accuſed, before he be heard. 2. He is credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of a falſe report without any triall of the truth thereof. 3. He
bereaves an innocent man of his whole eſtate, and gives it to an
unjuſt calumniator and lier. 4. He incourages calumniatours here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to follow <hi>Ziba's</hi> example upon like hope of reward. 5. Having
received a gift from the accuſer and thereafter giving ſentence in
his favours, he gave an ill example in this, and in all the former, to
inferiour judges. And 6. being in choler and paſſion upon <hi>Ziba's</hi>
report, he pronounces a raſh and unjuſt ſentence, whereby he
gaines nothing but a baſe and ungratefull flatterers thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>The ſecond action is between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Shimei. From the</hi> 5.
<hi>verſe to the</hi> 15. Which injurious fact of <hi>Shimei</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> is
amplified by the circumſtances. 1. Of the place, <hi>Bahurim</hi> a City
choſen by <hi>David</hi> after his firſt travells to reſt and refreſh himſelf
and his army in being ſore weary, as we ſee, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. 2. Of
the perſone, <hi>Shimei</hi> by name, and a man of the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> his
old Enemy, whoſe malice before did lurk, and now upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of <hi>Abſoloms</hi> rebellion burſts forth againſt <hi>David.</hi> 3. The
manner of this injurious fact is, both by word and deed, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>David</hi> by word, and by deed caſting ſtones at him as a dog,
and at his followers, the particular words of whoſe curſing is
ſet down, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. By ingemination ſaying, <hi>come out, come out,</hi>
ſhewing thereby the vehemency of his malice and paſſion, as if
he would ſay, lay down thy wrongfull title of King, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to be thruſt out juſtly therefore. 2. In place of due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
he calles him by two vile titles, a bloody man, and a
man of <hi>Belial,</hi> that is, a moſt wicked man, or which is by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
a rebellions libertine. 3. He declared that it is
the hand of a juſt revenging God that was puniſhing him, for
the bood of <hi>Saul</hi> and his houſe, and for the uſurpation of his
Kingdome, and therefore by <hi>Lex talionis</hi> the Lord has ſtirred
up his own Sonne to take the Kingdome from him, as he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119120:119"/>
it from <hi>Saul</hi> his Father in Law, and from his houſe, ſo that
he was taken in his own ſnare, and was done unto as he had
done to others. Upon which injurious fact of <hi>Shimei, Abiſhai
Iocabs</hi> Brother is ſo incenſed that he offers to be avengend upon
him by taking off his head, from doing whereof <hi>David</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
him, and diſſents thereto, by three reaſons. 1. Affirning
that he looks on <hi>Shimei</hi> onely as the inſtrument, but on God as
the ſupream cauſe, correcting him ſo for his ſinnes, and againſt
whom he was not to repine, but abide what his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
was and patiently to ſubmit thereto. The ſecond reaſon,
is taken from compariſon, that ſeeing his Sonne who was come
of his loynes, was ſeeking his life, much more might <hi>Shimei</hi> that
<hi>Benjamite</hi> do as he did, and ſo if he ſuffered the greater injury,
much more ought he to ſuffer the leſſe patiently. The third,
is from the fruit that by Gods providence, that fact of <hi>Shimei</hi>
(farre contrary to his intention) might bring forth, that the
Lord would look on his affliction, and requite good for his
curſing that day. By which arguments of diſſwaſion <hi>David</hi> mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies
the heart of <hi>Abiſhai</hi> and his ſervants, and abates their rage.
Notwithſtanding whereof <hi>Shimei</hi> ſtill inſiſts in his injurious fact,
untill <hi>David</hi> and his men came to <hi>Baharim</hi> where they were to
refreſh their weary bodies.</p>
               <p>Onely there remaines one doubt to ſolve, before we come to
the obſervations, which is this, it is ſaid by <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei
(Verſ.</hi> 11.) <hi>Was bidden by God to curſe David.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would appear, if <hi>Shimeis</hi> curſing was ſinnefull, that God
were the Author of ſinne. Whereunto I anſwer. 1. That
hereby is not meant, that <hi>Shimei</hi> had any commandement from
God, as a warrant whereon he could grond that ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
action of his, (which doubtles he had then alleadged, and
afterward when he excuſed himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.) Becauſe in
Gods Word an expreſſe commandment is in the contrary,
<hi>Ezod.</hi> 22. 28. Saying, <hi>Thou ſhall not revile the Gods, nor curſe
the ruler of thy people,</hi> and God cannot be contradictour to
himſelf, and therefore theſe words, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>The Lord hath
ſaid unto him, curſe.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>The Lord hath bidden him,</hi>
are not to be taken properly as any ſuch warrant of Gods Word,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:119120:120"/>
or commandement to do ſo, but onely to ſhew how <hi>David</hi> took
that curſing, as a correction for his ſinne from a juſt God. See
the like <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 6. as if he had ſaid to <hi>Shimei,</hi> curſe <hi>David,</hi>
or, as he had bidden him curſe, which made him to be ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
then and afterward, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 23. And not to ſuffer <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai</hi>
to revenge it. 2. In this ſinnefull action of <hi>Shimei's</hi> (as in
others the like) we muſt conſider that theſe three have a hand,
and each one their ſeverall ends; towit, Satan, ſtirring up
<hi>Shimei's</hi> lurking malice now to break forth in curſing, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtones at <hi>David,</hi> whoſe end herein was to afflict and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>David</hi> more and more now in his diſtreſſe: the next is <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi>
obeying Satans inſtigation, acteth this ſinnefull deed out
of the hatred of his heart. Whoſe end therefore herein, was
wraithfull revenge. The third is God making uſe of this their
ſinnefull action to the correction of his ſervant, whoſe end was
his own glory and his ſervants good. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſpeaks of his
brethrens wrong done to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. Ye thought evill
againſt me (ſayes he) but God meant it unto good: the like
may be ſaid of <hi>Amnons</hi> inceſt with <hi>Tamar,</hi> and <hi>Abſoloms</hi> with
his Fathers Concubines, as alſo <hi>Abſoloms</hi> murther of <hi>Amnon,</hi>
and his rebellion now againſt his Father, that <hi>Nathans</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
concerning both might be fulfilled, and in like manner in
Chriſts delivering up to death, wherein God had an hand, and
is ſaid to have done it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. For the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and Satan had an hand in it who entred into <hi>Judas</hi> heart,
out of malice to Chriſt, and as Enemy to mans redemption, and
<hi>Judas</hi> had a hand in it, for his owne wicked end, to ſatisfy his
covetouſneſſe. Theſe wicked ends in theſe two wicked actours
making the act ſinnefull in them, which in God directing it to
his glory, and mans good is the greateſt teſtimony of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
power, and love to mankinde. So likewiſe in <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 21.
and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 5, 6. The ſame is evident, as here in <hi>Shimei's</hi> fact,
God wills that, as <hi>Davids</hi> chaſtiſement, which he hates, as <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meis</hi>
wickedneſſe, ſo that wicked men are never the freer from
guilt and puniſhment, for that hand which the holy God has in
their ſinnefull actions.</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. IN <hi>Ziba</hi> and <hi>Shimej, Abſolom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> recorded in this
Chapter. We ſee the memory of their wicked deeds dye not,
as themſelves did: but the ſame ſurvives to the poſterity in the
publick regiſter of ſacred hiſtory: as on the contrary the good
deeds of the Godly, ſurvive in the ſame regiſter to their eternall
praiſe, and for others imitation: as it is ſaid of <hi>Maryes</hi> breaking
of the box of oyntment, which ſhe powred on Chriſts head, that
it ſhould be recorded, whereſoever the Goſpell ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Which ſhould ſerve to the diſſwading of men from doing of
evill, and to the encouragement of well doers, eſpecially when
they conſider at the laſt day, how both good, and evill works
ſhall be remembred, and have their ſeverall rewards given to
them accordingly. And how they ſurvive men even in this life,
as it is ſaid <hi>poſt fata, facta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Ziba</hi> under a faire pretence, and profeſſion of love
to <hi>David:</hi> but out of ſelfe-love only to himſelfe, hunts after his
own gaine and preferment. Which ſhewes the diſpoſition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
crafty worldlings, who under a faire ſhew of religion to God,
or love and reſpect to others, have their own private and ſelfiſh
ends which they propoſe: making their gaine to be Godlineſs, but
not Godlineſs to be gaine; and pretending love to others by their
ſmaller gifts, which like crafty fiſhers, or fowlers, they uſe as baits
only to attaine to greater, being (as one ſaies) more skilfull in
the <hi>Ablative</hi> than liberall in the <hi>Dative,</hi> and like that woman who
ſwept the houſe, not for love of clean-lines, but to find out the
loſt groat, pretending love to religion and reformation, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
their owne ſacrilegious gaine, and ambitious prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Ziba</hi> likewiſe to attain to his forenamed end, by
calumnies and falſe accuſation, he ſowes ſedition between <hi>David,</hi>
and his loyall and true ſubject <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> Which ſhewes that
they who are greedy of gaine, and preferment, will let looſe reines
to all ſort of wickedneſs, whereby they may attain to their end,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119120:121"/>
even to take away the life of man. As we ſee in <hi>Judas,</hi> and here
in <hi>Ziba</hi> accuſing his Maſter of leſs Majeſty and treaſon.</p>
                  <p>4. In <hi>Ziba</hi> likewiſe we ſee the pattern of a wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
ſervant, leaving his impotent and lame Maſter, at ſuch a time
of danger, to which he did not only expoſe him, but alſo did
back-bite him falſly, and ſought himſelfe to be poſſeſſour, and
owner of his Maſters eſtate: whereof before he had the truſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and government. So little truſt is to be had in men, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
worldlings, and ſuch as want the feare of God.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>David</hi> who had overcome the ſword, of many
and mighty enemies before, and <hi>Abſoloms</hi> great Army hereafter.
Yet is himſelfe overcome by a ſmall gift, and a flattering lying
tongue of <hi>Ziba.</hi> Which ſhewes how dangerous, and of what great
power inſinuation by gifts, and flattery is, even to the beſt: and
that oftimes what may not be obtained by force, is obtained by
fraud, which made Satan after his perſecution of the Church,
<hi>like a reed Dragon, to turn himſelfe next into an Angel of light:</hi>
and the vicar of his power to be horned like the lamb, though
he ſpake like the Dragon. Whereby he attained to ſo great and
univerſall a following, as we ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. The like effect of
which fraud and flattery, we ſee alſo in Satans deceiving of our
firſt parents.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>David</hi> without triall of the truth, or hearing firſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
accuſed, pronounces through raſh crudelity an unjuſt ſentence,
againſt juſt <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> in favours of an unjuſt calumniator,
and ſo ſinneth againſt the duty of a juſt judge or Magiſtrate.
Which ſhould teach all judges, or men in place, and power, to
beware of raſh credulity, and to trye well before they truſt, or
decree in judgment.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>David</hi> under the rod ſuffers wrong patiently, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame does wrong unjuſtly. Which ſhewes unto us the
frailty, and infirmities that are in the beſt, that none ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in their own ſtrength: but be in every eſtate, and at all times
watchfull and humble.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. In this ſecond action between <hi>Shimej</hi> and <hi>David,</hi>
we ſee, 1. When King <hi>David</hi> came to <hi>Bahurim,</hi> there to refreſh
himſelfe, and his men: as we ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. in place of reſt which
he looked for. Behold new trouble, a railing <hi>Shimej</hi> perſecutes
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119120:121"/>
him, and his followers: both with tongue, and hand. So that
we ſee, as is ſaid, <hi>many are the troubles of the righteous:</hi> and like
<hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers, one comes on the back of another, as wave fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
wave: and as <hi>Jacob</hi> was no ſooner rid of <hi>Laban,</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, but he heares of <hi>Eſau</hi> coming againſt him, and in
the mean time encounters with an Angel that wreſtles with him.
No reſt then to be expected here, till after our dyeing in the Lord,
we ſettle in our heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> Rev. 14. 13.</p>
                  <p>9. This <hi>Shimej</hi> being a man of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> his hid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
againſt <hi>David,</hi> which lurked in the time of <hi>Davids</hi> proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
breaks out now by curſing, and caſting ſtones at <hi>David,</hi> in
the time of his adverſity, which ſhewes not only what a wicked
treaſure, and unclean ground the heart of man is, which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
and preſerveth what Satan ſhewes therein, till occaſion
offer of manifeſtation, as we ſee in <hi>Cain</hi> againſt <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom</hi>
againſt <hi>Amnon.</hi> But likewiſe we ſee that adverſity diſcovers,
who are true friends, as we ſee thoſe was to <hi>David,</hi> who are
mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>and Chap.</hi> 17. 27. and who are enemies, as
<hi>Shemej</hi> was here, and <hi>Achitophel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Shimej</hi> curſeth and caſteth ſtones at <hi>David,</hi> and
ſo perſecutes him, both with tongue and hand. Which ſheweth
what perſecution in like manner the Godly may expect at the
hands of the wicked, as the Prophets found, and our Saviour
the Prince of Prophets: and as he told his Apoſtles, that they
ſhould find, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>and Joh.</hi> 16. 33. And therefore not to
think it ſtrange, nor to care for the ſcourge of their tongue, or
cauſeleſs curſing or reviling, ſo that the Lord bleſs, and that they
have his approbation, and of a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. Where <hi>Shimej</hi> ſaies, <hi>that God had returned upon
him all the blood of the houſe of Saul, and delivered the Kingdome
to his ſonne Abſolom.</hi> We ſee that malice ſo blinds the wicked that
they moſt wrongfully cenſure the Lords doings in afflicting or
trying his own, and as if they were of Gods counſell, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that to be the cauſe of their ſufferings, which their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hearts ſuggeſts, and is not the cauſe indeed, and by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
they judge of the cauſe, and juſtifies or condemnes the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:119120:122"/>
12. Where he ſaies, that the Lord had delivered the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
into <hi>Abſoloms</hi> hand. We ſee how fooliſh they are, who
meaſure Gods doings by their beginnings, and do not attend
the end: as we ſee in the ſteps of <hi>Joſephs</hi> fore propheſied advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and here in <hi>Davids</hi> ſad condition, in reſpect of <hi>Abſoloms</hi>
great following, and hopes, which made <hi>Shimej</hi> ſay that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was delivered to him. The contrary whereof was ſhortly
ſeen thereafter.</p>
                  <p>13. Whereas in like manner he attributes to God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
of the blood of <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe upon <hi>David,</hi> and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of the Kingdome into <hi>Abſoloms</hi> hand. We ſee the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of wicked men, who dare aſcribe to God, what the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hearts of men doe hatch, and their wicked hands for their
wicked ends ſeek to performe, and ſo to make him, who is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it ſelfe, and hates all iniquity, to be not only acceſſary, but
author of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Abiſhaj</hi> being incenſed by this fact of <hi>Shimej,</hi>
out of a carnall humour, offers to revenge this wrong done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>David.</hi> Where we ſee that a good cauſe, is not to be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by bad meanes, as here by carnall revenge and cruelty;
which was alſo the diſciples fault, who would have had fire
come downe from heaven, upon the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> for their
not receiving of Chriſt: but as the cauſe is good, or <hi>bona,</hi>

a revenge may be juſt, ſo it ſhould be ſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>Abiſhaj</hi> looked onely to the ſtone (as it
were) an inſtrument, but <hi>David</hi> looked higher to the hand,
that was the ſupreame caſter, and chaſtiſer of him, as all the
Godly do, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 21. Which is the ground of
their patience under ſufferings, and makes the ſame a pedago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
to leade them to repentance. Therefore <hi>David</hi> gives way
meekly, rather to his own humiliation, then to the puniſhment
of another.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. Where <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his own ſonnes ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up againſt him, to ſeek his life: and therefore much more
might <hi>Shimej</hi> do it. We ſee that domeſtick croſſes, and thoſe
of neareſt relation, are the greateſt and ſharpeſt of any: and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119120:122"/>
ſuch as may juſtly make men, to be the more patient in leſſer,
ſo that herein <hi>David</hi> gaines by it, and it is the advantage of
great croſſes, that they ſwallow up the leſſer, and though a
weak heart faint with every addition of trouble, yet the ſtrong in
grace do not ſo.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. Where <hi>David</hi> ſaies, it may be that God would
look on his affliction, and requite good for <hi>Shimeis</hi> curſing that
day. We ſee <hi>Davids</hi> faith and confidence in the Lords goodneſs
towards him, even when he is many waies now ſharply cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizing
him: ſo ſharp is the eye of faith, that through the darkeſt
cloud, it can perceive the light of the ſun-ſhine of the Lords coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
which <hi>David</hi> ever did ſo highly eſteeme, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. Alſo
the beſtowing of temporall favours go at peradventure (it may
be) but eternall are infallible.</p>
                  <p>18. Alſo we ſee here the truth of that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>That
all things work together for the beſt to them who feare him:</hi> even
the curſing of a wicked <hi>Shimei,</hi> as the hatered likewiſe of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi>
brethren, and their ſelling of him did to him. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that the wicked are no more bent, and ready to do evill
to the Godly, but God is more bent, and ready to do them
good, as <hi>David</hi> ſhortly found by experience after this, even as
he projected.</p>
                  <p>19. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Shimei</hi> being thus ſpared, he continueth and
increaſeth in his curſing, and caſting of ſtones, abuſing ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
lenity and patience: as the wicked do alſo the Lords, which
ſhould leade them to repentance. So that the wicked are like
the Waſp, that gathereth poyſon out of that, from which the
Bee gathereth hony, and make the worſt uſe of beſt offices, done
unto them by Gods ſervants, or others: and becauſe of impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they continue in ſinne and iniquity, as all evill natures growe
preſumptuous upon forbearance, whereas good are the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Mercy then has need to be guided with wiſdome, leſt it

by giving Counſell. 1. For ſecuring the rebellion in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance

               <p>Firſt then, for the ſecuring, and continuance of this rebellion, his
Counſell is to commit inceſt with his Fathers concubines, that

friend <hi>David</hi> in diſtreſs. We ſee howſoever his judgment was
pregnant, to note the ſinne of ingratitude in another, and to
tax the ſame, yet he ſees it not in a greater meaſure, being <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
ſonne, and in a groſſer manner of rebellion, in himſelfe.
Where we obſerve, that every man is ready like the <hi>Phariſees,
To ſpye the mote in their neighbours eye, but not the beame in their

3. In <hi>Abſoloms</hi> accuſation, we ſee alſo who is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a true friend, towit, he only, who not only in proſperity:
but alſo in adverſity proves ſo, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> and as

                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Achitophel</hi> gives counſell to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> to go
into his Fathers Concubines, that by inceſtuous fact all hope of
reconciliation with his Father might be obſtructed. Where we
ſee that prophane hearts, ſo contrives the plots of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt Gods law, as if there were no God, or over ruling
power, to croſs their deſignes, or to puniſh them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this foole (though otherwiſe accounted) <hi>had ſaid in his
heart there was no God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The ſcope of this Counſell, we ſee was to foment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the flame of diſcord, between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſolom:</hi> but
not to quench the ſame, which ſhewes unto us Satans nature in
his inſtruments, and as he firſt divided between God and man,
and afterward between man and man, as between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
&amp;c.</hi> So he continues: whereas God is the God of peace
ſo are his Children peaceable, as we ſee between <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Lot,</hi> and peace makers, as we ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                  <p>6. Where he ſaies, that by ſo doing, the hands of all who
were with <hi>Abſolom,</hi> ſhould be ſtrong. We ſee the blind folly of
the wicked, who think that to ſinne, is the way to proſper:
whereas <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 3. and in the examples of the holy Patriarch's,
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> and Godly Kings, we ſee the contrary, and as is ſhewne
to us, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 7.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Abſolom</hi> is counſelled by <hi>Achitophel,</hi> to commit
inceſt with his Fathers concubines, as <hi>Amnon</hi> was, how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
inceſt with his own Siſter: both Counſellours prevaile, and
both who were counſelled, obey his wicked counſell to their own
deſtruction. Where we ſee that it is as eaſy to one (wanting grace
and Gods Word and ſpirit to be their Counſellours) to take ill
counſell: as it is to them who give it, and proneſſe to villany in
great men, want never either projectours to deviſe, or <hi>Paraſites</hi>
like <hi>Doeg,</hi> to execute the moſt odious ſinnes, at leaſt to excuſe
them, and ſo farre God gives way to their ſinnes, as their ſinnes
may prove plagues to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>8. The tent is ſpred on the top of the houſe, and <hi>Abſolom</hi> goes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:119120:124"/>
in to his Fathers, Concubines in the ſight of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And ſo
that is fulfilled, which was threatned by <hi>Nathan, Chap.</hi> 12. 12.
So that the Counſell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and fact of <hi>Abſolom</hi> have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the judgement of God. Where we may admire the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God that can uſe the worſt of evills well, and moſt juſtly
make the ſinnes of men his executioners.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counſell in theſe
dayes was counted as <hi>the oracle of God.</hi> We ſee that great parts
miſimployed proves moſt miſchievous, as leaning, eloquence,
worldly wiſdome and the like, and when wickneſſe is armed with
wit and power like <hi>Nilus</hi> it overfloweth all the banks, ſo that
great need have they who have great parts, to ſeek the ſanctified
uſe of them, and this makes our condition the more dangerous
that we have to deal daily with a powerfull, and ſubtile Enemy
Satan, and therefore, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 31. In the caſe of
<hi>Achitophel,</hi> we ought to be devout in prayer, and to watch as our
ſaviour exhorts us.</p>
                  <p>10. We ſee alſo in <hi>Achitophel</hi> that policy and grace, or piety,
lodge not ever under one roofe. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may ſay, <hi>Exod.</hi>
1. 10. <hi>Let us deal wiſely with them.</hi> While in the mean time
he was dealing fooliſhly, and wanting grace to ſeaſon and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy

whereat it is directed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. Towit the deſtruction of <hi>David,</hi>
and therefore as cruell as well as crafty counſell, as Satan is both.
2. To come to this deſired end, he aſſumes theſe ſure mediums.
1. Celerity and expedition, a thing moſt neceſſary to be uſed for
ſurpriſing of Enemies, and obtaining a ſpeedy Victory. 3. Thus
the end being reſolved, and the mean in generall being concluded,
he labours to proſecute the warre by arguments from facility
and utility. The facility is grounded upon the reaſons taken from
the circumſtances of perſons and times: the firſt perſon is himſelf,
as he ſhould ſay, this matter is ſo facill, that it needs not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the King; and that I appear not to be the mover of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to endanger themſelves, I offer my ſelf to execute that which
I Counſell, though my profeſſion be not military. The ſecond
perſwaſion is from the ſmall number, which he craves for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
in reſpect of <hi>Abſoloms</hi> great Army. The third reaſon is from
the eſtate of the adverſaries, whom he affirmes to be weary, and
weak. The fourth is from the time of his invaſion and ſurpriſall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the night time, when all are at reſt.</p>
               <p>Next, his arguments from utility are. 1. By this ſpeedy, and
unexpected invaſion the Enemy ſhall be put to flight, and every
one retire to his own home, leaving <hi>David</hi> deſtitute. 2. <hi>David</hi>
being ſo deſerted ſhall be eaſily killed, who is the head of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
3. Hereby the whole people ſhalbe reduced to <hi>Abſoloms</hi>
obedience, and ſo peace which ſhould be, the end of all warre ſhall
be eſtabliſhed, all which ſayings at firſt pleaſed <hi>Abſolom,</hi> well and
all the elders of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, followes the contrary Counſell of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> who being
interrogated, by Gods providence by <hi>Abſolom,</hi> he layes down the
contrary end in minde, and contrary mean to attain thereto: his
end being <hi>Davids</hi> preſervation, and the mean, being delay, which
to <hi>David</hi> being weary, was very advantagious, for perſwading
<hi>Abſolom</hi> to which delay, and taking his Counſell which he was to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119120:125"/>
give, he uſes a very artificiall oration, wherein 1. he refutes the
Counſell of <hi>Achitophel.</hi> And 2. confirmes his own reſolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which refutation, he uſes a preface; wherein he ſhewes, that he
denyes not but <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counſell is good, but not at this time:
and then ſhewes that this enterpriſe is not ſo eaſy as <hi>Achitophel</hi>
affirmed it to be, but on the contrary dangerous, by the reaſons
following. The firſt whereof is taken from the known and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
fortitude of <hi>David.</hi> 2. From <hi>Davids</hi> Army who were ſo
inraged like beares robbed of their whelps. 3. From <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that <hi>David</hi> had in the warres, knowing all the Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
thereof, and ſo being not onely valorous but wiſe, the two
properties of a complaet Generall. 4. From <hi>Davids</hi> ſubtilty,
that he would not be found in the night with the Army, but
lurk in ſome ſecret place, as he had ſometimes done when <hi>Saul</hi>
did perſecute him. 5. From the perill of the firſt overthrow of ſo
few whom <hi>Achitophel</hi> would lead, which commonly is interpreted
to be the preſage of future, and the loſſe of the whole cauſe, and
whereby it ſhall come to paſſe, that the hearts of the moſt valiant
(like Lyons) who are with <hi>Abſolom,</hi> when they hear thereof ſhall
melt, for all <hi>Iſrael</hi> knowes that <hi>David,</hi> and all who follow him are
valiant men.</p>
               <p>Unto which refutation of <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counſell he ſubjoynes
his own. 1. That <hi>Abſolom</hi> commit not the leading of the Army
to any Lieutenant, the matter being of ſo great concernment, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
people being the more encouraged by the preſence of their
Prince, as likewiſe it being fitter that the Prince, himſelf have the
honour of the Victory, which was a powerfull argument to a
young ambitious Prince. 2. He Counſells <hi>Abſolom</hi> to go, not
with a part of the Army, but with all the preparation he can,
and therefore that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> be aſſembled from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi>
wherein he uſes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Hyperbole, from the ſand of the Sea.</hi> And drawes
the matter to a delay. 3. He reaſons from the event, which
ſhould be a totall overthrow of <hi>David</hi> and his Army, if they were
found in the field, and if he ſhould get him to a City, that great
multitude ſhould, as it were with cordes, drawit into a River, and
not leave a ſtone thereof.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all followes <hi>Abſoloms,</hi> and all <hi>Iſraels</hi> approbation of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhais</hi>
Counſell, as better than <hi>Achitophels,</hi> the reaſon wherof is
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119120:126"/>
ſubjoyned. <hi>For the Lord had appointed to defeat the good Counſell
of</hi> Achitophel, <hi>to the intent that the Lord might, bring evill upon</hi>

are accuſtomed to call that good which is profitable for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 1. WIt and experience had taught <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that in
conjurations, and hoſtile invaſions, celerity uſes
to produce moſt ſucceſſefull events, and therefore he gives Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

                  <p>2. He offers his ſervice to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> not onely as a Counſellour,

in the camp, which has ever bene the bane both of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as alſo of the Church: when men cannot content and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themſelves within their own ſtation, but ambitiouſly aſpire
above or beyond the ſame, and will have a hand in all cauſes, and
rule both in Church and Commonwealth, as eſpecially the Popes
their practiſe has been, according to the ſaying of one, <hi>Ecce duo
gladii,</hi> and of too many others.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. He vants, and like another <hi>Goliah</hi> bragg's that he
will do much, without ſaying if God will, where we ſee the
truth of that which is ſpoken of the wicked, that God is not in
all their thoughts, but they preſume of their own ſtrength and
ſacrifice to their own net, which tendeth ever to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>4. He promiſes that he will come upon <hi>David</hi> unexpectedly,
and will make him afrayd and thereafter ſmite him, and put all
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119120:126"/>
his Army to flight, where we ſee the blind pride of the wicked
ſpeaking of events as if they were not in Gods hand, who is the
Lord of hoſtes, but as if events and the lives of Gods Children
were in their hands, <hi>Although they have not power of one hair of
their head without the good providence of God,</hi> and as <hi>Davids</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
teſtifies: As alſo as we ſee, <hi>Act</hi> 23. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. He ſayes likewiſe that he will come upon <hi>David</hi> while he is
weary and weakhanded, and in the night time, ſo that like a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and ſedulous Enemy, he reſolves to take hold of all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
and make uſe thereof againſt godly <hi>David</hi> to his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
The like ſubtile and ſedulous Enemy have all the godly,
Satan, who ſpies all his advantages of our weakneſſe, and makes
uſe thereof to ſurpriſe us, and bring us to deſtruction, as we may
ſee in <hi>Lot,</hi> in <hi>Zoar,</hi> in <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Beethſheba,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> denyall,
and other godly men. Let be in the wicked, which ſhould learn
us, to work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling, and to
watch and pray, as our ſaviour exhorts us.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. It is ſaid, that this wicked Counſell of <hi>Achitophels</hi>
of ſmiting the Father, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. Pleaſed <hi>Abſolom</hi> the Sonne well,
where we ſee the unnaturality of a wicked Sonne, ſeeking after
his life who gave him life, and that where grace is not, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of duty is to be expected from the neereſt naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
as we ſee in <hi>Cham, Cain,</hi> and here in <hi>Abſolom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. Though <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counſell pleaſed <hi>Abſolom,</hi> yet
he acquieſces not therein, but calles <hi>Huſhai</hi> and asks his Counſell
in this proſecution of the warre, whoſe Counſell he asked not
before, in going in to his Fathers Concubines. Where we ſee the
Lords mercifull providence towards <hi>Huſhai,</hi> and in him towards
the godly, preſerving them, from many ſnares wherin they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
might fall, as he did <hi>David</hi> from going with <hi>Achiſh</hi> againſt
<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. And <hi>Huſhai</hi> here from joyning in that wicked
Counſell of <hi>Achitophels</hi> for <hi>Abſoloms</hi> committing inceſt with his
Father Concubines. O happy then are they who rely on God.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. We ſee the modeſty, of <hi>Huſhai</hi> in relation to the
perſon of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> though he oppoſes his Counſell, or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
not denying, but he was a wiſe Counſellour, and that his
Counſell was good, but not at this time. Which ſhewes that in
diſputes, or differences of judgements, reflections on perſons, or
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119120:127"/>
bitterneſſe and the like ſhould not be uſed, but ſuch modeſty, as
verity may have place, the cauſe it ſelf handled, unity ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
charity ſhewn, humour and ſpleen avoyded, and the way
of reconciliation no wiſe obſtructed. Therefore <hi>Huſhai</hi> to ſweeten
his oppoſition, he yeilds the praiſe of wiſdome to his adverſary in
other Counſells, that he may have leave to deny it modeſtly in
this.</p>
                  <p>9. Yet in <hi>Huſhai's</hi> boldneſſe and freedome without fear in
oppoſing <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counſell. We learn, what ſhould be the like
in the ſervants of God in oppoſing themſelves with courage and
zeal againſt errour, and every wicked courſe which is againſt God,
his Church, people, and the Lords anointed.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Abſolom</hi> preferreth <hi>Huſhai's</hi> Counſell to <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophels,</hi>
as the better, <hi>Huſhai's</hi> Counſell being for <hi>Davids</hi> good, and
that which he rejected being for his own good. Where we ſee
the mercifull overruling and ſecret providence of God, for the
good of his own, &amp; comfort in adverſity, making all things work
together for their beſt, but to the worſt of their Enemies, <hi>Who
dig a pit for others wherein themſelves do fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. The likelieſt devices we ſee doe not alwayes ſucceed, God
finds the meanes to croſſe the Counſell of <hi>Achitophel</hi> by a leſſe
probable advice of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> who had neither ſo deep a head,
nor ſo ſure a Counſell as <hi>Achitophels,</hi> yet his tongue refutes <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi>
and diverts <hi>Abſolom, Huſhai's</hi> tongue then and <hi>Abſoloms</hi>
heart is guided by a power above their own, who as he gives ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
to the tongue, ſo he gives ſucceſſe to the words, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Huſhai</hi> ſhall prevail with <hi>Abſolom,</hi> that <hi>Abſolom</hi> prevail not
againſt <hi>David,</hi> he that worketh all in all things ſo diſpoſeth of
wicked men, that while they think that they moſt pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and think themſelves ſafeſt, then they overthrow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as we ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 10. And their diſappointment is
ſureſt.</p>
                  <p>12. The reaſon why <hi>Abſolom</hi> obeys <hi>Huſhai's</hi> Counſell, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>Achitophels</hi> (ſayes the text) was, that the Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to defeat the Counſell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> had
prayed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 31. <hi>And that the Lord might bring evill upon</hi>
Abſolom. Where we ſee, the efficacy of prayer, and that the
Lord doth hear and grant the prayers of his own, according to,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119120:127"/>
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. Which have a twofold effect, for the good of the
godly, and the evill of their Enemies, wherefore the armour of
his Church moſt prevalent, has been ever prayers and tears.</p>
                  <p>13. We ſee here likewiſe that the greateſt puniſhment of ſinne,
and which bringeth all other evill with it, is, when men are left
to the Spirit of errour, and to reject good Counſell, or courſes,
and to embrace the worſe.</p>

               <p>FOllowes now. 1. The action of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> and his complices,
revealers of his Counſell to <hi>David,</hi> and the circumſtances
thereof. 2. The Tragicall and ignominious death of <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
and the cauſes thereof. 3. The marching of both Armies over
<hi>Jordan,</hi> and the ſeverall encamping thereof. And 4. the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
of <hi>Davids</hi> Army and proviſion thereof.</p>
               <p>In the firſt action there are many actours. 1. <hi>Huſhai</hi> who is
the revealer of the Counſell, and firſt advertiſer, according to
his promiſe formerly made to <hi>David.</hi> 2. The two Prieſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
back, by <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to the
ſame purpoſe. 3. Their Sonnes <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be the beares of this revelation. 4. Two Women,
the one a wench, ſent by the Prieſts from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to their
Sonnes, swho abode at <hi>Enrogell</hi> the other a mans wife in <hi>Bahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim.</hi>
5. A young man diſcoverer of the Prieſts Sonnes. And 6. the
exploratours that were ſent by <hi>Abſolom</hi> to ſearch and apprehend
them.</p>
               <p>The next Hiſtory is, the Tragicall end of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> wherein
we have to conſider, ſeeing he was a man of ſuch wiſdome and
eſtimation; what were the cauſes moving him to runne to ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
a ſelf murther, which I ſhall reduce to three. 1. The guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conſcience of his irremiſſibile offences. 2. The fearfull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the rigour and juſt puniſhment, which he expected
from <hi>David.</hi> 3. The defeat of his Counſell and diſappointment
of his ambitious project. Reaſoning therefore thus with himſelf,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119120:128"/>
by <hi>Abſoloms</hi> receiving the Counſell of <hi>Huſhai Davids</hi> reall friend,
But <hi>Abſoloms</hi> diſſembled foe, I foreſee that he and his cauſe ſhall
periſh, But as for me, above all others my danger is then greateſt.
For 1. my conſcience condemnes me that I have given wicked
Counſell againſt God, my King, and the Commonwealth, and
perſwaded <hi>Abſolom</hi> to defile his fathers bed, and perſecute him to
death, and ſo am unworthy to be called an <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> 2. Though
I ſhould repent and crave pardon, yet I apprehend no favour but
juſtice to be executed upon me by <hi>David,</hi> as an open example to
all traitours before the World. And 3. though I were ſpared, yet
I cannot draw my ſelf to a private life, and live as one juſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced,
and diſcourted: therefore to eſchew all theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
I reſolve upon this onely remedy to execute my ſelf.
Upon which reſolution he departs, deſerts his Maſter and his
cauſe, returnes to his City of <hi>Gilo,</hi> diſpoſes upon his worldly
eſtate, and hangs himſelf, againſt the Law of God, of nature, and
of Nations.</p>
               <p>The third, is the Hiſtory of the paſſage of both Armies over
<hi>Iordan</hi> and their camping in <hi>Gilead,</hi> where it is remarked, <hi>Verſ.</hi>
22. That of all <hi>Davids</hi> Army that paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> when
they were muſtered by daylight, their lacked not a man, ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
was his troubles with this divine preſervation, and ſo they
came to <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> a City in <hi>Gilead,</hi> renowned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 2. By
the viſion of Angels which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw for his protection. At this
time alſo <hi>Abſolom</hi> collected his whole forces, who were like the
ſand of the Sea for number, and followed after <hi>David</hi> and his
ſmall number, and made <hi>Amaſa</hi> his generall, who was Siſters
Children with <hi>Joab,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> Siſters Sonne, whoſe ambition
made him make no conſcience of all theſe naturall conjunctions,
to joyn againſt <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt place, we have the Hiſtory of the furniture and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for <hi>Davids</hi> Army. 1. By whom. And 2. what it was. The
Perſons by whom are three, <hi>Shobi</hi> an <hi>Ammonite,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi>
placed (as is thought) in <hi>Hanuns</hi> place, who had abuſed his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours,
for which cauſe he meets now <hi>David</hi> with gratitude

of danger, nor hope of reward are diverted from their fidelity
and duty to <hi>David:</hi> but poſtponing both feare or favour of man,
they look to God, and a good conſcience, diſcharges a loyall
and faithfull duty to their Prince, even in his greateſt adverſity:
and leaves the ſucceſs to God. A good and imitable example to
all ſubjects and ſorts of men? but alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> few <hi>Huſhai's</hi> are now in
the civill eſtate, but many <hi>Achitophels,</hi> and few <hi>Zadoks</hi> in the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>Huſhaj</hi> diſcovers to <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi>
and their ſonnes, the Counſell that he had given to <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi>
and forewarnes him what to do. It is commendable then,
but the contrary, to reveale the Counſells or courſes of a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
to a lawfull Prince, and to forewarne him of his danger that
he may prevent the ſame.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. This meſſage of ſo great concernment, is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Prieſts, to their ſonnes at <hi>Eurogell</hi> by a maide: and
themſelves thereafter are hid from <hi>Abſoloms</hi> ſearchers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by a woman of <hi>Bahurim.</hi> Which teaches us, that God
who hath variety of inſtruments, both in heaven, and earth, yet
in his wiſdome ſometimes ſingles out weakeſt inſtruments, to
performe greateſt enterpriſes: that his power in them may be
ſeen, and he may have the glory of the work. Examples where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we may ſee in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter, preſerving and educating
<hi>Moſes,</hi> the woman of <hi>Tebes</hi> killing <hi>Abimelech, Deborah</hi> overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Midian, Jael</hi> killing <hi>Sicera,</hi> and poore fiſher men converting
the whole world: the like may be ſaid of <hi>Rahab, Eſther,</hi> and the

                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. The Prieſts ſonnes are diſcovered, delated, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
preſerved, and though many other dangers appeare in this
matter: yet the Lord delivers them out of them all. Wherein is
ſeen, the diſappointment of wicked and cruell enterpriſes, the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119120:129"/>
protecting hand of God of his own, and a great ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and confidence to thoſe who follow good courſes.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>David</hi> hearing of his danger prevents it, &amp; albeit
he was weary, and loaded with ſorrow: yet he ſpends the night,
in his removing and paſſing over <hi>Jordan.</hi> So that Gods promiſes
of his deliverance, and confirming him in his Kingdome, make
him not neglect the ordinary meanes of his ſafety: as we ſee the
like in <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 27. 31. Which teaches us the like, and that we
muſt not refuſe to do what God requires, for furthering of that
which he decrees.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. In <hi>Achitophel</hi> we ſee three cauſes of his deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
1. The unmeaſurable weight of his ſinnes. 2. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of <hi>Davids</hi> judgment which he feares. 3. His diffidence of
pardon, and his rejection from any participation of honour, or
advancement in <hi>Davids</hi> Court or Kingdome. Whereupon we
collect the like cauſes, and degrees of others their diſperation.
1. The weight of guiltines, which with <hi>Cain</hi> they count irremiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
2. The apprehenſion of Gods wrath and juſtice, as we ſee
in <hi>Judas.</hi> 3. Diffidence of pardon, and their rejection from any
part, or place in the Kingdome of heaven. The cure whereof,
or preſervative in the contrary, is. 1. Confidence in the mercies of
God exceeding farre the number, or weight of our ſinnes, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
103. 8. 2. Relying on the merits of Chriſt, and like the wounded
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the fiery Serpents, looking upon him by the eye of
faith, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. 3. Conſidering the freedome of the Lords
love, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. And that life everlaſting is his free gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.
And laſtly remembring the examples of the Lords mercy, to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,
Marie Magdalen,</hi> the thief on the Croſſe, Chriſts Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers,
<hi>Act</hi> 2. 36. And to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was perſecuting him.</p>
                  <p>7. We ſee in <hi>Achitophel</hi> what ſhamefull and comfortles end
ſuch may expect who for their own ambitious, or covetous ends
give Counſell, or go on in courſes againſt God, Lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and the good, and quiet of Church, and Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Achitophels</hi> wiſdome was great and highly eſteemed, and
yet in the end he proves a furious fool, by his ſelfmurther, &amp; ſo his
wiſdome was turned into folly, becauſe he abuſed the ſame to
wicked ends. Which teacheth us that Gods benefits ſhould not be
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119120:129"/>
abuſed to ſinfull ends, elſe they will turne into curſes, as the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> working wiſely, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.
10. <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength, <hi>Abſoloms</hi> beauty, <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.
The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſe's</hi> learning, <hi>Tertullus</hi> eloquence,
and here <hi>Achitophels</hi> wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>9. We ſee here likewiſe that worldly wiſdome without grace,
and ſanctification can be no protection from ſhame, and ruine in
the end: a worldly loſſe, a conceited affront, a vexing fear, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
conſcience, forſeen danger, and the like, can ſoon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the life comfortles, and oftimes drive a man to deſpaire and
make him cruelleſt of any to himſelf; How vain then is it to be
wiſe, except in God, whoſe fear is the beginning of true wiſdome,
and to depart from evill is true underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>10. By this example alſo of <hi>Achitophels</hi> death, whereunto (like
<hi>Judas</hi>) he was ſtirred up by Satan, as he had been formerly to
ſinne by pernicious Counſell. We ſee what great cauſe all men have
to pray, as Chriſt hath taught us, <hi>Lord lead us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and what Satan intends when he tempts to ſinne, towit,
nothing elſe but thereby to bring men to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>11. It is ſaid, that when <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſaw that this Counſell was
not followed, he hanged himſelf. Where we ſee what an ill gueſt
pride is, which cauſes men to mis-interpret diſgraces, or overrate
them, and raiſe ſuch a ſtorme in the breaſt, which cannot hardly
be calmed without the death of the conceived diſgracer, or elſe
their own: the one whereof we may ſee in <hi>Hamans</hi> ſpleen againſt
<hi>Mordecai,</hi> and the other here in the Perſon of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
humility can eaſily digeſt great wrongs, and miſregard the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding
of others.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Achitophel</hi> puts his houſe in order, who could not order
his own unruly paſſion and affections, and is carefull for the world,
which he was notwithſtanding preſently to leave to others; but
was careleſſe of Heauen, and of his own future and eternall eſtate.
Where we ſee how fooliſh and prepoſterous are the cares, and
courſes of Worldlings, who prefer earth to Heaven, the goods
to ſoule, or body, and the providing for others, neglecting
their own eternall welfare, and running to everlaſting ruine.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. When <hi>David</hi> had muſtered his men beyond <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
who had been paſſing it in the night time he lacks not one
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119120:130"/>
of them, wherein the Lords gracious protection was ſeen to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
great comfort, and thoſe who did follow him. Whereas
<hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 7. Their fell of the followers of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> 20000. men,
which ſhould be a great incouragement to all men, to follow
good courſes, and favour good cauſes, for ſuch only have the
promiſe of Gods preſervation.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. It is ſaid that after <hi>David</hi> had paſſed over <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
Abſolom</hi> alſo followed, and all the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him.
Where we ſee that the multitude is on <hi>Abſoloms</hi> part, and that it
is not without cauſe forbidden, to follow the multitude to do
evill. As we ſee in the practiſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> ſo that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is no note of the true Church, but the contrary, as we ſee
<hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>Seeing it is the broade way that leades to damnation,
and many they are who do walke in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. We ſee here likewiſe by <hi>Abſoloms</hi> following <hi>David</hi> over
<hi>Jordan</hi> with ſo hugh a multitude (as it were) cloſe at the back,

                  <p>16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>David</hi> from a wealthy and potent King is now
brought to that eſtate, that he is ſupported with food from mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
men, his ſinne brought him chiefly to this, which ſhewes
the mutability of greateſt wordly eſtates, whereunto none ſhould
truſt, nor think their mountain ſo ſtrong that it cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

And to eſchew ſinne which is the cauſe of all miſery both here
and hereafter.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>David</hi> is perſecuted by his own ſonne and people, but is
pitied and provided for by ſtrangers, which is, and ought to be
a comfort to the Godly in affliction, that God being their friend
they ſhall never want friends, nor proviſion: but he that fed his
people in the wilderneſs, and <hi>Eliah</hi> by Ravens, and the <hi>widdow</hi>
of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> who alſo provided <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter to be the
nurſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Obadiah</hi> in <hi>Achabs</hi> Court to feed the Lords
Prophets by fifties in caves, will alſo provide for his own, ſeeing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119120:130"/>
he feeds the ſparrowes, and cloathes the lillies of the field, and
therefore much more will care for them that feare him. Heaven
then ſhall want power, and earth meanes, before that any ſuch
want maintenance, and if God chaſtiſe, or take with one hand, he
ſhall cheriſh, and give with another.</p>

               <head>II. SAM. Chap. 18. from the 1. Verſe to the 19.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter is orderly ſubjoyned the hiſtory of the bloody
battle between <hi>Abſolom</hi> as purſuer, and <hi>David</hi> as defender,
which is to be reſolved in foure particulars. 1. The diſcipline u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by <hi>David</hi> in ordering and leading out his Army. 2. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and event thereof. 3. The report thereof made to King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
4. How he is paſſionately grieved for the death of <hi>Abſolom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then the diſcipline and order which <hi>David</hi> uſes in leading
forth his Army, is commendable, for 1. He muſters or counts
them, that hereby he may know their number, ſee their Armes,
and conſider their ſtrength. 2. After their muſter he puts them
under command of Captaines of hundreds, and Colonells of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands:
that the ſouldiers may obey their Captaines, and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
their Colonells. 3. He puts the regiments under three ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Commanders or Generalls, <hi>Joab, Abiſhaj,</hi> and <hi>Ittaj:</hi> and
divides his Army in three battalions, or ſquadrons, aſſigning their
leading to the ſeverall conductors. Next, when <hi>David</hi> has thus
ordered the Army, he offers as a valiant Captain to go with them
to battle, in proper perſon for to ſhew his courage, and for
their better encouragement. But on the contrary, by the ſecret
Counſell, and wiſdome of God, withdrawing <hi>David</hi> whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
was decreed, as <hi>Abſoloms</hi> deſtruction was concluded
by drawing him to battle, the people diſſwade <hi>David</hi> from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them in perſon, by reaſons taken <hi>à commodo &amp; incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo.</hi>
1. They being the body, and he the head: their enemies
will not greatly care for them, though they dye or flie, ſo long as
the head is ſafe to renew the battle, but if the head periſh, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will likewiſe periſh. 2. Care ſhould be had of his ſafety, for
the well of the body, who is worth ten thouſand of others, and
who if he ſhould dye, better ten thouſand of the Army dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:119120:131"/>
3. If he ſtay in the City, and need be, he can ſuccour them out
of the City. To which their diſſwaſion <hi>David</hi> aſſents, knowing
it to be out of love towards him, and the Commonwealth. And
ſo ſtanding in the gate by which the Army was to march forth
in order, he gives command to the three Generalls in audience
of the people, <hi>to deal gently with the young man</hi> Abſolom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſome gives theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe of his naturall affection
which moved him to pity his own fleſh, though rebellious.
1. Becauſe he looked not ſo much on the inſtrument, or rod;
as on his own ſinnes of homicide, and adultery that had procured
this his correction by his own ſonne, as the Lord had threatned.
And 3. Becauſe he looked on the double danger of ſoul and body,
wherein <hi>Abſolom</hi> now ſtood; and therefore labours for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of his body, that thereafter he might be induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and ſo his ſoule might be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Followes next the battle it ſelfe, and circumſtances thereof, and
1. The place, the wood of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in the territory of <hi>Gilead,</hi>
where <hi>Ephraim</hi> fought with <hi>Jephta,</hi> after the defeat of the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
Judg. 12. 2. The number of thoſe who were ſlain on <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi>
ſide in battle, towit, 20000. beſides thoſe that were devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the wood, and in flying. 3. The manner of <hi>Abſoloms</hi> own
death, who flying through the wood on his Mule, whereon he
rid, and the Mule going under the thick boughes of a great Oke,
his head caught hold of the oake, and he was taken up between
heaven and earth, and the Mule that was under him went away.</p>
               <p>Which thing when one of <hi>Davids</hi> Army had ſeen, he told <hi>Joab,</hi>
who challenged him, that he had not killed him, and he would
have rewarded him with ten ſhekells of ſilver, and a girdle: which
the diſcoverer ſhew he would not doe, though he might have a
thouſand ſhekells. 1. Becauſe he was the Kings ſonne. 2. Becauſe
of the Kings command, that none ſhould touch him. 3. Becauſe
the fact had been capitall. 4. Becauſe it could not be hid from the
King, if he had done it. And 5. Becauſe <hi>Joab</hi> himſelfe would have
been his accuſer, and enemy. Whereupon followed the killing of
<hi>Abſolom,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> himſelfe, while he was hanging in
the oake alive, by thruſting him through the heart with three
darts, and by his Armour bearers their ſmiting of him, and killing
him. Whereupon enſued <hi>Joabs</hi> ſounding a retreat, from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119120:131"/>
of the people that had been with <hi>Abſolom.</hi> And <hi>Abſoloms</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
in a great pit in the wood, whereon was laid a great heap of
ſtones, notwithſtanding that he had in his life time provided and
built a ſumptuous pillar, or buriall place, for himſelfe in the Kings
dale, to keep his name in remembrance, ſeeing he had no ſonnes,
and which he called after himſelfe, <hi>Abſoloms</hi> place. One doubt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſts to be ſolved, how it is ſaid <hi>that he had no ſonnes,</hi> ſeeing
<hi>chap.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>It is ſaid that he had three ſonnes and a daughter:</hi>
to which it is anſwered, that thoſe were dead before the erecting
of that pillar or tombe, God ſo ordering that ſuch a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
ſtock ſhould not proſper, to have a poſterity of ſuch like
branches.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. IN <hi>David</hi> we ſee an accumulation of moſt worthy parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
in a good Prince, to wit, prudence, patience, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
courage, hearkning to good Counſell, and love to his people,
and above all piety and Godlineſſe, to whom therefore God
gives good ſucceſſe, a fit pattern to all Princes to follow.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. We ſee here in <hi>Davids</hi> offering to go with
his Army in perſon, and in their diſſwading a loving: conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Godly Prince, and a loyall and a loving ſubject, every
one ſtriveing to overcome another by good offices, <hi>David</hi> offering
his paines, yea the very hazard of his Perſon, blood and life for
the common welfare, and his ſubjects highly valuing his ſafety,
and contenting for the ſame to hazard their lives and fortunes,
O happy ſtate then, and Kingdome, or other ſociety whatſoever,
Eccleſiaſticall, Politicke, or Economicall where this harmony is
found; as on the contrary unhappy is their condition where the
contrary contention is ſeen.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>David</hi> deſireth his Generalls <hi>to deal gentle with the
young man</hi> Abſolom, what means this too great indulgence? Deal
gently with a traitour, but of all traitours with a Sonne, and of
all Sonnes with a wicked inceſtuous and bloody fratricide, and
an intending pariſide. Where we ſee ever in holieſt parents as <hi>Eli</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:119120:132"/>
was, nature may be guilty of an injurious tenderneſſe, and ſinnefull
indulgence. Or whether ſhall we not rather think that this was
done in type of that free, and matchles love and mercy of that Son
of <hi>David,</hi> the King of Kings, and redeemer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who prayed
for his murtherers, and ſaid when they were killing him. <hi>Father,
forgive them for they know not what they do.</hi> And though we be
rebellious Sonnes, yet ſtill alſo is he ſo compaſſionate towards us
that he intercedeth for us.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks ſo concerning <hi>Abſolom,</hi> as confident of the
victory on his ſide, though in reſpect of the contrary Army he
was but a few. Which ſhewes <hi>Davids</hi> faith, and confidence in God,
who is able to ſave by a few, as well as by many, as <hi>Gideons</hi> 300.
proveth, and that he was not afraid of the arme of fleſh, having
the arme of the Almighty Lord of hoſtes to be for him.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. The ſword devoures 20000. of <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Army,
&amp; the wood more than the ſword; which ſhewes how numerous
an Army <hi>Abſolom</hi> had, how ſtrong an arme of fleſh, and how
univerſall this rebellion was. Wherey we obſerve, how eaſely a
fickle multitude may be tranſported to the wrong ſide: and what
vertue, or merits of a Prince can aſſure the hearts of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
when ſo gracious a King finds ſo many rebells?</p>
                  <p>6. We ſee alſo how God takes part (as the Lord of hoſtes)
with a juſt cauſe, and the very wood, and inſenſible creatures
conſpire with the ſwords of <hi>Davids</hi> Army, and lets <hi>Iſrael</hi> feel,
what it is to take part with an unnaturall and traiterous uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Let no people therefore look to proſper alway in rebellion,
but in end look for divine revenge.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Abſolom</hi> in his flying through the wood on his
mule, his head takes hold of the thick boughes of a great oak,
whereby he hangs between Heaven and Earth, as hated of
both for his unnaturall rebellion and other his wickedneſſe, as if
God meant to preſcribe this puniſhment for traitours, therefore
<hi>Abſolom, Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> dye all three one death, and ſo
let all ſuch periſh who are guilty of the like treachery againſt the
Lords anointed, or the Lawfull ſupreame Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>8. An oak ſerves to be both gallowes, and hangman to this vile
traitour, and the very mule that he rode upon leaves him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
revenge, who had left filiall duty to his Father, and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119120:132"/>
to his ſoveraigne, if there were no others to perſue and puniſh
wickedneſſe, God will make the very ſenſles creatures, and brute
beaſts to avenge the ſame, as we ſee in the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the
fire of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the puniſhment of <hi>Korah,</hi> the mockers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eliſhai,</hi> and others. Let not the wicked then expect impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſome way, or other in the Lords own time here, or at fartheſt
after death hereafter.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Abſolom</hi> is puniſhed by that wherein he moſt delighted, for
his hair was no ſmall part of his beauty, nor matter of his pride.
Where we ſee, what it is to glory and be proud of any earthly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and that, that part which is miſuſed by man to ſin, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
imployed by God to revenge.</p>
                  <p>10. Neither is it without ſpeciall, and divine providence, that
the place of the battle is the wood of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that <hi>Abſolom</hi> in
a great oak thereof might finiſh his ungodly life in an ignominious
manner, ſo that while like <hi>Jehu</hi> he is marching towards it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of his Godly parent, he is but haſtning thereby to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and his own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. A private ſouldier ſees him hanging, and tells it
to <hi>Joab,</hi> but would not kill him, becauſe of the reverence and
obedience to the Kings command concerning <hi>Abſolom.</hi> A good
part in private men, and ſubjects to reverence, and obey the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
commands of their ſuperiours, and not to do any thing of
concernment without a warrant, or call, from them that are in
authority.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Joab</hi> upon that intelligence ſees him, and ſmites
him through the heart, in which that hatefull rebellion, firſt was
hatcht, with three darts, ſo that what the ſouldier forbore in
obedience, <hi>Joab</hi> doth in zeale, not fearing to prefer his ſoveraignes
ſafety, to his indulgent command, and more tendring the life of
the King, and peace of his country, then the weake and fond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of too indulgent a father. Eſpecially ſeeing by Gods Law,
<hi>Deut,</hi> 21. 21. A rebell Childe ſhould dye, and by martiall Law
a publicke Enemy may be killed in the field. The which teaches
that the publicke good ought to be preferred before private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
or relations. Eſpecially by publicke perſons.</p>
                  <p>13. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not afford ſo firme a friend to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> as
<hi>Ioab</hi> had been, who but he ſuborned the Woman of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119120:133"/>
ſue for the recalling of <hi>Abſolom</hi> from his exile? Who but he went
to fetch him from <hi>Geſhur</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> And who but he, who
at laſt reconciled him fully to his Father <hi>David?</hi> Yet now he
who formerly was a Solicitour for him, is his executioner, and
has juſtly forgotten himſelf any more to be a friend to him, who
had forgotten himſelf to be a Sonne, and to ſuch a Father, and
turned Enemy to him. So that we ſee, that with honeſt hearts all
reſpects either of blood, or friendſhip ought to ceaſe in the caſe
of treaſon.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Ioab</hi> not onely peirces his heart with darts, who
had peirced his Fathers heart with ſo many griefs, after that he
was lift up to an oke, who had lifted himſelf up againſt his King:
but he is alſo mangled with many wounds by <hi>Ioabs</hi> armour bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
who had wounded his parent with ſo many wounds of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
and mangled and divided all <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his rebellion. So
that as a man ſinnes, oftimes like <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he is
in like manner puniſhed. As we ſee alſo, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 6.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>Ioab</hi> at laſt having obtained the Victory ſounds
a retreat, and with holds his Army from perſuing <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
appeares <hi>Ioabs</hi> prudence, and what ſhould be the like wiſdome
of commanders to put a difference between the heads of a faction,
and a ſeduced multitude, and to pity the one, while they take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
on the other.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Abſolom</hi> is caſt in a pit in the wood, and a heap
of ſtones upon him, who for a glorious and Princely tombe had
reared up a ſimptuous pillar, like the <hi>Piramids</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
his name, and memory in the Kings dale, which therefore
he called after himſelf, <hi>Abſoloms</hi> place. Where we ſee, how the
wicked are oftimes diſappointed in their ambitious deſignes, as
the builders of <hi>Babell</hi> were, and are more carefull for conſerving
their name in memory, or remembrance, then in keeping a good
conſcience, or to be carefull of their ſouls ſalvation, and to do
that which by ſhewing charity, and doing of good works would
perpetuate their name here, and receive approbation, and remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the day of their accounts hereafter.</p>
                  <p>17. We ſee here that although <hi>Abſolom</hi> had three Sonnes,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 27. Yet there is no Sonne left him, the Lord by their
death, having ſo chaſtiſed him, by which becauſe he would
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119120:133"/>
not be amended, and leave off his wickedneſſe, but rather increaſe
therein. Therefore after the rod he takes now the axe as it were,
and finally deſtroyes him, leaving him no poſterity to perpetuate
his memory: but in place thereof a heap of ſtones upon him,
every one whereof to be a witneſſe, as it were and a proclamer of
his deteſtable villany, and to eternize his infamy.</p>

takes the affirmative, &amp; <hi>Joab</hi> the negative, <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> reaſons
are. 1. From his Perſon <hi>(Let me now runne)</hi> as if he would ſay,
I have before brought tydings from my Father <hi>Zadok</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
of the event of <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counſell, and <hi>Huſhai's</hi> defeat

bring tydings to <hi>David</hi> of the event of the battle. 2. From the
Perſon of the King now in great perplexity of mind, till he hear
of the event of the battle, and who has gotten the Victory.
3. From the nature of the report, <hi>Good tydings, that the Lord
hath avenged him of his Enemies.</hi> Which will make him gracious
to his Prince, which ſubjects deſire to be. On the contrary <hi>Joab</hi>
diſſwades him therefore, by theſe reaſons. 1. From the time, it
is not expedient thou beare the meſſage this day, ſeeing another
time will offer thee a more favourable argument, by reaſon of the
mixture of that which will be ſorrowfull, with the victory
which is joyfull. 2. From this ſubject of the report in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that the Kings Son is dead and therefore the reporter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will not be acceptable, knowing <hi>Davids</hi> great affection to <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom,</hi>
as he ſhew thereafter. Therefore <hi>Joab</hi> directs <hi>Cuſhi</hi> one of

the way of the plaine, overrunneth <hi>Cuſhi,</hi> who for a ſhorter way
had taken the Wilderneſſe, and coming in fight, he is ſpied by one
of <hi>Davids</hi> watchmen, who was upon the the roof of the gate of
the wall of the City, and who accordingly cryed and told the
King, and finding that it was but one alone that was running; the
King conjectures, that it was the bearer of tydings, the reaſon of
this conjecture being from common experience, for if the Army
had been overthrown, not one but many had been ſeen flying
and reparing to the City, but being victorious, and buſily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
in following and dividing the prey, as <hi>Siſera</hi> was thought
to have been exerciſed, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 30. Therefore one onely was
ſent to report the Victory, who in his drawing neerer beeing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to be <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> the Son of <hi>Zadok, David</hi> conjectures the
newes to be good, by the goodneſſe of the bearer, and who firſt in

as became the pious Son of ſuch a Father, he aſcribes the praiſe
of the victory and of the deliverance of <hi>Davids</hi> Enemies into his
hand to God onely, &amp; not to the wiſdome of <hi>David,</hi> or valour of
<hi>Joab,</hi> as a flatterer would have done, &amp; therefore bleſſes the Lord

that as they are willed to weep with them, that weep, like fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowfeeling

and eſpecially at the proſperity of Gods Church, and people, and
their deliverance, from their Enemies, and that the Lord has
manifeſted his juſtice on them, as his mercy towards his own.</p>
                  <p>2. In <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> deſiring from <hi>Ioab</hi> leave to go, and a warrant
from him, who was chief in power to give him a call, and runnes
not unſent, to tell theſe glad tydings. We ſee it is the duty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
to ſubmit to the direction of their ſuperiours, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that the bearers of the glad tydings of ſalvation ſhould not
runne before they be ſent, and have a call from thoſe, who have
power to give it them in the Church of Chriſt. Though like
<hi>Ahimaaz</hi> they be never ſo willing, or forward, or able alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
that function.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. When <hi>David</hi> is in greateſt fear, and ſolicitude
concerning the event of the battle, he gets good newes of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſucceſſe and victory: even ſo when the Godly are in greateſt
feares dangers and difficulties, the Lord in their extremity ſhewes
his owne gracious deliverance, and opportunity, witneſſe <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
deliverance from <hi>Eſau, Iſraels</hi> at the red Sea, <hi>Davids</hi> from
<hi>Sauls</hi> oruelty, his peoples from <hi>Hamans</hi> bloody plot, <hi>Eliahs</hi>
from <hi>Achab, Peters</hi> from <hi>Herod,</hi> Act. 12. And many more
others, therefore let none deſpare of the Lords care of them, as
he had of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>three Children,</hi> though they ſeem to
be like the Lamb in the Lyons paw, but in a holy confidence let
them conſtantly rely on him.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Ahimaaz, Zadok</hi> the Prieſts Sonne,
ſayes, <hi>He is a good man and brings good tydings,</hi> joyning well
theſe two together, as indeed they ought to be in all the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and Miniſters of the Goſpel, in whoſe mouth the good and
glad tydings of the Goſpell is put to declare to Gods people, of
the Summe of <hi>Davids</hi> victory over all our ſpirituall Enemies, and
of our deliverance from them, and their overthrow, that as the
newes is good, ſo they ſhould be good men that carry them, their
carriage being ſuitable to their calling and meſſage, both holy,
that their life belies not their tongue, nor that it be not ſaid of

                  </p>
                  <p>5. How welcome was <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> when he brought
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:119120:135"/>
theſe newes of his Armies ſafety, and that all was well, and how
much more welcome ſhould they be, <hi>And their feet counted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autifull
on the mountains who</hi> (like the Angels at Chriſts

                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> bleſſes the Lord for the Victory, and
aſcribes the ſame onely to him, who is the Lord of hoſtes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
neither to <hi>Davids</hi> wiſdome in directing, nor <hi>Joabs,</hi> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
valour in executing, but onely to the Lords power and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Arme, who had given the ſame. Thereby teaching all men
in all conditions, or ſucceſſe of affaires to look higher then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
and to acknowledge him to be ſupreame governour
to whom the glory of all the good we have belongs, that we
may ſay; <hi>Not unto us, but to thy name be the glory and praiſe for
ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>V.</hi> 32. As <hi>David</hi> hears the joyfull newes of the Victory: ſo
he hears by <hi>Cuſhi</hi> the ſorrowfull tydings of his Sonne <hi>Abſoloms</hi>
death, which he ſo laments. Whereby we ſee how the Lord tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
the cup, which he gives, mixing to his own, ſome ſowreneſſe
with their ſweetneſſe, ſo that their joy here is neither full, as it
ſhall be hereafter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. Nor unmixed leſt we ſhould be too
much inamored with this life, and cloyed with Worldly delights
&amp; contentments, therefore our ſweeteſt roſes have their prickles,
<hi>Et nil omni ex parte beatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Here likewiſe, we ſee the miſerable condition of civill and
inteſtine warre &amp; troubles, that in theſe, even ſuch Victories that
are obtained by the party prevailing are not without ſad loſſs of
ſome, who were dear, or neer unto them, as is ſaid of the warres
between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey, Bella gerit, placuit nullos habitura

diſſent, and perſwade to peace, and unity both in Church and
Commonwalth.</p>
                  <p>9. As has been ſaid, on the 5. <hi>Verſe,</hi> and explication of the
charge given to <hi>Joab,</hi> and the others concerning <hi>Abſoloms</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
and the cauſes thereof: ſo here the cauſe of <hi>Davids</hi>
lamenting for his death, was eſpecially with intuition, firſt of his

own ſins of adultery, and the murther of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> as the cauſe why
he was ſo ſharply corrected in him, who was his Son and a part
of himſelf, and which all of us ought to look unto, when we are
corrected in the perſons of our Children, or any that are neer, and
dear unto us, and as <hi>David</hi> looked unto, when he mourned and
faſted, for the ſickneſſe of the firſt Child, that was borne unto him
by <hi>Bathſheba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Next, his mourning and lamentation was with intuition
of his ſpirituall, and now eternall eſtate, dying ſo without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in his ſinnes, of bloodſhed, inceſt, and rebellion, which ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ould
be in like manner the chief cauſe of mourning to all, who fear God
when they their friends, or any other of neerer relation to be
wicked and incorrigible, and running headlong to their own
damnation, and which was the cauſe of <hi>Samuels</hi> going to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi>
and mourning for <hi>Saul</hi> all the dayes of his life.</p>
                  <p>11. Out of his two tender and fatherly affection he cryes out
with ingemination, <hi>My Son, my Son</hi> Abſolom <hi>would God I had dyed
for thee.</hi> Where we ſee, that the beſt men have not wont to be leaſt
paſſionate: but what ſhall we ſay of our Saviours love to us, &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
thereof, who has ſaid of us wretched rebells, <hi>Not, would
God I had dyed for you, but, I have dyed for you, a bloody, a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
a ſhamefull and a curſed death.</hi> Behold then how he loved

the men of <hi>Judah</hi> concerning their being firſt in the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and that they deſpiſed the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being ten tribes,
or major part, and had not firſt adviſed with them in bringing
back the King.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt conſequence, or action mentioned, which is
<hi>Davids</hi> mourning for the death of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> we have ſpoken
before, and here we ſee by his example, and ſympathy with
him, the Victory, that day is likewiſe turned to mourning unto all
the people, and in place of their ſhewing themſelves joyfull
in a publicke triumphing way, they privately ſteale into the
Citie, like them, who are aſhamed, and ſteale away when
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119120:136"/>
they flye in battle. And as for the King himſelfe, he cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his face, as the manner of mourners was, and cryes out bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,
<hi>O my ſonne Abſolom, my ſonne, my ſonne.</hi> Whereof <hi>Joab</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advertiſed, he comes to the King, and boldly 1. Reprehends
him for mourning ſo for <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and giving ſuch a bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the people. 2. Exhorts and counſells him to ariſe, and go
forth, and to ſpeak comfortably to the people. And 3. Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
him, if he did not ſo, that he ſhould be deſerted by all the
people ſpeedily, and that ſhould be a worſe evill to him, then all
the evill that had befallen him from his youth, till then. In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of <hi>David</hi> he upbraids him. 1. With ingratitude, that
in place of honouring, or rewarding his ſervants, who had ſaved
his life: and the lives of his ſonnes, his daughters, his wives, and
concubines, he had ſhamed them, by mourning for a traitour, who
ſought his life, and the lives of his ſervants, and therefore had
juſtly ſuffered, and for which fact they needed not to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as it ſeemes he would have them. 2. He upbraids him with
the greateſt iniquity that can be, that he hated his friends, and
loved his enemies, which might be a ſufficient ground hereafter
to any, not to prove his friends, as they had formerly done, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
their lives and fortunes for him, but to prove his enemies.
3. He labours to prove the truth thereof, by <hi>Davids</hi> ſo bitter
mourning for <hi>Abſolom,</hi> whereby he declared that he regarded
not his Princes, or ſervants, whom rather he ſhould have cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
welcomed from the battle, thanked or rewarded, than
withdrawne himſelfe from them, and mourned for a traitour.
4. He upbraids him with a prepoſterous, and wrong choice, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
rather of <hi>Abſoloms</hi> life, though they all had died: the
laſt whereof had pleaſed him better, then the death of <hi>Abſolom.</hi>
5. Unto this he therefore ſubjoynes his advice, and exhortation
that <hi>David</hi> go forth, ſhew himſelfe cheerefull for the victory, and
ſpeak comfortably to his ſervants, which if he obeyed not by an
argument <hi>ab incommodo,</hi> he threatneth him with a ſpeedy, and
totall deſertion of all the people and Army, which he had under
his charge, and had hazarded ſo for him, which would prove
the greateſt evill that ever as yet had befallen him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>David</hi> is moved to do as <hi>Joab</hi> had adviſed, he
comes forth to publick view, in the moſt publick place of the

                  </hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> prieſts to perſwade them thereunto, by
two main arguments. The firſt whereof is, 1. Seeing the ſpeech
of all the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> reſolving to bring back <hi>David</hi> is come
to the Kings eares, and therefore why ſhould they be laſt herein?
2. From the neer relation and conſanguinity of that tribe with
<hi>David,</hi> whereof he is come, being his brethren, that is, his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks:

and haters to be lovers of our enemies, even as Chriſt loved us
being his enemies, and gave himſelfe to the death for us.</p>
                  <p>6. He imputes alſo to <hi>David</hi> moſt unjuſtly and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that he regarded not his Princes nor ſervants, and if <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom</hi>

of <hi>Joab,</hi> having power and charge of the Army, and
therefore taking liberty to himſelfe to ſpeak as he pleaſed, and as
his paſſion miſled him to his King and Soveraign: ſo it ſhewes the
great patience of <hi>David,</hi> in hearing without oppoſing or reply.
Prudence and patience being two notable vertues in a Prince and
adorning him no leſs then his crowne or diademe.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. In his threatning of <hi>David, That if he went not
forth, and ſhewed himſelfe cheerfull to the people, they would not one
tarry with him that night, which would be the worſt evill of any that
ever yet befell him.</hi> We ſee that the greateſt good and ſtrength of a
Prince, is the love of his people, and their cleaving to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the contrary, the greateſt evill that can come to a Prince,
and which is his greateſt weakning, is their juſtly procured ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and deſerting of him, as we ſee in <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and which
therefore ſhould make all Princes and Kings, ſtrive to keep the love
of their people, and cheriſh the ſame.</p>
                  <p>8. Whereas <hi>Joab</hi> threatneth <hi>David,</hi> and confirmes the ſame
by a ſolemne and great oath, taking Gods name in vain againſt
the commandment. We ſee both his impiety and imprudency, for
threatning of a Prince (except by warrant from God, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
was, or from his Word by faithfull paſtours, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
prudent and reverend way,) they are unfit to be uſed by
ſubjects, and do rather provoke to wrath, than produce any
good effect.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. Notwithſtanding of <hi>Joabs</hi> raſh boldneſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
upbraiding, and ſharp threatning, yet paſſing by all,
and poſſeſſing his ſoule in patience; he yields to <hi>Joabs</hi> admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and what <hi>Joab</hi> gives with the left hand, he takes with the
right, and makes good uſe thereof. Wherein we have a good

                     </gap>ſt in bringing back King <hi>David.</hi> We ſee the inconſtancy of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119120:139"/>
multitude, which like <hi>Ruben is unſtable, and light like water,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for <hi>David,</hi> thereafter for <hi>Abſolom:</hi> and when he is dead,
againe for <hi>David:</hi> and ſhortly after that, following a rebellious
<hi>Sheba,</hi> no truſt then to be had in them, as we ſee in their crying
<hi>Hoſanna</hi> one day to our Saviour, and crucifie another day: but
a watchfull eye is to be had over them, and a right hand of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and wiſe government.</p>
                  <p>11. The argument that is uſed for bringing back <hi>David,</hi> is
the benefits which <hi>Iſrael</hi> received by him, to wit, deliverance
from their enemies, eſpecially the <hi>Philiſtimes,</hi> who were the moſt
noyſome and cruell. Whereby we obſerve, that it is a good part,
and policy in a Prince, to oblige his ſubjects by benefits, for
which cauſe our Saviour tells us, that they are called benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.
So likewiſe it is the duty of ſubjects ſeaſonably to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
and thankfully to requite the ſame, as fit time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
requireth. But O what greater cauſe have we to be duty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſubjects to Chriſt our King, who has delivered us from all our
ſpirituall enemies, and is our moſt liberall benefactour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 2.</p>
                  <p>12. The ten tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who before in <hi>Abſoloms</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
were <hi>Davids</hi> greateſt enemies, they prove now moſt earneſt
for his reduction, and his firſt and faſteſt friends. Whereby we
obſerve that where God is a friend to any, he will not let them
want friends: yea, will make their moſt cruell enemies to be
their friends, as he made <hi>Eſau</hi> to be to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 33. <hi>Abaſuerus</hi>
to Gods people, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8. And <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
the <hi>three Children,</hi> Dan. 3. Which ſhould teach every one by all
meanes, to ſeek after the friendſhip of God, and to be at peace
with him, and then they ſhall have the Angels, and all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be their friends, and be at peace with them.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. Though <hi>Judah</hi> unnaturally, and rebelliouſly
had followed <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and revolted. And albeit now victorious
<hi>David</hi> might by force reclaime them to his obedience, yet pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and piouſly he uſes, all faire meanes for their reclaiming,
and coming back to him againe: and therefore for this end, he
ſends <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> prieſts to perſwade them. An example
worthy to be imitated by all Princes, by all faire meanes rather
then rigour and ſeverity, both to procure, and retaine their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in obedience: the threatning of the people wherewith, of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119120:139"/>
twelve tribes loſt ten to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is an example. But what a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King have we, who is the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> who being now
victorious over all his enemies, and might by his Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſoon ſubdue his proudeſt rebells, yet uſes all faire meanes for
our reclaiming by the promiſes of the Goſpell to pardon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

and to come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſends the miniſters of his Word,
as the embaſſadours of peace and reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>14. For perſwading <hi>Judah</hi> to peace, and coming to <hi>David,</hi>
to bring him back in peace, he ſends to their elders, <hi>Zadok</hi> and
<hi>Abiathar,</hi> as fit inſtruments for that purpoſe. Where we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

eſpecially to their ſuperiours.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> make this, as one of the motives

and ſanctifier of the other, but not the aboliſher.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. By the ſame argument, theſe prieſts are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to deale with <hi>Amaſa,</hi> who was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Generall of <hi>Abſoloms</hi> hoſte,

choice of a fit inſtrument, for effecting of a good purpoſe:
which contributes greatly for obtaining of a wiſhed ſucceſs, as
experience herein did prove, and therefore ſhould be followed

any great work to do.</p>

Which ſhewes not only the diſguſt that <hi>David</hi> had taken againſt

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 17. IN <hi>Shimei's</hi> haſting to meet King <hi>David</hi> with ſuch a
train of <hi>Benjamites</hi> after the Victory, and in <hi>Ziba's</hi>
joyning with him with his Sonnes and ſervants; not from any
ſincere affection that either of them had to <hi>David,</hi> but for their
own ends. We ſee the nature and diſpoſition of diſſembling and
temporizing hypocrites, whoſe actions for their own ſelf end are
farre different from their affections, and that where they hate
moſt, yet they can in ſome outwards pretend, and make ſhew of
greateſt love and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Shimei</hi> curſeth <hi>David,</hi> and caſts ſtones at him in his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
whom now in his proſperity he flatter's and followeth.
Which ſheweth unto us, not onely the various condition of the
Godly, now in adverſity and after in proſperity, but likewiſe the
various diſpoſition of time ſervers, who with the <hi>Jewes</hi> can cry
<hi>Hoſanna</hi> to day, but on the morrow, <hi>Crucify,</hi> and can in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
flie from them, whom in proſperity they will faune upon

                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Shimei</hi> ſueing for pardon. We ſee. 1. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.
2. Acknowledgement and confeſſion of his ſinne.
3. Seeking of remiſſion. And 4. making amends by a contrary
courſe of being the firſt of the houſe of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to meet the King
<hi>David,</hi> and conduct him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> all which ought to be in
penitent ſinners, ſueing for pardon from Chriſt the Sonne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>

walking in wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. In <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> we ſee an example of private and
cruell vindict, ſuch as was in <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who would have ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> and in Chriſts owne Diſciples,
who would had fire come down from Heaven upon <hi>Samaria,</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> in ſmiting off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare: whereas good <hi>Jacob,</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>David,</hi> and our ſaviour Chriſt were farre from this carnall,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:119120:142"/>
and cruell diſpoſition, and therefore to be therein followed, as
the former is to be fled: <hi>For learn of me</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>for I am humble
and meek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>What had he to do with the Sonnes of</hi>
Zerviah, that they ſhould be adverſaries to him: the word in
the originall being, Satan, becauſe of their inſtigation to ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
for which cauſe alſo <hi>Peter</hi> was called ſo by our Saviour, and
bidden <hi>Go behinde him.</hi> Whereby we ſee what they are who give
evill Counſell, and how ſuch are to be eſteemed, towit, even as ſo
many Satans, who was the firſt that gave evill Counſell to our firſt
parents, which brought death on them, and all their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>David</hi> gives this as a reaſon of his clemency towards <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,
Do not I know this day</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that I am King over Iſraell.</hi>
Which ſhewes unto us the good uſe that Princes and great men
ſhould make of their power and authority; not to be the more
cruell, or for oppreſſion of their inferiours, but rather to ſhew
their elemency even to offenders. Herein imitating him with
whoſe name they participate, and to uſe their power to the good
and comfort of Gods Church, and people.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>David</hi> promiſes to penitent ſeeming <hi>Shimei;</hi> that
he ſhould not dye, and ſweares unto him: but farre more mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is our Saviour the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> to all true penitent ſinners,
who has promiſed pardon to all ſuch, and ſealed the remiſſion of
ſinnes by his Sacraments, and ſworne alſo by himſelf, <hi>That as be
lives, he deſires not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he convert
and live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> a true and loyall friend, and ſubject
to <hi>David,</hi> who had ſhewn ſuch ſympathy with <hi>David</hi> in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
as he had <hi>neither dreſt his feet, trimmed his beard, nor
waſhen his cloathes, till David</hi> ſhould return in peace; yet is falſly
ſlandered in the contrary, as an affecter of the Kingdome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Whereby we obſerve, that the moſt Godly and innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whoſoever cannot eſcape the ſcourge of the tongue, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
calumnies: as we ſee in <hi>Shimei's</hi> upbraiding <hi>David, Chap.</hi> 16. 8.
With the blood of <hi>Saul</hi> and his houſe, and uſurping his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and as wee ſee, in the calumniating of <hi>Eliah,</hi> as a troubler
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and our bleſſed ſaviour, as a <hi>Wine bibber,</hi> and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

and dejects himſelf, and all his fathers houſe, as dead men,
and extoll's <hi>Davids</hi> gracious benefits and bounty beſtowed upon
him, which indeed is the beſt way that we can take to obtain the
favour of God, who is King of Kings, and to ingratiate ourſelves
in his ſight, towit, by caſting down ourſelves at his feet, profeſſing
our vile, and wretched condition, with the poor <hi>Publican:</hi> and
acknowledging the Lords bounty, and mercyfull dealing with us,
and with <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> humbly ſubmitting our ſelves in all things,
to his good will and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>10 <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. In <hi>Davids</hi> perſeverance of giving any part of
<hi>Mephiboſheths</hi> Land to a deceitfull <hi>Ziba,</hi> now after right informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to which <hi>Ziba</hi> being preſent could not reply. We ſee infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in the beſt of men, and that judges, or Magiſtrates upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tryall and information ſhould reforme their judgements, and
as equity requires recall their unjuſt decrees, and rectify the
ſame: as we ſee <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> did, <hi>Esther</hi> 8. And not to do as <hi>Herod</hi>
did in the matter of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> or as <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid concerning
Chriſt. <hi>What I have written, I have written,</hi> and would not alter
the ſame. Nor yet to do as <hi>David</hi> herein did.</p>
                  <p>11. We ſee alſo, that <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> acquieſceth in <hi>Davids</hi>
decree, and grudgeth not as he had done him wrong, becauſe he
had taken nothing from him, but that which formerly he had
freely given him; even ſo ſhould we acquieſce in Gods dealing
with us, and ſubmit to his wiſe diſpenſation, when he takes from
us any temporall benefit, as health, wealth, or Children, and
the like, which of his free favour he hath formerly given unto us,
which was <hi>Jobs</hi> practice, when he ſaid: <hi>The Lord hath given,

And 2. the diſſention between the ten tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119120:143"/>
tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> In the action between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Barzillai,</hi>
We have 1. how he is deſcribed. 1. From his country that he
was a <hi>Gileadite.</hi> 2. From his age, that he was 80. <hi>years old.</hi>
3. From his eſtate, or condition, that he was a very great man.
4. From his actions teſtifying his great love to <hi>David.</hi> 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Rogelim</hi> to conduct <hi>David</hi> over <hi>Jordan.</hi> 2. From his
former bounty and liberality to <hi>David,</hi> who had provided him
ſuſtenance, when he lay at <hi>Mahanaim.</hi> For which kindneſſe,
ſhewn to <hi>David,</hi> like a thankefull Prince he invites <hi>Barzillai</hi> to go
with him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he would retain and entertain
him nobly in his court, which courteous &amp; kinde offer <hi>Barzillai,</hi>
notwithſtanding modeſtly refuſeth. Upon theſe reaſons. 1. From
the brevity of his life in the enjoying ſuch a benefit. 2. From his
great age being. 80. <hi>years old,</hi> and ſo more fit for a private and
retired condition, which that age requireth, then a Kings court.
3. From the decay of his ſenſes, and their faculty, whereby he
could not be capable of court delights, as of delicate meates, or
drink, or of pleaſant Muſick. And 4. that as the court could be
no benefit to him, ſo he ſhould be but a burden to the King, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he offers to go a little way over <hi>Jordan</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> counting
himſelf unworthy of ſuch a reward as was offered, and deſires
that with <hi>Davids</hi> good leave and favour he might returne to his
own City, and be buried in the grave of his parents, and ſeeing
himſelf might not goe with the King, for the forenamed reaſons,
he makes offer of his Sonne <hi>Chimham</hi> to go, with him, &amp; he to do
to him what he thought good. Which offer <hi>David</hi> doth kindely
accept, and promiſeth that whatſoever he would ask of him, he
would do for him. And ſo having bleſſed <hi>Barzillai,</hi> he diſmiſſes
him home again, and ſo goes on in his journey to <hi>Gilgall,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

men of <hi>Judah; That they had ſtolen him away and brought him

of that tribe, and therefore collecting that they where cauſeſly
angry at them for that cauſe. 2. They ſhew that it was not for
any benefit, or reward that they expected, or had, for this their
being firſt in his conduct. To whom theſe of <hi>Iſraell</hi> reply, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
concerning that right by kindred to <hi>David,</hi> which the men
of <hi>Judah</hi> pretended, affirming that their right to him was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as having ten parts in him, becauſe they were ten tribes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 33. IN <hi>Davids</hi> kinde remembrance of <hi>Barzillais</hi> favour,
and bounty to him, when he was in diſtreſſe, and in
the gracious offer that he now makes unto him for the ſame.
We ſee the praiſe worthy vertue of gratitude, commendable in
all perſons as the contrary vice is odious, and eſpecially in Princes,
for which we ſee the thenth leper, who was healed by Chriſt,
and came back to give him thanks ſo commended, as likewiſe
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> his gratitude to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in giving <hi>Goſhen</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and friends, to whom his ſucceſſor proved ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
thereafter, and was plagued, in like manner <hi>Davids</hi>
gratitude to the King of <hi>Ammon</hi> ungrately requited, which
was the cauſe of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> utter ruine, likewiſe
<hi>Eliahs</hi> gratitude to the Widdow of <hi>Sareptah, Eliſha's,</hi> to the
Woman of <hi>Shunem, Davids,</hi> alſo to the poſterity of <hi>Jonathan,</hi>
and our Saviours promiſe; <hi>That a cup of cold water ſhall not be

the laſt day how it ſhall be ſaid; <hi>When I was hungry, ye fed me
not, &amp;c. Inherit therefore the Kingdome prepared for you before
the beginning of the World.</hi> Which ſhould teach us to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
both to God, as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 2. And to men, who have
deſerved well of us.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Barzillai</hi> is ſaid, to have been a very rich and great man,
and in <hi>Davids</hi> diſtreſſe both helps, and hazards with him.
Whereby we obſerve the right uſe of riches and a great eſtate,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:119120:144"/>
towit, when occaſion calls for it, both to help and hazard in a
good cauſe, wherein either Church, or Commonwealth, or
both have their intereſt, and not to miſpend upon pride, ryot,
or ſuperfluities, farre leſſe to uſe their greatneſſe, or beſtow their
goods for perſecuting Gods Church, and oppoſing his cauſe. As
we ſee that <hi>Roman Antichriſt,</hi> and his followers (which are
the hornes of the beaſt) doe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>Barzillai</hi> ſpeaks of the ſhortneſſe of his life, and
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 37. Of his death and buriall, teaching all thereby, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the aged, in the midſt of their greatneſſe and proſperity to be
mindefull ever of theſe things: which made <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>
to have his tombe into his garden, which made <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo to
teach Gods people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 12. to pray, <hi>Teach us Lord to number
our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto Wiſdome.</hi> This was
<hi>Jobs</hi> waiting, <hi>Job.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>All the dayes of his appointed time till
his change ſhould come,</hi> and which like practice, counting every day
the day of our death, account, and entring into eternity, if it were
ours daily, it would further our mortification of ſinne, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
falling therein: where as, while men with the rich fool (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in health and ſtrength) promiſed to themſelves long life, they
lull their ſouls in ſecurity, put off repentance, and amendement
of life, and are ſnatcht away by death unawares and preſented to
judgement.</p>
                  <p>4. This remembrance of the ſhortneſſe of his life, of death
and buriall, weanes <hi>Barzillai</hi> from regarding worldly, or court
delights, and from high offered promotion, ſo that he becomes
dead to the World in affection, before he be dead in the World in
condition. Which in like manner ſhould teach us how to wean our
hearts from regarding any worldly pleaſures, or profit, honour, or
advancement, (and ſpecially not to hunt after the ſame by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes, as many do) by ſeriouſly conſidering how ſhort mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
an a time, we have to enjoy the ſame, how uncertain alſo
the honour of death is, and that we muſt leave all, when we go to
the grave, and are preſented to judgment.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>V.</hi> 41. When <hi>David</hi> had made an end of the troubles raiſed
by <hi>Abſoloms</hi> rebellion by the victory which he had obtained over
him, now followes a new trouble by the diviſion &amp; diſſention that
fell out between the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> &amp; the other ten tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:119120:144"/>
So that we ſee, as is ſaid of old age, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 3. That the cloud
returne after raine: ſo in this life the Godly may expect trouble
after trouble, as one wave followeth in the neck of another, or
as <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers of evill newes came one after another.</p>
                  <p>6. We ſee here alſo Satans pollicy to hinder a good work,
which was an unanimous, and peaceable reduction of <hi>David,</hi> by
raiſing a diſſention between the tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who
were of one ſtock, of one religion, under one King, and fellow
members of one Commonwealth. And which hath ever been
Satans practiſe, ſince he made the firſt diviſion between God, and
our firſt parents: as we ſee, in that attempt of diſſention between
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot, Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell, Saul</hi> and <hi>David, Korah</hi> and
<hi>Moſes, Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Ephramites,</hi> Judg. 12. <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites,</hi>
Judg. 21. <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> here, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
Act. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>9. And in the Schiſmes that he hath ever ſtirred up in
the Chriſtian Church, and ſtill does, to hinder the Goſpell: and
make the greater way to the propagating of his damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
                  <p>7. We ſee here likewiſe in this diſſention from whence it, and
all other, the like proceeds, to wit, from envy: jealouſy, and
pride, for precedence and preheminence, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh:
ſaying, <hi>by pride cometh contention,</hi> which was the cauſe of of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abs</hi>
killing of <hi>Abner,</hi> and thereafter of <hi>Amaſa,</hi> of the warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Cae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> of the contention alſo amongſt Chriſts
diſciples, who ſhould be greateſt, of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
between other Biſhops of Patriarchall ſeates: and amongſt others
alſo both in the Civill and Eccleſiaſticall eſtate even unto this day,
forgetting that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Learne of me for I am hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and meek,</hi> which is the true and ſure way to peace and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 43. This diſſention is increaſed, and fomented by
the feirceneſs of words on both ſides, but the words of <hi>Judah
are ſaid to have been the feirceſt.</hi> Where we ſee the truth of that
which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſets down, concerning an evill bridled
tongue, that though it be a ſmall member (as he calls it, <hi>Jam.</hi>
3. 5.) yet what a great fire it kindleth, and is a world of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and is it ſelfe ſet
on fire of hell. Whereas a ſoft anſwer pacifieth wrath, and prevents
diſcord.</p>

                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:119120:145"/>
9. In all this, though the complaint was made to <hi>David</hi> by
the ten tribes, yet for the naturall affection, that he carried to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
whom he was loath to offend. And which therefore made
their words to be feircer, he forbeareth to decerne, and decide
the matter; whereupon a new rebellion did enſue, as we ſee in
the next Chapter. Which may learne Magiſtrates, and Judges to
eſchew partiality, upon carnall or naturall reſpects: and not to
ſuffer affection to beare ſway, either to obſtruct, or corrupt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
but looking to the equity of the cauſe, to do that which is
agreeable thereto, and ſo to prevent dangers, that otherwiſe
might enſue.</p>

wicked man. 3. From his progeny, the ſonne of <hi>Bichrj</hi> a <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite.</hi>
4. From his Action, he blew a trumpet, for aſſembling the
men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto him. 5. From his ſeditious ſpeech unto them,
the like whereof was that of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 King. 12. 16. Diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now that they had any part in <hi>David,</hi> who before were claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ten parts in him. And 2. Proclaiming liberty to them from
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:119120:145"/>
royall government, by bidding them go to their tents, and houſes;
that leaving <hi>David,</hi> whom contemptuouſly he calls the ſonne of
<hi>Jeſs,</hi> they might think of another ſort of government. The event
of which ſpeech is ſet down, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. To wit, the defection of the
men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from <hi>David,</hi> and their following of <hi>Sheba,</hi> but that
all <hi>Judah</hi> conſtantly did cleave to their King.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Action is <hi>Davids</hi> ſequeſtration, and ſhutting up his
concubines whom <hi>Abſolom</hi> had defiled, immediatly after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Action is <hi>Davids</hi> imployment of <hi>Amaſa,</hi> (whom
he had newly placed in <hi>Joabs</hi> roome) within three daies to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
to him the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> who tarrying longer then the
time appointed, and <hi>David</hi> thinking delay in ſuch purpoſes to be
dangerous: ſo that <hi>Sheba</hi> if he were not ſpeedily purſued, might
do more evill then <hi>Abſolom</hi> lately had done, therefore he imployes
<hi>Abiſhaj</hi> to take his ſervants, and purſue after him, who when they
were at the great ſtone in <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before them, whom when <hi>Joab</hi> (who was with <hi>Abiſhaj</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany)
ſees, he kindly firſt ſalutes him calling him Brother, and
askes of his welfare, but taking him by the beard with his right
hand to kiſs him: as the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> was agreeable to
our joyning of hands, with his left hand, he treacherouſly kills
him, with his ſword, which he had ſo cunningly girded unto him,
that it might eaſily fall out of the ſcabbard, when he did ſtoop to
embrace <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and ſo he might have occaſion to hold it in his
left hand, after he had taken it up, without any occaſion of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition
to <hi>Amaſa:</hi> who being dead, then <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abiſhaj</hi> his
brother purſue after <hi>Sheba,</hi> which purſuit being retarded by the
peoples ſtanding ſtill, as they came by gazing on <hi>Amaſa,</hi> who
was lying wallowing in his blood, in the midſt of the high way,
one of <hi>Joabs</hi> men who ſtood by him. 1. Proclaimed that all who
favoured <hi>Joab,</hi> and were for <hi>David,</hi> ſhould follow after <hi>Joab.</hi>
And 2. That the ſight of <hi>Amaſa,</hi> ſhould no more impeade them,
he removed <hi>Amaſa</hi> out of the high way into the field, and caſt a
cloth upon him, ſo that thereafter all the people followed <hi>Ioab:</hi>
who alſo went through all the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and gathered the
people, till they came to <hi>Abel</hi> of <hi>Bethmacaachah,</hi> whither <hi>Sheba</hi>
had gone, as <hi>David</hi> had ſuſpected he would, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. To fortify
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:119120:146"/>
himſelfe or eſcape, which City therefore <hi>Ioab</hi> did beſiege, and
as the cuſtome was for battering the ſame, he did caſt up a bank
againſt the ſame, to throw it down. Whereupon a wiſe woman
of the City, calleth unto <hi>Ioab,</hi> and diſſwades him from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the City by foure arguments. The firſt whereof is taken
from military diſcipline, according to the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it was appointed, that firſt conditions of peace, ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to any City, which if the ſame were accepted, the matter
was ſo ended, and no invaſion uſed. 2. She argues from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the inhabitants of the City, who were peaceably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
as her ſelfe was, and not rebellious. 3. She reaſons from
the dignity of the City, that it was a mother in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that had
bred and brought forth many inhabitants and Children. And
4. From the duty of <hi>Ioab,</hi> as a Godly Commander, and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to a Godly King which was, not to ſwallow up the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Lord, but rather by the right uſe of the ſword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, to defend and maintaine the ſame. By which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<hi>Ioab</hi> diſclaiming any ſuch cruelty or wickedneſs, ſheweth
unto her, that he was come only againſt a rebell <hi>Sheba,</hi> whom if
the City would deliver to him, he would ſpare the ſame. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſhe capitulates with him, in name of the City, that <hi>Sheba's</hi>
head ſhould be throwne over the wall unto him. Which being
done by the people of the City, through the wiſe perſwaſion of
this woman, <hi>Ioab</hi> ſounds a retreat from the City, every man to
his tent, and <hi>Ioab</hi> returned to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the King, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all things now ſetled in a peaceable condition, appoints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
officers, and rulers in his Court and Kingdome for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
government of all matters, both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>DAvids</hi> ſtill finds new troubles to ariſe, after a rebellious
ſonne, now a rebellious ſubject, a verifying of the truth
of that enmity, which ſhall ever be between <hi>the ſeed of the woman,
&amp; the ſeed of the Serpent, David</hi> alſo being herein a type of Chriſt,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:119120:146"/>
the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> who never did, nor will want enemies to him,
even of ſuch as are profeſſed ſonnes and ſubjects, and whereby
alſo is ſeen the verity of that, <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous
but the Lord delivers them out of them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Sheba</hi> is deſcribed to have been a <hi>Benjamite</hi> of <hi>Sauls</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
as <hi>Shimej</hi> likewiſe was, and therefore carrying a lurking ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt <hi>David,</hi> ſo that to ſeditious, and carnall minded mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
perſons, there wants nothing but a fit occaſion, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to vent and make their malice manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Another cauſe of <hi>Sheba's</hi> rebellion was his pride, to be the
head of a faction, but which in the end, drew him on to his own
deſtruction, before which pride ever goes, as before honour goes
humility, which ſatanicall vide therefore every one ſhould eſchew,
as the mother of much miſchiefe, and the cauſer of great ruine in
the end.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Sheba</hi> a man of <hi>Belial,</hi> blowes a trumpet of rebellion, no
marvell being ſuch a one, and as all ſeditious rebells ought to be
accounted, <hi>men of Belial.</hi> But it is a ſad matter, when thoſe who
ſhould be preachers of peace, are trumpets of rebellion, and <hi>who
ſhould lift up their voyces only as a trumpet to ſhew Gods people their
tranſgreſſions,</hi> as he ſpeaketh by his Prophet <hi>Iſaj.</hi> 58. 1. That ſuch
ſhould lift up their voyces, as a trumpet, to perſwade to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
                  <p>5. He who lately (with the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) claimed ten parts
in <hi>David</hi> as King, diſclaimes and diſownes him now, as having
no part in him at all. Thus will hypocriſy detect it ſelfe at laſt;
and what lay before under aſhes in <hi>Sheba's</hi> heart, burſts forth now
in flames in his words and actions. And ſo do many hypocrites
now diſclaime Chriſt by their deeds: and ſhew, that they have
no part in him, who profeſs him in their words, and in their tide
of Chriſtians: to have the chiefe part in him, and in ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>David</hi> before had raiſed his hand againſt a faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and therefore now a faithleſs ſubject raiſes his hand
againſt him, as a man ſinneth ſo oftimes he is puniſhed, and
in this alſo as a part is that doome denounced againſt <hi>David,</hi> for
the blood of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> fulfilled, <hi>that the ſword ſhould never depart

7. By way of contempt he calleth <hi>David</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Jeſs,</hi> as
our Saviour was called a carpenters ſonne. Let not therefore theſe
of lower degree, grudge that they ſometimes undergoe the laſh
of contemptible words, or think it ſtrange that they ſuffer the
ſcourge of the tongue. This being likewiſe to be adverted by
thoſe in authority, that diſdainfull and mutinous ſpeeches, ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of miſcontent, are the ſmoke, that goes before the flame of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
forth in rebellion, and therefore to be heeded.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Sheba</hi> after diſowning of <hi>Davids</hi> government over them,
bids <hi>Iſraell go to their tents to live as it were at liberty,</hi> as it is ſaid
in the book of the <hi>Judges, that there was no King in Iſraell in thoſe
daies, and therefore every one did as he thought good.</hi> Where we
ſee the ordinary practiſe of the Authors of ſedition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime,
and pretend the liberty of a people, from a juſt and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſubjection, while as they intend to bring them under the yoke
of unjuſt uſurpation.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. All <hi>Iſraell</hi> revolts from <hi>David,</hi> and followes <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
as nothing then is more unſtable then a multitude, who upon
every light occaſion, or irritation, are ready to affect a change:
and withdraw their necks from under the yoke of preſent autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
ſo there is no levity, nor love, that can be ſecurity enough
for Princes; (ſuch as <hi>David</hi> ſhew lately to this people after his
victory) without the awfulneſs of power, and the feare of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p>10. As Bees when they are once up in a ſwarme, are ready
to light upon every bough: ſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being ſtirred up by
the late rebellion of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> are apt here alſo to follow a <hi>Sheba,</hi>
eſpecially (as is ſaid) finding nothing but clemency, and <hi>Davids</hi>
paſſing by their former revolt. It is dangerous therefore for any
ſtate, that the multitude ſhould once know the way to inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the leaſt tract whereof in this kind, being eaſily made a
beaten path, without timely curbing, and reſiſting begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
                  <p>11. Though <hi>Iſraell</hi> rebell, yet <hi>Judah</hi> continues loyall. The
Godly then in their greateſt diſtreſſes or deſertions, ſhall never
want ſome friends, as were <hi>Obadiah</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> neither ſhall
the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> ever be left deſtitute, of ſome true ſubjects,
in the time of greateſt Apoſtaſies, like 7000. in <hi>Iſraell, that had

                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>David</hi> before he took courſe for ſuppreſſing
<hi>Sheba,</hi> beginneth a reformation in his own houſe by ſhutting up,
and ſequeſtrating from his company thereafter, thoſe his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,
whom <hi>Abſolom</hi> had de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iled. The like of this did <hi>Jacob,
Gen.</hi> 35. when he was commanded by God to ariſe and go to
<hi>Bethel,</hi> in cauſing his houſhold to out away the ſtrange gods,
that were amongſt them: leaving hereby a Godly and good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to all men, Princes and paſtours who would reforme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to beginne the reformation of abuſes, at their own perſons
and families.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Amaſa</hi> being reconciled to <hi>David,</hi> is imployed
by him to aſſemble all <hi>Judah</hi> for the purſuit of <hi>Sheba.</hi> It is no
ſmall wiſdome then to make a friend of a foe, and to ingage ſuch
a one, who is newly reconciled, wherein he may be confirmed, by
his own act.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Joab</hi> having now <hi>Amaſa,</hi> imployed by <hi>David,</hi> and ſet
in his roome: he ſmarts for a loyall diſobedience in killing of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom,</hi>
and for his too peremptory and bold ſpeech thereafter,
which he had to the King, although had been a man of great
meriting before, and many atcheivments. Whereby we ſee how
ſlipry are Princes Courts, how changeable is their favour, and
how unſtable are places of preferment, as we ſee in <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h,</hi> who
knew not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> favour towards <hi>Haman,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
here towards his couſing <hi>Joab.</hi> O happy then are they
who are in favour with God, whoſe love is Immutable and

change.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Amaſa</hi> is directed to aſſemble all <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>David</hi> in
three dayes. Which ſhewes that in ſuppreſſing of ſudden inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
there is need of ſpeed, and the leaſt delay in rebellion is
dangerous, and may prove irrecoverable.</p>
                  <p>

tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how kindly kiſſes he him with his lippes, but how cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
killes he him with his hand, as he had done to <hi>Abner</hi> before.
Whereby we ſee, that there is no enmity ſo dangerous, as that
which comes like <hi>Jails</hi> to <hi>Sicera, Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> to Chriſt, and <hi>Joabs</hi>
here to <hi>Amaſa,</hi> masked with love, for open hoſtility calls us to
our guard, but there is no fence againſt a truſted treachery. Thus
ſoiritually dealeth the world with our ſoules, it kiſſes us, and
ſtabbs us at once, if it did not embrace us with one hand, it
could not murther us with the other, the evill of whoſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
like <hi>Joab</hi> his ſword we advert not, more then <hi>Amaſa</hi>
took heed to <hi>Joabs</hi> ſword, God deliver us therefore from our
truſt therein, and we ſhall be the ſafer from the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>17. The cauſe of this treacherous murther in <hi>Joab,</hi> was his
pride, not enduring that any ſhould be put in his roome, and his
envy at <hi>Amaſa's</hi> preferment (though ſo neer in kinne unto him.)
Which ſhewes unto us, what dangerous, and damnable vices pride
and envy are: and what bad fruits the ſame doth produce, as we
ſee they did before, in the murther of <hi>Abner.</hi> And as pride doth
here in burſting all bands to God, King, Country, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Amaſa</hi> likewiſe now being in peace and preſerment, and
expecting no harm, receives that reward which he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in warre, when he was following <hi>Abſolom</hi> and leader of his
Army. God then the righteous judge of the world, we ſee, has
his own times of puniſhing, though magiſtrates forbeare. And
God is juſt in all his waies, though man be unjuſt. Neither let
any who ſinne, and are on evill courſes, dreame of impunity, but
that at one time or other, they ſhall ſmart for their guiltineſs: and
oftimes when they leaſt ſuſpect danger.</p>
                  <p>19. <hi>Amaſa</hi> is innocent of the crime, of ſeeking <hi>Joabs</hi> place,
for which he is murthered by him, yet he is guilty before God,
for his ſiding with <hi>Abſolom.</hi> Whereupon we collect, that oftimes
men ſuffer innocently for ſome crimes that are laid to their
charge: and in reſpect of the perſons who are their purſuers, yet
in Gods judgment they are juſtly puniſhed for other ſins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
either they have been ſpared, or elſe has not been noted to the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:119120:148"/>
world; &amp; as many at the hour of their death, &amp; execution, publicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have acknowledged. With ſhould teach all men to flie ſinne,
though never ſo ſecretly committed, or by men paſt by, and
where impiety is, not to expect impunity at one time, or other.</p>
                  <p>20. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. It is ſaid; That <hi>Amaſa took no heed to the ſword
that was in</hi> Joabs <hi>hand, wherewith he killed him,</hi> and ſo foreſaw
not his danger, which ſhewes, that God blinds the eyes of the
wiſeſt, and benum's their judgments, when he is to cut the pillars
of their ſtanding, and the thred of their lives, according to the
proverb, <hi>hos dementat quos Jupiter vult perdere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Joab</hi> was not puniſhed by <hi>David,</hi> for the like muthering
of <hi>Abner,</hi> as he did now of <hi>Amaſa,</hi> therefore he committeth this
new offence, and pollutes the Land with blood again, the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
whereof for this toleration did lie upon the royall throne,
which ſhould teach all Magiſtrates, to uſe the ſword aright which
God hath put in their hands impartially, and without reſpect of
perſons, otherwiſe what further ſinne is committed by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
of the former, they become guilty thereof, and may expect
divine puniſhment for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>22. After the death of <hi>Amaſa, Joab</hi> with <hi>Abiſhai</hi> perſue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Sheba</hi> a traitour to his King, while as himſelf is a traitour to
his friend, a publicke perſon, imployed by his King in a publicke
ſervice, in the very execution thereof, and who was both inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
expecting no ſuch thing, and couſen german with <hi>Joab,</hi>
whereby we ſee how ready ſome are to cenſure, condemne, and
puniſh that in another, whereof themſelves are guilty, as we ſee
<hi>Gen.</hi> 38. In <hi>Judah,</hi> and that no bands of nature can ty to duties
where grace is wanting.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>The people paſſing by when they ſaw</hi> Amaſa <hi>lying
in the high way killed, they ſtood ſtill.</hi> Which ſhewes us that the
death of great men draw many eyes upon it, and many cenſures
of it, whether they be in Church, or Commonwealth, therefore
their life ſhould be ſo ordered, as their death may juſtly be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned,
as <hi>Samuell</hi> was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 1.</p>
                  <p>24. <hi>Joabs</hi> man ſeeing this, removes <hi>Amaſa</hi> out of the high
way and covers him, not regarding ſo much the loſſe as the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore
of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Thus wicked politicians care not ſo much for
the committing of wickedneſſe, as the notice thereof, therefore
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:119120:149"/>
if murthers, oppreſſions, thefts whoredomes be ſmothered, and
hid from the knowledge of men, their Atheiſt, blind and obdured
hearts care not for the omniſcient knowledge of the Almighty,
who has power both of ſoul &amp; body to caſt into Hell fire, whence
it is ſaid by the <hi>Pſalmiſt, The fool hath ſaid in his heart, that there
is no God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. <hi>Amaſa</hi> being thus removed out of the way, the people
follow bloody <hi>Joab</hi> in perſuit of rebellious <hi>Sheba, Verſ.</hi> 13. Their
leader being wicked and evill, but the cauſe which they chiefly
followed being good. It is to the cauſe then, which we ought to
look, and not cenſure the cauſe, or judge thereof by perſons, or
their perſonall faults, who maintain the ſame, but ſeparating the
precious from the vile, and diſtinguiſhing between the one and
the other. Let us adhear to the cauſe, or to that which is good,
whether Doctrine, forme of government, or other, and leave the
perſons for their faults to God, and them who has power to
puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>26. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Sheba</hi> being perſued betakes himſelf, to <hi>Abell</hi> a
fenced City as <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. To eſcape taking, which
notwithſtanding of intended ſafety did prove his ruin, God ſo
diſappointing the projects and practiſes of wicked men, that he
makes their glory to turn to their ſhame, and turneth their
wiſdome like <hi>Achitophells</hi> into folly, and that wherein they place
their confidence and ſafety, to tend to their deſtruction. O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
then is he who is directed by God, who puts his whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
onely in him, and makes him to be onely his ſunne and
his ſhield, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11.</p>
                  <p>27. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. For preſervation of the City, onely a wiſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
appears and parlies with <hi>Joab.</hi> Whereby we obſerve that
God uſeth weak inſtruments oftimes to effectuate great purpoſes,
that the glory may be his own, and the good redound to others,
as we ſee in <hi>Deborah, Jaill, Judith,</hi> this wiſe Woman here and
many others: and that Gods graces, as wiſdome and the like, are
not tyed to any one ſex, but are free to all on whom it pleaſes
the Lord to beſtow the ſame.</p>
                  <p>28. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. She convinceth <hi>Joab,</hi> firſt by authority of
Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 10. <hi>That peace ſhould be offered to any City
firſt, before the invaſion thereof.</hi> Whereby we ſee, that even then
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:119120:149"/>
Gods people were accuſtomed with Scripture, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof, againſt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> prohibition of <hi>Laiks,</hi> to read the
ſame, and which 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. Sheweth to be injurious, as alſo
that Scripture ſhould be the warrant and rule of all our actions,
from which whatſoever diſagreeth ſhould be eſchewed, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
agreeth with the ſame in matters intellectuall, or in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
morall and practicall, ſhould be followed, and obeyed. And
as this was the Law of God, and his rule preſcribed to others;
ſo is it his owne gracious practiſe towards all rebellious ſinners:
he firſt offers peace and reconciliation to them by the Miniſtry of
his Goſpell, in treating and beſeeching them to be reconciled to
him, before ever he take any other courſe of puniſhing, or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeing
them. Where alſo we ſee what ſhould be the ſcope and
end of warre, towit, peace, and procurement thereof, which if it
have any other end, it turn's to publicke murther.</p>
                  <p>29. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. She ſhewes in her own perſon to <hi>Ioab,</hi> what was
the diſpoſition of all her fellow Citizens, towit, that they were
peaceable, and faithfull, or loyall, two good properties, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in Citizens, and in all other ſubjects, and contrary to the
diſpoſition of ſeditions, unquiet and firy ſpirited perſons, who
like <hi>Salamanders</hi> delight in the fire, and flame of contention, and
<hi>love ever</hi> (as we ſay, <hi>to fiſh in drumly, or muddy waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. She alſo calles the City of <hi>Abell a mother in Iſraell,</hi> becauſe
of the birth and breeding of the inhabitants therein, by analogy
whereof all Citizens, and others are taught what duty they owe
to their native Cities, and country and compatriots: for the
which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were ſo zealous, and for the good where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the very heathen feared not to yield up their lives.</p>
                  <p>31. She deſires alſo, <hi>Ioab not to devoure, or ſwallow up by the
ſword the Lords inheritance,</hi> it being a City of that holy Land,
which the Lord ſo owned. Whereupon we note in generall the
right uſe of the ſword to be as <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the innocent, and to puniſh onely the nocent;</hi> and not to do the
contrary, which ſhould be an admonition to all Magiſtrates, and
thoſe who have power of the ſword.</p>
                  <p>32. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Ioab</hi> in great vehemency he deprecates that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of any intention he had to deſtroy, or waſte that City,
though having harbored a traitour, providing he onely were
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:119120:150"/>
delivered, a worthy and imitable example of a wiſe and valorous
generall, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 23. Concerning the Lord;
<hi>That he would not deſtroy the righteous with the wicked.</hi> How fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then is their condition, and what ſhall be their anſwer in the
day of their account. Who upon the quarrell onely of their
own ambition, have not ſpared to waſte whole tribes of the
<hi>Iſraell</hi> of God, and as may be ſeen in the bloody warres of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt Nation at this very day.</p>
                  <p>33. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. According to this wiſe Womans capitulation,
and concluſion with <hi>Ioab, Sheba's</hi> head is cut off, and caſt over
the wall unto him, and that moſt juſtly loſes he his head and life,
who had conſpired againſt the head of his people, and to take his
life from him, and no leſſe wiſely by the perſwaſion of this wiſe
Woman, does the inhabitants of this City ſave their own heads
by delivering of his head to <hi>Ioab.</hi> Thus does <hi>Sheba's</hi> pride and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
bring him in the end, &amp; in the very place where he placed
his ſecurity, to a violent and a ſhamefull end, the ſame or the
like whereof may all ſuch <hi>Sheba's</hi> expect, who riſe up and rebell
againſt lawfull and eſtabliſhed authority. Spiritually alſo the caſe
is ours, every mans breaſt is a City incloſed, every ſinne is a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
that lurks within theſe walls, God calls to us for <hi>Sheba's</hi>

by mortification, he having no quarrel to our perſon, but
for our ſinne, if we be wiſe then, we will hearken to this his deſires,
if we love the life of our own ſouls, and then, we cannot be more
willing to part with our ſinne, then our mercyfull God is to
withdraw his judgments, elſe if we love the head of his traitour
better nor the life of our own ſoul, we ſhall juſtly periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>34. Then <hi>Joab</hi> returnes with Victory, and hopes by <hi>Sheba's</hi>
head to pay the price of <hi>Amaſa's</hi> blood, <hi>David</hi> hates the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
entertaines the man, delayes the revenge, <hi>Ioab</hi> was ſo great
and popular, that it was no marvell that <hi>David</hi> ſayes; <hi>The Sonnes

to puniſh him. Greateſt powers then we ſee have not all content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

the right adminiſtration, of all the affaires of his Kingdome, and
therefore appoints ſeverall perſons both in Church, and ſtate, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary

               <head>II. SAM. Chap. 21.</head>
               <p>THis Chapter is branched forth in two parts, the firſt is the
Hiſtory of the three years famine, that was upon the Land,
<hi>to the</hi> 15. <hi>verſe.</hi> And the ſecond is the foure Victories which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and his ſervants purchaſed againſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> again, the
Hiſtory of the famine is reduced to theſe three particulars. 1. The
famine it ſelf, and deprehenſion of the cauſe thereof, <hi>From the</hi>
1. <hi>verſe to the third.</hi> 2. The remedy that is ſought, and adhibited.
3. The ceaſing of the plague there upon, and the buriall of <hi>Saul</hi>
and <hi>Jonathans</hi> bones, and the ſeven Sonnes of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom the
<hi>Gibeonites</hi> hanged.</p>
               <p>1. As for the famine it ſelf, it is one of the three ſore plagues
with which the Lord uſually threatned his people for their ſinnes,
the famine, the ſword, and the Peſtilence, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 23.
and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 13. And it is twofold, towit, a famine of the ſtaff
of bread, wherewith our bodies are fed, and this naturall life;
which is here meant, and a famine of the word of God, which is
the ſpirituall bread wherewith our ſouls are fed, and the ſpirituall
life thereof, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11. And which is the greateſt plague of any.
With all theſe three fornamed plagues <hi>David,</hi> and his Land was
corrected. 1. By the ſword of rebellion lately. 2. Now by three
years famine, <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 24. By the plague of Peſtilence for his
numbring the people.</p>
               <p>The time then when this famine was, is in the dayes of <hi>David,</hi>
neer the end of his raigne, and after all his inteſtine troubles from
the hand of man are ſetled; then the Lords own hand exerciſes
<hi>David,</hi> and his people with a new correction. Whoſe courſe for
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:119120:151"/>
deprehenſion of the cauſe of which famine he takes is, like a wiſe
<hi>Phyſitian,</hi> that ſeeks out the cauſe of the ſickneſſe firſt, and ſo doth
<hi>David,</hi> and the perſon at whom he inquires, is ſaid to be the
Lord, who is an omniſcient God, and who laid on the rod, and
therefore could beſt tell, for what cauſe he did it: which inquiry
was not immediatly by <hi>David</hi> himſelf; but by the ordinary mean
that was uſed, towit, by the mediation of the high prieſt, before
the Ark by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thumim,</hi> as was preſcribed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. And
unto which the Lord readily and cleerly anſwered, &amp; ſhewed that
it was for <hi>Saul</hi> and his bloody houſe in generall, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
becauſe he ſlew the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> againſt oath and covenant,
and ſo joyned to cruelty the fearfull ſinne of perjury. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
having found out the cauſe, comes next to inquire at the
<hi>Gibeonites</hi> who were the party offended, what ſhould be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
to whom the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> anſwer. 1. Negatively, that
they would not have either Gold or Silver of <hi>Sauls,</hi> or of his
houſe. 2. Neither that <hi>David</hi> ſhould for them kill any man in
<hi>Iſraell,</hi> whereby they ſhew that they had no quarrell againſt
the Nation in generall, for that cruelty which <hi>Saul</hi> had uſed
againſt them, diſtinguiſhing ſo between a nationall and a perſonall
quarrell, and between innocents and guilty. 3. They anſwer
poſitively, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. That they would demand by way of reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
ſeven of <hi>Sauls</hi> Sonnes, who had conſummed them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to deſtroy them throughout all the coaſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be
delivered to them, and that they might hang them up unto the
Lord, as an atonement of his wrath againſt <hi>Iſraell,</hi> for their
King <hi>Saul</hi> his cruelty and perjury, and in that very place which
was called from his name, <hi>Gibeah</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> and where he was
borne and bred, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 26. To which demand of their's
<hi>David</hi> anſwered by granting the ſame, onely he ſpared <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth</hi>
the Sonne of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> becauſe of the Lords oath that
was between <hi>David</hi> and him, and delivered to them the two
Sonnes of <hi>Rizpah Sauls</hi> Concubine, and five others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Sonnes of <hi>Michal Sauls.</hi> Daughter, not that ſhe did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them to <hi>Adriell</hi> who was their Father, ſeeing ſhe was childleſſe
to the day of her death, but that ſhe adopted them, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
Daughter did <hi>Moſes,</hi> and becauſe of her education of them as if
they had been her Sonnes, and therefore it is ſaid in the text,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:119120:151"/>
                  <hi>Whom ſhe brought up for Adriell,</hi> who had to his Wife, <hi>Merab
Sauls</hi> eldeſt Daughter, as we ſee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 19. Who was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
mother to theſe five Sonnes, and probably was dead, and
therefore her Siſter <hi>Michall</hi> had taken them to bring up. Theſe
ſeven then being delivered, the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> accordingly did hang
them up on the hill before the Lord, in the beginning of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Harveſt, which was in moneth which we call <hi>March.</hi> Whom
<hi>Rizpah</hi> (out of naturall affection to her own two Sonnes, and
kindeneſſe to the reſt) did watch night and day, that neither the
birds ſhould reſt on them by day, nor the beaſts of the field by
night ſhould tear them, and this ſhe did from the beginning
of the barly Harveſt, till rain dropped from Heaven upon them,
or that rainy wether began, after the great drouth which had
been before and cauſed the famine, having ſpread ſackcloth for her
upon the rock, in witneſſing of her mourning for them, where we
have this doubt to be ſolved, how are theſe ſuffered to hang ſo
long, ſeeing it expreſly againſt the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23.
<hi>Which commandeth that the bodies of ſuch ſhall not remaine all
night upon the tree?</hi> To which it is anſwered, that the Law of God
is made for man and not to controll the Author, whoſe power is
abſolute, and this fact (like robbing of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi>) being extraordinare, having a ſpeciall warrant from the
Oracle which was conſulted, no doubt their avent.</p>
               <p>This fact of <hi>Rizpah</hi> being told to <hi>David,</hi> he is ſo moved by
her kindeneſſe to the dead, as he follows her example herein, by
bringing the bones of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> from <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> and
honourable burying them in the ſepulchre of <hi>Kiſh Sauls</hi> Father,
in <hi>Zelah</hi> of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as alſo in burying of the bones of theſe ſeven
Sonnes of <hi>Saul</hi> that were hanged. Whereupon the Lord was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
for the Land, and the famine removed.</p>
               <p>Thereafter <hi>from the</hi> 15. <hi>verſe, to the end,</hi> is ſet down the four
ſucceſſive, and ſeverall Victories which <hi>David</hi> and his ſervants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
over the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and in ſpeciall over the Sonnes of a
great giant <hi>Rapha,</hi> the firſt whereof was, <hi>David</hi> being preſent
and in great danger by one of the Sonnes of the giant, from
which <hi>Abiſhai</hi> delivered him being faint, by killing the Sonne of
that giant who purſued him. Whereupon <hi>Davids</hi> men reſolve by
an oath, that he no more ſhould go out with them to battel, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:119120:152"/>
hazard his perſon, leſt he thereby ſhould quench the light of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> The ſecond and third battle was at <hi>Gob,</hi> where the other
two of the Sonnes of the giant were ſlain, and the fourth and laſt
battle was at <hi>Gath,</hi> where the fourth Son of the giant was ſlain,
and ſo all his Sonnes, who were borne unto him there periſhed.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. BY this famine for the ſpace of three years together, after
the ſword. We ſee that it is the lot of the Godly to be
exerciſed with diverſe croſſes in this life, as it is ſaid, many are
the troubles of the righteous, that ſo their hearts my be weaned,
from the love thereof, and ſet upon the deſire of a better life, and
on the right way to attain thereto, were there is fulneſſe of joy, &amp;
pleaſures for evermore, holyneſſe being the way to this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. The continuance of this famine three years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
makes <hi>David</hi> at laſt to inquire for the cauſe thereof. Where
we ſee, that when any croſſe, or affliction continueth unremoved,
it ſhould drive us to the inquiſition, and ſelf tryall of the cauſe,
which while that be found out (as <hi>Achans</hi> guiltineſſe) the rod
will not be removed, nor the plague ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>3. This famine is ſaid to have continued three years. Which
ſhewes unto us, that as the Lord is he who layes on the rod, ſo
likewiſe he limits the time of the laying on of the ſame, as he did
as long the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> ſhould be in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thereafter
in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Which ſhould be an argument of patience under any
croſſe, and of hope for a gracious deliverance in the Lords good
time.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>David</hi> all theſe three years till at laſt, inquires not of the
Lord of the cauſe, partly expecting the yearly removing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and partly becauſe himſelf was not pinched therewith. Which
ſhewes not onely; <hi>Quod non tangit, non angit,</hi> but likewiſe that
the beſt hearts may be ſometimes overtaken, with dulneſſe in holy
duties.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>David</hi> when he ſees the plague, he inquires of the
ſinne, conſidering that never man ſmarted cauſleſly from the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:119120:152"/>
hand of God, and that ſinne ever calls for puniſhment, O then
when we ſuffer, that we would inquire, what have I done? and
that our croſſes were a pedagogie, to lead us to repentance, as
we ſee in the example of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. <hi>Hoſea.</hi>
6. 1.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>David</hi> is a Prophet, and yet the cauſe of this famine is
not revealed to him, but he muſt inquire thereof in the ordinary
way. <hi>If God then will have Prophets, to have recourſe to Prieſts, as
the ordinary way, how to know his will:</hi> how much more ſhould
people, now uſe the ordinary meanes, and not neglect the ſame,
to inquire of Gods Word, and the miniſtry thereof, of Gods will:
as they are commanded, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>David</hi> no ſooner inquires of the cauſe, than the Lord by
his oracle readily anſwers. Whereby we ſee a ground of great
comfort to ſuch, as in ſincerity draw neer to God: as we ſee
in his ready anſwer to the theefe on the croſs, and others. Yea he
has been found of them, that ſought him not: as we ſee in <hi>Pauls</hi>
converſion, and much more will be found of them, who ſeek
him in ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>8. The Lord ſhewes that this plague on the Land, was for
<hi>Saul</hi> and his bloody houſe, becauſe he ſlew the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> Where
we ſee how happy is a land, that has a good King: and how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
a land is, who have an ill King: whoſe ſinne is oftimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
in the perſon, not only of the people while he is alive, as
<hi>Davids</hi> numbering of the people was by peſtilence: but alſo when
they are dead (yet their ſinne not dying) as we ſee in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and in the famine on the land, which his ſinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
                  <p>9. Between <hi>Sauls</hi> ſlaying of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and the time of
this famine on the land, for the ſame there had intervened neer
fifty yeares. Wherein it was forgot by many, that were alive, but
was not forgot by God, who keepes our ſinnes unrepented of, in
a freſh regiſter, till the day of our account and remuneration. It
is therefore a vaine hope of impunity, which ariſes from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of judgments. Which oftimes is for this cauſe, that the cup
of ſinners (as was of the <hi>Amorites</hi>) is not yet full.</p>
                  <p>10. This ſin was not the ſinne of the preſent age, but of the
former generation, and yet thoſe of the preſent age are puniſhed:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119120:153"/>
ſo that ſinne never goes unpuniſhed (as we ſay) either in the ſtock
or brock, as many houſes of our land can verifie, and according
as it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord will viſite the ſinnes of the Fathers upon
the Children, to the third and fourth generation:</hi> to wit, with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
judgments as here, but not with eternall, which is only
perſonall, and not ſucceſſive: except they tred the ſteps of their
ſinnefull, and impenitent predeceſſours.</p>
                  <p>11. Amongſt all <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinnes, which were many and great:
the Lord pitches only on blood guiltineſs, and perjury. All ſinnes
having a loud cry in the Lords eares for vengeance, but none ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a louder cry then blood guiltineſs. As we ſee in that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,</hi>
and of Chriſt whom he typified. whereof the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſaid,
<hi>His blood be on us and on our Children,</hi> ſo alſo of his <hi>Martyrs,</hi>
Revel. 6. 10. And of all other innocent perſons whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>12. Likewiſe as he calls <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe a bloody houſe, ſo the
Lord layes to his charge, the guiltineſs of perjury by ſlaying of
the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> contrary to the oath of the Lord made unto
them, by <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Joſh. 9. 3. So that
perjury is a grievous, and damnable ſinne, violating that which
is moſt ſacred the oath of God: and which kindles Gods wrath
here, that without repentance ſhall burne againſt the guilty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all eternity hereafter, except they repent.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. It is ſaid that <hi>Saul ſought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>David</hi> askes the <hi>Gibeonites what he ſhould do to
them? and wherewith ſhould he make atonement.</hi> Whereby we ſee
that he looked not on the ſecundary cauſes of the famine, as
drouth and unſeaſonable ſeaſons or the like, but he looks higher
to a provoked God by ſinne, who be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to do, when either any generall plague, or puniſhment is on the
land, or any particular chaſtiſement is upon themſelves, or their

                  <p>15. In <hi>Davids</hi> asking the <hi>Gibeonites what he ſhould do for them?</hi>
We ſee likewiſe that <hi>David,</hi> as being acquainted with Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
knew well that the removall of the judgment, beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to beginne at the ſatisfaction of the party wronged. For we
ſay, <hi>non remittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur ablatum,</hi> and that by
ſo doing, the ſinne which cryed for a curſe, being removed with
the judgment, a bleſſing may come in place thereof.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. The <hi>Gibeonites</hi> in their anſwer to <hi>David.</hi> 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
any ſatisfaction for the blood and lives of their predeceſſours
by ſilver or gold of <hi>Saul</hi> or his houſe. To ſhew that they were
free of covetouſneſs in that matter, and would not make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
of that, which was ſo precious to them, who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by <hi>Saul</hi> which thing may condemne many Chriſtians now
a daies, and make them aſhamed: who for mony and price, will
ſell the blood and lives of their deareſt, and neereſt relations, and
not proſecute the law againſt ſuch, who have polluted the land
by blood guiltineſs, if their greed be once ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. In their demand alſo of ſeaven of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonnes
to be delivered to them, to be hanged by them in <hi>Gibeah</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi>
for his conſuming and deſtroying of them. We ſee not only that
the Lord oftimes, retaliates ſinne with the like puniſhment, and
deſtruction: but alſo that it is lawfull for perſons wronged, to
have their recourſe for remedy, and ſatisfaction to the civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
howſoever private revenge be alwaies forbidden.</p>
                  <p>18. The Lord ſmites the land with famine, for this wrong
whereof they complaine, and they know it not, till <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales
it to them, and the Lord to him. Which ſheweth, that the
righteous judge, oftimes avengeth the vexations and wrongs that
are done to men, when they are not a ware, nor think thereof:
our hard meaſures then, are not hid from him, though his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
are oftimes hid from us, it is ſufficient that God can be no
more neglective, then ignorant of our wrongs.</p>
                  <p>19. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. For <hi>Sauls</hi> offence and ſinne, ſeaven of his ſonnes
are delivered to be hanged up. It is then an ill inheritance, that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119120:154"/>
wicked parents leave to their Children, to wit, to be puniſhed
for their offences: as is ſaid, <hi>That the Lord will viſit the ſinnes of
the Fathers on the Children, to the third and fourth generation.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a numerous ofſpring of Children ever a bleſſing, or to be
gloried in, ſeeing as <hi>Jerubaall's</hi> 69 ſonnes were all ſlaine, by their
own brother <hi>Abimelech</hi> upon one ſtone: and <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeaven ſonnes
here, were hanged on a gallowes, ſo to the great griefe of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
if they be alive, or to their friends if they be dead, they
may come to woefull, and violent ends, though never ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>20. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Alwaies <hi>David</hi> ſpared <hi>Mephiboſheth, Jonathans</hi>
ſonne, becauſe of the Lords oath, that was between them. Which
ſhewes that the Godly make conſcience, of all their words and
Actions, and of their fidelity and promiſes even to the dead. If
<hi>Davids</hi> love alſo to <hi>Jonathan</hi> preſerves <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> how much
more, then ſhall the Father of mercies, preſerve and do good to
the Children of the Faithfull, for the covenant made with their
Parents in Chriſt, in whom he is well pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Sauls ſeaven ſonnes are hanged on a hill before
the Lord.</hi> The acts of juſtice then as they are intended, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and reſtraint; ſo they ſhould be done in that eminency of
place, that may make others to be both inſtructed, or forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and terrified, then unwarrantable courſes of private revenge,
will ſeek to hide their heads in ſecrecy, but the beautifull face of
juſtice, both affects the light, and becomes it.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. After all this it is ſaid, <hi>that God was intreated
for the land.</hi> Which ſhewes unto us that for the removing of this
plague, not only ſatisfaction was given to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> but
likewiſe earneſt prayer, and intreaty was uſed towards God. As
we ſee the like, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 17. And which ſhould be the practice
of all people, that are under any correction generall or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>23, This ſhewes in like manner, that happy is that land,
where ſinne is ſharply puniſhed, and juſtice impartially executed,
this being a way both to hold off judgments off of a land, if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
as alſo to remove them if they be incumbent.</p>
                  <p>24. Likewiſe we ſee that plagues or puniſhments, as they
come from God in juſtice, ſo upon repentance and humble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:119120:154"/>
and ſupplication they are taken off by God in mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
is ſaid, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>He has torne, and he will heale us, he hath ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and he will bind us up,</hi> being like the centurions ſervants, to
whom if he ſaid <hi>come they come,</hi> and if he ſaid <hi>go they went.</hi>

own ſonnes, but to all the reſt of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonnes, that were hanged
up, by preſerving them from being deſtroyed by birds or beaſt.
We ſee a good example of naturall affection to her own ſonnes,
and of pity, and piety alſo towards the reſt, though dead, and
ignominiouſly hanged, from whom ſhe could expect no thanks
nor reward.</p>
                  <p>26. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. In <hi>David</hi> likewiſe his following of her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
towards the dead (though his enemies) by bringing the
bones of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> from <hi>Jabeſh Gilead,</hi> and burying
them in <hi>Sauls</hi> City of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and in the buriall place of his
Father <hi>Kiſh,</hi> as alſo in burying <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeaven ſonnes, that were
hanged. We ſee a worthy part in <hi>David,</hi> who hearing what
<hi>Rizpah</hi> had done, diſdaines not to follow her example, though
a woman, in that which was good and commendable. As it
ſhould be the like duty in all, to imitate vertue and piety, in any
perſon whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>27. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. It is ſaid that the <hi>Philiſtims had yet warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with Iſraell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Which ſhewes unto us, the reſtleſs and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
malice, and enmity of the wicked againſt the Godly:
and what ſhall be the condition, of Chriſts Church, to the end
of the world, under the raigne of the ſonne of <hi>David:</hi> which
may be confirmed by many examples, of all ages. In the houſes
of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> between <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
Gods people, in the deſert between <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and <hi>Amalek,</hi> &amp;c. In
the daies of the <hi>Judges,</hi> between <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and their many enemies,
between <hi>David,</hi> here and the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> between the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Church, and the <hi>heathen Emperours,</hi> the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and now between <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours
and <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> Whereupon let us learne two things.
1. To prepare for the battle. And 2. not to love the worſe
the truth, and profeſſours thereof, becauſe it is oppoſed by many
enemies.</p>
                  <p>28. It is ſaid <hi>That in the firſt battle with the Philiſtims David
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119120:155"/>
waxed faint,</hi> and was in great danger of his life by a gyant, till
he was delivered by his Captaine <hi>Abiſhai</hi> who ſlew him. Which
ſhewes unto us the infirmity of old age, as we ſee <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>David</hi> was now, his naturall ſtrength being decayed, and
which every aged perſon ſhould beſeech God, to recompence
with the ſpirituall ſtrength of grace. In our ſpirituall battle like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with our ſpirituall enemies, oftimes we faint, and are in great
danger, being invaded by the great gyant Satan: but he ſhall not
prevaile, becauſe, that he who is the Captaine of the hoſt of the
Lord, (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 14.) is neer, and ready to deliver us, who hath
overcome Satan, and freed us from his danger, as <hi>David</hi> did the
lamb out of the Lyons mouth.</p>
                  <p>29. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. In the peoples ſwearing that <hi>David ſhould no
more go out in battle with them.</hi> We ſee the loyall and loving care,
that they have of the preſervation of his life, with the hazard of
their own notwithſtanding. Which is and ſhould be to all loving
ſubjects, an example of worthy imitation, ſeeing God has made
ſuch to be our heads: therefore we ſhould be ſo farre from
conſpiring with <hi>Abſoloms,</hi> or <hi>Sheba's</hi> againſt their lives, that on
the contrary as in the naturall body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the arms and hands will
ward any blow intended againſt the head: ſo ſhould we any hurt,
that is intended againſt them, whom God has placed in ſupreame
Authority over us.</p>
                  <p>30. The men of <hi>David</hi> decree, and ſweare this, <hi>leaſt he ſhould
by endangering himſelfe, quench the light of Iſraell.</hi> Which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was, both for wiſdome and policy, as alſo for religion and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
as Godly paſtours are likewiſe called the <hi>light of the world,
Matth.</hi> 5. Both in reſpect of ſound doctrine, as alſo of a holy
converſation. Where we obſerve what reverend, and good eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
people ſhould have, both of good Princes, and Godly
Paſtours. As we ſee here of <hi>Davids</hi> men in the one, and the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi>
in the other, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 14. And that both Princes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,
ſhould ſtrive to be lights before their people, that as light
is comfortable, ſo they may be comfortable inſtruments, for the
good of their people. And as lights and lanternes goe before, and
leade, as the fiery pillar did <hi>Iſraell</hi> in the wilderneſs, and the ſtarre
the wiſe men: ſo they may go before in a Godly, and good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not be as darkneſs by the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:119120:155"/>
31. In <hi>David,</hi> and his ſervants victory at laſt over all thoſe
gyants that invaded them. We ſee that bodily abilities, are not to
be truſted or gloried in: and that there is no wiſdome alſo, nor
ſtrength againſt the Lord, nor them for whom he ſtands. As we
ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38. As likewiſe we ſee what the Godly, and they
who truſt in him, may expect againſt all their moſt mighty or
malicious enemies, to wit, deliverance and victory in the end.
So that they may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. <hi>and</hi> 37. <hi>If God
be for us, who can be againſt us? Nay in all theſe things we are more
then Conquerours, through him that hath loved us.</hi>

            <div type="section">
               <head>II. SAM. Chap. 22. from the 1. Verſe to the 21.</head>
               <p>IN the former Chapters, we have ſet down <hi>Davids</hi> many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
againſt his divers, and potent enemies both forraine, and
domeſtick. After which when he enoyes peace in the end of his
raigne, he praiſes and extolles the goodneſs of God towards him.
So that as he began his kingdome with prayer, as his ſonne <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
alſo did: ſo he cloſes and concludes the ſame with praiſe,
theſe two religious exerciſes being the Lords prerogative, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
50. 15. Which ſong of praiſe in this Chapter is coincident, both
for matter and words, with the 18. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> in the expoſition
whereof, we mind not therefore copiouſly, and accurately to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and which we remit to the many worthy Divines, who
have written upon the book of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> but generally to
illuſtrate the matter proponed in this Chapter, ſo farre as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
for the continuation, and more clearing of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>The purpoſe then of <hi>David</hi> in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is to praiſe God for
his many deliverances, and victories over his Enemies: bearing
the type of the trophe's, that Chriſt and his Church, ſhall in like
manner obtaine over all his, and their Enemies.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the matter proponed here is high, mixed and of
great variety, and therefore hardly can be reduced to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
method: yet for facility and inſtruction, we divide the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:119120:156"/>
ſam: into a Preface, a propoſition, a confirmation, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>The preface is the inſcription of the <hi>Pſalm, verſ.</hi> 1. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
is the commendation of the omnipotent power, and
gracious favour of God towards him, <hi>to the</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
and probation thereof, is taken from two arguments,
the one is from the commemoration of the power, and mercy
of God, delivering him from his Enemies, amplified <hi>from the</hi>
5. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 29. the ſecond is from the narration of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
given to him over them, <hi>from the</hi> 29. <hi>to the</hi> 47. <hi>verſ.</hi>
Whereupon he inferres the concluſion, that therefore he will
praiſe God, ſerve him, and call upon his name, for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits:
paſt, preſent, and promiſed to his ſeed forever: and will
make a perpetuall profeſſion thereof, and leave the example of the
ſame, to his poſterity for their imitation.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Preface which we ſupply, from the inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the 18. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it containes five things. 1. The Author.
2. To whom it is directed. 3. The nature thereof. 4. The time
when it was compoſed. And 5. Upon what occaſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the Author is <hi>David,</hi> who albeit he had other
glorious ſtyles, yet he chooſes this, as the moſt honourable: to be
the Lords ſervant, profeſſing in humility and truth his ſubjection
to God, whoſe Vicegerent he was over others. He is called
therefore the ſervant of the Lord, in reſpect both of his publick
eſtate, as all Kings are called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. And by whom they
raigne, as alſo in his private eſtate, common with all others that
are Godly, and ſerve him.</p>
               <p>2. He to whom this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is directed, is, to the chiefe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
who was over the others who were appointed both by
voyce, and inſtruments, to praiſe God melodiouſly in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and thereby implying the dignity of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The nature of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is <hi>Euchariſticall,</hi> or a ſong of
thankſ-giving, uſed to be ſung after victories, or benefits receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
ſuch as were the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> of <hi>Deborah</hi> and
<hi>Barak,</hi> the women of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> after the killing of <hi>Goliah,</hi> the ſong
of <hi>Simeon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The time was when <hi>David</hi> had peace, within and without his
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:119120:156"/>
Kingdome, which the ungodly abuſe to inſolency, luſt, eaſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
and the like.</p>
               <p>5. The occaſion is, his deliverance from all his Enemies, and
eſpecially his moſt mighty, and capitall Enemy <hi>Saul,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
wicked men would abuſe to their own glory, and oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not to Gods onely, as here doth <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next in the propoſition we have. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> profeſſion of the
Lords goodneſſe towards him in preſerving him from all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
exalted and amplified by eight ſeverall <hi>Epethits,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he compares God, as not being able ſufficiently by one, or a
few to expreſſe his thankfulneſſe, and the Lords goodneſſe. 2. We
have the meanes whereby he procured the Lord to be ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
which is prayer and therefore <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that holy exerciſe from two arguments. 1. Taken from
Gods dignity as worthy to be praiſed, and therefore alſo to be
prayed unto. 2. From the utility that ſhould redound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thereby, towit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thereby he ſhall be ſaved from all his
Enemies.</p>
               <p>The exalting and amplifying of the Lords goodneſſe by the
<hi>Epethits,</hi> which he aſcribes unto him are <hi>Metaphoricall.</hi> And
1. He calles him, <hi>his Rock.</hi> 2. <hi>His Fortreſſe.</hi> 3. <hi>His Deliverer.</hi>
4. <hi>His Shield.</hi> 5. <hi>The Horne of his ſalvation.</hi> 6. <hi>His Tower.</hi>
7. <hi>His Refuge.</hi> And 8. <hi>His Saviour,</hi> whence he gathers. 1. That
therefore in him he will truſt, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 2. That he will call
upon him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Firſt then God is called a <hi>Rock,</hi> and by application of faith,
his <hi>Rock.</hi> 1. Becauſe men take refuge when they are perſued to
Rocks, as we ſee <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 47. The <hi>Benjamites</hi> did to the Rock
<hi>Rimmon,</hi> and ſo, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. The Spouſe is ſaid, <hi>to be in the clifts
of the Rock.</hi> 2. Becauſe wiſe men who would build upon a ſure
foundation, which can neither be undermined, nor overthrown
by ſtorm, they build upon a <hi>Rock, which indeed is Christ Jeſus
againſt which the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail,</hi> and he is alſo
that <hi>Rock,</hi> ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. Which affordeth to us in
the Wilderneſſe of this World, ſpirituall drink, and refreſhment,
whereof he ſpake to the woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>2. He calleth God his <hi>Fortreſſe,</hi> from a <hi>Metaphor</hi> of ſtrong
holds, whereunto men have their recourſe in time of warre,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:119120:157"/>
placeing therein their ſafety, from their perſuing, or aſſaulting
Enemy, and which the Lord proveth to be to all ſuch, who put
their truſt in him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>David</hi> calleth God his <hi>Deliverer,</hi> from Shepherds who
watch over their flocks, and when they are perſued by wilde
beaſts, protect them, and deliver them from them, as <hi>David</hi> did
the the ſheep of his Father, from the Paw of the Lyon and Beare,
the great and good Shepherd of our ſouls, being ſo to all the
ſheep of his flock, as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. And of which number
never a one ſhall periſh.</p>
               <p>4. He calleth God his <hi>Shield,</hi> as he is ſo called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11.
And as he ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 1. Under whoſe ſhelter he
was ſafe, and under the coverture whereof likewiſe laying hold by
faith thereon, <hi>We are ſafe from all the fiery darts of the Divell,
Eph.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>David</hi> calleth God, <hi>The Horne of his ſalvation, a</hi> Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
from horned beaſts, whoſe hornes are their ornaments, and
whereby they both defend themſelves, as alſo puſheth their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
even ſo the Lord is the ornament of the ſoul, and who not
onely is our defence, but alſo the puſher, and deſtroyer of all our
Enemies, eſpecially which are ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>6. He calles him his <hi>Tower,</hi> by which he underſtands that it is
he, who is his eminent refuge, and who exalted him to be King,
and from a low degree raiſed him to an eminent place (ſuch as
Towers are,) as alſo by his many Victories had exalted him, (as
one in a Tower) above all his Enemies, who he had laid low and
ſubdued to him.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>David</hi> calles God his <hi>Refuge,</hi> a <hi>Metaphor</hi> from the City,
of refuge in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, to which the offender had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
for ſafety from his perſuer, and avenger of blood; and to
whom likewiſe when we have offended, muſt have our recourſe
for ſalvation, from the perſuit of juſtice, and the wrath of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and righteous Judge of the whole World.</p>
               <p>8. He calleth God, <hi>his Saviour,</hi> as he is properly and indeed,
not onely from bodily Enemies, and all outward evills, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
but he ſaves his people from their ſinnes, as the Angell ſaid,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. And conſequently from all the evills, that ſinne hath
brought on mankinde, eſpecially death everlaſting, and changing
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:119120:157"/>
the nature of all other things that are evills of their own nature,
and making them work together for their good, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28.
ſhewes, and to turne to their beſt, as the hatred, and ſelling of
<hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren did unto him.</p>
               <p>From which acknowledgment of Gods goodneſſe to him, and
deliverance of him, he gathers two concluſions. 1. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will truſt in him, and ſo make uſe of his by gone expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
for the time to come, as he did when he encountred with
<hi>Goliah.</hi> And 2. that as by prayer and calling upon God, he had
formerly found favour, and deliverance from his Enemies, ſo he
would therefore continue, upon theſe two grounds. 1. Becauſe
the Lord is worthy to be praiſed for his deliverances, which he
giveth; and therefore worthy to be prayed unto, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
be ſtill ſought from him, as we are taught to do, <hi>Pſal.,</hi>
50. 15. 2. Becauſe of the good that he ſhould reap thereby
which is, ſafety from all his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The confirmation of the propoſition is taken from
four arguments. 1. From his extreame, and deſperatelike miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>from the</hi> 5. <hi>verſe to the</hi> 7. 2. From three degrees of Gods
benefits to him, the one, the hearing of his prayers in his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
the other in the wonderfull teſtification of his preſence to
his comfort, and deſtruction of his Enemies, <hi>from the</hi> 7. <hi>verſe to
the</hi> 17. And the third is from the work of his deliverance, <hi>from
the</hi> 17. <hi>verſe to the</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Firſt then he ſets forth his miſeries ranking them in four ſorts,
or expreſſions. 1. <hi>The waves of death compaſſed me.</hi> 2. <hi>The
floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</hi> 3. <hi>The ſorrowes of
Hell,</hi> (or as ſome tranſlate the grave) <hi>compaſſed me about.</hi> And
4. <hi>The ſnares of death prevented me. By the waves of death,</hi> meaning
his frequent, and deadly like dangers, wherein he was, and which
as one wave followes on the back of another did in like manner
follow one after another and aſſault him; ſo that one danger of
death was no ſooner paſt, eſpecially in <hi>Sauls</hi> time, but another
followed in the place thereof.</p>
               <p>Next, <hi>by the floods of ungodly men</hi> is underſtood the multitude
of his wicked Enemies, and their furious rage, which like ſpouts
of waters did terrify him. 3. <hi>By the ſorrowes of Hell,</hi> is meant ſuch
as might bring one to deſpaire, and pit of deſtruction. And 4. <hi>by
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119120:158"/>
the ſnares of death</hi> is underſtood, ſuch ſnares as craftily were laid
for his life, and did threaten aſſuredly death unto him. Whereof
the giving unto him <hi>Michal Sauls</hi> Daughter was one, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.
21. And his imployment of <hi>David</hi> for a dowry to get him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
foreskins of the <hi>Phili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tims,</hi> that he might fall by their hands,
and having thus deſcribed his miſeries, &amp; ſeverall dangers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was, he amplifies the ſame in moſt pithy, and patheticke
words, they compaſt me, they terrified me, they incloſed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and they prevented me, and ſo, as he uſed an aggravating of
words to ſet forth Gods goodneſſe towards him, ſo in the ſame
manner doth he amplify his own dangers and miſery.</p>
               <p>Hereafter he recounts again the Lords mercies and benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him by their degrees, the firſt whereof he makes to be the
Lords hearing of his prayer, which by the word crying he ſhewes
was earneſt, and by ſaying, <hi>He called on the Lord in his diſtreſſe
and cryed,</hi> he ſhewes that the ſame was frequent.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is taken from the arguments of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
whereby he declares the ſame to the comfort of <hi>David,</hi> and
the Godly, and to the terrour, and confuſion of his, and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and this he doth in a <hi>Poeticke</hi> and <hi>Patheticke</hi> manner, the
force whereof is, that as God by the ſudden impreſſions in the
Elements declares his power and preſence; ſo by many evidences
he likewiſe declares the ſame in delivering his own from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and bringing on their Enemies dreadfull deſtruction: ſo that
when we ſee, or hear theſe meteors, they may ſerve as books of
inſtruction, to teach us the mighty Majeſty, and power of God,
for the protection of his own, and overthrow of their Enemies,
and the manifeſtation of his love to the one, and of his wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the other, expreſt by an <hi>Allegoricall</hi> manner of ſpeech, and
as by a fearfull tempeſt and ſtorm raiſed againſt them.</p>
               <p>The third degree of his confirmation of the propoſition is from
the work of the Lords deliverance of him, as is ſaid of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliver's them
out of them all.</hi> And this he propones under the ſimilitude. 1. Of
one that was ready to drown, and periſh in a River of waters,
whereby troubles are meant, according to the Phraſe, that is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
in Scripture, out of which he acknowledgeth his deliverance
was from above, that is, from Heaven when all earthly hope,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119120:158"/>
or help failed, and therefore that as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> Daughter preſerved
<hi>Moſes</hi> by drawing him out of the waters, even ſo did the Lord
preſerve him by delivering him from all theſe troubles. 2. He
amplifies this deliverance from the perſons, and their quality, from
whom he was delivered, towit. 1. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> that they were
ſtrong Enemies, that hated him (this being the ground of their
Enmity.) 2. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> that they were much ſtronger than
he, and therefore by his own ſtrength could not be delivered from
them, but by his, who is omnipotent, and is ſtronger, than they.
Next, he amplifies his deliverance from the vigilancy, and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
of his Enemies, whereby they prevented him in the day of
his calamity, and ſought to ſurpriſe him before he was awar,
or could provide ſufficiently for his own defence: as we ſee in
his own Sonne <hi>Abſoloms</hi> inſurrection, but the Lord was his ſtay,
whereupon he did rely, &amp; truſt. And laſtly, when he was redacted
to great ſtraits, and knew no outget, nor what to doe, except
that (with good <hi>Hezekias</hi>) his eyes were towards the Lord, and
as he ſaid to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>When there was but a ſtep
between him, and death.</hi> Then the Lord brought him forth as
out of a priſon, and delivered him, for no merite of his, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
cauſe, although he was a man according to Gods own
heart, but <hi>becauſe of the Lords free love, and that he delighted in
him.</hi>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>1. <hi>DAvid</hi> calleth himſelf a <hi>Servant to the Lord,</hi> being a great
King over men. Which ſhould be an example to teach all
men, and eſpecially thoſe who are in great places the vertue of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and that the chief point of their office is to ſerve God,
and to uſe their power for him, as the ſame is from him, which
while any neglect, as glorious and proud Tyrants do, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
baſe ſlaves to Satan, and their own beaſtly appetites.</p>
                  <p>2. From the nature of this ſong of praiſe, we learn out of the
ſame inſcription, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. <hi>And firſt verſe of this Chapter.</hi> Where
beſide the generall deliverance from all his Enemies he particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes,
<hi>Saul.</hi> That as it is the duty of all men to be thankfull to God
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119120:159"/>
for all his benefits, in generall, as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 2. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the ſame <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and elſewhere, to recount, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for ſome of the chiefeſt, which we have receaved in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>3. From the time of peace, and tranquillity wherein <hi>David</hi>
doth this; when the Lord had delivered him from the hand of
all his Enemies; We obſerve what ſhould be the right uſe of peace
and proſperity, towit, to expreſſe our thankfulneſſe to God for
the ſame both by word, and deed in the courſe of a Godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and neither to be lulled aſleep thereby, like <hi>Laiſh</hi> in
a carnall ſecurity, nor to pamper our bodies, like the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
nor to glory thereof, and confide therein, with the rich fool
in the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>4. We ſee here likewiſe, that albeit <hi>David</hi> uſed the ſecondary,
and ordinary means of his deliverance from his Enemies, yet he
attributes the ſame onely to God, and his bleſſing of the means,
without which all had been in vain, which he could have uſed, as
we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. And elſewhere, and therefore
in all our enterpriſes, this ſhould be ſought, and in all our ſucceſſes
this ſhould be acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. From <hi>Davids</hi> amplifying of the Lords goodneſſe
to him, by ſo many, and diverſe Epethites, which afford comfort
and inſtruction. We ſee that a Godly and ſenſible ſoul of the Lords
mercies, can never ſufficiently enlarge it ſelf in the expreſſion of,
and acknowledgment of the ſame, and when it hath expatiated it
ſelf, and done all it can, it thinks that it is deficient in duty, and
can never enough magnify the riches of the Lords mercy, and
glory of his grace and goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>6. From his comparing him to a <hi>Rock,</hi> a <hi>Fortreſſe,</hi> a <hi>Horne,</hi>
and a <hi>Tower, &amp;c.</hi> We ſee that from every thing a Godly man can
gather a leſſon of comfort, or duty, as the Bee can gather Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from every flowre, therefore ungrate <hi>Iſraell, Iſai.</hi> 1. <hi>Is ſent to
the Ox, and Aſſe to learn, and the ſluggard to the Bee and Ant,</hi> and
ſuch as are onely <hi>Verball</hi> Profeſſors, to the fruitleſſe Figtree that
was curſed, and the unprofitable ſervant, and hider of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
as alſo wicked livers to the Vineyard ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. From the concluſion which he makes upon all the
former Epethites, that therefore in God he will truſt. We ſee the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:119120:159"/>
uſe, that the Godly make of the Lords by paſt goodneſſe, or
mercies towards them, towit, from their bygone experience
they reſolve ſtill to truſt, and put their confidence in God for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
favours, and manifeſtation of his care, and kindneſſe towards
them, as we ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> reaſoning from the Lyon, and Beares
overthrow, to the like of <hi>Goliah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Davids</hi> next reſolution after truſting in God, is,
<hi>That he will call upon him ſtill as he had done formerly.</hi> Which
ſhewes unto us not onely that as we truſt in God, for his mercy, &amp;
goodneſſe, ſo we muſt ſeek the ſame by prayer, but alſo that we
muſt be conſtant in the exerciſe of this holy duty, praying alwayes
(as the Apoſtle exhorts us) and upon all occaſions, amongſt all
the benefits of God, there being none greater then this, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of our heart, to call upon God, and pouring upon us the
Spirit of grace and ſupplication, and then (which we can have no
greater aſſurance of obtaining our requeſts, then when we get a
heart to ſeek the ſame earneſtly at the Lords hands,) wherefore he
ſubjoynes, ſo <hi>ſhall I be ſaved from my Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. In like manner where <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>he will call upon the
Lord, who is worthy to be praiſed.</hi> We ſee that prayer is onely to
be made to God, and neither to Sainct nor Angell, for as the
Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>How ſhall they call upon him, in whom
they have not believed?</hi> That ſeeing we muſt onely believe in
God, therefore ſayes our Saviour (proving thereby himſelf to be
God) <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> therefore
it will follow that we muſt onely call upon God, theſe two being
the Lords prerogatives royall (as it were) religious prayer, and
praiſe, as we are taught here, as alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>By the waves of death that compaſſed</hi> David, <hi>and
the floods of wicked men, that made him afraid.</hi> We ſee that the
Godly are not onely vexed with outward Enemies, but alſo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
ſometimes with inward troubles, and diſquietings, as we ſee
<hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>Job</hi> 16. 12. <hi>and</hi> 18. 10, 11. And <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22. 1,
14, 15. And therefore none, who are ſo exerciſed with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wreſtlings ſhould think the ſame uncouth, or unuſuall.</p>
                  <p>11. Where in like manner we ſee that <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>That the
floods, or multitude of wicked men made him afraid.</hi> We obſerve
that the beſt of men have their infirmities, and their beſt graces
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119120:160"/>
a mixture there with. So that although <hi>David</hi> truſted in the
Lord, to be ſaved from all his Enemies, as he profeſſeth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3.
<hi>and</hi> 4. Yet this his confidence we ſee is not without fear, the
Spirit bidding him truſt in God; but the fleſh cauſing him to fear
man, ſuch is the battle in the Godlieſt between the fleſh, and the
Spirit, and there being no perfection in this life, that ſo, we may
watch, pray, and be <hi>humble, working out our ſalvation in fear and
trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. By the rehearſall which <hi>David</hi> makes of his miſeries, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
and dangers wherein he was, and out of which the Lord
to the glory of his grace delivered him. We learn that the chief
way to glorify God, and be pertaker of his mercy, is, to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and underſtand our own miſery, and ſeriouſly, and truly to
acknowledge the ſame, as we ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>David</hi> ſayes; <hi>That in his diſtreſſe he called upon
the Lord.</hi> Whereby we learn, that ſanctified troubles drive us to
God, as the hardſhip which the prodigall indured drove him
home to his Father, and as we may ſee in the book of the Judges
at large, <hi>Judg.</hi> 3. 9. And elſewhere, as the bodily diſeaſes alſo
which Chriſt cured brought the ſick unto him, and as the ſtorm,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 24. drove <hi>Peter</hi> to come to Chriſt, and pray to him
for ſafety.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>David</hi> alſo ſayes; <hi>That he called upon the Lord, and he
cryed,</hi> which ſhewes unto us two things, towit, the frequency
of his prayer, as alſo by crying, the fervency of his prayer, which
like a loud cry ſounds in Gods ears, whereby we are taught in
like manner to be frequent in prayer, asking, ſeeking, and knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and as our Saviour prayed in the Garden, and we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,
<hi>Luk</hi> 21. 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. and <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2.
As alſo to be fervent in prayer, and not tepid, or luke warme,
but as the importunate Widdow, and friend, and as the <hi>Cananitiſh</hi>
Woman for her Daughter to be carneſt, wreſtling with <hi>Jacob.</hi>
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll we get the bleſſing, for as the Apoſtle ſayes; <hi>The prayers of the
Godly availe much if they be fervent,</hi> and therefore it is ſaid,
<hi>Act.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>That the Church made earneſt prayer to the Lord for
Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. <hi>David</hi> in like manner ſayes, not onely that <hi>he called upon
the Lord,</hi> but alſo <hi>I cryed</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>to my God.</hi> Whereby we ſee
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119120:160"/>
the application, which faith makes, as <hi>David</hi> made in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſtreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. And as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, <hi>my God, and my Lord.</hi>
Which application and appropriation, (as it were) excites the
Godly to prayer, emboldens them in prayer, and gives them a
holy aſſurance after prayer of obtaining their requeſts.</p>
                  <p>16. He alſo ſaies, that <hi>the Lord did heare him, and his cry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into his eares,</hi> thereby ſignifying what a comfortable returne,
the Lord made of his prayer. Whereby we are taught not only
that we ſhould pray, but alſo that we ſhould try, what returne
is made of our prayers: as when we pray for grace, mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and other ſpirituall gifts, that are neceſſary to ſalvation, the
defect of which triall, makes our prayers to be more out of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
then fruitfull. As likewiſe this is an argument that prayer
ſhould be made only to God, and to no other: becauſe this is his
property, that he heares the prayers of the Godly, whereſoever
they are: which no creature can do, who is not <hi>omnipreſent,</hi> and
<hi>omniſcient</hi> as the Lord is, and who heares not only <hi>vocall,</hi> but
<hi>mentall</hi> prayers: as we ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaies the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 65. 2. <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, unto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thee ſhall all fleſh come,</hi> and conſequently to no other.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. This allegoricall expreſſion of the manifeſtation
of the Lords preſence for the terrour of his foes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. And
comfort of his own, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. Shewes how many waies the Lord
hath, for the confuſion of the Enemies of his Church, and the
deliverance of his own from their rage, and all other danger.
When we behold then theſe meteors, and mutations in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
albeit there be naturall cauſes thereof, yet we ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
higher than nature, to ſupernaturall conſiderations, and
deeply contemplate in them, the might and Majeſty, the power,
and preſence in them of the creator, for the ends forenam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>18. If the manifeſtation of the Lords preſence be ſo terrible
to his foes, as by ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>empeſts, that are temporary, and but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient,
here as is expreſt, and as we ſee was at the giving of the law
in <hi>Sinaj.</hi> How much more unſpeakably terrible, ſhall the Lords
preſence be as a dreadfull judge to malefactours, when he ſhall
come at the laſt day, to exact a ſtrict account of the breach of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119120:161"/>
his law, and when the tempeſt of his dreadfull wrath, and dint
thereof ſhall reſt upon them, unto all eternity.</p>
                  <p>19. Where it is ſaid, <hi>that the earth ſhook,</hi> (being without
ſenſe and ſo great a body) <hi>when the Lord was wroth, and that it
trembled, and that the very foundations of the heaven alſo moved
and ſhook,</hi> which is a farre greater, and glorious fabrick then the
earth. O then, when the Lord is angry for ſinne, how ſhould
the greateſt, and moſt high, and glorious Kings, and others on
the earth, who are but the duſt thereof, and aſhes, tremble
and ſhake, and feare to offend ſo dreadfull a Majeſty, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
a God, and <hi>if his wrath be kindled but a little,</hi> (as is ſaid
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2. 12. How reſtleſs ſhould they be, till by humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

                  <p>20. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. It is ſaid, <hi>That the Lord rode upon a Cherub
and did flie, and was ſeen upon the wings of the wind.</hi> All which
Allegoricall ſpeeches are uſed, to expreſs the Lords celerity which
he uſes for deliverance of his own people, when they are in ſtraits
or in danger. As we ſee when his people were purſued, by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>

<hi>David</hi> hereby ſhewes, that (as has been ſaid) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

their eyes are to him, who is above, and ſeeing their troubles are

                  <p>23. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. He ſhewes that <hi>as his Enemies are many, ſo they
are ſtrong,</hi> and too ſtrong for him. Whereby we obſerve, that
worldly power, or ſtrength is not on the Godlies, or Church of
Gods ſide, but rather on their enemies, wherein therefore
they glory, as in multitude, riches, power, and worldly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
as we ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. But therein is the comfort of the Godly,
that as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gehezj</hi> concerning the hoſt of Angells, <hi>there
are more for them, than againſt them,</hi> and he who is for them is
ſtronger, than they who are againſt them, they being but as the

24. <hi>David</hi> alſo ſets down the ground of their enmity againſt
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be their hatred of him: not that he had done any
wrong to them, to procure their enmity, but rather he had done
good offices to them, as he did to <hi>Saul,</hi> and loved them though
they hated him, as he did <hi>Abſolom:</hi> but their hatred of him
without a cauſe, was only from that root, of that proclaimed
enmity <hi>in paradiſe, that the ſeed of the ſerpent, ſhould hate the ſeed
of the woman,</hi> the wicked, and the world ever hating the Godly
for Godlineſs ſake, as they hated our Saviour, and as he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells,
that the world would alſo hate his diſciples. Therefore let
none now adaies think it uncouth, that they are either hated for
piety, for which they are beloved of God, and the Godly, or as
<hi>Micholl</hi> derided <hi>David,</hi> and deſpiſed him, that they are likewiſe
mocked and contemned.</p>

<hi>Achitophell, Chap.</hi> 17. 1, 2. Such are the enemies of Chriſt Church
many for multitude, ſtrong for power, and crafty for Counſell,
as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let us work wiſely,</hi> and ſuch are the ſpirituall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies,
with whom every Chriſtian has to encounter with; but
this is our comfort, in place of many enemies, we have one (as
the people ſaid of <hi>David</hi>) more worth than ten thouſand of
them, and for ſtrength is the almighty God, and Creator, by
whoſe word he made all things, and upholds them by his power;
and in place of their craftineſs, he who is wiſdome it ſelfe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
them from heaven, and as he did <hi>Achitophells,</hi> can turne

                  <p>26. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>David</hi> aſcribes here his liberty or enlargement,
his life and preſervation thereof, and all other his benefits, which
he had received from God, only to his free love and favour: as
the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. And not to any merit of his,
though he was a man according to Gods heart. Which ſhould
teach all men the like humble acknowledgment, <hi>for what have we</hi>
(as the Apoſtle tells us) <hi>but what we have received, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:119120:162"/>
why ſhould we glory, as if we had not received the ſame? and
when we have done all that we ſhould do,</hi> (if it were poſſible) our

our ſelves to be <hi>but unprofitable ſervants,</hi> as we ſee alſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

And <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job. 35. 7.</p>
                  <p>27. We may ſee here in like manner matter both of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and inſtruction. Admiration of the Lords free love, that he
ſhould paſs by the fallen Angells, who were created glorious
ſpirits, and that he ſhould delight in the ſonnes of men, ſinfull
duſt and aſhes, ſo that we may juſtly cry out with <hi>David, what
is man that thou ſhould ſo regard him, or the ſonne of man, that
thou ſhould be mindfull of him?</hi> no cauſe of any ſuch delight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on mans part, but the contrary, as we ſee at large <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.
Next we may ſee matter of inſtruction, that if God delight in
man, therefore man ſhould in like manner delight in God, his
ſervice, and ordinances, and not (as many do) in the ſervice, or
rather ſlavery of ſinne, Satan, and (like the prodigall that fed
ſwine,) in their own beaſtly luſts and fulfilling thereof.</p>

the</hi> 26. He declares the Lords goodneſs towards him in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
remuneration. 1. <hi>According to his righteouſneſs.</hi> 2. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cleanneſs of his hands,</hi> both which he repeates, <hi>verſ.</hi>
25. By which <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> is underſtood either the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his cauſe againſt his enemies, whoſe cauſe on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was unrighteous, or if perſonall, and not only cauſall, the
righteouſneſs of integrity or ſincerity is to be underſtood, as he
ſaies <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>I was alſo upright before him. And by the cleanneſs
of his hands</hi> is meant, the innocency of his Actions, and that as
he had a juſt and righteous cauſe on his ſide, ſo he proſecuted
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119120:163"/>
not the ſame by unlawfull meanes, as his enemies did. Likewiſe
it is to be remarked, that he ſaies not, <hi>that the Lord rewarded
him for his righteouſneſs,</hi> as meriting any waies thereby, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his righteouſneſs, according to that excellent diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi> on the ſeaventh penitentiall <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and
words (<hi>fac auditam.</hi>) who ſaies thus. If the felicity of the
ſaints be mercy, and not acquired by merits. <hi>Where is that
which is written, who ſhall render to every one according to his
workes? If it be rendred then according to works,</hi> how ſhall it be
eſteemed mercy? but it is one thing (ſaies he) <hi>according to
their workes,</hi> and another thing for the workes themſelves, for
in that it is ſaid, <hi>according to his workes,</hi> the quality of the work
is underſtood, that whoſe workes are ſeen to be good, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhall be alſo glorious, as whoſe workes are evill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhall be contrary. But as for eternall life which we have
from God, and with God, no labour can be equalled, (ſaies he)
no work can be compared. They are therefore (as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaies
<hi>via regni, non cauſa regnandi</hi>) not the cauſes of Gods favour or
delight in us, but the effects, not proceeding but ſucceeding the
ſame, and not the provocations, but the declarations thereof.
Therefore he ſubjoynes (<hi>for I have keept the waies of the Lord</hi>)
declaring, 1. Poſitively what he did. And 2. Negatively, what
he did not, in theſe words (and have not wickedly departed from
my God.) <hi>By the waies of the Lord,</hi> underſtanding his word and
precepts, which are called his waies, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 3. Becauſe he is
the Author thereof, by the inſpiration of his ſpirit, as alſo becauſe
there is nothing commanded therein but holineſs, which is the
Lords way, he being holy in all his waies, and laſt, becauſe the
ſame leads to him, as the ſtarre did the wiſe men to Chriſt. Next
his keeping thereof is 1. In mind and meditation, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119.
11. And 2. In practice, meditation, and converſation: againe,
his not departing from God, is not in relation to place, which
none can do, in reſpect that God is <hi>omnipreſent.</hi> But in relation to
his commandments, as he expones himſelfe, <hi>in the next verſe,</hi> and
this he did not wickedly: that is, through preſumption, and in a
conſtant courſe of ſinning, though through frailty, and force of
temptation one may fall, as <hi>David</hi> did indeed, and <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe:
but on the contrary, he ſets Gods Word or precepts alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:119120:163"/>
him to be the directory of this life, which he calleth his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 30. 1. Becauſe they ſerve to diſcerne good from
evill. And 2. becauſe Gods Word is not a naked ſentence, but as
it points out evill, ſo it pronounces plagues againſt it, which ſhall
be executed according to the ſentence thereof. Likewiſe the ſame
is called here Gods <hi>ſtatutes,</hi> as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 8. Becauſe of the obligatory
power thereof to the Lords obedience; as ſubjects are bound to
obey the lawes and ſtatutes of their King. And this <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
he did in ſincerity, and uprightneſs, which the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<hi>Pſ.</hi> 5. 6. And without any hypocriſie which the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
Whereby he by the grace of God, did keep himſelfe from
ſinning againſt God, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 11. Which he calleth his iniquity,
becauſe what grace we have is Gods, but what iniquity we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
is our own, and from corrupt nature.</p>
               <p>Next, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. He ſubjoynes an <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> converting his
ſpeech to God. And 1. extolling his goodneſs, and equity towards
the Godly, as alſo his equity and ſutable dealing with the wicked,
and as for the Godly, he gives them three <hi>Epithets,</hi> whereby he
deſcribes them. 1. <hi>Mercifull.</hi> 2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright.</hi> And 3. <hi>Pure.</hi> The
firſt being relative to offenders and the poore, and contrary to
cruelty and uncharitableneſs. The ſecond, being contrary to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
towards God, and diſſimulation towards man, whereby
a Godly man is like a <hi>Nathaniell.</hi> And the third being contrary to
uncleanneſs either of heart, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. Or life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As for the wicked the <hi>Epithet</hi> which he gives them. Is 1.
Froward, (as <hi>Naball</hi> was ſaid to be, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 17.) who is, (as
he would ſay) of an obſtinate, rebellious and perverſe diſpoſition,
who neither will heare, nor obey good Counſell: and with ſuch
(he ſaies) the Lord will ſhew himſelfe unſavory, and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to them, becauſe of his ſharp judgments, which he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
upon them. 2. The other <hi>Epithet</hi> that he gives to them, is
pride, or haughtineſs, both againſt God, in refuſing to obey Gods
commandments, or taking his yoke upon them, as we ſee <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2. 3.
And in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 5. 2. As alſo againſt man, and in ſpeciall
the Godly, whom they afflict uſually. Whom notwithſtanding
the Lord will ſave: but as for thoſe wicked proud ones, the eyes
of the Lord is upon them in wrath (as his eyes are on the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in mercy) that ſo he may bring them down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:119120:164"/>
After which <hi>from the</hi> 29. <hi>verſe to the</hi> 50. he continueth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
of the Lords favour particularly to himſelfe, taken eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from the victories granted by God to <hi>David</hi> over all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
forraine, and domeſtick: in the firſt whereof he laies down a
generall, <hi>that God is his lamp who will lighten his darkneſs;</hi> by a
<hi>Metaphor,</hi> darkneſs being taken for mens miſeries, and calamities,
and light for mens felicity and proſperity, ſo that hereby he
declares how the Lord turned his calamity to comfort, and his
adverſity into proſperity.</p>
               <p>In the next <hi>three verſes</hi> he has an <hi>Epiphonema</hi> from the works
of God, from his eſſence or nature, from his word, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of all them who truſt in him. 1. From his workes, in
making him runne through the thickeſt troups of his enemies,
while they are in the field, and when they have their recourſe to
their ſtrong Cities, in making him ſcale them nimbly, and take
them in victoriouſly. 2. From his eſſence, that he is perfect in his
way. 3. From his Word, that it is pure, like gold tryed in the
fire, and without mixture of any errour therein, but true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.
4. From his preſervation of all them, who truſt in him.
Which <hi>Epiphonema David</hi> cloſeth with a compariſon of others
that are called <hi>Gods,</hi> by way of interrogation or challenge, ſaying,
<hi>who is God but the Lord, and who is a rock, ſave our God?</hi> as if he
would ſay, none are ſuch, the like interrogation having ever the
force of a negation. Thereafter <hi>from the</hi> 33. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 50. He
applies the generall to himſelfe in particular, by many arguments
by way of gradation. Whereby he proves that God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon him, all thoſe things that are neceſſary or requiſite,
for obtaining deliverance from his enemies, and victory in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
Which are 1. That the Lord is his ſtrength, and power,
whereby he underſtands that he gave him courage of heart, as
we ſee in his going againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> and which is the firſt vertue
of a commander in warres. 2. That he maketh his way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or plaine, which ſignifies the removing of all impediments,
and facilitating his enterpriſes. <hi>In making his feet ſwift to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
and fall upon his enemies,</hi> and having over taken them, to get
the victory over them, and to be ſet above them. 4. <hi>That he
he taught his hands to fight,</hi> which ſignifies his skill in military
affaires, and how to uſe his weapon. 5. That with skill he had
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:119120:164"/>
alſo given him ſtrength of body requiſite for warre, <hi>So that a
bow of ſteel was broken by his Armes.</hi> 6. <hi>That he had given him the
ſhield of his ſalvation,</hi> whereby he ſignifies his ſurety from the
weapons, or darts of his Enemies, and ſubjoynes that the Lords
greatneſſe of power was the cauſe of his greatneſſe by Victories.
7. <hi>That he inlarged his ſteps under him,</hi> ſo that his feet did not
ſlip, whereby he ſignifies his proſperous ſucceſſe in all his march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
8. He ſets down the conſequences of all the former in the
execution, and practiſe thereof, in perſuing his Enemies; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
them, conſuming them, and deadly wounding them,
that they could not riſe, but were fallen under his feet, ſo that
the Lord had given the necks of his Enemies, who would not
lie under the yoke of his obedience unto him, for that end, that
he might deſtroy them, and when they were in this extremity,
when they looked for help from man, they were diſappointed,
for there was none to ſave then, and when they ſought help
from God, he did not anſwer them, and thus being helpleſſe, he
compares them to moſt vile things, and ſhewes that he did beat
them as ſmall as duſt, and did ſtamp them, as myre the in ſtreet,
and diſperſe them, as they ſpread dung on the ground. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
he amplifies yet more the Lords goodneſſe to him. <hi>From the</hi>
44. <hi>verſe to the</hi> 50. In that this Lord had not onely delivered
him from the ſtrivings of the people, who were his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
but alſo that he had ſubdued under him the Nations,
that were round about him, as the <hi>Syrians, Ammonites,</hi> and
<hi>Philiſtims, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Verſ.</hi> 47. he burſts forth in a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticke
doxologie,</hi> for the Lords deliverance of him from all
his Enemies, and his advancement over them, and laſt by way
of concluſion, <hi>From the</hi> 50. <hi>verſ. to the end.</hi> He reſolves to
be thankfull to the Lord, while he lives, which he doth upon
two reaſons, the one is, <hi>ab antecedentibus,</hi> implied in the
particle, <hi>therefore,</hi> that is for all the before rehearſed bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits:
the other is <hi>à conſequentibus,</hi> becauſe he will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to his anointed, and to his ſeed for ever. Wherein <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

for whom he has appointed the inheritance, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did for
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the birthright with the bleſſing, which <hi>Iſaac</hi> gave to
<hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. We ſee that although the Godly merit not by any condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their works, or Perſons, yet that piety and Godlineſſe
wants not its own reward, <hi>ratione pacti,</hi> becauſe God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
the ſame thereunto, and therefore it is juſt with him to
perform, and onely of meer mercy, as we ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 12. and
<hi>Hoſe</hi> 10. 12. Where we are willed to ſow in righteouſneſſe, and
reap in mercy. Therefore ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16, 17. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> who had refreſhed him oftimes in his bonds. <hi>The
Lord grant that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day,</hi> towit,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:119120:165"/>
                     <hi>of death, and his account,</hi> the wages of ſinne being death, but life
everlaſting being the free gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. And therefore
called an inheritance, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. Which comes to Children not
by their own purchaſe, but which is given them by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which recompenſing therefore of ſinceer holineſſe, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall
piety ſhould be a great encouragement, to the Godly to
perſevere therein, and abound in good works, in which as the
way which leads to that heavenly Kingdome, we are exhorted
to walk, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. And to abound therein, and bring forth
much fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Davids</hi> keeping the wayes of God, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
wickedly from him, or his ſtatutes. We ſee, not onely the
Godlies care of ordering their converſation aright; but likewiſe
wherein true Godlineſſe conſiſts, which is, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>To ceaſe to
do evill,</hi> or not to depart from Gods commandments, and to <hi>learn
to do well,</hi> or to keep his wayes, as we ſee alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 14. and
<hi>Amos</hi> 5. 15. Where we are commanded <hi>to hate evill, and love
good,</hi> that is, to eſchew ſinne, not onely in action, and to do good,
but alſo to hate the one, and love the other in our affection.</p>
                  <p>5. We ſee here likewiſe the difference between the ſinning of
the Godly, and of the wicked, the Godly ſinne daily, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are taught to crave daily forgiveneſs: but this their ſinning is,
but through frailty, and by ſins which we call <hi>Quotidianae incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis,</hi>
but they are not, as the ſinnes of the wicked are, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
by departing wickedly from God with delight, making
a trade of ſinne, and ſinning againſt both knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>That the Lords judgements were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
before him.</hi> Whereby we obſerve that the right way how to
eſchew ſinne, is, to hold Gods Word, or his ſtatutes, called here
his judgments ever before our eyes, a the directory of our life,
and converſation, as <hi>David</hi> did here, and which he hid alſo in
his heart, that he might not ſinne againſt God, as he ſhewes, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
119. 11. As alſo if by Gods judgments, his puniſhments of ſinne
were meant, the ſame likewiſe ſerves as a powerfull preſervative
from ſinne to the Godly, as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 120.</p>
                  <p>7. Whereas he ſayes, <hi>That all his judgments were before him,</hi>
which is all one with that, which he ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. <hi>That he
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:119120:166"/>
had a reſpect to all Gods commandments,</hi> we obſerve that it is not
the practiſe of the Godly to nouriſh any one boſome ſinne, as
<hi>Herod</hi> did, in hearkning to the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> in many things, except in
the matter of <hi>Herodias,</hi> but as it is the commendation of <hi>Zachary,</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth, Luke</hi> 1. 6. <hi>That they walked in all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God blameleſſe,</hi> ſo to abandon and mortify all ſinnes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
and to obſerve all Gods ordinances, and ſo to ſtrive to
be perfect by that perfection which we call of parts, though we
cannot in this life attain to that perfection, which we call of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. Where <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>That he was upright before
God.</hi> We ſee not onely wherein the Lord delights, towit, ſincerity
in his ſervice, and worſhip, which <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 6. <hi>He calleth truth in
the inward parts.</hi> But likewiſe that it is the care of the Godly to
be ſinceer without hypocriſy, and to approve themſelves to God,
as doing all before him, and in his ſight, whom they know to be
omniſcient, and the ſearcher of the heart, and reines.</p>
                  <p>9. Likewiſe where he ſayes, <hi>And have keept my ſelf from mine
iniquity</hi> He ſhewes the difference between grace, and ſinne in the
Godly, the one is from God onely, <hi>for what have we which we
have not received?</hi> And therefore ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Yet not I, but
the grace of God, which was in me:</hi> but the other which is ſinne, is
onely from ourſelves, and our corrupt nature, and therefore juſtly
ſhould we own it as ours, and be humbled therefore.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. 27. From the properties whereby he deſcribes
the Godly, that they are mercyfull, and not cruell, or uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
as alſo upright, and not hypocriticall, nor diſſemblers, and that
they are pure both in heart and life, and not unclean like Dogs
and Swine. Let us learn to be like them, as herein they are like to
God, and do as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Follow me as I
follow Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. Where he ſayes, <hi>With the forward, God will ſhew himſelf
unto them unſavory, or diſpleaſant.</hi> We ſee not onely the naturall
diſpoſition of the unregenerate, that they are froward, rebellious
and perverſe; but alſo that themſelves are the cauſe why the Lord
delights not in them, as he doth in the Godly, and that the Lord
is as an unſavory thing, and unpleaſant to them, eſpecially when he
puniſhes them juſtly for their ſinnes, who otherwiſe to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:119120:166"/>
is ſo ſweet and deſireable, that they exhort others to taſte how
ſweet he is, and excellent, and to ſeek after him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9. So
that he is like that cloud, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>That was darkneſſe to the
Egyptions, but gave light to</hi> Iſraell.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. Gods people is called an afflicted people, where
we obſerve what their condition is, and ever has been in this
World, as our Saviour foretold his Diſciples, and therefore are
compared to <hi>a Lilly amongſt Thornes, Cant.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Sheep amongſt
Wolves,</hi> and to <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark toſſed upon the Waters, with which
condition they ſhould reſt content, ſeeing the ſame was of their
head and Saviour, and that the Lord does this for their good, as
<hi>David</hi> profeſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. And as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> many wayes
ſhewes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>13. As for the comfort of his afflicted people it is ſaid, <hi>That
God will ſave them,</hi> ſo to the terrour of the proud and ungodly
who afflicts them it is ſaid, that the Lords eyes in wrath is upon
them, that he may bring them down: whereby we ſee that
as the Godly ſhould referre their cauſe, and wrongs to the
Lord, ſo that aſſuredly he ſees there injuries, and hears their
cryes, as he did <hi>Iſraells</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> And his peoples in the book of
the <hi>Judges,</hi> and will certainly revenge their cauſe, (<hi>for vengance
is his and he will repay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>) and he will bring down the haughtieſt of
them all, who oppreſſe them, as he did <hi>Pharaoh, Siſera, Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,
Haman, Herod,</hi> and others, and has brought down ſince
mighty Princes, noble houſes, and the flouriſhing eſtates of many
for their pride and oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>As the Lord was</hi> Davids <hi>Lamp, and enlightned
his darneſſe;</hi> ſo is he the author of our proſperity, to whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with a thankfull acknowledgment, we ſhould referre the
ſame, and it is he alſo who lightneth the darkneſſe of our minds,
by his Word and eye-ſalve of his Spirit whereof he ſpeaketh,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18. And maketh his Church alſo like <hi>Goſhen</hi> wherein
was light only, when all others are like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> who were
plagued with darkneſſe, or like the <hi>Sodomites</hi> who were ſtricken
with blindneſſe before their deſtruction. Whereupon we collect
what a great bleſſing to any Nation, or people the light of Gods
Word is, and a faithfull Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30, 34. <hi>and</hi> 35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſee by the many endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:119120:167"/>
which <hi>David</hi> rehearſeth for fitting him for warre and for
Victory, that the Lord when he calleth any man for any work in
his Church, or Commonwealth he furniſhes him with abilities
fit for the work, as he did <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> for the work
of the Tabernacle, <hi>Sampſon</hi> for delivering his people from the
<hi>Philiſtims,</hi> the artificers for building the Temple, and as our
Saviour furniſhed and fitted his Apoſtles with the gift of tongues
and miracles; ſo that they who want this furniture and fitnes,
with ſuteable gifts, cannot pretend to a calling from God for
the work.</p>
                  <p>16. Hence alſo we ſee the Lawfullneſſe of ſome warres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have ſpoken before, and of the art military; which ſerves
to confute the errour of the Anabaptiſts. And in the example
of <hi>David,</hi> that it is Lawfull for the civill Magiſtrate to puniſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
and ſeditious offenders, this being the Lawfull uſe of
the ſword given by God to ſuch, for correction of them who
do evill, and to whom they ſhould be a terrour, as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
ſhewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 36. <hi>David</hi> thankfully acknowledgeth that the Lords
gentleneſſe, or kindeneſſe to him had made him great, as <hi>Job</hi>
alſo profeſſed, <hi>That God had given him all that he had,</hi> whoſe
example O that theſe who are great in honour, or wealth, in
promotion and advancement would follow, and that they
would honour God, and be comfortable inſtruments to his
Church and people, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was, and <hi>David</hi> here, and as his
Sonne <hi>Solomon, Joſiah, Hezekiah, Esther, Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi>
with others were, and not Enemies to Gods Church, to their
own deſtruction, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the wicked Kings of <hi>Iſraell</hi>
were, eſpecially <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jeſabell,</hi> and as <hi>Haman, Herod,</hi> and
others.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>V.</hi> 42. <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>That his Enemies in their ſtraight, they
cryed to the Lord for help, but he anſwered them not.</hi> Which ſhewes
that in their diſtreſſe the wicked can call upon God, but it is
like the howling onely of a Dog, like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> deſiring of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
to pray for him to be free from the plague, but not from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for the cauſe, which is ſinne to be freed from; nor yet
from faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which grace they have not, therefore their prayers
being onely from ſelf love, and Worldly fear, and being the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:119120:167"/>
prayer of unregenerate perſons habituated in ſinne, the Lord did
not hear nor anſwer them, as it is ſaid <hi>Of ſuch; that God hears
not ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 43. The wicked are by <hi>David,</hi> here compared to vile
things, as <hi>duſt, mire</hi> and <hi>dung,</hi> whereas the Godly on the contrary,
are compared to moſt precious things, as <hi>the Lords treaſure, his
inheritance, and his jewell's,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>Fruitfull Vines, Kings
and Prieſts,</hi> (Revel. 1. 6.) <hi>Sonnes to God, coheirs with Chriſt,
and the most excellent on the earth;</hi> (Pſal. 16. 2.) Whereby
we ſee, what ever be their earthly prerogatives, how vile the
wicked are in Gods ſight, and in the Godlies, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. And
that the Godly are onely in high eſteeme with God, and truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and therefore let them correſpond to theſe titles where
with they are ſtiled.</p>
                  <p>20. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 44. By the Lords ſubduing of the Nations to him,
and by making <hi>David</hi> to be head over them; we may ſee here
Chriſts Kingdome cleerly prefigured, to whom the Lord hath
not onely ſubdued all his Enemies, and given him Victory over
them, triumphing on the Croſſe, and leading captivity captive,
but alſo by the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he has made him head
and Lord over all, according to that promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>I will
give thee the heathen for an inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of
the Earth for a poſſeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 51. After <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution of a conſtant thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
to God for all his benefits, in the preceeding verſes; he
calls <hi>himſelf here his King,</hi> acknowledging the Lord hereby to
be the Author of his promotion, (<hi>for by him Kings raigne</hi>) and
he calleth all the benefits that that he had received from God,
his mercy which he had ſhewn to him, excluding thereby merit;
which two things would God that Kings, and all other men in
place, or power would ſeriouſly acknowledge, and then as they
have their power, and places from God, they would imploy the
ſame for God, and walk humbly before him.</p>

2. The adverſity and puniſhment of the Enemies of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and of the Kingdome of Chriſt, or his Church. Next,
the ſubject of the Hiſtoricall part is a catalogue of 37. of <hi>Davids</hi>
moſt valiant men, who had aſſiſted him in fighting the Lords
battles, and the valiant acts that ſome of them had performed.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Propheticall</hi> part, we have. 1. The <hi>exordium, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>
2. The <hi>Prophecy</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>narration.</hi> In the <hi>exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
or <hi>inſcription,</hi> we have. 1. The nature of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi>
towit, <hi>Teſtamentary,</hi> or the laſt Words of <hi>David,</hi> and therefore
full of dignity, weightineſſe and Majeſty, ſeeing it is proponed
in the laſt time of <hi>Davids</hi> life and raigne, in form of a Teſtament,
at which time Godly men laying aſide Worldly affaires, or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and this is <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Principall,</hi> and this is the Spirit
of God, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. And the God of <hi>Iſrael, Verſ.</hi> 3. As for <hi>David</hi>
who is the inſtrumentall, or ſecundary Author, he is deſcribed by
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:119120:168"/>
foure tittles. 1. He calls himſelfe the ſonne of <hi>Jeſs,</hi> (which <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
uſed in diſdaine) acknowledging thereby the mean conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was in at firſt, before the Lord raiſed him to a higher,
and this title he aſſumes for three reaſons. 1. Thereby to teſtify
his humility and to give an example to others. 2. For verificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the propheſies made of the geneologie of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who
was to come of that root and ſtock. And 3. that it might be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
what Prophet was the Author of this propheſie. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſtile which he aſſumes, is from his dignity whereunto he
was exalted from ſo low a degree, to amplify the Lords goodneſs
thereby, and his free love. The third title which he aſſumes, is,
<hi>the anointed of the God of Jacob,</hi> hereby ſignifying his inauguration.
1. By <hi>Samuell.</hi> 2. By the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and laſt by
common conſent of all <hi>Iſraell</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The laſt title which
he aſſumes, <hi>Is the ſweet Pſalmiſt or ſinger of Iſraell,</hi> in reſpect of
the divine <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which he not only compoſed and wrote, as
the penman of Gods ſpirit, but alſo which he ſung himſelfe, and
directed to be publickly ſung by the muſitians, who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for that uſe, in the tabernacle, and in the future Temple, which
ſongs are called <hi>ſweet,</hi> not only in reſpect of the melodious and
ſweet harmony of muſicall inſtruments and voyces, which were
uſed in the ſinging of them, but alſo and ſpecially in reſpect of the
ſweet and comfortable heavenly matter that is contained in
them, as alſo he calls himſelfe <hi>the ſweet ſinger of Iſaell,</hi> to ſhew
that all theſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> and ſpirituall ſongs, as all other parts of
Scripture, or of mans miniſtry, ought to be directed and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to the good of Gods Church, which is his true <hi>Iſraell.</hi>
All which <hi>Epithites</hi> of <hi>David</hi> here, we ſee then may be reduced
to theſe two, a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the principall Author by whom <hi>David</hi> is moved, to
utter theſe words of this propheſie, he ſaies <hi>Is the ſpirit of God,
the God of Iſraell, and the rock of Iſraell,</hi> from which the ancient
Fathers gathered againſt the Hereticks of their times, the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
doctrine of the holy Trinity, one in ſubſtance, and three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
perſons, the Father, noted by the name <hi>Elohim</hi> and God
of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> The ſonne, by the <hi>rock of Iſraell,</hi> as <hi>Paull</hi> calles Chriſt,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. And the Holy Ghoſt by the <hi>ſpirit of God. David</hi>
therefore hereby declares, that he has in this Action for his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:119120:169"/>
the motion and inſpiration of the bleſſed and Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
God the Father, by his ſonne, and the inſpiration of the Holy
Ghoſt, ſpeaking unto him himſelfe, and ſpeaking by him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, followes what he is moved to ſpeak, which is to
<hi>declare the properties of a good King, and how proſperous his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſhall be under him.</hi> But eſpecially not meaning his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
kingdome and continuance thereof, as was promiſed to
him; but the perpetuity of the kingdome of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come,
which though his kingdome ſhould decay, and his houſe come
to an end, as all temporall things have their own period, through
the unworthineſs and provocation of his poſterity, yet the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, who was to come of him, and is called his ſonne,
ſhould never decay, but be permanent and perpetuall, becauſe of
that everlaſting covenant made with him, ordered in all things
and ſure, concerning his everlaſting ſalvation, which is all his
deſire.</p>
               <p>Now this everlaſting kingdome of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
ruler over all men, and who is not only juſt himſelfe,
being without ſpot of ſinne, but alſo who juſtifieth others, and
who ruleth not only juſtly, like one that feareth God, but alſo
who makes others to feare him. This everlaſting kingdome of
his (I ſay) is compared here to two things. 1. <hi>To the light of
the morning,</hi> that ſucceedeth after the darkneſs of the night, and
drives it away, when the Sunne riſeth, and is without clouds, to
obſcure, and hinder the bright rayes and ſhining thereof. 2. <hi>To
the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth,</hi> after the ſharp and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
winter; and which ſhineth pleaſantly after the ſweet and
warme ſummers raine.</p>
               <p>But as for the enemies of Chriſt, and his Church. He 1. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares

               <p>As for the ſecond part of this Chapter which is <hi>Hiſtoricall,</hi>
containing a <hi>Catalogue</hi> only of the names, and ſome valiant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>Davids</hi> chiefe officers, and Captaines in his Army, the
ſame not needing a copious explanation, therefore we remit the
ſame to the reader. Only this is to be marked, that <hi>Joab</hi> his
name is here omitted, though he had done many valiant deeds
for <hi>David,</hi> and this is for his many vices, and treacherous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> for which <hi>David</hi> gave charge to his

are here recorded, not only for commemoration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
But likewiſe for example and imitation of their
vertues, and to ſhew how great workes, the Lord wrought by
weake meanes. Only the temerity of the three, is not to be
commended altogether, nor followed, that hazarded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo, for bringing to <hi>David,</hi> water out of the well of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi>
which was commendably therefore poured by <hi>David</hi>
upon the ground, unto the Lord, as a teſtimony of his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
for their preſervation, and that he ſhould not ſeem ſo
much to be given to the ſatisfying of his carnall deſire and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to drink that, for which theſe three had hazarded their
blood and lives.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>DAvid</hi> now being neereſt to death, like the ſwanne ſings
ſweeteſt, comforting himſelfe with heavenly meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and expreſſions of his faith in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and obtaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by him: and not grudging that he is to leave an earthly
Crowne, and kingdome, being ſure of a heavenly. The like
example we have of old <hi>Simeon,</hi> when he got the babe Chriſt
Jeſus in his armes: and of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. And which ſhould
be the practice of all Chriſtians, who draw neer to death, to
exerciſe themſelves with holy and heavenly meditations, having
laid aſide the world, and the thoughts thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Davids</hi> firſt ſtile which he aſſumes is, (<hi>the ſonne
of Jeſs</hi>) to teſtify his humility, and to acknowledge from how
low a condition, the Lord had raiſed him up, as he called <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
out of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r,</hi> to be the Father of the Faithfull, and of many
Nations, <hi>Moſes</hi> from keeping <hi>Jethro's</hi> ſheep, to be a Prince over
his people <hi>Iſraell.</hi> The <hi>Judges</hi> from a low pedigree, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers
of his people from their oppreſſours. And <hi>David</hi> here who
was but the ſonne of <hi>Jeſs,</hi> a private and obſcure man, to be King
of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> From whence then let all men learne a leſſon of like
humility, ſeeing the ſame in ſo great a King, and eſpecially in
him who is King of Kings Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaies, learn of me for
I am humble and meek.</p>
                  <p>3. He calls himſelfe next, <hi>The anointed of the God of Jacob,</hi>
acknowledging thereby, that all his promotion, and advancement
to be King, was from God, whom he calleth the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and from whence our Saviour reaſoneth for the reſurrection,
ſhewing thereby <hi>That God is not the God of the dead, but of the
living,</hi> who as they were living in their ſoules after death, ſo
ſhould they live in their bodies at the reſurrection. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is called the God, not of the ſoule of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
in the complex, as he doth conſiſt, both of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p>4. Alſo from the title of <hi>the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſraell.</hi> We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:119120:170"/>
that our skill in arts or ſciences, and all the gifts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
that we have from God, as the Talent concredited to
us, ſhould be imployed for the good of the <hi>Iſraell</hi> of God, which
is his Church, unto the edification thereof.</p>
                  <p>5. Verſ. 2. <hi>Where</hi> David <hi>ſaies, that</hi> the ſpirit of the Lord ſpake
by him. <hi>We ſee, as the Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>ſpeaketh,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21. That
the Scripture, and propheſie in old time, came not by the will of man,
but the holy men of God, ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,
<hi>and therefore ought ſo to be reverenced and obeyed, being not
of humane, but divine authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Here alſo we ſee that what <hi>David</hi> ſpake, he did not the
ſame without a warrant from God, who ſpake by him, and (as
<hi>verſ.</hi> 3.) who ſpake to him. Teaching us thereby in like manner,
that we ſhould have a warrant from the Word of God, now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in Scripture both for doctrine, or what we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as alſo as a rule of our actions and converſation, how we
ſhould live, and order the ſame a right.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>David</hi> likewiſe as a Prophet ſaies, that Gods Word was
in his tongue, and ſo ſhould the ſame only be in the tongue, of all
faithfull and true preachers, and not mens fancies, or the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>David</hi> who was a ruler over men himſelf; ſhewes
what are the two parts of ſuch a one, to wit, the execution of
juſtice impartially, and to rule in the feare of the Lord: having
that rooted in their heart, and having the ſame alſo ever before
their eyes, in all their Actions, or decrees in judgment. But how
farre many Magiſtrates, and Judges vary from this rule, is but
too common and to be deplored.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. By earthly things for our capacity. He teaches
how comfortable, and profitable, the government of ſuch a one,
is to Gods people, and eſpecially the government of Chriſt Jeſus
the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is to his Church, who is that ſunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
who diſperſeth the darkneſs of ſinne, and ignorance, and
as a bright morning without obſcuring clouds, ſends forth his
beames, and rayes of ſaving knowledge in the minds of his elect,
and is alſo as the pleaſant, and tender graſs, that ſpringeth out of
the earth, by cleare ſhining after, raine to be green paſture (as
<hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23. 2.) to his own ſheep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:119120:171"/>
10. Alſo as none can hinder the riſing of the ſunne, or the
brightneſs of a cleare morning, nor the ſpringing of the graſs
out of the earth, in the due ſeaſon thereof: ſo none ſhall be able
to hinder the kingdome of Chriſt, and progreſs of the Goſpell,
but ſhall find that as is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>That he who ſits in heaven
ſhall laugh them to ſcorne,</hi> and as our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Paul, That it
is hard for them to kick againſt the pricks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. Where <hi>David</hi> ſaies, after the ſetting down the
proſperity of Chriſts kingdome, and continuance thereof for ever,
(although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he has made with
me an everlaſting Covenant, of ſalvation, which is all my deſire.)
This teaches us to be content, with whatſoever diſpenſation it
pleaſes the Lord, to make to be our lot in temporall things;
though we ſhould be as poore as <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arus,</hi> ſo be that we be
made pertakers of that ſalvation wrought by Chriſt, and be
within the Covenant of grace. Which alſo with <hi>David</hi>
ſhould be all our deſire, as he decleres likewiſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
4. 6.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. The wicked are compared to <hi>thornes,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their preſent diſpoſition, and of their future eſtate, and
condition, prickly and hurtfull in the one, and ſad and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the other, as being appointed to be burnt for ever. Which
as it ſhould be a terrour to the greateſt, to be of a wicked diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and chiefly to be proſecuters of Chriſts Church, which
is compared therefore to a <hi>Lillie amongſt thornes,</hi> Cant. 2. 2.
So it ſhould be a comfort to the Godly, who are proſecuted
by them, that though their wrongs be not redreſſed here on
earth, yet they ſhall be hereafter, when theſe (who like <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
were thornes in their ſides</hi>) ſhall be burnt in hell fire for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>13. The wicked alſo are called <hi>thornes thruſt away,</hi> that is,
rejected. Whereby we obſerve, that wickedneſs continued in
without repentance, is an evident token of reprobation: as on
the contrary, piety, and true Godlineſs, is a ſure ſigne of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and predeſtination, unto life eternall, and therefore we are
exhorted, (in relation to our ſelves) to make ſure our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by wel-doing, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. Are called Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:119120:171"/>
hath preordained, that we ſhould walke in them, elected to them,
but not elected for them, and they being, <hi>via regni,</hi> but not <hi>cauſa
regnandi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. And thereafter in this Catalogue of ſo many
valiant men under <hi>David.</hi> We ſee that it is a happy kingdome,
wherein there is a good King as <hi>David</hi> was, wiſe Counſellours,
and valiant ſouldiers. As alſo how by the contrary (as in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi>)
a Nation or Kingdome becomes rent, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>15. We ſee likewiſe, how the Lord workes great and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
workes, ſometimes by very weake and unlikely meanes.
As we ſee chiefly in the book of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and by a few fiſher
men, the converſion of the Nations, that all the glory may be
given to God, and his own finger may be ſeen in the work, as
alſo by this regiſter of their names in holy Scripture, <hi>That the
memory or remembrance of the Godly ſhall be bleſſed, but the memory
of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. We ſee how tender <hi>Davids</hi> conſcience was,
who would not drink of the water of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
which his three valiant men brought unto him, becauſe he
counted it their blood, in reſpect they had hazarded their lives
for the ſame. O then how farre contrary is the <hi>conſciences of
thoſe men, ſeared with a hot iron, and paſt feeling,</hi> whoſe daily
meat, and drink, is the blood of men, eſpecially the poore, whom
they oppreſs, and whoſe faces they grinde, and chop their fleſh
as meate for the pot, as the Prophet ſpeaks, and what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
an account have thoſe <hi>Canniball's,</hi> to make at the laſt day.
And eſpecially how dreadfull ſhall be their doome, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who live by ſacriledge, or ſuch idoll ſhepheards, who
live on the blood of ſoules, as are deſcribed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56. and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi>

               <head>II. SAM. Chap. 24. from the 1. Verſe to the 10.</head>
               <p>THe generall argument of this Chapter, is the hiſtory of the
three daies peſtilence, wherewith God in his juſtice pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
his people, for their own ſinnes, but ſpecially for <hi>Davids</hi>
their King, in numbering the people, which may be divided in
theſe four particulars. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> cauſing the numbring of the
people, <hi>to the</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Davids</hi> repentance for the ſame, <hi>in
the</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. The puniſhment thereof by peſtilence, <hi>to the</hi>
16. <hi>verſ.</hi> And 4. The removing of the plague, <hi>from the</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.
to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt, we ſhall conſider. 1. By whom <hi>David</hi> was
moved to number the people. 2. What he did being moved.
3. <hi>Joabs</hi> diſſwaſion to <hi>David.</hi> And 4. <hi>Joabs</hi> obedience at laſt
to <hi>Davids</hi> command which prevailed.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. It is ſaid, <hi>That the Lord moved David, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
angry againſt Iſraell for their ſinnes,</hi> which doubtleſs had been
great, although not nominated, and for which he is ſaid to be
angry, <hi>per Anthropopatheiam,</hi> whereby humane paſſions are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to God, which truly, and properly fall not in his divine
offence, but for our capacity, the Scripture ſpeaks to us, in our
own language, and attributes to God mans affections. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
anger is the motion of revenge, therefore by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
when God revenges, and executes juſtice, and does thoſe
things, which men uſe to do in anger, he is ſaid in Scripture to
be angry, and in wrath.</p>
               <p>Next, it is ſaid that the Lord moved <hi>David,</hi> and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
21. 1. It is ſaid that Satan moved <hi>David,</hi> and we ſhall alſo find
that there were inward movers in <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, that moved
him. Firſt then, we ſee that both God, and Satan, had a hand in
the work: God by permiſſion, and in a wiſe ordination of it to
good, and Satan by ſuggeſtion, and in a malitious intention
for evill; God as a judge, in a juſt puniſhment for ſinne,
and Satan as an enemy, and an acto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r of ſinne. God then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:119120:172"/>
works evill, nor by an evill way, but he worketh in evill,
<hi>derelinquendo &amp; dirigendo,</hi> withdrawing his grace, and directing
the evill to his glory in the end. As we have ſhewne before in the
Lords commanding of <hi>Shimei</hi> to curſe <hi>David.</hi> Neither is it any
excuſe therefore to Satan, or <hi>David,</hi> that God moved, nor is any
blot in God that Satan moved, acting from divers principles, and
for divers ends. That alſo which inwardly moved <hi>David,</hi> was.
1. Ambition, and pride to know thereby his grandure, in the
numeroſity of his ſubjects. 2. Confidence in the arme of fleſh,
and multitude of his people. 3. Curioſity, ſeeking to know that
which at that time was unneceſſary, as <hi>Joab</hi> did ſhew him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the thing that <hi>David</hi> did, being thus moved, is, the
numbering of the people, which for a Prince to do, or command
to be done, in it ſelf, or for a good end, and upon an neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
is not unlawfull: the act then offends not, (as we ſee that
<hi>Iſraell</hi> went oftimes under numbring, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 17. By <hi>Moſes</hi>
himſelf) but it is the mis-action, and the doing thereof not out of
a Princely providence, but curioſity, vain confidence and pride,
which makes the action vicious and ſinfull.</p>
               <p>The third thing is <hi>Joabs</hi> diſſwaſion, ſeeing the King curious,
and the fact dangerous, and this he doth, 1. By a plauſible <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
praying to God to augment the number of his people a
hundred fold, &amp; that <hi>David</hi> may live to ſee it. 2. He interrogates
the cauſe wherein he obſcurely, reprehends the Kings oftentation
and curioſity. 3. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 3. He obviates the Kings inſtance,
if he ſhould ſay, that it were to try the peoples univerſall, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ſubjection thereby. To which <hi>Joab</hi> anſwers, ſaying, <hi>are
they not all my Lords ſervants.</hi> And 4. he ſhewes the danger of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this in the ſame place of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Why will he be
a cauſe of treſpaſſe to Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth thing is <hi>Joabs</hi> obedience at laſt, the Kings word
prevailing, the reaſons whereof are theſe. 1. <hi>Joab</hi> was a wicked
man, and though he had declared that it would be a cauſe of
treſpaſſe to <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and therefore unlawfull, yet he diſpenſes with
ſinne, and chooſeth rather to obey man than God, as he had done
before in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> 2. He was an ambition man,
and a crafty cortior, who feared to looſe his place, and that if he
did it not, another would be imployed to do it. Therefore he
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:119120:173"/>
takes his journey. 1. Towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and paſſing <hi>Jordan,</hi>
enters into the City of <hi>Aroer,</hi> ſituated on the River <hi>Arnon,</hi> which
enters in the mouth of <hi>Jordan,</hi> marching the Kingdome of <hi>Sihon,</hi>
ſometime a part of the Land of the <hi>Amorreans,</hi> at the ſprings of
which River <hi>Arnon,</hi> ſtands this City <hi>Jaſir,</hi> their he paſt <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
and entred in <hi>Galaad,</hi> at a place called <hi>Tachtim Hodſhi,</hi>
which is by interpretation a new Land, whereof no mention is in
<hi>Joſua.</hi> But was after conquered by <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. From
that he came to the City <hi>Dan,</hi> which is the <hi>Northmarch</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,</hi>
ſituated upon <hi>Jordan,</hi> and from the <hi>North</hi> he entred in the
<hi>Weſtmarches,</hi> towards the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and came to <hi>Tyre</hi> and
<hi>Sidon,</hi> for albeit the ancient inhabitants poſſeſſed the Cities, yet
they were in the partage of <hi>Aſher</hi> and <hi>Nepthalim:</hi> and from the
<hi>Weſtmarch,</hi> he entered into the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> even to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi>
which divided <hi>Judea,</hi> from <hi>Idumea</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and ſo compaſſed
all the marches of the holy Land, beginning at the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> towards
the <hi>North,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and from thence to the
<hi>South,</hi> and ſo after nine moneths, and twenty dayes came back
to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and gave up the whole number of the people to
<hi>David,</hi> extending to <hi>thirteen hundred thouſand men.</hi> Which
number diſagrees with that which is et down, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 5.
Where the number of the men of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> extends to <hi>eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand,</hi> and of <hi>Judah</hi> onely <hi>four hundred threeſcore and
ten thouſand,</hi> ſo there is addition to the one, and diminution of
the other. But this ſeeming contradiction, or diſgreement is thus
reconciled, that theſe 300000. which are omitted in <hi>Samuel,</hi>
and added in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> are the twelve claſſes of <hi>Davids</hi> guard
that were appointed in their ſeverall <hi>vices</hi> to attend him moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
24000. monethly, as we ſee, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27. Which joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the twelve moneths, makes, 288000. to which if 12000.
of the Princes and Captaines of hundreds and thouſands be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereof is mention, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. They make up the compleat
number of 1100000. of the men of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> which are not ſet down
in <hi>Samuell,</hi> becauſe they were well enough known to the King, and
as for the number of them, of <hi>Judah</hi> being 30000. leſſe in the
<hi>Chronicles.</hi> then in <hi>Samuell</hi> it is anſwered by Interpreters, that in
the <hi>Chronicles</hi> their number is ſet down, as they were after the
plague of Peſtilence, and whereof 30000. by that plague were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 1. BEcauſe after many Victories, and abundance after
famine, <hi>Iſraell</hi> waxed in ſolent, and luxuriouſly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
therefore as God had pulled down their pride before by
the ſword, and famine, ſo now doth he by the Peſtilence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we ſee, not onely what varity of rods, God hath to chaſtiſe
with: but alſo that renewing of ſinning procures the renewing of
puniſhment and correction, as we ſee eſpecially here, and in the
book of <hi>Judges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Iſraell</hi> ſinned, and becauſe <hi>Iſraell</hi> hath done ſo, therefore
<hi>David</hi> ſhall ſinne, that <hi>Iſraell</hi> may be puniſhed. The rulers ſinne
then is a puniſhment to a wicked people; and if God were not
angry with a people, he would not give up their rulers to ſuch
ſinnes as whereby he is provoked to vengance, as people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould beware to provoke God to anger by their ſinnes, and
abuſe of Gods benefits, ſo it is not without cauſe that they are
charged to pray, and make ſupplications for all, but eſpecially
for thoſe, who are their rulers, and in eminent authority over
them, the private well being ever compriſed in the publicke.</p>
                  <p>3. As is ſhewn to us, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. Satan moved <hi>David</hi> to
this ſinne of numbring the people. Which ſo offended God and
brought a plague upon them, whereby we obſerve who is the
chief tempter to all ſinne, and has been ſo in all ages from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and therefore is called the tempter: as alſo to what end,
he tempts to ſinne, which is to kindle Gods wrath againſt man,
and to bring Gods plagues upon man here, and eternall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon him hereafter, and therefore he is called a murderer
alſo from the beginning, and is an Enemy both to God and man;
fy then on fooliſh ſinners, that are ſlaves to ſuch a one.</p>
                  <p>4. He moves <hi>David</hi> to ſinne, an eminent perſon, yea, a man
according to Gods own heart. Which ſhewes, that Satan dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
on the beſt and ſtrongeſt, as he did on our firſt parents in
their eſtate of Innocency, and on Chriſt himſelf, and therefore
the beſt of men ought to watch, and pray that they be not led
by him into temptation, remembring the examples of <hi>David</hi> here
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119120:174"/>
and in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and of <hi>Peter,</hi> notwithſtanding of his
forewarning by our Saviour. As alſo, that the higher any are in
place in Church, or Commonwealth they are in greateſt danger
to be tempted, becauſe their fall is moſt ſcandalous, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
by their example of the fall of many, <hi>Majorum ergo ruina,
ſit minorum cautela.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. In <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne of numbring the people through pride, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
and confidence in the arme of fleſh. We ſee that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
whoſoever have their own infirmities, which ſhould keep
them watchfull and humble, and that there is no perfection during
this life, the faireſt face having its own blemiſh, the cleereſt day its
own clouds, and the Godlieſt on Earth, being like <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſpotted
ſheep, and with the <hi>Apoſtle, Rom.</hi> 7. 24. Having occaſion to cry
out, <hi>O wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from this body
of death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>David</hi> a Godly man, yet ſinneth, <hi>Joab</hi> a wicked
man, yet diſſwades from ſinning. Where we obſerve that no man
is ſo leud, or wicked, but that ſometimes he will diſlike ſome evill,
and it will be abhominable to him, as the Kings word was to
<hi>Joab,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 6. As on the contrary their is no man on
Earth ſo holy, but that ſometimes he may ſinne groſly, but as
we ſay, <hi>one ſwallow makes not the ſpring,</hi> ſo by one onely act, men
are not to be Judged, holy or wicked.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Joab</hi> gives good counſell to <hi>David,</hi> though he was a
wicked man. Where may obſerve, that there are many who can
give good counſell to others, for the avoyding of ſome ſinnes,
who in groſſer treſpaſſes have not grace to take good counſell
themſelves, like the <hi>Phariſees who could eſpy the moat in their
neighbours eye, and offer to take it out, who would not ſpy, nor
let the beam be taken out of their own eye.</hi> Such was <hi>Joab</hi> who
counted <hi>Davids</hi> command to number the people abhominable,
(though having no great ſhew of evill) and therefore diſſwaded
him therefore: who in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah, Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi>
could not take good counſell to himſelf from his own heart. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let any look, who gives the counſell, but what it is; and if
good, not to reject it for him, who gives the ſame, as our Saviour
taught the people concerning the <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. Notwithſtanding of <hi>Joabs</hi> good counſell, we ſee
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119120:174"/>
that <hi>David</hi> perſiſts obſtinately in his reſolution, and will have the
people numbred, that he might know their number, a fault too
ordinary in Princes, who would uſe arbitrary government, and
to have their will a Law, as the proverb is; <hi>Sic volo, ſic jubeo,
ſtat pro ratione voluntas.</hi> Whereas their will ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Gods, and their actions ruled by Law, by which
they would have the actions of their ſubjects, and inferiours to be
ruled.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>David</hi> not onely ſinnes in commanding the people to be
numbred, but alſo in an obſtinate reſolution notwithſtanding of
good counſell in the contrary, which therefore brought a plague
upon his people. Which ſhewes not only how farre, &amp; foulely the
beſt ſometimes may fall and fail: but likewiſe that for the ſinnes
of a people, oftimes either the Lord takes away a good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
from them, or elſe withdrawes his grace from ſuch, and
leaves them to themſelves to commit ſuch ſinnes, as in the Juſtice
of God, and for their offences puniſhment is inflicted upon
them, as the three years ſamine was for <hi>Sauls</hi> treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> here in numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>10. Notwithſtanding <hi>Joabs</hi> reſiſtance, unto <hi>Davids</hi> command
at firſt, yet for worldly reſpects, and corrupt ends, againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and conſcience he obeys <hi>Davids</hi> command at laſt, and
prefers obedience to man to the obedience of God, contrary
to that worthy ſpeech of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 5. 29. And which teaches
us in like manner, that we ſhould in all things obey God rather
than man, whereof our Saviour gives the reaſon, becauſe he has
power, both <hi>of ſoul and body, to caſt both into Hell fire,</hi> which
no man hath.</p>

               <p>FOllowes now after <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> repentance,
wherein are three things. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> contrition. 2. His
confeſſion. And 3. his deprecation. In the firſt it is ſaid; <hi>That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119120:175"/>
he had numbred the people, which was after nine moneths, and
twenty dayes,</hi> Davids <hi>heart ſmote him.</hi> Which is the ſame phraſe
that is uſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. Whereby is ſignified the awaking,
and accuſation of his guilty conſcience, and ſenſe of his ſinne now,
wherein he had layed ſo long in a deep, and dead ſecurity without
either ſight, or ſenſe of his own guiltyneſſe before. Which ſmite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. The breaking and contrition of the
heart. Whereupon enſues the ſecond part of his repentance, which
is a confeſſion to God of his ſin, expreſt by two phraſes. 1. That
he had <hi>ſinned greatly.</hi> And 2. <hi>that he had done very fooliſhly,</hi> and
laſt, is his deprecation, <hi>That the Lord would take away the iniquity
of his ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which we have in the text is, the meſſage
from God to <hi>David,</hi> which enſued upon his repentance. <hi>From the</hi>
10. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 15. Wherein we have. 1. The time. 2. The
meſſenger that is ſent to <hi>David.</hi> 3. The meſſage it ſelf, or <hi>Option</hi>
given to <hi>David.</hi> And 4. <hi>Davids</hi> anſwer and election. Firſt then
the time was, when <hi>David</hi> was up in the morning, the ſmiting
of his conſcience raiſing him from his bed, which as he ſayes,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 6. He had been <hi>watering with his tears in the night time
before.</hi> 2. The meſſenger whom the Lord ſends to him is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
from his name, <hi>Gad.</hi> 2. From his office, a <hi>Seer,</hi> and more
particularly from his relation to <hi>David,</hi> that he was his <hi>Seer,</hi>
or one whom familiarly <hi>David</hi> uſed to conſult with in his
doubts, or difficulties. The word (<hi>Seer</hi>) being an ordinary ſtile
given to the Prophets of God, becauſe of the Lords revealing by
viſions, words, or dreams, of his will to them, and by them to
others. As we ſee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. 3. The meſſage it ſelf is an <hi>Option</hi>
of any of three plagues, whereby the Lord was to puniſh <hi>Davids</hi>
people for their own ſinnes, that had angred him againſt them:
and for <hi>Davids,</hi> in numbring of the people. 4. <hi>Davids</hi> anſwer
and election, contains. 1. His perplexity, and ſtrait whereinto
he was put. 2. His choyce of the Peſtilence. And 3. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his choyce, from the greatneſſe of Gods mercy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, followes <hi>from the</hi> 15. <hi>verſ. to the</hi> 18. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the plague, and ſtaying thereof, wherein we have.
1. From whom it is ſent, towit, the Lord. 2. How long it
continued. 3. How many dyed thereof, towit, 70000. men.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:119120:175"/>
4. By whom the execution was made, towit, by an Angell.
5. The Lords ſtaying of the deſtroying Angell. 1. When and
where, towit, when he was ſtretching his hand upon <hi>Jeruſale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>

is enough, ſtay thine hand.</hi> 3. Upon what ground, towit, the
Lords compaſſion, and repenting him of the evill. And 4. Where
this Angell was, towit, <hi>By the threſhing floor of</hi> Araunah. Now
the Lord is ſaid to repent of the evill, (towit, of puniſhment, as
is ſaid, <hi>There is no evill in the City which the Lord does not,</hi>) not
<hi>properly,</hi> but <hi>per anthropopatheiam,</hi> when he does that in mercy
what men uſe to do, when they repent of any evill, that they
have done, and forbear the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, followes for the ceaſing of the plague, and after the
former direction of the ſtaying thereof. <hi>Davids</hi> prayer &amp; humble
ſupplication, wherein we have. 1. The occaſion thereof, towit, his
ſeeing of the deſtroying Angell, who being an inviſible ſpirit, yet
appeared in a viſible ſhape at this time to <hi>David,</hi> as the Angels did
to <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> and others. 2. <hi>Davids</hi> humble confeſſion of his
ſin, &amp; <hi>that he had done wickedly.</hi> 3. His cleering of the people of any
guiltineſſe, towit, in this his fact and ſinning, whom he calls
ſheep for innocency, and relating to himſelf, who was as their
ſhepheard and ruler. And 4. his preferring their ſafety to his
own, and his Fathers houſe, and deſiring that the Lord would
transferre the plague, and puniſhment rather on him, and it, than
any wayes to let it lie on them.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Lord who ſent firſt a ſad meſſage to <hi>David,</hi>
by the ſame meſſenger <hi>Gad,</hi> gives him now a comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of mercy, and deliverance of his people from the plague of
Peſtilence, and in teſtimony of <hi>Davids</hi> thankfulneſſe for the ſame,
<hi>Gad</hi> by a warrant from God directs him to erect an altar to
the Lord, in that very place, where he ſaw the deſtroying Angell,
towit, <hi>In the threſhing floor of</hi> Araunah <hi>the</hi> Jebuſite. Which thing
<hi>David</hi> readily went about to perform, as the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(ſayes the text) although it was <hi>Gad,</hi> as the meſſenger
who ſpake unto him, and for this end went up to the floor of
<hi>Araunah,</hi> conferres with him, byes the floor of him, erects the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
offers thereon burnt, and peace offerings, and ſo the plague
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:119120:176"/>
was ſtayed from <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Wherein we have to conſider. 1. Who
this <hi>Araunah</hi> was. 2. Where was this place. 3. Why this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
was erected. 4. <hi>Araunahs</hi> liberall offer, and his pious prayer.
5. <hi>Davids</hi> modeſt refuſeall, and the cauſe thereof, with his buying
of the floor, and Oxen, and the price thereof. 6. <hi>Davids</hi> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of an Altar, and offering thereon. And 7. the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
that followed hereupon, towit, the ſtaying of the plague of
Peſtilence.</p>
               <p>1. As for <hi>Araunah</hi> he is called by Nation, and pedigree a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſite,</hi>
or <hi>Cananite,</hi> but now a <hi>Proſelite,</hi> and of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as may be ſeen by his offer and prayer. 2. This floor was
on mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>David</hi> went up
to it. 3. This Altar was to be erected, that the plague might
ſtay from the people. 4. <hi>Araunah</hi> therefore for the ſervice of
God, and good of his people, and love to the King, and eſpecially,
as a preſage of the vocation of the Gentiles, liberally offers not
onely his threſhing floor freely, but alſo his Oxen, and threſhing
inſtruments, and inſtruments of the Oxen, as their yokes, and
ſuch like for wood, which liberality of his is extolled highly, that
he did this as a King to the King. Who notwithſtanding modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuſes it upon this reaſon, that according to the Law a man
muſt offer to God of that which is his own, and therefore.
5. Buyes it, and the Oxen for 50. ſhekells of ſilver, whereupon.
6. <hi>David</hi> offers (having built the Altar) burnt offerings, and
peace offerings for expiation of Gods wrath, and propitiation.
And ſo 7. this was the ſucceſſe, <hi>The Lord was intreated for the
Land, and the plague ceaſed.</hi> Not that this is to be referred
to theſe ſacrifices, as the cauſe, but by way of <hi>Metonymie; When
the name of the cauſe is transferred to the effect.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 10. IT is ſaid; That <hi>Davids heart ſmote him after he had
numbred the people.</hi> Whereby we obſerve, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the wicked &amp; the Godly, that albeit the Godly ſin
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:119120:176"/>
yet they lye not ſtill impenitently in ſinne, and ſecurity, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do, but by grace, and repentance, they riſe againe: and
their hearts ſmites them for the ſinne, which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
as we may ſee here in <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Hezekiah, Peter,</hi> and
others.</p>
                  <p>2. We ſee here likewiſe, that the committing of ſinne, is like
<hi>John's eating of that little book,</hi> Revel. 10. 10. <hi>Which was ſweet
in his mouth, but thereafter bitter in his belly:</hi> or like thoſe locuſts,
Revel. 9. 8. Who had alluring haire as women, but had Lyons
teeth that bite, and Scorpions tailes which ſtinge: even ſo
ſinne in the committing thereof is pleaſant, but in the end when
the conſcience is awaked, is painfull, as <hi>Manaſſah, Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi>
and <hi>David</hi> found both in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and this.
Who therefore would eſchew, the ſower of ſinne, both here
and hereafter, let them eſchew the poyſonable ſweet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmites him, after the numbring of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which was after nine moneths and more. Where we ſee,
as it is Satans policy, when he has moved men to commit ſinne,
ſo thereafter to lull them a ſleep in ſecurity, even ſo that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when they have ſinned, may lye a long time in this ſinfull ſleep,
before they awake: as <hi>David</hi> did in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> till the
Lord by <hi>Nathan</hi> awaked him, and as here he did in the numbring

ſo our next care and prayer to God, ſhould be that if we ſinne,
he us ſuffer not to lye ſtill in ſecurity, with impiety joyning impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency.</p>
                  <p>4. In <hi>Davids</hi> confeſſion, ſaying <hi>he had ſinned greatly, and done

parents did, nor extenuates his ſinne, as <hi>Saul</hi> did in ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi>
and the cattle: nor defends his ſinne, as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did,
but rather aggravates his ſinne, <hi>that he had ſinned greatly.</hi> This
being the practice ever of them, who are truly humbled, and this
being the beſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

example of the <hi>Publican,</hi> and parable of the returning <hi>Prodigall,</hi>
and of <hi>David</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <p>5. Whereas <hi>David</hi> ſaies, <hi>that in ſinning he had done very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly.</hi>
We ſee that it is not without cauſe, that ſinners are called
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:119120:177"/>
                     <hi>fooles</hi> in Scripture, though never ſo worldly wiſe, as the <hi>nich foole</hi>

there is no God,</hi> and that ſinne is folly, as <hi>Tamar</hi> ſaid to <hi>Amnon,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 12. Whereas they only are truly wiſe, who are God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the feare of God being the beginning of wiſdome, and they
only make a wiſe choice of things, preferring pleaſures for ever
more, to ſinnefull periſhing pleaſures, and a heavenly kingdome
to earthly profit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they alſo like the wiſe ſteward, provide for time

takes alſo with warnings, as <hi>David</hi> did with <hi>Jonathans.</hi> And as
our Saviour adviſeth, agree with their adverſary, while they are
on the way. Whereas the fooliſh ſinner does none of theſe fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named.</p>
                  <p>6. In <hi>Davids</hi> prayer for remiſſion of his ſinne, he calles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
Gods ſervant. Whereby we ſee, that although at ſome time,
through frailty, or force of temptation, a Godly man may fall into
ſome provoking ſinne, beſide thoſe of daily incurſion, yet their
deſire, and ordinary c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ſe of life, is to ſerve God, from which
therefore, as from the greater part they are ſo denominated: as
the wicked are called ſinners, though ſometimes they have done
ſome act, that ſeemeth good and pious, as <hi>Joab</hi> here in his diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>David</hi> to number the people.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. The Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> is called <hi>Davids Seer.</hi> Where
we obſerve not only the neceſſity, and utility, of faithfull paſtours,
who ſhould be <hi>Seers,</hi> or <hi>watchmen,</hi> as they are called, <hi>Ezek</hi> 33. 2.
And give warning to Gods people, of their danger and duty. But
likewiſe whereas <hi>Gad</hi> in a particular manner, is called <hi>Davids
Seer.</hi> We have in <hi>David</hi> a good, and Godly, example of imitation
for Magiſtrates and great men, to adjoyne to themſelves, ſome
worthy, and able ſervant of God, and have them in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
with whom they may communicate their ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and conſult with them in the matters of God, and of their
ſalvation, which is <hi>that one thing moſt neceſſary,</hi> as our Saviour
ſpoke unto <hi>Martha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. Albeit <hi>David</hi> repented in manner aforeſaid for
his ſinne, yet he muſt be corrected, not that we eſtabliſh hereby,
that doctrine of remiſſion of the fault, but not of the puniſhment,
which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> uſe for their ſatisfactions, and purgatory, but to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:119120:177"/>
ſhew, that when God has pardoned the ſinne, yet he inflicts the

was, ſo ſeverely puniſhed, being one according to Gods own
heart. What may wicked flagitious ſinners, for manifeſt, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
ſinnes expect? and if this was done to the green tree, what
may withered branches look for?</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>David</hi> chooſes rather to fall in the hand of
God, <hi>by the Peſtilence,</hi> then fall into the hand of man, <hi>by the Sword,
for with the Lord is mercy, whereas with man is cruelty.</hi> And this
is the reaſon which <hi>David</hi> gives of his choice, (<hi>for his mercies
are great</hi>) ſaies he, ſo that the Godly in the midſt of their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
corrections, they ever by faith apprehend mercy, and that
the Lord tempers their moſt bitter cup, with the ſweetneſs of
fatherly love. Whereas the wicked drink of the wine, of the
wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the
cup of his indignation, as is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 10.</p>

Where we obſerve that the Peſtilence, and ſuch other
plagues, or puniſhments, that come on man for ſinne, are ſent
from God: and come not by chance or fortune (as men ſpeak)
nor are to be attributed, only to the diſtemper, or corruption of

to come from the ſinne-chaſtiſing hand of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:119120:178"/>
they ſmart, <hi>David</hi> was proud of the number of his ſubjects, and
now they are greatly diminiſhed, that he may ſee cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
in the matter of his glory. The like we may ſee in the
ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and the beautifull haire of <hi>Abſolom.</hi>

                  <p>13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>When the Angell ſtretched forth his hand upon
Jeruſalem to deſtroy in, the Lord repented him of the evill,</hi> and
commanded the Angell to ſtay his hand, ſaying, <hi>It is enough.</hi>
Where we may obſerve the Lords bowells, of compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his people, even when he is moſt ſharply ſmiting, and his
preventing mercy, before that <hi>David</hi> make his ſubſequent ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
for ſtaying of this plague.</p>
                  <p>14. Here likewiſe we ſee, that the Lord hath his Angells rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to execute his will, as his miniſtring ſpirits, either in juſtice
or mercy, whoſe example of promptitude, or obedience, we are
taught by our Saviour, in the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> to follow, <hi>and to do
his will on earth, as it is in heaven.</hi> Whoſe great power alſo we
may ſee, in ſo ſhort a time, deſtroying ſo many thouſands: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but one Angell. As we ſee likewiſe in the deſtruction of the
firſt borne, in one night through all <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of one <hi>hundred,
fourſcore,</hi> and <hi>five thouſand</hi> of <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> by one Angell alſo, in
one night of <hi>Sinacheribs</hi> Army, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 35. Whence we may

God, whoſe miniſtring ſpirits they are, and do attend his

                  <p>15. Where the Lord ſayeth to the Angell (<hi>it is enough,</hi>)
We ſee that as the Lord mixes the cup, of his ſharpeſt, and moſt
bitter chaſtiſements with mercy and love: ſo likewiſe the Lord,
like a wiſe and skilfull Phyſitian meaſures his cup, <hi>and will not
lay upon any, more then they can beare,</hi> but with the correction in
his own good time, he will give the iſſue and delivery: thus he
who ſets Limits to the raging ſea, did Limit the time how long,
his people ſhould remaine, in the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in the captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi> As he did here, how long this
deſtroying Angell ſhould ſmite with his ſword of Peſtilence. And
O how little pleaſure, doth the Lord take in the death of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
ere <hi>David</hi> could ſee the deſtroyer, the Lord had reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, whoſe compaſſions, if they did not both withhold, and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:119120:178"/>
abridge his judgments, what could we look for, but hell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

admirable Love, to his poore ſubjects, who would ingroſſe the
plague to himſelfe, and his houſe, from this people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi>
and ſues to interpoſe himſelfe between them, and the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Thus did our Saviour Chriſt, and ſonne of <hi>David, (who
is that good, and great ſhepheard of his ſheep,</hi>) offer himſelfe to
death, which they had deſerved, yea more, did dye for them,
and interpoſed himſelfe between the Fathers wrath and them,
to deliver them there from, and from everlaſting deſtruction, and
as <hi>David</hi> did for his people, ſtill interced's for his Church to the
worlds end.</p>
                  <p>17. We ſee likewiſe though <hi>David</hi> ſaw the Angell, with the

a Godly heart, will part with any thing that is needfull, and
may ſerve for the worſhip of God, who is the giver of all good
things, which we have here: and of all good things which we
hope, or look and long for hereafter. Which ſerves to rebuke
and condemne, the tenacious, and baſe avaricious diſpoſition,
of many in this age, who can part with nothing, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Gods worſhip, or promoting of religion, or any good

is therefore highly praiſed by the ſpirit of God, and regiſtrate
to all after ages, in the holy Scripture, that all theſe things did
<hi>Arannah,</hi> as a King gives to a King, and that he ſaid to <hi>David
the Lord God accept thee.</hi> Whereupon we obſerve, that what
is done by a pious heart, to the honour and worſhip of God,
ſhall never want its own reward, and bleſſed remembrance, as

was the breaking of that box of precious oyntment, by <hi>Mary
