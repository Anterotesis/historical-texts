            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vnmeaſurable they did appeare, till at length they became a
deepe, that could not be paſſed ouer. Therfore I haue bin glad
to take this oportunity of my dayes yet lengthned out, once
againe to meaſure this great deepe: And by an hiſtory of
a like wonderful deliuerance, to reuiue the dead memory
therof in the cares of a ſecure and vnthankefull world. That

of our purging and preparing: that when the ſtones are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſquared, Gods houſe may bee perfectly aduanced: And the
ſetting vp of the <hi>Arke</hi> will be the finall ouerthrow of <hi>Dagon.</hi>
In patience therefore (deere bretheren) committee wee our
ſelues into the handes of our faithfull Creator. That his hand
is not ſhortned, we may ſee in that <hi>wonderfull deliuerance.</hi> In
memoriall whereof, I haue now the <hi>third time,</hi> tendred thoſe
meditations, that I might <hi>pay my vowes</hi> vnto the Lord, for the
ſanctifing of that generall deliuerance by a <hi>ſpeciall deliuerance</hi>
vnto me: &amp; the rather, becauſe the Lord hath euen now of late
<hi>deliuered</hi> me out of the <hi>horrible pit, and reſtored vnto me the Ioy
of his ſaluation,</hi> that I might declare the wonders of the Lord in
the land of the liuing: <hi>The Lord hath renued me as an example
vnto them which ſhall in time to come beleeue this wonderfull
worke.</hi> And yet, (bleſſed be our faithfull God) this is a day of
good tidings. The <hi>buſh is not conſumed the ſcepter of</hi> Antichriſt
<hi>is broken,</hi> his <hi>ſinne repenteth,</hi> and the <hi>Lord raigneth,</hi> and <hi>hell is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</hi>
And why ſhould I hold my peace? Surely if my ſight
<pb facs="tcp:9119:5"/>
fayle me not, I ſee in that deliuerance, <hi>Amelecks</hi> vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw:
Oh that <hi>Moſes handes may be held vp ſtill,</hi> that <hi>Ameleck</hi>
may be deſtroyed from vnder heauen, for the better ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my weake knees and feeble hands to the due meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that wonderful deliuerance! I haue ſpared ſome few hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
from my publicke ſtudie, and ſpent them in the meditation
of <hi>a like wonderfull deliuerance</hi> of the <hi>Church of God</hi> in former
times. <hi>Very malitious</hi> was the <hi>enemie</hi> when nothing would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him but the vtter rooting out of the <hi>Church of God.</hi> And
ſurely much more malitious our enemies, that had plotted the
extreame ouerthrow both of <hi>Church and common-wealth.</hi> 2.
<hi>Very patient and wiſe was the Lord</hi> in giuing the aduerſary ſo
far his deſire, as euen to haue brought his miſchiefe to the
poynt of execution; to make his confuſion the greater, and the
<hi>Churches deliuerance</hi> more admirable &amp; comfortable. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that our <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> had brought their <hi>plotte</hi> within leſſe
then eight houres execution after two yeares ſecure contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and ripening thereof: This as it magnified the admirable
prouidence of the Lord in ordering the actions of the wicked,
ſo it tended tò the greater aſtoniſhment and confuſion of Gods
enemies, and, notwithſtanding the careleſſe ſecurity of the
<hi>Atheiſt,</hi> yet hath, and ſhall make, to the eternal comfort of the
true beleeuer. 3. <hi>Wonderfull was the Lord</hi> in diſapoynting the
practize of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>deliuering</hi> of <hi>his Church:</hi> but that the
enemie was <hi>caſt in the pit,</hi> which he had digged for others. Oh!
how did this <hi>magnifie the iuſtice of God,</hi> how did it <hi>confirme
the faith of the afflicted?</hi> And ſurely did not the Lord ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
much more wonderfull <hi>in our deliuerance?</hi> Was it a ſmall
matter to deliuer vs as a prey out of the ſnare of the Fowler, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
alſo our aduerſaries were conſumed with the poulder
which they had prepared to blow vs vp, by an ouer-ruling hand
of the Almighty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was the Lords dooing, and it ought to be maruailous in thy
eyes:</hi> And marke what I tell thee? <hi>Neuer looke to ſee the face of
God in glory for thy final releaſe out of all thy troubles, vnleſſe thou
doſt ſee the eſpeciall loue of thy God in this deliuerance: and ſo ſtill
deſireſt to ſee further; to the increaſe of thy moſt holy faith; that ſo
<pb facs="tcp:9119:6"/>
beleeuing thou maiſt ſee greater things then theſe: yea beſt able to
ſee a farre off, euen the finall deliuerance of the Church</hi> out of all
her troubles. For thy further direction and prouoking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to this <hi>Chriſtian duty,</hi> In the feare of God make vſe of this
<hi>hiſtory</hi> which I doe tender thee as a glaſſe, wherein thou maiſt
dayly view that wonderfull deliuerance. I haue as the Lord
hath inabled me, conſidered thy weakeneſſe, and prouided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
That thy edge may be ſtill ſharpened, and the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

tendering thee onely for a taſte, ſome briefe obſruations on

the preparation to the hiſtory: yet furniſhed and eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,

as may ſerue thee well for a full enterview of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the deliuerance of Princes and Kingdomes from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

ſtudying breuity, becauſe this <hi>wanton age</hi> cannot indure long
diſcourſes, and my <hi>health</hi> will not indure long ſtudies: if thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
be ſharpned, pray for <hi>health,</hi> and liberty of the Goſpell:
and (ſo thou <hi>luſt</hi> not after <hi>quailes</hi>) thou maiſt ſhortly by Gods
mercy haue more variety. For the preſent conſider my weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and magnifie Gods power: let the <hi>Printer</hi> beare his owne
burthen, and yet as he hath prouided, ſo eaſe thy ſelfe, and him,

Prince, though the diſobedience of the Queene had much

of the law, and that to be ſcanned by the wiſdome
of his Councellors, wherein that he would not be his

for ſatisfaction to the right cenſure of his lawes, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
if we iudge him by the outward action he did not

               <p>The equity hereof appeareth in this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 48. Whether a man may be his owne Iudge.</note> that as men
are blinde in their Iudgements and ſo cannot know

we muſt auoide all occaſions of euill. And ſeeing we
muſt auoide all appearance of euill, therefore howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it may bee, that a man may herein Iudge righteouſly,
yet ſeeing to the world it will appeare otherwiſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the approouing of his good name in the eye of

               <p>If it ſhalbe here demaunded how then may a man be
produced in his owne caſe to the ſatisfiyng of the world?
the anſwere is plaine: he is not produced as a Iudge but
as a witneſſe thereto, and not ſo as a witneſſe as if the
Iudgement depended vpon himſelfe therein: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his allegations are confirmed by an oath, as being
the meanes which the Lord hath appointed to end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies,

               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This <hi>vtterly conuinceth all popiſh religion</hi> and

ſtand to the Iudgement of the world, and it <hi>condemneth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the ground,</hi> of that groſſe opynion, that we may be ſo
perfit, as not to erre in our iudgements. <hi>It caſteth to

All which, proceed from this only ground, that their is no

               <p>A notable fallacy, whereby Satan deceiues ſinners; that
becauſe others many times iudge wrongfully of them,
therefore they conclude that they beſt know themſelues,
and beſt may be their owne Iudges concerning their
ſinnes.</p>
               <p>A priueledge which how-ſoeuer they ſtand vpon, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
for this end, that their iniquity may be hidden from
the eye of the world, ſeeing this is an eſpeciall meanes
not onely to ripen the ſinne, but further alſo to
harden the heart of the ſinner. Therefore behold the
admirable iuſtice of GOD, in taking the wicked in
their owne ſnares, that hardneſſe of heart, continuing
impenitency, and ſo in the end working deſpaire: hereby
it comes to paſſe, that they which would haue the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deuolued to themſelues; that ſo they may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the true iudgment of ſinne, it ſhalbe vnto them
as they do deſire, they ſhall haue iudging enough,
euen to ſinke them to hell, they ſhall truely iudge of

is their therefore no meaſure, but euen extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?
could hee haue deuiſed a greater? could the poore

for the good of the offender, and not to ſtrenghthen the

Iudge plead for him-ſelfe to iuſtifie the equity of this his

was committed againſt the greateſt perſon, and the thing
commaunded being very indifferent, therefore by theſe

deſerue ſo haynous a puniſhment? or doth hee rather like

Princes muſt erre the ſubiect ſhal deeply ſmart for it, and

               <p>But what might bee the cauſe of all this haſte?
Surely lette vs heere looke vp to GOD and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to bee in extremitie, and delaie was dangerous. <hi>Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was to bee aduanced that ſhee might be meanes

the wicked therein fulfill the will of GOD wherein

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9119:34"/>
that the head may rule and the reſt may obey.</p>
               <p>

and euen the wicked when they ſatiſfie their luſts,<note place="margin">Wicked in their ſinnes ſerue Gods righteous will.</note> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
vnto the righteous law of God, For howſoeuer
no doubt the law proceeded from luſt, and could not
chuſe but redound to the ſhame of the lawgiuers who were
not lawes to them-ſelues neither could rule their familes
and therefore they muſt haue a law to force this obedience
and it is a miſerable obedience which is onely forced by
the law,<note place="margin">1. Sam.</note> yea if we conſider the nature of this prophane
people to apt of it ſelfe to Lord it ouer the weaker,<note place="margin">Num. 24.</note> and
therefore needed rather a bridle to curbe their tirany, then
any warrant to make good their imperiouſneſſe, therefore
to them the law was not ſeaſonable,<note place="margin">Husbands are to rule ouer their wiues.</note> (ſo wiſely ought
lawes to be fitted to the ſtate and conditions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
yet if we ſhal conſider the matter of the law in it ſelfe,<note place="margin">1. Vſe.</note>
as it hath it ground out of the law of nature ſo is it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
alſo by the word of God. For doth not the law
of nature inforce no leſſe, then that they which are beſt able
by reaſon of their different ſtrength; they which deſerue
beſt, as being the prouiders for the family, they which
muſt defend all and ſo ſhall anſwer for all, that they I
ſay ſhould haue the preheminence. And doth not the
word of GOD iuſtifie this law of nature which giues
vnto man the ſuperiority ouer the wife, and that not
onley in the time of mans fall,<note place="margin">Gen. 2</note> as if before they were
one fleſh, and therefore no difference of ſuperiority
betweene them (as if this ſuperiority were only a part of
his or the wiues puniſhment:)<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> but alſo in the time of his
reſtitution by Chriſt; thereby iuſtifying the holy right
thereof,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> and approuing the ſame to be a ſpeciall bleſſing:
Wherein we may behold an admirable prouidence of God,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note>
that how-ſoeuer this law of ſuperioritie concerned euen the
ſtate of innocencie,<note place="margin">Tim 2.</note> becauſe euen to that happy condition
this holy ſubiection was neceſſary:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> Yet is not this law giuen
till y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fal of man, becauſe then there was neceſſary vſe therof
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9119:35"/>
in regard of ſin that now had taken footing, which though
it giue no way to proud inſulting &amp; imperious behauiour,
much leſſe allow power of bitter ſpeaking, cruel correction,
or iudiciall proceeding in the caſe of life, becauſe though
the husband bee a King in his familie, yet his kingdome is
but ſpirituall, and for temporall reformations ſubiect to the
Temporall ſword: no otherwiſe to take the ſame into his
hand then by ſpeciall warrant from the ciuill Magiſtrate:
yet it eſtabliſheth ſuch a power ouer the wife as Chriſt
hath ouer his Church,<note place="margin">And how far</note> if to cal <hi>Peter</hi> Sathan when he ſinnes
of ignorance, then much more to reproue ſharpely preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
ſinnes, that God may be iuſtified and ſinne aſhamed,
&amp; repentance being renued may be the renuing of loue: as
treading loue vnder foote in regard of Gods glory in the
aduancing thereof, confirming our affections, which as yet
condemne the baſnes of ſuch carpet Knights that proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
their dignitie as a baud to luſt, and become ſlaues to
their wiues for a little dalliance:<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> ſo hereby wee may learne
alſo for concluſion in this point, to giue God his right and
ſuperioritie ouer vs in a happy conqueſt of our rebellious
affections, that ſo wee may retayne our dignitie ouer our
wiues. Had theſe prophane men learned this leſſon they
had not needed a law to haue procured this dignitie. But
for want hereof euen their law they thinke ſcarce ſtrong
ynough, and therefore they indeauour to ſtrengthen it with
a further pollicy. Namely, 1 <hi>They cauſe it to be publiſhed in
the</hi> ſeuerall language of each Nation, that ſo being parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
vnderſtood, it might appeare more authenticall, and
being hereby inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as waighty, &amp; in good erneſt it might
both more eaſily procure obedience and ſo take away the
hatred from the law-giuers. For ſeeing no doubt the
repudiating of the Queene for ſo ſmall a matter, muſt needs
heare odious in the eares of the ſubiects,<note place="margin">Wicked iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their ſin by making it common to others.</note> therefore to qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
this hatred the people muſt bee gratified, and (wherein
thinke theſe wiſe-men) ſhall wee gratifie them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then by giuing them power to domineere ouer their
wiues; ſo that now though they vſe them neuer ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtuouſly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9119:35"/>
yet this law ſhall ſtop their mouthes, and ſo ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
ſhall increaſe from the higheſt to the loweſt, wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and repudiating what ſhall not now be lawfull. So
politicke are great ones to cloake their owne ſinnes, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them common, and ſo iuſtifiable in others: So wiſely
doth the Lord confound them in this their pollicie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> while
by this communicating of the law to either, they prouide
for their credits, they doe not hereby diſcouer their ſhame
but by this meanes alſo ripening ſinne generally they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the way to Gods generall iudgements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> Well howſoeuer the drift of theſe politickes might
herein be wicked in publiſhing theſe lawes thus to catch in
their mother tongue, yet is there an equitie in this point y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>Namely ſeeing lawes are publiſhed in ſuch a language
that they may be knowne to all;<note place="margin">Lawes to be publiſhed in the vulgar tongues.</note> therefore as no man may
clayme priuiledge beyond the law, ſo we are hereby taught
to be acquainted with the lawes, not to intrap others or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our ſelues from wrong onely, but that ſo we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
conſcionably obedience to the ſame. And if ſo bee
we are to take notice of mens ordinances, that ſo wee may
obey them, how ought then our delight to be in the law
of the Lord that ſo we may meditate therein day and night,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 2.</note>
And by the direction of the ſame reforme our waies? Which
as it condemneth that man of ſinne who lockes vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law

will of God wee might not care to performe it, ſo it may
cauſe vs to lament the ignorance of the world euen in ſuch

fruit of this ignorance (euen deſperate wickedneſſe) that the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I pray you? Surely that, here's more fuell preparing for his

               <p>A notable preſident for Chriſtian Princes to poſſeſſe their
veſſels in holyneſſe and honour, not ſuffering the ſtranger to
deuoure their ſtrength, nor expoſing their poſteritie to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and diſhonour, but to be carefull of chaſtitie in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
So to baniſh the occaſions there of from their Courts,
as idleneſſe, filthy dancing, vaine ſtage-plaies &amp;c. And to
ſee the Lawes ſeuerely executed againſt this ſin, leaſt the
ſtranger indeed doe deuoure their ſtrength; and as they
tooke it of the hyre of an harlot, ſo they ſhall returne to the

               <p>But he that is filthie will be filthy ſtill. The King is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and he puts his deſire in execution.</p>
               <p>Now let vs further conſider how God is pleaſed herein.
What light bringes hee out of this darkneſſe? What waie
makes he hereby for the deliuerance of his Church?</p>
               <p>In the Cittie of <hi>Shuſhan</hi> there waas a certaine Iew whoſe<note place="margin">Verſe. 5.</note>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:9119:49"/>
name was <hi>Mordecai</hi> the ſoune of <hi>Shimei.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In theſe few next verſes the holy Ghoſt ſets downe ſuch
meanes whereby <hi>Heſter</hi> is aduanced to the Court, as ſhew
their grounds and reference to others. And they are of
two ſorts.</p>
               <p>The firſt is her preſeruation and education, being for
an orphane captiue, and ſo more extraordinarily plunged
in affliction, and thereby more extraordinarily caſt vpon
the prouidence of God: who as he vſually worketh by
meanes, ſo he prouides a kinſ-man to become his tutor
and nouriſher, and ſuch a kinſ-man who as he was perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
with her in her humiliation ſhould alſo be pertaker
with her of her aduancement.</p>
               <p>This kinſ-man therefore is here deſcribed at large, by
his <hi>habitation</hi> he dwelt in <hi>Suſhan;</hi> ſecondly by his Country
he was a Iew. 3. by his name he is called <hi>Mordicai. 4.</hi> by his
pedigree he was of the tribe of<note n="*" place="margin">Bitter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</note> 
                  <hi>Beniamin</hi> where alſo <hi>his

the ſonne of <hi>Kiſh</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. He is deſcribed vnto vs by his <hi>outward condition,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he was borne, in the captiuity, which the holy
Ghoſt neceſſarily implieth when ſpeaking in the 5. verſe.
of his father <hi>Kiſh, He it was</hi> (ſaith the ſpirit) <hi>which had bin
carried away from Ieruſalem with the captiuity that was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with</hi> Ieconiah <hi>King of Iuda, whom</hi> Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
<hi>King of Babel had caried away.</hi> verſ. 6. Wherepon it muſt
needs follow that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was not caried away in the
captiuity, but his father <hi>Kiſh.</hi> And ſo the worke of GOD
herein appeeres more admirable, that one man borne in
the captiuity ſhould not onely be gardian to his couſin,
left fatherleſſe and comfortleſſe, who in all likely-hood
might need of ſuch helpe himſelfe, but that both theſe
being in ſuch a deſperate condicion, ſhould be ſo highly
aduanced in the land of their captiuity.</p>
               <p>Now that by this verſe, <hi>Kiſh</hi> the father muſt be ment, and
not <hi>Mordecai</hi> the ſonne. I take it is more then
probable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:9119:50"/>
1. Becauſe men at this time vſually attained not to halfe
thoſe yeares (for Iewiſh conceits paſſe them not) as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<hi>Mordecai</hi> muſt now be of,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 30. Mordecai was not caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the captiuity.</note> if he were one that was
caried away in the aforeſaid captiuity.</p>
               <p>2. The text it ſelfe doth ſeeme to reſolue the matter
where it makes this <hi>Mordecai</hi> couſin-german to <hi>Heſter,</hi> 25
being the daughter of <hi>Abihail</hi> who was <hi>Mordecaies</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,<note place="margin">Wiſ. 7. 15.</note>
Now among. i. couſins as there is vſually much
likeli-hood of years, ſo there could not here be ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as that <hi>Mordecai</hi> in any wiſe could be of that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity.</p>
               <p>3 And what need we ſerch the ſcripture vpon the authors
of Iewiſh fables and vnneceſſary ſuppoſals; ſeeing grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there might be diuers men of that ſame name, one
ſucceeding another within generations,<note place="margin">Scripture not to be ſtrained.</note> which is neither
contrary to the chronology of the ſtory, nor the Anology
of faith, both the ſcripture is iuſtified in it literall expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which we are to cleaue vnto, when no falſe-hood or
abſurdity followeth, and there-vpon all this controuerſie
is happily ended?</p>
               <p>So then we will take him for <hi>Heſters</hi> kinſ-man and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he performeth the part of a Kinſ-man vnto her, as here
in the verſe is deſcribed. <hi>He nowriſhed</hi> Heſter <hi>who was the
daughter of his vnkle,</hi> and the holy Ghoſt giueth a fourefold
reaſon of it, <hi>One</hi> from the <hi>bond of affinity,</hi> ſhe was his vnkles
daughter, and therefore by the rule of nature he was tied
to nowriſh her. Secondly from her miſerable condition,
<hi>ſhe had neither father nor mother,</hi> and therefore, ſhe had
need of ſuch of a gardian: and that we may ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of the Lord, in the tempering of his Childrens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
that there ſhalbe ſomewhat euen therein not onely
to moue to compaſſion, but to giue hope of repentance,
or elſe at leaſt to make miſery greeuious: behold <hi>another

               <p>Namely the <hi>maide was faire and beautifull to looke

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> did nouriſh her, drawne from his owne conſcience and

holy affection. Namely that <hi>after the death of her father and

adopted her to be his Child, as by the rule of conſcience
he was bound, but further alſo as his Child did moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

               <p>Surely this being but coniecturall, <hi>and</hi> the publike

ſuch hope, and therefore ſhe will herein yeeld to neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
becauſe the Lord might aſwell preſerue her vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <p>The maidens being thus prepared, are in the ſecond

of the Church may be more free and glorious, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

the Lord awake and returne when he will deliuer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
giuing them herein theſe apparant markes. Namely,
Firſt <hi>The clearing</hi> of his children by the mouthes of their

               <p>And ſurely if we do conſider the ſtate of the Church of

               <p>To this purpoſe we may obſerue a different eſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Thus you ſhall find to haue beene the ſtate of the Church

               </p>
               <p>And conſidering the promiſes of God for the reſeruing

Was it the mercy of God, that ſhee ſhould bee ſo

vnto God, to giue either fulnes or impoſe wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

(though hee had aboundance of ſpirit) yet appoint this

may hee not pardon the ſinner, and get him-ſelfe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Surely though wee dare not ſimply iuſtifie <hi>Heſter</hi> in

               <p>
                  <hi>But yet</hi> ther is an other flaw in this marriage:<note place="margin">

               <p>Surely by the ſame Lord who brings light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and turnes the euills of his children to his glory, and

did what he would:<note place="margin">Ioſ, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>yea what Heſter</hi> ſimply was not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.
For though the Lord had commanded that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould not marry with Idolaters,<note place="margin">Iudg. 3. Deut, 21.</note> yet doth he alſo not

And therefore no warrant for vs that haue choyce of holy

               </p>
               <p>Then the King made a great Feaſt to all his Princes and

is, that as Princes be <hi>wiſe, what they commit in truſt,</hi> ſo they
be not <hi>ſecure</hi> in the <hi>iſſue of it:</hi> but rather watch dilligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ouer the truſt committed, and to keepe the bridle in
their owne handes, <hi>by putting it wiſely to God.</hi> Whereby
it ſhall come to paſſe: that the ſubiect hereby perceiuing
that he is rather <hi>honoured in the caſe committed,</hi> then the

               <p>Surely though purpoſes are ſinnes in the ſight of God:

<hi>Who onely can iudge</hi> by the out-ſide, and ſo may proceed

               <p>Surely, by inflicting the puniſhment vpon the intent:
that ſo the intent being met withall, the act may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,

And therefore ſeeing intent of treaſon pardoned,

Is it not more then time to preuent ſuch deſperate onſets
