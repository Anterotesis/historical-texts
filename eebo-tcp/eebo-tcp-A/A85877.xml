         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt of the time briefly, Now, now at preſent, now whilſt it is time, whilſt you have an opportunity to get money from the Malignant party; now (even now) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they riſe up again, and force you to flye for refuge to ſome neighbour Nation; provide you of Materials to do it; take from them their Horſes, Armour; nay ſuch bleſſings as neither you nor your fathers before you could either purchaſe or enjoy, their waxed boots; and this leads me to the ſecond thing conſiderable:</p>
            <p>The condition of the times, <hi>They are bad, dangerous, uncertain and wavering, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the times be bad now, what will they be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Beloved, Man is a little world, the world is round, and ſo are we; the world is an hollow and empty thing, ſo are we; the world hath his times and ſeaſons, his Winters and and Summers, his Dayes and Nights, ſo hath man; he hath times of gettings, and his times of loſings; his Sommers of pleaſure, and his Winters of heavineſs; his Dayes of joy, and his Nights of ſorrow: Seeing then all theſe ſub<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unary things are thus tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and wavering, let us lay hold of whatſoever ſtands before us, let us take all things that comes in our way, furniſhing our ſelves cape-a-pee, with the goods of the ungodly, implyed in theſe words, <hi>Therefore plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ye, &amp;c.</hi> and this brings me to the third Motive that ſhould perſwade, or rather invite us to do it, <hi>Becauſe the winter appreaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now becauſe the times are bad, and the winter approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, therefore buy ye wax'd Boots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168664:4"/>Beloved, all creatures by natural inſtinct are taught to provide and lay up proviſion againſt Winter; the little Ant ſtacks up Corn; the laborious Bee layes up Honey againſt the cold Winter approaches; and will it not be a ſhame, nay a great ſhame beloved, for man who is a reaſonable creature, and hath more ſtrength and diſcretion then ten thouſand Ants or Bees put them all together; I ſay, Will it not be a moſt abominable ſhame for him to be ſent to the ſilly Ants and Bees for inſtruction, whilſt he like the ſimple Graſhopper hops and skips away the ſummer of his dayes in vanity and idleneſs, and afterwards in the winter of years is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to periſh and ſtarve for want of food? O beloved, rather do any thidg then ſtarve; the Proverb ſaith, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is the mother of miſery, therefore it is good to provide &amp; lay up ſomething againſt a rainy day. Now what ſeaſon is more rainy then the Winter ſeaſon? and what is more ſeaſonable at that time, what better fence in the world for our feet againſt the rain, wet and cold, then a pair of waxed Boots? therefore buy ye if ye have money, plunder ye if ye have none, (for it matters not how you come by them ſo you have them) waxed boots. So now I am come to the fourth and laſt thing, the benefit and uſe we ſhould make of the times: Buy waxed boots, therefore buy ye waxed boots.</p>
            <p>Where note, that the adverb <hi>therefore,</hi> is an adverb of connexion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for here it joins the winter and the boots together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now beloved, ſince I have taken the boots in hand, give me leave to ſtitch them up in few words, telling you firſt how many ſorts of boots there are; and next what manner of boots thoſe be which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red here in my text. For the better explanation of which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168664:4"/>
words, you are to take notice that there are eight ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of boots, I will run over them briefly, becauſe I ſee the time haſtens: I ſay beloved, there are ſeveral ſorts of boots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt your Dutch boots, they are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that will not put on a boot which is not as well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quored as themſelves; from whence I gather this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, That drunken men love drunken boots. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is your French boots; O defie them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, defie them, they are abominably contaminated with the diſeaſe of their countrey; how many whole congregations of ours have they already infected with it? VVitneſs that lamentable ſnivelling and ſnuffling which of late hath ſpread it ſelfe through the bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen Noſes of our ableſt teachers, for which no other reaſon in the world can be given then their riding the Siſters in theſe French Pockey boots: Here by the way give me leave to tell you the ſeveral names of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; Some call it <hi>Morbus Neapolitanus,</hi> and <hi>Morbus Gallicus:</hi> Firſt, it is called the Neapolitan Diſeaſe, or the Diſeaſe of Naples; for it is obſerved by our wiſeſt Phyſicians, that ever ſince Naples commidities came over into England, this diſeaſe hath been very buſie amongſt us. Others ſay it came by another Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an trick, and that it was brought over by advice of Nich. Machavil in a Florence ſil<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Petticoat, under which device it hath continued ever ſince; therefore beloved have a care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how you meddle with forreign VVenches Petticoats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Latit Anguis in herba:</hi> that is that Serpent the Devil lurks in their holes, and the Pox under their Petticoats.</p>
            <p>Next it is called <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> and not unfitly, for <hi>Gallicus</hi> ſignifies a Cock, and <hi>Morbus</hi> a Diſeaſe, that is,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168664:5"/>
as much as to ſay, the Diſeaſe of the cock; and truly it is well known, that the cock is the firſt part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is infected with this diſeaſe: But ſome will ſay, VVhat do you tell us a ſtory of a cock and a bull? VVhy verily beloved, a good cock is a good thing; and bulls leather is good leather to make waxed boots of; which brings me to the third ſort of Leather, your <hi>Ruſha</hi> boots. Fourthly, there is your Spaniſh Leather boots. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, your Calves Leather Eſſex boots. Sixthly, your Slints skin, or abortive Parchment boots. Seventhly, there is your Hell-cart, or Coach-boat. Eighthly and laſtly, there is your right Engliſh Neats. Leather boot, which is the boot intended here in my text for the VVinter waxed boot: <hi>Now becauſe the times are bad,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So now having ſhewn you how many ſeveral ſorts of boots there are, give me leave likewiſe to ſhew you how to diſtinguiſh the good from the bad, (becauſe I will not warrant all of our Profeſſion to be honeſt men, ſince I know ſome who can ſtretch their conſciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Laſt or their Leather) therefore that you may not be deceived in your choice of a perfect win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter boot, you are to obſerve theſe four qualities.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Grain of the Boot.</item>
               <item>2. The length of the Boot.</item>
               <item>3. The well joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; ſowing of the Boot.</item>
               <item>4. The waxing of the Boot.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt' the Grain of the boot; beloved, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Grains, there are your Grains of Corn,

your Grains of Muſtard-ſeed, your Beer and Malt Grains, &amp;c. Next there is your good and Phyſical Grains. Thirdly, there is your <hi>Granum vivens ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> your living ſenſible Grains, (of which ſort I fear here are too many in this Congregation) that is, your Knaves in Grain. And laſtly, there is your Leather Grain, (the principal here intended) which if it be cloſe and compact, ſtiff and ſhining, you may be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (of the firſt thing obſervable) that your Leather is good.</p>
            <p>The next thing conſiderable, is the joyning and well ſowing of the boot; By joyning, you are to underſtand the even cutting and proportioning of the tops to the upper part, and the vampings to the lower part of the legs of the boots. This properly belongeth to the Maſter, but the other of ſowing or ſtitching belongs to his Servant. Now in ſowing or ſtitching, you are to take notice, that you are not to ſowe boots as you ſowe Corn, (in which he is accounted the beſt workman who ſcatters and diſperſeth his grain beſt) but you muſt ſowe your ſtitches cloſe together, firſt on the inſide, next on the outſide, if ever you mean to have your Boots go thorow ſtitch, and hold out water when the Winter comes, and the wayes are heavy and durty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, look to the length of your boots; Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a long boot hath theſe commodities. Firſt, it will keep warm, and cover that which hath covered many a Commodity. Next it will preſerve you from fretting and galling between the legs, (a diſeaſe which many a dear Siſter is troubled with, proceeding from the ſame cauſe though in a different manner) the man by hard riding, to the woman by being too hard ridden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168664:6"/>A third commodity belonging to long boots is this; that if the vampings fail, the leather ſhrinks, or the ſeames crack, yet they may be often mended, and the boots ſtill do good ſervice, which reaſon alone (if the two former are not prevalent) are enough to perſwade you to buy long waxed boots.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, you muſt obſerve the waxing of the boot, in which you are to take notice, firſt of the matter, wax; and next of the manner, how to wax your winter boots.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the matter wax: Beloved there are three ſeveral ſorts of wax. Hard wax, ſoft wax, and <hi>Bees</hi>-wax. The firſt is uſed for letters, the ſeond for Bonds or Indentures: But ſoft here, me thinks I here ſome one amongſt you object and ſay, If ſoft wax be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed for Indentures, why may it not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be uſed for ſuch boots as we commonly make Indentures in, when you and I, (and many more here amongſt us) come late home from Taverns and Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling houſes? To this I anſwer, that ſuch boots ought rather to be termed <hi>Dutch</hi> liquored-boots, than waxed boots; ſince the head and the feet do ever ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize, ſo as the one cannot properly be ſaid to be full of liquor, except the other bear a ſhare with it alſo. I rather believe theſe boots are made of ſome Horſes skin that died of the ſtaggers.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt ſort of wax, is <hi>Bees</hi>-wax, the only wax you are to uſe for your winter boots; ah but you will ſay, how ſhall I uſe this wax that you ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of for winter boots: why, you muſt know that this wax in the waxing of boots is not to be uſed ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but compounded with hard tallow, which brings
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168664:6"/>
me to the laſt thing you are to obſerve, that is, the manner of waxing your winter boot. Beloved, you are firſt to melt hard tallow with this wax, then you are to annoint and chaſe in theſe ingredients by a good fire, at three ſeveral times, becauſe once or twice will not be enough, by reaſon of the drineſs of the new boot, which will ſoak up the firſt and ſecond time, whatſoever you lay upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay therefore you muſt do it at leaſt three ſeveral times, if you mean to have a perfect and ſure well waxed winter boot.</p>
            <p>So having now run in my boots through all the parts of my Text, and taken pains to give you many weighty reaſons why you ought all of you to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide of waxed boots. Firſt becauſe of the times, they are bad. Secondly, dangerous. Thirdly, uncertain. Fourthly, <hi>The Winter approacheth, &amp;c.</hi> Next alſo I have given you Obſervations and Inſtructions, that you may not be deceived in your choice of a winter boot, but may eaſily diſcover it; Firſt by the grain, Secondly, by the well ſoweing. Thirdly, by the length: Fourthly, and laſtly, by the waxing; and alſo taught you the ſeveral Sorts of Wax, and how in what manner you ſhould wax your wintered Boots. Give me leave out of the former part of the Text, to raiſe this Doctrine: That,</p>
            <p>Bad times require good boots. I ſay bad times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire good boots: becauſe the times are bad, and the Winter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall explain my ſelf to you brethren, briefly thus. I ſay, bad times require good boots; for verily beloved, the times are bad, very bad, and are like every day, for ought I ſee, to grow worſe and worſe; ſo as I fear, we muſt all of us
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168664:7"/>
e're long, be forced to fly for our Religion. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, whither ſhall we fly? Marry 'tis a Queſtion worth your anſwering, but I doubt there are few or none here, that know how to reſolve me in it; for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I am as yet to ſeek my ſelf, where to run or hide my head, ſhould the malignant party prevail. But perhaps, ſome will cry out and ſay, we will fly to <hi>New England,</hi> another he is for <hi>Geneva,</hi> another he is for a nearer place then both theſe, he wil away to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Truely beloved, I muſt confeſſe, I cannot but approve of this place for the beſt, being it is not only the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but the ſafeſt, and hath ever in former times, been found to be the only Nurſe and Sanctuary, for all ſuch as are like them, Diſpiſers of Royal Government, and Self-forms of Prayers.</p>
            <p>But here will one object, and ſay. Is not this an Iſland wherein we now live, (I had almoſt ſaid where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we now dwell, but alas! if the times change, here will be no habitation for us:) and is not this Iſland en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed round with a great Sea, will not all our ſhipping then be taken from us, how then ſhall we get over to <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> or what good then will our wax'd boots do us?</p>
            <p>Beloved; this weak Objection, is eaſily anſwered thus. 'Tis true, that <hi>England</hi> is an Iſland encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Sea. 'Tis true, there will be no travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of it by Land, and it will likely prove as true, (if the wicked prevail) that our Navy will be taken from us. But O thou inconſiderate fool! whoſoever thou art that raiſeſt this idle objection,) haſt thou not the more need of waxed boots to paſſe through this Sea? haſt thou not great and rough Waters to wade over, before
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168664:7"/>
thou canſt arrive at thy Journeys end? Now if thy boots be long enough, (which as I told you before; you muſt be ſure to obſerve, before you buy them for this purpoſe) and the Seams ſtrong and well-waxed, ſo as they will hold out water, which you ought firſt to make tryal of, by wading in them over the <hi>Thames,</hi> from the Parliament-ſtairs to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> or from <hi>White Hall</hi> to <hi>Stangate,</hi> (for one of theſe wayes we muſt all fly if the Cavaliers prevail) you need not be afraid afterward to go over with them, to any part beyond the Seas. So as methinks, this alſo ſhould be another ſtrong motive, to perſwade us to buy ſtrong and long waxed boots.</p>
            <p>But here ſome incredulous and fearful brother, will make a ſcruple, and ſay: ſhould we grant you, that it may be poſſible for us, to paſſe over the Sea in waxed boots; yet how ſhall we do now the Winter is come on, the days ſhort, but the Night and our Journeys very dark and long? I ſay, how ſhall we doe in theſe diſmal and obſcure nights, to find our way, through ſo pathleſſe and uncertain an Element as the Sea is?</p>
            <p>O beloved be not diſmayed, be not caſt down with fear! take you no care for that. Have we not a good and glorious General gon before us, and with the beams of his bright ſhining Countenance, will like the Sun, diſperſe thoſe dark ſhades that doth cover the Waters. He is our Leader, our Guide by day, and our Lamp by night, who hath carried a living fire in the Lanthorn of his beak; which neither the higheſt Winds can put out, nor the greateſt Waves extinguiſh, becauſe it will ever continue the ſame, ſo long as the Splendor of it endureth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:168664:8"/>But we will leave generals, and come to particulars, for I fear I have been too tedious in illuſtrating this Doctrine, wherefore I will only paſſe to an uſe or two, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>The firſt is an uſe of conſolation or comfort. Is it ſo, That waxed boots will preſerve us from the cold; is it ſo that with waxed boots, we may paſſe through thick and thin; Nay, through Seas of Troubles, why, what a great comfort and conſolation is it, for all thoſe who have occaſion to travail through bad and ſad ways, to be provided of waxed boots. Beloved, there are (as I ſhewed you before) your Summer and your Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter boots. In the one you may travail reaſonably well, all the yeer long, provided your ways, and the journey be accordingly. As for example: If you have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ride your <hi>Newmarket</hi> ways, your <hi>Banſted Down</hi> wayes, your <hi>Tiptry Heath</hi> wayes, or your <hi>Salisbury plain</hi> wayes, then theſe Summer boots will carry you through; theſe will preſerve you well enough, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no raine from above, or durt, mire, and waters from beneath, do not offend or moleſt you. But ſhould you have occaſion in the Winter time to travel, your <hi>Eſſex</hi> wayes, your <hi>Dunmow</hi> wayes, your <hi>High Suffolk, Farningham Caſtle</hi> wayes, or thoſe moſt abominable dirty, miry, and watry <hi>Wiſhbeech,</hi> or <hi>Ely Fenny</hi> wayes; O in what a fine caſe would your Summer boots be, when they have been well waſhed in thoſe filthy ways. How will they ſhrink together like parchment againſt the Fire. Therefore buy you waxed boots.</p>
            <p>And this puts me in mind of a merry, but a real ſtory, that I have heard from a credible perſon, who I am confident would not tell an untruth, of a certain
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168664:8"/>
young Gentleman, living not far from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> who was a Suiter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to a fair Lady, dwelling at <hi>Cholcheſter</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Now this young Gallant, having never before, travelled five miles from his Fathers Houſe, (imagined the ſame the Citizens Wife did, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never in her life time been out of <hi>London,</hi> would needs perſwade her Husband, that though ſhe had but twenty miles to ride, and it was a rainy day, yet they two might ride ſafe and dry all the way, under the Penthouſes:) So this ſpruce Blade, thinking all the World was heath ground, though it was in the depth of Winter, and his man perſwaded him to put on his Winter boots, he would not go thither in any but a pair of thin Calves leather <hi>Eſſex</hi> boots, alledging this reaſon for it, That he new his Miſtreſſe would love him the better, when ſhe ſee he came to court her, in a pair of her own Country boots. Whereupon, he ſets forward on his Journey; but mark Beloved what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; he had not gone above half his way, before he took ſuch an exceſſive cold on his Feet, that he was forced to alight at a poor blind Alehouſe, at a place called <hi>Black Chappel,</hi> within three miles of <hi>Dunmow,</hi> where he had no ſooner got a fire made, and his boots (which hung about him like Chitterlins, with much adoe pulled of) but he fell into a violent Ague, and was immediately compelled to take his bed, where he remained many days after. But I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that the poor Alehouſe Keeper, where this Gentleman lay ſick, did keep in his houſe a young water Spaniel, which he had newly taught to fetch and carry; this wanton unlucky Whelp, ſeeking about the houſe in the midſt of the Night, for ſome bones to eat,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168664:9"/>
lights upon the Gentlemans boots, which he no ſooner meets with, but being deſirous to put in practiſe, what his Maſter had ſo lately taught him, he takes firſt one boot, and afterwards another, and carryes them into the entry: where finding them wet and ſoft, inſtead of playing the Cur, falls to tearing them, and in ſhort time pulled and knawed them into many peices. Now it chanced, that in the morning early, before it was light, the Old mans Wife (who alſo dreſſed tripes for to get a living) was called up by a Butcher, who brought her ſome inwards of a Beaſt fot the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which ſhe had no ſooner received, but returning back through the entry, ſhe unhappily ſtumbled upon the Gentlemans mangled boots, ſo as letting fall what ſhe had in her hands upon them, groping in the dark, ſhe took up all together, and carrying them into the Kitchin, (without lighting a Candle) firſt cut, and then waſhed and dreſſed them all together, and having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards well boyled the boots, amongſt the reſt in a Kettle, which over night ſhe had ſet over the fire for the ſame purpoſe, ſhe caſt them into her ſowcing Tub, where for a while we will leave them, and tell you what become of our ſick Gentleman. Beloved, this Gentleman within few days after, began to recover, and waxed very hungry, ſo as calling his Landlord, to know what meat he had in the Houſe; Truely Sir (quoth he) we have nothing but a diſh of Tripes of my Wives one dreſſing, which if you pleaſe to have, they ſhall be made ready immediately. Well! well they are accepted of, and brought to the Gentleman, who ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up in his bed, did feed heartily, till ſuch time as taking up a piece of thin, long, lean Tripe (as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168664:9"/>
and finding a ſtring jagged about the edge of one ſide of it, he called up his Landlady, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know what part of the beaſt that was? the Poor woman ſearching it, and diſtruſting what it was, but not dreaming how it ſhould come there, without ſpeaking one word, runs down Stairs into the Kitchin, where ſhe was no ſooner come to ſearch for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans boots, ſhe finds the puppy dog tearing of the Vampings, which he had lately transformed them into Slippers. In the mean time the Gentleman would not be ſatisfied, but calls for her again to anſwer his queſtion, who as ſoon as ſhe was come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he again demands of her, what part of the inſide of the beaſt that was, he held in his hand. The poor woman, though fearful and trembling, yet wittily replyed, that ſhe beleived it to be rather a part of the out-ſide, then the in-ſide of the beaſt, meaning the hide, and begging pardon for her carle<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſſe, and the dogs wantonneſſe, deſired his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to forgive them both, telling him plainly, that that peece he ſhewed her, was a peece of his worſhips boots, and that the threads, that looked like a purl or edging upon the tripe, was nothing but the jags of the Shoomakers ends which hung about it. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at this accident, one while laughing, and another while fretting, cauſed the old man to ride away ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> for a ſtrong pair of waxed boots, but what with his delay, (by reaſon of his ſickneſſe, and afterwards for want of boots) to viſit his Miſtris, whom he promiſed to have ſeen a week before;) ſhe imputing his long ſtay, rather to a neglect and ſlighting of her, than his preſent misfortune, immediately contracted her ſelf to another, who had formerly been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168664:10"/>
a Servant to her, and at his coming diſcarded him, by which means he loſt his Miſtris, his labour, his boots, and had like to have loſt his life too, had he not happily recovered.</p>
            <p>O beloved! let this ſad example be a Caveat for all you who have Miſtreſſes, to have a care of wearing Tripes, when you ride a wooing, leaſt you be ſerved like this infortunate Gentleman, who for want of a pair of waxed boots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was firſt caſt into an Ague, next had his boots caſt into the Tripe tub; and laſtly, was himſelf quite and clean caſt out of his Miſtreſſes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Therefore buy ye waxed boots; which brings me to the ſecond uſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond uſe is an uſe of Reproof; to reprove all thoſe who are ſelf-willed, and cannot fairly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to buy them waxed boots. But to ſuch as theſe, examples move more than precepts, wherefore I will only give you one or two more, and ſo I will make an end, for fear of tiring your patience. I read of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that paſſing over a River in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> without his Winter boots, he took ſuch an extreme Cold in his Feet, that he ſuddenly fell ſick of a violent Feaver, and within four dayes after dyed at <hi>Babylon.</hi> The like I find in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Lives, of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Roman <hi>Sextorius,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Homer</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that leaving his boots behind him, and comming bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot into the Temple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> whileſt he was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on his knees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at her Altar, he was peirced into the Heel, with a venom'd Dart by <hi>Paris,</hi> (the part only of him which was vulnerable,) of which he ſuddenly dyed, which accident had never happened to him, (as <hi>Alexander Roſſe,</hi> that little <hi>Scotch</hi> Mithologiſt obſerves)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168664:10"/>
had he not two days before, pawned his boots to <hi>Uliſſes,</hi> and ſo was forced to come without them to the <hi>Trojan</hi> Sacrifice. He alſo further obſerves, that that <hi>Achilles</hi> (of whom <hi>Homer</hi> hath writ ſuch wonders) was but a Shoomakers boy of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that when <hi>Uliſſes</hi> ſought him out, he at laſt found him at the Diſtaffe, ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Shoomakers thread; now this Boy was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that as ſoon as it was reported abroad, that the Oracle had choſen him to rule the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Troy,</hi> all the Journeymen in the Country, liſted themſelves under him, and theſe were the Mermydons wherewith he got all his Honor, and overcame the <hi>Trojans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need I mention forraign ſtories, being my ſelf an Eye-witneſſe of the lamentable ends many <hi>Suffolk</hi> men, in the Seige of <hi>Cholcheſter,</hi> who being forced to keep Centry in that wet and boggy Country, (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Seige, it was generally obſerved for thirteen weeks, not a day paſſed, in which much rain did not fall) I ſay theſe poor Country Wretches, were forced to ſtand up to the kneesday and night, in Cold, Dirt, Mire, and Wet; inſomuch, that for want of waxed boots, many of them dyed ſuddenly, others had their Legs rotted off; many their feet gangreened, and after was cut off; and few or none, but had Ulcers, Boyls, and Iuflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, breaking out upon them.</p>
            <p>Alas! alas! what would theſe poor Cripples do to run away, ſhould the Times change, and the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants prevail over us? How muſt they be forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir their Stumps for want of Legs, to eſcape the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? This one comfort they will have above us, that whenſoever they are taken by the Wicked, they will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168664:11"/>
not find them ſtand complementing, or making legs for pardon; but they ſhall rather find them down upon their Knees, begging mercy and forgiveneſſe of them, whoſe perſons they have turned out of their poſſeſſions, and whoſe houſes theſe lame Creatures, have for theſe many yeers, converted into Spittles and Hoſpitals.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn you what became of three great Princes, and of many poor <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who periſh'd in theſe late Wars, for want of waxed boots. I ſhould here give you an account, how and in what manner, you ſhould know the right ſhape and faſhion of a Winter boot: and likewiſe ſhew you, what manner of Heels are the beſt, the moſt ſuitable and ſerviceable for you againſt running or flying times, I ſhall only name them at preſent. Beloved, your Polony heel is good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Wooden heels better, but thoſe of Corke the beſt of all; for then will it be needful for you to make trial of a pair of High heels, and indeed you will then, and then only, have occaſion to run, as though you ran for a wager; and for this uſe, your Corke heels are found by experience to be the beſt and higheſt in the World.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I ſhould have taught you the art of repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſtitching, vamping, underlaying, and mending of your boots, and ſhould likewiſe have ſhewed you how to chooſe the Soles of your boots; and alſo in a word have applyed theſe things to the good uſe of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but that I ſee the Glaſſe is run<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the time hath prevented me, I muſt be forced to make an end, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the words of my Text, <hi>Now becauſe the times are bad, and Winter draws neer, therefore buy you Waxed Boots.</hi>
