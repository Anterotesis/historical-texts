            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether this <hi>Psalm</hi> was written by
<hi>Moses,</hi> as the Jewish <hi>Rabbins</hi> think,
or by some other Prophet, or why
this <hi>Psalm</hi> with four and twenty more
is destitute of a Title, when all the
rest have suitable Inscriptions, is not
material to enquire. The <hi>Psalm</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a rehearsal of Gods Wonderful Works in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
when he went before his People in the Wilderness,
when God wrought Miracles every hour, and the Cloudy
Pillar by Day, and the other of Fire by Night, like a
Guardian Angel protected the Mighty Host, and rendred
them formidable to all Nations that heard of their
Name, or had notice of their Approaches; or, we may
call it a Spur to fervent Devotion, and profound Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of the infinite Majesty of Heaven, who never
leaves such Devotional Prostrations unrewarded; and if
sincere, crowns them usually with loving Kindnesses
and tender Mercies: Instances whereof are given in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> Men who by their Prayers bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49763:3"/>
the Heavens, and made God come down, and as it
were forced the Almighty into pity, and compassion by
their Supplications.</p>
            <p>To excite our Attention, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> begins his
Hymn with an expression great, and lofty, becoming
the Supream Being, and worthy of an Infinite Majesty;
In a few words he gives us the best Description of Gods
<hi>Providence,</hi> that reason can desire, and there could be
nothing more magnificent, than to say of him, <hi>The Lord
reigneth, let the People tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which will oblige me to deviate, or vary a little
from the received Translation, is the ambiguity of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Original, which we render <hi>tremble.</hi>
The word in other places of Scripture stands for <hi>being
tumultuous,</hi> or <hi>in a rage, inconfusion,</hi> or <hi>in great disorder,</hi>
and this signification seems to me to be most proper here,
and to render the sense much clearer, and if you ask me,
what that sense is, I shall deliver it in this <hi>Preposition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Propos. <hi>In the midst of the greatest tumults and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
the Divine Providence is awake; In the midst
of the most lamentable confusions, Gods management
of things is orderly, and regular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This must necessarily be the Result of the Text, if
we Construe the words according to the Interpretation
I have given, and the words will naturally bear,</hi> viz.
The Lord reigneth, let the People in a Commonwealth, or
Kingdom be never in so great disorder, or confusion; even
then, when all things seem to be turned upside down, the
Lord reigns by his Providence.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> fancy that God is asleep,
when things go contrary to our Carnal Wishes, and
fond Expectations, we that enjoy Gods Revelations are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49763:3"/>
better taught; And though the vast Ship of this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
World were sinking, we have reason to believe,
that the great Pilot who sits at the Helm, is broad awake,
and hath pregnant Reasons for the Dispensation. It's a
weak Argument, that God is careless, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pry into the Reasons of his Actions; nor can the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
be less than Childish; to conclude that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
enjoys his ease, regardless of things below, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our selves are not Omniscient; We could not be
Creatures if we were so, and should lose our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon the God above, if our Wisdom did equal his,
or could know all the depths of his Actions.</p>
            <p>Yet so great is his goodness, that he hath not left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without Witness, and as mysterious as his goings in
the Sanctuary seem to be, he hath let his Servants know
the Order of his Providence. So great an advantage
are the Scriptures, that while <hi>Pagans,</hi> like Moles, grovel
in the Earth, unable to apprehend what is done above;
We like Children of Light, can unfold Gods darker
Proceedings, and inform the World of the equality of
his Ways.</p>
            <p>When the ten Tribes revolted, and shook off their
obedience to their Liege Lord <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> we may easily
guess what disorders the <hi>Jewish</hi> Commonwealth then
laboured under, and what confusions that juncture of
Affairs produced. <hi>Judah</hi> fought against <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
against <hi>Judah,</hi> and in both Parties without all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
were Discontented Men, who added Fewel to
the Fire, and threw Brimstone into the Flame to make
it soar the higher; yet while the Republick lies in that
Convulsion-fit, God dispatches a Prophet to the Tribe
of <hi>Judah, Shemaiah</hi> by Name, with order to tell them,
1 <hi>Kings 12. 24. Thus saith the Lord, ye shall not go up,
nor fight against your Brethren the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49763:4"/>
every man to his own house, for this thing is from me;
i. e.</hi> Let no Man wonder at these Disorders, for I have
a Hand in them, and my Providence doth manage
them; And to this purpose, <hi>Amos</hi> brings in God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Am. 3. 6. Is there any evil, i. e.</hi> any evil of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
in the City, <hi>and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> This,
even <hi>Jehoram,</hi> as wicked as he was, could not but be
sensible of, and therefore when in the great Famine of
<hi>Samaria</hi> People were ready to devour one another, and
things were come to that extremity, that Women fell a
dressing their own Children for their Dinner, the King
desperate and melancholick, cries out, <hi>This evil is of the
Lord, i. e.</hi> How dismal soever the state of things appears,
the Almighty hath given order for it, and it's he, whose
Power and Wisdom manages this Calamity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this Subject will require some elucidation, and
therefore I shall consider here,</hi> 1. What those Disorders,
and Confusions are, which seem to infer a carelesness of
Providence. 2. Why God suffers, and permits such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
and Disorders. 3. How his Providence appears in
them, and which way he manages these seeming Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
            <p>1. What these Disorders and Confusions are, which seem
to infer a carelesness of Providence.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Oppression of the Innocent and Poor,</hi> such as we find
among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of <hi>Amos</hi> and <hi>Jeremy, Am. 6.
12. c. 8. 6. Jer.</hi> 7. 6. And no doubt a dismal sight it is,
to see the Rich invade the Poors little all without control,
and Great Men crush those of an Inferiour Rank by their
lawless Power; to see <hi>Ahab</hi> take possession of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s
Vineyard; and <hi>Ziba</hi> because in favour with the King,
wrong the lame and harmless <hi>Mephibosheth;</hi> to see the
<hi>Widdow</hi> scorn'd, because she hath no Potent Friends; and
the <hi>Orphan</hi> trampled on, because his injurious Adversary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49763:4"/>
can out-Bribe him; to see a <hi>Jeremy</hi> thrown into a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
because he speaks the truth; and a <hi>Daniel</hi> hurled
into a Lyons Den, because he cannot conform to the
looser Customes of the <hi>Persian</hi> Court; to see an <hi>Aristides</hi>
driven into Exile, because of his Justice, and an <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>
deposed from his Office, because the rash <hi>Lysander</hi>
lost the Field. Oppression as it is enough to make even
a Wise Man mad, according to <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 7. 7. so
it is an Argument, that Justice hath forsaken the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal;
and without Justice, Human Societies become
Cages of Ravenous Birds, and the Band, which is to
hold Mankind together, must necessarily be dissolved.
It's this maintains the health and vigour of the Body
Politick, and this once taken away, must on the
other side cast it into violent Distempers; Distempers
which render it not only weak, but deformed and odious,
and must at last be the Death of it. It's this whereby
God intended Kingdoms, and Cities should be governed,
and Men no sooner receive their being, but at the same
time receive the Principles of this Vertue. Nature
obliges them to it, as much as it doth to self preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and with their Mothers Milk they imbibe these
Inclinations; and on these Inclinations the wholesom
Laws of all Nations are grounded; and whatever Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are contriv'd by Wise men for the well governing
of Societies, do all go upon this supposition. Nay,
God himself is concerned to see this Justice maintained
in Commonwealths, and it is part of his Prerogative
to preserve its Laws inviolable, so that it's being lost in
a Corporation, seems to reflect upon him; and as it
was he alone, that first taught Men to gather into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
so to let Oppression come among them, which
is the Bane, that kills them, to a sensual Eye seems to
be no small disparagement to his Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49763:5"/>
2. Such another Disorder is, when <hi>a Covetous, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Prince is suffered to spoil and harrass the Countrey
of his Neighbour Prince, who is at Peace with him,</hi> and
<hi>not so much as dreams of any Hostile Approaches,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof we have in <hi>Benhaded,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other cause but that of Interest, and his own
glory, fell upon <hi>Baashah</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> being in League
with him, and surprizing his Territories, plundered,
and made himself Master of <hi>Ijon,</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Abel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi>
and <hi>all the Store-cities</hi> of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> 2 Chron. 16.
3, 4. A strange way of War! to fall upon his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
for no other reason, but because he is more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and to deprive the other of his Right and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
because he is too weak and feeble to oppose him:
To fancy because I have got a numerous Army, that
therefore I may do what I list; and because I can be
more wicked than another, that therefore I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be so. To imagine because I am a King, that
therefore I am exempt from all Laws, and because
there is no Man above me, that therefore I may crush
whomsoever I have a mind to, to flatter my self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God hath advanced my Throne above other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
that therefore the rest must be my Vassals, and
because they cannot easily resist me, that therefore I may
make them fall a Sacrifice to my Lust and Glory. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
monstrous and odious, even to <hi>Pagans</hi> and Infidels!
and which deserve not only the sharpest Satyrs, but
Gods severest Vengeance: We look upon <hi>Joab</hi> as a
Villain, because he killed <hi>Amasa</hi> Kissing, and <hi>David</hi>
justly called him the worst of Men, because he Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<hi>Abner</hi> under pretence of Friendship, and shed the
Blood of War in Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Ninus</hi> takes what he can get, because his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are unarmed: and <hi>Sesostris</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> discontented
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49763:5"/>
that he hath so little, makes even his Familiars a prey
to his Ambition: Actions which in Private Men would
be punished with the Hangmans Sword, and in Persons
of a lower Condition, revenged with the most exquisite
Racks and Tortures; Yet it is not Power, can justifie a
Sin, nor the greatness of a Man turn a Vice into Vertue.
Robbery is a Crime in a Prince as much as in a Subject,
and stealing other Mens Goods the greater injustice in a
King, by how much he stands higher, than other Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
No Prince hath power to act against the Law of
Nature, and what is intrinsically Evil, can never be
made Good by the most specious pretences of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Princes that are given to such injustice are Enemies
of Mankind, and no marvel, if the Disorders they cause
in the neighbouring Dominions are astonishing, for the
Sin it self is prodigious. That which amazes the
Spectator more, is, that such Unrighteousness very often
prospers, and the Disorders it causes, tends to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
and splendour of the Perfidious Conquerer, for
it makes him not only more adored by Parasites, and
Flatterers at home, who call him, <hi>Great, Invincible,</hi> and
a <hi>Demy-God,</hi> but formidable to Nations afar off, which
like innocent Animals, at the approach of the Ravenous
Hawk, quake as the Rumour spreads of his speedy,
though treacherous Victory; A Scene of Affairs, which
Providence seems to suffer in, and while he, in whose
Hands the Hearts of Princes are said to be, lets loose the
Reins, and suffers them to do what they list, Men guided
by sense can suspect no less, than that the Lord doth not

Nation breaking into Factions, imbrue their hands in one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49763:6"/>
anothers Blood, and thrust their Swords into one anothers
Bowels, as the</hi> Midianites, <hi>Jud.</hi> 7. 22. When Neighbour
fights with Neighbour, and those of a Mans own House
prove his greatest Enemies; when Members of the same
Commonwealth first run into Discontents among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and thence into open Hostility one against the
other; when different Parties first give one another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
Names, from reproachful Names come to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities,
and feed their Envy and Malice so long till it
break forth into a consuming Fire. There is hardly
any Nation but some time or other hath felt the smart
of these Intestine Divisions; and if any have escaped the
blow, it must be, because there was nothing in the
Country worth contending for. How many Mens lives
were lost at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Contentions betwixt <hi>Marius</hi>
and <hi>Sylla,</hi> betwixt <hi>Catilines</hi> Party, and the <hi>Senate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> every School-boy knows, that

Disputes at <hi>Thebes,</hi> betwixt <hi>Ismenias</hi> and <hi>Archias,</hi>

Civil War, that set <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi>

To see Men Drunk with their Prosperous Fortunes,
and angry with their own Happiness; To see them fall
foul one upon another, and they that might live in ease
and safety, like Mad Dogs bite and devour one another;
To see them enraged one against another upon a <hi>punctilio</hi>
of State, and as if their Lives were nothing worth,
throw them away because both Parties cannot be of the
same Judgment; To see them not only begin their
Quarrels upon slight Occasions, but pursue them unto
Death and Ruine, as it is an Argument of intolerable
Pride and Self-conceitedness, so it's like, the careless
Spectator, that sees the Tremendous Effects of it, will
wonder, what's become of Providence in such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Massacres:</hi> When the true Religion is persecuted,
as a Pestilent Heresy, and mighty Endeavours are used
to Extirpate its Renown and Glory: when Fire and
Faggot become Arguments to confute it, and Swords
and the Gallows are made use of as the only Syllogisms
to batter its Fortifications: when it is not only contemned
and derided, but the Professors of it severely handled,
and those that dare be so bold as to own it, put to most
cruel Torments: when the Floods of Ungodliness
threaten to overwhelm it, and the Malice of Men rises
to that height, that nothing will serve their turn, but
its Ruine and Destruction. Such was the <hi>Massacre</hi> of
the <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when to live up to the Law
of <hi>Moses,</hi> was present Death, and to observe Gods Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
the readiest way to be Tortured, when to believe
in one God was to be broken on the Wheel; and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<hi>Idolatry</hi> involved the Votary in the danger of most
barbarous Usage. Thus was the true Religion treated
in the first ten Persecutions by the Heathen <hi>Emperours,</hi>
when to have a Bible in the House, and to be thrown
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49763:7"/>
to the Lyons was all one, and not to offer Incense to
the Heathen Gods, was cause enough to be torn in pieces
by Bears and Tygers; when Multitudes of Christians
were driven like so many Sheep to the Slaughter, and
the Hangmen were sooner tired with Executing, than
the Professours of Christ's Doctrine with the variety of
their Tortures. Thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> dealt with
the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> from the Year of Our Lord
1334. to 1340. and upward, when those innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for contradicting the Corruptions of that Church,
were hurled into the Fire; and not to be subject to the
Pope in his unlawful Decrees, was counted as bad as
Witchcraft; when Flames were the Portion of Men,
that would not believe a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and a Dungeon
the Reward of adhering close to the Oracles of the Holy
Ghost.</p>
            <p>Such was the Massacre at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1572.
when in one Night many thousands were Murther'd
for no other reason, but because they were Protestants:
and vast numbers of Men and Women Murthered like
Beasts, because they would make the Bible the only
Rule of their Faith and Manners, when at <hi>Rome</hi> they
triumphed at the Inhumane Fact, and like the <hi>Jews,</hi>
thought they had done God Service by sacrificing the
lives of his Servants to their Rage and Malice. This
was the lot of the Protestants in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Year 1641.
when 200000 of them were destroy'd to make the Popish
Clergy sport, and Men that professed themselves to be
of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church out-did <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Cannibals</hi>
in their Cruelty; when the more Protestants a Papist
killed, the more he Merited, and might tell the Pearls
of his Crown in Heaven, not by his Beads, but by the
number of <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples, which as he thought, he had
sent to Hell, and offered to the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49763:7"/>
If God takes care of any thing, thinks the sensual Man,
it must be of the true Religion, this we must conceive
to be his Darling, and if he hath more tender Affections
for one thing than another, this we must suppose is the
chief Object of his sollicitude: This makes most for his
Honour, and his Glory is advanced by nothing so much
as by true, and genuine Worship; This therefore he
must be thought to mind and cherish most, and to look
upon with the kindest Aspect: But to see this Jewel
scorned, derided, affronted, and its lustre darkened by
Clouds of Ignorance and Malice: To see this Pearl bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
shattered, and the dust of it dispersed into the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
corners of the Earth: To see its Foes live great,
and those that touch this Apple of his Eye, brave it in
their pleasures: To see them erect their Throne on the
Necks of Gods Servants, and securely trample on these
supposed Favourites of Heaven; what can we conclude,
but that either this is not the true Religion, or that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
is careless, and supine in its Protection?</p>
            <p>5. Such another Disorder is, <hi>Base and contemptible mens
climbing up to the Thrones of Kings, and displacing the
true Owners, and usurping their Authority;</hi> When the
vilest of Men are advanced to Royalty, and they that
were but Subjects a little before, come to sit in their Lords
Tribunal: vvhen Persons of the Dregs of the People
get up to the highest Povver, and they that vvere but
Scum before, come to svvim like Oyl on the top, and
throvv dovvn Gods Anointed; when a <hi>Jeroboam</hi> from
Surveyor of the Kings Works, rises up to be King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and a <hi>Zimri</hi> that dvvelt in a Cottage before, comes
to possess himself of the Royal Palace.</p>
            <p>Such vvas the sudden advance of the Famous or rather
Infamous <hi>Massinello,</hi> vvho from a Fisherman, in a day or
tvvo comes to be a Prince, and from mending of Nets,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49763:8"/>
in a Weeks time is advanced to be more than <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>
of <hi>Naples,</hi> whose contemptible Condition is on a suddain
changed into Adorations, and his Converse with the
meanest of his fellow Subjects, turned into bows and
cringes from the greatest of the People: he that before
had scarce a Dog to attend him, in a few hours is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a Crowd, and receives the Courtships and
Caresses of an incredible Multitude: he that knew little
but Obedience a little before, now Commands Armies,
and from a Slave, comes to give Law to the proudest of
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> They that before would scarce vouchsafe
to look upon him, now are glad of his kinder Smiles:
and his threats, that before were accounted little more
than the noise of a Hound, are now dreaded more than
the Almighties Thunder.</p>
            <p>Such was the prodigious rise of the late Usurper, whose
Crimes, and wonderful Successes in his Bloody Attempts,
have given occasion to the sad Solemnity, and the Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
and Ashes of this Day. A Man, (if it be not
a Crime to call him so, for he outwent Devils in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy)
by whose contrivance the Royal Crown fell
down, and with the Crown the Church, and with the
Church the Nations happiness: a Man, whose Crimes
must be detested while time is measured by the intervals
of Day and Night, and who by his Actions hath fixed
such a blot on Christianity, as perhaps the Tears of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages cannot wipe away: a Man, who in pursuance
of his Dreams was restless, till he saw what the Evil
Spirit had revealed, accomplished; and first poisoned
the Peoples Loyalty, and then made advantage of their
Perfidiousness.</p>
            <p>Who made Religion a Stalking-horse to invade the
Throne, and when he had possessed himself of it, was
more lawless than the Person, whom he pretended to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49763:8"/>
expel for being so; Who forced his way to Greatness
through a thousand lives, and knowing no means to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to it, but injustice in the highest degree, cut down
all the Trees that stopt his Prospect; who made the Bible
subservient to his Sword, and held it in one Hand, that
he might only do greater Execution with the other; who
under a pretence of Liberty, made the Nation a greater
Slave to him than they are in <hi>Turky,</hi> and while he gave
out, that he would set them free, bound them but the
faster in their Shackles: who to reform the Church, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it down to the Ground, and while he made Purity
the Watch-word, brought in darkness greater than the
<hi>Aegyptian;</hi> for he taught Men a new Religion, how they
might be Devout and yet Rob and Steal, and commit
Sacriledge without fear, or Remorse of Conscience:
who in the worst sence became all things to all Men, to
make them all his Prey, and complied with several
Parties, to make them all his Devoted Vassals; who
could weep to deplore the Misfortunes of the Time, while
he was the chief Instrument to bring them in; and cry
out against Monarchy, while nothing less was the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Ambition; who waved the Title of a King
meerly because he saw it was not safe, and seemed Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
thereby the better to compass his dangerous Designs
and Purposes.</p>
            <p>Who to stop the Clamours of the People, did them
right, thereby to wrong his Prince the better: and to
make his Murther Legal, caused him to be condemned
by a Law of his own making: who first promoted the
Parliaments Independency of the King, and then made
himself Independent of their Power: who first gulled
the simpler Party into an opinion of his sanctity, and
when he had done so, wallow'd securely in the shades
of the greatest Villany: who made himself great, by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49763:9"/>
daring to do that, which Heathens would have trembled
at, and so his Glory might be set on the Pillars of Fame,
was content to make <hi>Lucifer</hi> both his <hi>Instrument</hi> and
<hi>General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus lived the proud <hi>Vsurper,</hi> but what is more, died
in his Bed, lamented by the Crew that had served him
in his Sins, disposed of three Kingdoms to his Son, who
wanted besides Right, his Fathers Cunning, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Qualifications; yet he saw his Successor applauded,
and fawned upon by Men that were then in Power,
and had the satisfaction to behold a Man of his own Line
in a probability to carry on his own Usurped Authority,
which was all that a dying Tyrant could desire, and
greater felicity a Man could not possibly aim at, that
believed no other Life, or if he did, could not expect a
share in its Happiness: yet with his Death his Hellish
Laurels did not wither, for his Funeral was Royal, as if it
had not been enough to have lived a King, except he
died so too, and the pomp of his Interrment such, as
attracted the Eyes of the most curious Spectators; Nay,
as after the Storm is past, there remains some agitation
of the Waves, so the Agents of Foreign Princes, that
had dreaded this <hi>Neptunes</hi> Trident, while alive, retained
some awe of his Power after Death, which was the
reason, that with their forced presence they graced his
affected: Funeral: An Accident uncommon, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rare; and if <hi>Asaph</hi> seeing the Prosperity of private
wicked Men, his Feet had almost slipp'd, and he very
near sunk into a slight Opinion, and low thoughts of
Gods Providence, what would he have said, had he seen
Impiety thus publickly honoured, not only in Life, but
in Death, as if Heaven had applauded the <hi>Heroick</hi> Sin,
and loved to bestow Rewards on Men, not only for their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49763:9"/>
great Attempts in Vertue, but for daring to be more
than ordinarily Profane and Impious?</p>
            <p>But as great as these Disorders are, or seem to be,
they are no blemish of Providence, nor doth that Golden
Chain look the less lovely, because all the Links are not
distinctly seen by Men, whose Eyes by staring upon
Sensual Objects, as People that look much on Snow,
have contracted a vicious dimness. And so much will
appear from what we shall propose in the second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Why God suffers such Disorders and Confusions to
happen in Commonwealths or Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>God doth it to punish a Nation or People for their
Sin.</hi> When the Sins of a People are come to a fatal
pitch, and the measure grown full, it's time for God,
by sending such Disorders to lash the generality into
better Manners; not that God doth instigate them to
these Disorders, but it's just with him to withdraw his
restraining Grace, and not to hinder their wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations:
And when the Prop that upholds the House
is Charity, and that Charity is abused, if the Prop be
removed, and the House fall, it's to make the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
sensible of his ingratitude. When Pride and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and fulness of Bread, and its usual Concomitants,
Wantonness and Luxury come once to Rage and Reign,
God justly takes away the Partition that kept the Fire
and Tinder asunder, and then no marvel, if being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and let loose to fall one upon the other, they cause
a Combustion which is not easily quenched.</p>
            <p>When the Body is grown Pletharick, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
abound, the Wise Physician breaths a Vein, and
though the ignorant Spectator thinks he is going to let
out Life, yet it's only to preserve the whole from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing.
God sometimes afflicts a good King for his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49763:10"/>
wicked Peoples sake, so he permitted the Excellent <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
to be Slain, because though himself was one of the
best of Men, yet his Subjects were Hypocritical to a high
degree; and while they seemed to comply with the King
in the true Worship of God, continued Idolaters in
their Hearts: So God suffered the <hi>Martyr of the day</hi> to
fall, because the Nation that lived under his Shadow,
were grown extravagant in their Manners. And that
you may not wonder, how God comes to punish the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and let the Guilty go free, I must answer, That
the Innocent, though seemingly Afflicted, yet lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the Adversity, but only Anticipate Heaven, and
exchange their Temporal for an Everlasting Bliss a few
years sooner, while the Sinners, though seemingly pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous,
suffer signally in the loss of their great <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative;</hi>
for hereupon they must necessarily fall into
confusion, and while they send sometime to the <hi>Vine,</hi>
and sometime to the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> to Reign over them, and
know not where to fix, they at last inconsiderately, yet
by Gods wise Permission, fix upon the <hi>Bramble</hi> for their
Prince, whence Fire comes forth, and either Disperses
or Consumes the giddy Multitude.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God punishes the <hi>People,</hi> for their <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Princes</hi> sake, as he sent a Famine on the Land in
the days of <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 21. 1. because King <hi>Saul</hi>
had committed Perjury, and Slain the <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> And
so he would not depart from his anger against the <hi>Jews,</hi>
because of the Sins of <hi>Manasseh, 2 Kings</hi> 23. 26. where
with he had provoked him to anger: For Kingdoms are
Bodies Politick, whereof Princes are the Heads, and if
either Head or Body be put to streights and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
the design of Providence is fulfilled, which is
resolved, when heinous Offences are committed in the
whole, one principal part should smart for the boldness,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49763:10"/>
that the other may take warning: and though that
which suffers may not be so guilty as the other, yet as
they sympathize together, so its seldom seen but that
they do contract something, or participate of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Corruptions, and consequently, justly share in one
anothers Sufferings: And where the Prince suffers for
the People, though it's confest, the Providence is more
astonishing and surprizing, yet it is more Godlike and
Majestick, and an imitation of the Death of <hi>Jesus,</hi> who
consented to die for the People, that the whole Nation
might not be undone.</p>
            <p>God never punishes a Nation as a Nation, but only in
this present Life; for indeed that relation extends no
farther: when People in the next, come to be judged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great Tribunal, they are not judged as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but as single Persons; for every one shall give an
account of himself to God; and therefore if God Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stises
a Nation as a Nation, it is only in this World,
and if in such Chastisements, either the generality or
some Principal Members suffer, its enough to answer the
design of the Divine Equity, which is to let the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
see his displeasure against the cursed thing that is in
the midst of them; so that in this case, the Almighty
uses a kind of <hi>Decimation,</hi> he being too pitiful, and too
great a lover of Humane Societies to destroy every
individual, especially in Ample Commonwealths, <hi>wherein
are more than Sixscore thousand Persons, that cannot
discern between their right hand and their left,</hi> Jon. 4. 11.
But,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>As in all these Disorders and Confusions, there are
some, who though notoriously guilty, yet escape, and are
not so much as singed by that devouring Fire, nay, prosper,
and thrive best in such Combustions: so Providence lets
them go free, to convince Men of Reason, that there is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49763:11"/>
another World, where their insolence and unrighteousness
shall be punished with a witness,</hi> Psal. 50. 21, 22, 23. God
gives Men a taste of his Justice here, that they may not
think in their hearts, there is no God; and yet but a
taste, that they may not imagine, that what he doth
here, is all he intends to do. Some Judgments he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to send down now, to let the World see, there is
a God that judges in the Earth; and yet he sends not all
he means to send, to teach them, there are far more
dreadful ones to come. Some careless and debauched
Men he lashes here, to hint to us, that there is an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
Eye; and yet others he lets alone, to assure us,
that there is a future and Everlasting Vengeance.</p>
            <p>There is not a greater Argument of another Life,
than Gods being silent now, and not Executing Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against an Evil Work speedily; especially, where
the Crimes threaten Omnipotence, and Men attempt
to mingle Heaven and Earth together, dare be Giants
in Transgression, and make Gods Patience an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their Irreligion: for God, being a Righteous
Governour, cannot but be just; and since he awakes not
to Vengeance here, he will certainly pay the Sinner
home with interest hereafter.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor heard of a Nobleman
in his Dominions, who had run through all the Fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Labyrinths of Sin, tasted of all its Luxuries, lived
the life of a Beast, or of a Devil rather, <hi>had spared no
Woman in his lust, and no Man in his anger,</hi> had been
Drunk and Intemperate to a prodigy, yet had never
had any Cross or Sickness, and at last Died softly and
quietly without pain or trouble, with Age more than
with Sickness, being then above Fourscore; The Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Prince smote upon his Breast, and said, <hi>Either
there is no God, or after this comes a Life of Reward and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49763:11"/>
Vengeance:</hi> concluding peremptorily, That this Man
having escaped Gods Rods and Axes here, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be Tormented hereafter.</p>
            <p>So that Prosperous Villains are Gods Witnesses, that
Men do not cease to be when they Die, and carry Marks
about them of Gods future Vengeance. God in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to thrive, confirmes what he hath said in his
Word, and their Flourishing Condition here, is an item,
that when this Life is ended, they shall be destroy'd
forever; which is a Truth so important, and which
the World is so highly concerned to know, that it is in
a manner necessary, Impiety should be prosperous here,
that their strength should be firm, and there should be
no Bands in their Death, that they should not be in
trouble as other Men, nor plagued like other Men, that
their Eyes should stand out with fatness, and that they
should have more than their hearts can wish, since it is
an infallible Argument, that <hi>God hath appointed a day,
wherein he will render Tribulation and Anguish to every
Soul that doth evil, to the</hi> Jew <hi>first, and also to the</hi> Gentile,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>3. Such Disorders come <hi>to convince Men, that true
Happiness is not to be had in this Valley of Tears, but must
be sought in Heaven.</hi> To this end the greatest Glories
in the VVorld are subject to decay, and Scepters and
Diademes are suffered to tumble down, to shew, there is
a greater felicity to be gotten elsewhere. To this end
the greatest Calm is suffered to die into a Storm, and
<hi>Halcyon</hi> days into threatning VVaves and Billows, to
assure us the Prophet was in the right, when he cryed,
<hi>Arise and depart, for here is not your rest,</hi> Mic. 2. 10.</p>
            <p>To this end <hi>Gilimer</hi> the <hi>Vandal</hi> was overcome, and led
in Triumph through the Streets of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> To
this end, <hi>Andronicus</hi> from an Emperor is made a Slave,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49763:12"/>
and infamously dragged through Common-shores and
Kennels; To this end the Great <hi>Vitellius</hi> hath Dirt
thrown in his Face, and is haled to the Market-place to
be Executed; To this end the Mighty <hi>Croesus</hi> is like to
fall a Sacrifice to Flames, and the Sturdy <hi>Bajazet</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
in a Cage: King <hi>Boleslaus</hi> made a Skullion,
and <hi>Dionysius</hi> forced to turn Schoolmaster; To this end
<hi>Valerianus</hi> is Flead by the <hi>Persian</hi> Souldiers, and Salted
as if he had been Bacon; To this end <hi>John</hi> the Twenty
third, though a Pope, is at last constrained to eat his
own Clothes, and to feed upon the Flesh of his own
Arms, for hunger; To this end <hi>Adonibezeck</hi> after the
Conquest of Seventy Kings, hath the extremities of his
Hands and Feet cut off, and all to teach Men, that
these outward Gaudes are <hi>vanity of vanities, all is
vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the aforesaid <hi>Gilimer</hi> was so sensible of this,
that being after long, but fruitless Resistance necessitated
to yield himself to the Enemy, sent to his Conqueror
for three things, for <hi>Bread,</hi> for a <hi>Spunge,</hi> and for a
<hi>Cittern:</hi> for <hi>Bread</hi> to support his fainting Body, for a
<hi>Spunge</hi> to wipe away the Tears, he had shed for the
loss of his Royal Grandeur, and for a <hi>Cittern,</hi> to rejoyce
in his Experience that all is vanity.</p>
            <p>The fickleness of these outward Glories is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their emptiness, and in that like Glasses, they
are so easily broke and crackt, Wise Men see, that they
are but bubbles; were they lasting, Men would fancy
them to be Heaven, and their uninterruptedness would
tempt poor Mortals to say of them, as the surpriz'd
Disciple of Mount <hi>Tabor, It's good for us to be here, let's
make Tabernacles.</hi> Indeed in the midst of their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
Men are apt to promise themselves substantial sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
and while they see them slip through their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49763:12"/>
Fingers, they are so unwise as to adore them; What
would they do, were they really what they seem to be,
and had they beside their dazling Dress, Eternal dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make them amiable?</p>
            <p>God hath laid up other Felicities for Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and they lie out of the Common Road, that Men
might take pains to get them. We must not think God
bestow'd Immortal Souls upon us, that we might fix
them on Sensual Objects, and when we find, that they
are capable of securing such Riches and Pleasures as
fade not away, we must suppose, that to do so, was the
principal End of their Creation. God hath made these
lower things changeable as the Moon, that like the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the <hi>Revelation, chap. 12. vers.</hi> 1. we may set our
Feet upon them, and aim at Delights which transport
Souls, ravish Angels, and force Seraphim into Extasies.</p>
            <p>The deceitfulness of outward Glories appears no where
so plain, as in publick Disorders and Confusions, and
they are the best Glass to shew us, what unsatisfactory
things they are; For though in private Families disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
and changes happen every day, yet they are
too inconsiderable for a Multitude to take notice of them;
but Publick Disorders convince a Kingdom of the
Imperfection of these External Comforts, and the more
notorious they are, the more all sorts of Men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fwaded
into a belief of that Imperfection; so that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
of this nature are Sermons preach'd to a whole
Nation, and Speeches from Heaven, whereby God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
an Universal Reformation.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Sometimes it is to try the Good, and to brighten their
Faith, and Hope, and Constancy,</hi> which like Gold, is best
Polished and Refined by Fire. And this Reason God
himself gives, <hi>Ps.</hi> 81. 7. It is in this case, as in matter
of Heresies, which <hi>must be, That those which are approved,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49763:13"/>
may be made manifest, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 19. To adhere to a good
Cause, when it sleeps under the soft Wings of Peace
and order, may be Policy, but to espouse it when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
is an argument of true Honesty and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.
He that can defend it, when it meets with Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
we may conclude, is guided more by its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
than his own Interest: and he that sticks to it,
when Tempests threaten to overwhelm it, discovers,
that it hath not only his bare Approbation, but his
Heart and Affections too.</p>
            <p>To Salute Christ when all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> cries Hosannah,
may be a piece of Civility; but to speak for him when
he is Crucified, is a sign of true Christian Simplicity.
Till Persecution came, the Son of God had innumerable
Flatterers; but when that Fire began, the number soon
dwindled away into a small Company of Followers.
It happens so sometimes, that the good cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from the counterfeit Professors of Religion,
and while all meet in the Publick Assemblies, the Wheat
and Chaff seem to be one, but Troubles and Disorders
like the Wise <hi>Shepherd</hi> make a distinction between the
Sheep and the Goats, and discover the Integrity of the
one, and the Deceit and Hypocrisie of the other. To
follow <hi>David,</hi> when all <hi>Israel</hi> runs after <hi>Absalom,</hi> is a
Mark of Loyalty, but with <hi>Achitophel</hi> to shrink, when
Heaven seems to frown on the right side, is base Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.
Troubles, like <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> make a separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Metals, and shew which is the Silver, and
which the contemptible Mineral. Those that are good
grow better by them: Those that seem only to be so, in
the hour of Temptation fall away.</p>
            <p>That Sap certainly is strongest, which preserves the
Leaves of a Tree green and verdant all the Winter, and
nothing is so great a sign of strength and hardiness, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49763:13"/>
to be able to endure the rude assaults of Frost and Snow,
and unseasonable Weather. It's a Character of Infamy,
the Evangelist imprints on the chief Rulers among the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who indeed believed in <hi>Jesus,</hi> but for fear of the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> durst not confess him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 42. True
Goodness like Lillies thrives, though Thorns and Bryars
do surround it, and <hi>Salamander</hi> like can live in Fire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>late Kings</hi> Piety shines the brighter, because he
durst maintain it under Temptations to forsake it. The
Troubles that came upon him, it's confest added little to
his outward Pomp, but rendred his Goodness more charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and amiable to the Prudent Spectator: It had never
arrived to that Renown and Glory, if those Confusions
had not been the Touchstone: and when like Lawrel it
could stand those Thunders, it was evident that an
Almighty Power did uphold it: Had he lived Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
all his days, his Vertue would have made him a
Saint, but the constancy of it in the severest Tryals, gave
him the Character of a Martyr: Had he professed and
express'd Meekness, while his Subjects were submissive
and respectful, the excellent Qualification might have
challenged suitable Commendations; but to practice it
when his Servants became his Masters, and instead of
Honouring, loaded him with Indignities and Reproaches,
this deserves our wonder: To be true to the Church
against his Temporal Interest, was that, which gave him
the greatest Credit, and to forgoe a Crown rather than
part with his Religion, an act which force the World
into admiration. The greater Man he was, the greater
was the Tryal, and for such a Tryal, perhaps, nothing
was so fit as Royal Vertue. The Disorders he lived to
see, made him more sensible of Gods assistance, than all
his Sunshine did, and he had never tasted of that degree
of sweetness in Gods favour, if Persecution and a Prison
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49763:14"/>
had not increased the relish. This gave him a clearer
sight of Gods goodness, than the high <hi>Specula</hi> of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and his Solitariness afforded him such Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as he must never have hoped for in the Crouds of
<hi>Courtiers.</hi> This made him look into <hi>Paradise,</hi> and see the
Suffering <hi>Jesus</hi> on his Throne, and taught him, that a
Man might be the Son of <hi>God</hi> in the very Garden of
<hi>Gethsemane.</hi> This furnished him with Lessons, which
the greatest Kings are Strangers to, and with <hi>Moses,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
him to behold him that was Invisible. This made
his Faith with <hi>Abraham,</hi> believe even Contradictions,
and raised his Confidence, that though he Died, he
should live for ever. This made him stand amazed at
his own Vertue, and while he saw he was able to do, what
he thought had been impossible, admire the immense
power and goodness of God, when grace was thus suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for him, and made his strength proportionable to
his burden. This made him find by blessed experience,
what the Saints of old felt in their Chains and Tortures,
and assured him, that to rejoyce with joy unspeakable,
and full of glory in the midst of Flames, was no Fable.
This made him see, that the things Invisible are the
most desirable Objects, and find with the great Apostle,
that there is a great difference between being Persecuted
and forsaken.</p>
            <p>5. Such Disorders are sometimes permitted <hi>to discover
the ill Principles of some Mens Religion, who are like to
seduce others by their specious Pretences, that Men who are
in good earnest resolved to be saved, may be aware of them,</hi>
and not <hi>fall into the same condemnation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 1, 5, 9.
Men who suppose that gain is godliness, when trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and Perillous times do come, and Disorders rise,
serve themselves of these Tumults, and under a shew of
Piety, grasp what they can, and betray their Carnal
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49763:14"/>
Ends, which in such times cannot be hid, when there
are opportunities and temptations to call them out into
Action; for as in such Disorders commonly the Right
Cause, or the Party that have most Justice on their side,
are oppressed and come by the worst, so the other make
advantage of their Misery, and their Blood and Tears
give the other Growth and Stature. It's possible, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Hearers,</hi> you may remember times, when Men
walked in Sheeps Cloathing, but within were Ravening
Wolves, and while their Voice was exactly like <hi>Jacobs,</hi>
their Hands continued rough as <hi>Esau</hi>'s; when Men
cryed, The Temple of the Lord, and yet at the same
time Murthered those that opposed their Insolencies, and
talked of the good Cause, while they meant nothing
else by it, but enriching their own Purses; when Men
pretended a thorough Reformation, and made their own
Souls as black as Hell, and gave out that they fought for
God, when it was only to maintain, what they had
unjustly purchas'd; when Men sighed and groaned to
get the Prey into their Net, and laboured much for a
Spiritual Kingdom, to make a surer settlement of their
Temporal Possessions.</p>
            <p>When Men under a shew of seeking a World to
come, did what they could to enjoy this present, and
left no Stone unturned to Establish Religion, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might Establish themselves the better in their
Unrighteous Acquists; when Men to pull down Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
as they called it, set up Robbery and Sacriledge
in the room of it, and instead of doing things better
than they had been, exchanged only one Sin for another;
when Men call'd that Zeal, which was in good earnest
nothing else, but inordinate Passion, and termed that
Charity, which was no more but Kindness to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in Iniquity; when Men called others Dumb Dogs,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49763:15"/>
that they might more securely Bark at them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
them as lazy Droans, that they might carry
the Honey, those Bees had made, to their own Hives;
when Men undertook to resolve Cases of Conscience,
while themselves had seared their own, and under a
pretence of taking Scruples out of other Mens Breasts,
felt none for the monstrous Injuries they had been guilty
of to their Neighbours; when Men gave out, they
pittied the Divisions of the Church, while themselves
were the Causes that began them, and talk'd of Works
of Mercy, while they shew'd none to those they had
turned out of their Livings; when they trampled on
the Pride of Prelates with a greater of their own, and
ran like mad from <hi>Babylon</hi> to be consumed in the Fire of
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I have seen some <hi>gaudy Flowers</hi> arrayed more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
than <hi>Solomon,</hi> but when dismantled, have been
nothing but unsavoury and unprofitable Stalks; so the
deadly <hi>Night-shade</hi> looks fresh and green, as other Plants,
but carries Poison in its Bowels; so the Prince of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones, the <hi>Diamond,</hi> by its Rayes, promises so
many Springs of Light, but its Powder kills without
Remedy; so <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> dazle the Eye, yet are no
Steams more odious or loathsom, than those which rise
from the Mines, they are digg'd out of; so the <hi>Butterfly</hi>
is striped with several Paints, yet is no more but a
squallid Animal; so the <hi>Glow-worm</hi> looks like a creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Star, yet if you behold it by day light, it is a
very homely Creature.</p>
            <p>These are the true Emblemes of some Mens Religion
in the World, and their partial Obedience in times of
Disorder and Confusion, tells the Considerate part of
Mankind, that what they profess is <hi>Varnish</hi> not <hi>Substance,
Glass</hi> not <hi>Natural Chrystal, Shadow</hi> not <hi>Reality;</hi> for how
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49763:15"/>
can that be true Religion, where I give to <hi>God</hi> the things
which are <hi>Gods,</hi> and deny to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things which
are <hi>Caesars?</hi> where I am conscientious to the Creator,
and unjust and perfidious to the Creature? where I
offer Sacrifice, and envy my Brother in my heart? where
I express love to my Maker, and yet do not give all their
due, Custom to whom Custom; Tribute to whom Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
Fear to whom Fear, and Honour to whom Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
or in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Phrase, Fear God, and do not
Honour the King?</p>
            <p>And these Sophistications God commonly discovers in
Confusions, intending them as Sea-marks, to give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Ships that see them afar off, not to come near
those Sands, lest they split their Vessel, and lose their
Goods, which with great cost and labour they have
purchased. But it's time we proceed, and enquire,</p>
            <p>3. How Gods Providence appears in these Disorders and
Confusions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>God puts bounds and limits to the rage of Men, that
cause and encourage those Disorders.</hi> The proud <hi>Senacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,
Es.</hi> 37. 24. talks big, he had already put <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
into Consternation, and boasted of greater mischiefs he
intended; <hi>By the multitude of my Chariots,</hi> saith he,
<hi>am I come up to the height of the Mountains, to the sides of</hi>
Lebanon, <hi>and I will cut down the tall Cedars thereof, and
the choice Fir-trees thereof, and I will enter into the height
of his Border, and the Forest of his Carmel.</hi> But he that
sits in Heaven laughs at him, and the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
<hi>the little talking Insect,</hi> assures the <hi>Prophet,</hi> that
beyond such a Field he shall not step, and as he saith, he
doth; <hi>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult is come
up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose,
and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the
way which thou camest.</hi> When <hi>Maxentius</hi> had filled <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49763:16"/>
with Murthers, and the People feared not only greater
Injuries to their Persons, but a total Desolation, (so
great was the fury of the Monster) the Almighty sets
bounds to his brutish Courage, and sends the great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
to remove him, and with him the Yoak, he had
laid on the trembling People. And thus hath God dealt
with most Tyrants, who have thought to crush the
World by their Power, when they have threatned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it self, and gone on securely for a considerable time,
insomuch that they have flattered themselves, that all was
their own, an Invisible hand hath stopt their Progress,
and allotted them their limits, <hi>Hitherto shalt thou come
and no farther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this hath been Gods method with the most Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hereticks, whose business it hath been to ruine the
Church, and to render it, as the first Mass, a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or a thing without shape or Figure; Not only <hi>Arrius</hi>
himself was stopt from belching out Blasphemies against
the Son of God, by being struck with a fatal Loosness
before he could reach the <hi>Council,</hi> but his Heresie too,
when the World was afraid of its Inundation: for after
such a term of years, the true Religion flourished again
maugre all the opposition, from <hi>Constantius, Valens,</hi> and
the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sometimes God disappoints such Men in their highest
hopes and expectations. Benhadad</hi> sends to King <hi>Ahab,</hi>
to tell him, 1 <hi>Reg. 20. 3. Thy Silver and thy Gold is mine,
thy Wives also and thy Children, even the goodliest are
mine,</hi> and <hi>accordingly</hi> dispatches his Servants to take their
choice of what they liked. <hi>Ahab</hi> gives the Messengers
a resolute denial, at which the <hi>Syrian</hi> storms and swears,
<hi>v. 10. The Gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust
of</hi> Samaria <hi>shall suffice for handfuls, for all the People that
follow me;</hi> Hereupon he marches with two and thirty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49763:16"/>
Kings, his Vassals at his Heels, and hearing that some of
the <hi>Israelites</hi> were come out against him, he scorns to
fight with them, but like a God, at whose nod People
must either live or die, bids his men take them alive:
But behold how the <hi>Phantastick King</hi> is disappointed in
his hopes, while he thought all <hi>Samaria</hi> would come out
to him with Ropes and Halters about their Necks to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Sovereign Power of Life and Death, he
and his vast Armies, which filled the Land, are not only
chased and beaten, but himself is taken Prisoner, and
forced to come crouching and cringing to the King of
<hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Selimus</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> in the year of our Lord 1569. sets
out from <hi>Constantinople</hi> with 25000 Horse, and 3000 <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi>
and joins an Army of the <hi>Precopian Tartars</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of 80000 Horse more, besides a Navy at Sea of 150
<hi>Gallies</hi> Manned, and provided of suitable Ammunition
to Invade the Kingdom of <hi>Astracan;</hi> he had already
swallowed the <hi>Empire</hi> in his hopes, distributed the various
Provinces to his <hi>Basha</hi>'s, and consulted how to govern
the Kingdom, conquer'd already in Imagination. It's
true, the Inhabitants of <hi>Astracan</hi> were in great confusion,
but the Mighty God, who sets up one, and pulls down
another, comes in, dashes all the swelling hopes of the
haughty <hi>Sultan,</hi> and beyond expectation, all that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Army pines and dwindles away in their march, some
of them come as far as <hi>Azeph,</hi> and of that vast Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
2000 only return to <hi>Constantinople. Vitiges</hi> the
<hi>Goth</hi> besieges <hi>Rome,</hi> makes use of all the Stratagems,
that his wisest and cunningest Men can think of, and
doubts not of success, but in despight of all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
he is forced to retire, and acknowledge a
<hi>Providence.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the famous year 1588. set
out their Invincible <hi>Armada</hi> against <hi>England,</hi> fright the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49763:17"/>
Inhabitants of the Land with their Titles and Numbers,
and promise themselves a perfect Victory, but on a
suddain that vast Navy is scattered and torn, and only
a few Ships return home to bring King <hi>Philip</hi> the News,
that the rest were lost, insomuch that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
thought, that God was become a <hi>Lutheran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So unexpectedly doth God change the Scene of Affairs
in such Disorders. The <hi>Amalekites</hi> plunder <hi>Ziklag,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. and then sit down and play, and praise
their Gods for the Conquest, while <hi>David</hi> and his Men
are almost distracted with fear and grief. On a suddain,
the Clouds clear up, God directs them to the Camp,
where the Enemy lay, secure of his Prey, The Foe is
beaten, and <hi>David</hi> recovers all, <hi>v. 17, 18, 19. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
provoked by <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Tyrant, Encamps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; The Enemies numbers and valour fright
the <hi>Emperors</hi> Men, who look'd upon themselves, as lost;
But behold <hi>Theodosius</hi> prays, and on a suddain a mighty
Wind arises, insomuch that the Enemy is forced to turn
his back, and yield. So in <hi>Aurelius</hi> his Army, when
those vast numbers of Men were ready to die for thirst,
the <hi>Christian Legion</hi> calls upon God, and on a suddain
the Heavens brake forth in Lightning and Rain, the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
among the Souldiers are stilled, and all drink, and
are refreshed by Gods kindly Showers.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Sometimes God works a mighty deliverance from such
Disorders by very inconsiderable means.</hi> What misery there
was in <hi>Samaria</hi> in the time of that dire Famine, we read
of, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. 25, 28, 29. any one may guess that hath
felt the straights of Hunger; that in one day there should
be so great a change, that a Measure of Fine Flower
should be sold for a <hi>Shekle,</hi> one of the Kings Servants
thought to be a thing so impossible, that he ventured to
say, if God should rain down Corn from Heaven, it could
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49763:17"/>
not be, yet it happened so as the Prophet had said, and
the deliverance was effected by four inconsiderable <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi>
who despairing of life, fled to the <hi>Syrian</hi> Camp,
and found such affluence and plenty, that all <hi>Samaria</hi> was
immediately relieved and stored with Provision; Thus
was the <hi>Roman Capitol</hi> saved by Geese, and the <hi>Roman</hi>
Army chased by <hi>Poisoned Birds</hi> from the <hi>Parthian</hi> Walls;
Thus the young <hi>Corvinus</hi> beat the <hi>Gauls</hi> with the help
of a <hi>Raven;</hi> And <hi>Immo Henry</hi> the Emperors <hi>General</hi> was
delivered from the danger threatned him by <hi>Gisilbert</hi> of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> by <hi>Swarms</hi> of <hi>Bees</hi> let loose upon the Enemy,
which Stung both Horse and Rider, and made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for Action; Thus <hi>Fridlevo</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi>'s Army was
saved by a <hi>Dog;</hi> And <hi>Hannibal</hi> got a signal Victory
over <hi>Eumenes</hi> by the help of <hi>Serpents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more inconsiderable the means are whereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
are effected, the more they proclaim the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power and Providence; and when <hi>Gideon</hi> conquers
a numberless Host of the <hi>Midianites</hi> with three hundred
Men, it's a sign, the Lord of Hosts hath a hand in it.
That <hi>Sampson</hi> smites a thousand <hi>Philistines</hi> with the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
of an Ass, shews that God governed his Arm; and
when <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer make the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi>
flee, it's an Argument, that the Lord reigned in
the midst of the frights and fears, which possessed the
cowardly <hi>Israelites.</hi> If Men believe it not, it is because
they do not consider the weakness of the Instruments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such occasions, and the only thing that makes them
Infidels, is, because they conclude not from the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibleness
of the means, that there must be a higher
Power, which gives them Strength and Vertue.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Sometimes God causes Divisions and Dissentions to
arise among the Prevailing Party, that were the cause of such
Disorders, that they may fall into great Disasters and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49763:18"/>
Abimelech, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. sets upon his Brethren,
threescore and ten Persons, Murthers them all, and fills
the City of <hi>Shechem</hi> with Confusion; Things go on
merrily, and he fears no evil, but when he had Reigned,
saith the Sacred Writer, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Three years over <hi>Israel,
God sent an Evil Spirit between</hi> Abimelech <hi>and the men of
Shechem,</hi> and the Men of <hi>Shechem</hi> dealt treacherously
with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> which proved both his and their undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>v.</hi> 40, 54. As great as their Friendship was before,
God doth but pull out a Pin, that held them together,
and the whole Frame breaks in pieces, and while they
see no Foreign Power to revenge their former wickedness,
themselves are made the Instruments to do it. God in
this case made use of the Law of Retaliation, and the
Judgment that came upon them was suitable to their Sin.
<hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Righteousness, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 4. is as the Morning
Cloud, and as the early Dew it passes away, Therefore
themselves shall be as a Morning Cloud, and as the early
Dew they shall pass away, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 3. so these Men had
sown Divisions, and Dissentions among the People, at
last their Sin becomes their Punishment, and that which
before had been their delight and pleasure, proves in the
end their Yoak and Burthen; They divide themselves,
and are lost.</p>
            <p>This was the case of the <hi>Arcadians, Troezenians,</hi> and
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> of old, and hath been re-acted in our days;
for though such Jealousies and Dissentions seem to come
by chance, yet there is nothing more certain, than that
God thereby visits the Sins of those, that have been the
causes of Publick Disorders and Confusions; and when
those, who have assisted them in their attempts, begin
to suspect either their Fidelity or Honesty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
plot, how to remove the Mushrooms, they have
raised, its Providence disposes their hearts to it; not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49763:18"/>
that he, who is of Purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,
prompts them to Sin, but justly sends blindness on their
Minds, whereby their Eyes become dim to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and they tempted to undermine their own Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>5. Sometimes God so orders it, that the Authors of such
Confusions shall hearken to ill Counsel, whereby they may
be ruined. Ahab <hi>by the</hi> Prophets <hi>Testimony, was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that signally troubled</hi> Israel, 1 Kings 18. 18. <hi>But
behold how Providence deals with him. A fancy takes
him, that he must needs go up, and Retake</hi> Ramoth Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
<hi>out of the hands of the</hi> Syrians; <hi>yet before he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
upon the Enterprize, he consults both with
his</hi> Confederates <hi>and such</hi> Prophets <hi>as he had, whether
the Expedition were safe or no. All but</hi> Micah <hi>advise
him to it, and to this Advise he hearkens; but see, how
Providence laid the Scene. I saw the Lord, saith</hi> Micah,
1 Kings 22. 19, 20, 21, 22. I saw the Lord sitting on his
Throne, and all the Host of Heaven standing by him, on
his right hand and on his left, and the Lord said, Who
shall persuade <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he may go up, and fall at <hi>Ramoth
Gilead?</hi> and one said on this manner, and another said
on that manner, and there came forth a Spirit, and stood
before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him; And the
Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
forth, and I will be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all his
Prophets; and he said, thou shalt persuade him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
also, go forth and do so; <hi>And so it came to pass, he
was perswaded, went, and was Shot, and Died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though at this day, we see no such Visions as
<hi>Micah</hi> did, yet we may justly imagine, when we see
the same events, that they are compassed and effected the
same way, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Gods permitting some Evil Spirit to
put ill Counsel into the Heads of those, with whom such
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49763:19"/>
Firebrands Advise, that acting according to those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
they may come to that woful End, which their
Crimes and Follies do deserve. Were our Eyes quick
enough to behold the Transactions and Consultations
in the Kingdom of Spirits above us; could we pry into
their Secrets, Order, Proceedings, and Management of
this lower World, we should be able to resolve a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and mysteries of Events, which now
seem strange and uncouth to our darker understandings;
for on the Molehills of this World, where myriads
of little Ants do run, those Spirits exercise their power,
and that which we call Accidental, hath been, and is
contrived by their deliberate Resolutions.</p>
            <p>Thus we may suppose they acted, when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Counsel of his Young Men, and rejected the
grave Advice of his Elder <hi>Senators;</hi> the very cause of
his succeeding danger. Thus they blinded the <hi>Carians</hi> of
old, who rebelling against <hi>Darius,</hi> set up for themselves,
but by neglecting the excellent Counsel of <hi>Pixodorus,</hi>
were Conquer'd by the <hi>Persians;</hi> Thus they deceiv'd the
tumultuous <hi>Athenians,</hi> who following the dangerous
Advice of <hi>Aristagoras,</hi> drew the fury of <hi>Darius</hi> upon them,
and laid the Foundation of their Ruine. Thus they cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen'd
that unwary and Seditious People, in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
with the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> while they obliged them to
hearken to <hi>Cleophon,</hi> who encouraged them to a vigorous
prosecution of the War, of which they repented, when
it was too late; for they lost not only all their power and
greatness, but became subject to domineering Tyrants,
and lost all their ease, and conveniencies too. Thus the
Seditious <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was served by them: Advised by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi>
the <hi>Prophet</hi> to yield himself to the <hi>Chaldean Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>
and expect his Mercy; he desperately hearkens to
the turbulent Counsels of Men as vicious as himself, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49763:19"/>
stand out against the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Army, which proved his
overthrow, and the utter destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But still those Evil Spirits, as they are Gods <hi>Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
so they all must attend his Command and Order, and
they cannot thus impose on Sinners here on Earth, till the
Almighty gives them a Warrant for to do so: And he may
do it, as he is the Judge of Heaven and Earth, and it's
just he should do so, to lash the Insolencies of Men, that
would confound Kingdoms or Societies.</p>
            <p>6. Sometimes he sends upon Men, who are the
Causes of such Disorders, <hi>a Worm to gnaw their Breasts,
even a tormenting Conscience.</hi> Such a turbulent Spirit
was <hi>Pashur</hi> the Son of <hi>Immer</hi> the Priest, in the time of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah,</hi>
a Man who set both the King and Nobles against
the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> whereupon God threatens him,
to make him a terrour to himself, which without all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radventure
came to pass, when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> took the
City, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 4. So that when no visible Judgment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in such Men, there is an Enemy many times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them, which frights them worse than all External Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
<hi>Cain,</hi> who was the first that brought Disorder
into the World, behold, how after his Brothers Murther
his Conscience haunts him! Though there were no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the World, but his nearest Relations, yet he fancies
every place he goes to, full of Men and Enemies, and is
afraid they'l kill him. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who scarce let a day
pass without some Villany, and seemed to be born to the
Confusion of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, cries out, when no Man
pursues him, trembles, when no Enemy is near him, and
feels terrours within, while without, all seems to be
calm and quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nero</hi> kills his Mother <hi>Agrippina,</hi> sets <hi>Rome</hi> on Fire, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes
the <hi>Christians,</hi> but what ails him? In the midst of
his Guards he is frighted, fancies he sees dreadful shapes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49763:20"/>
before him, feels Arrows in his Breast, while his Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
fawn upon him. <hi>Constans</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour,
dispatches his Brother <hi>Theodosius,</hi> soon after he cannot
sleep; What's the reason, was it Sickness? Was it a
fit of the Gout, or Stone, or Collick that troubled him?
No, something within opens his Eyes, and shews him
his Brothers Ghost, coming towards him with a Cup of
Blood, and saying to him, <hi>Drink inhumane Brother;</hi>
It was his wicked Conscience. <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the
<hi>Goths</hi> uses <hi>Symmachus</hi> very barbarously, and falls Sick
upon it; Was it any disorder of the Blood? Was it a
Surfeit? Was it a Fever that discomposed him? No,
he sees a Fish opened, and sees <hi>Symmachus</hi> his Head in it,
and having seen it, cannot put the strange sight out of his
mind; his Conscience rolled and worked within, and
drew the dismal Picture before his Eyes, and in such
frightful colours, that in Torments of Mind he dies.
Thus it happened to <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> that engaged in <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrands</hi>
Faction against his Master <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th. Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;</hi>
his Conscience tore him within, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
how he had sworn an Oath of Allegiance to his
Prince, and perfidiously broke it, lay upon his Spirits,
and Rackt him, and in that Rack his polluted Soul expires.
<hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> who for some years had put <hi>England</hi>
into Combustion, the Night before <hi>Bosworth-Field,</hi> in his
Sleep fees all the Devils in Hell about his ears, ready to
tear his cursed Soul away. Those Devils were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
of his Conscience, foreboding the Flames that
waited for him in the black Kingdom of Infernal Furies;
And if History and Fame doth not belie the late Usurper,
for all his borrow'd Glories he slept but uneasie, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd as
soft as his Pillows were, something harder than Lead
or Iron lay upon his Heart, which made him start in his
Sleep, and betray an unruly Guest within, upon other
occasions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:49763:20"/>
This way God lets even the wickedest of Mankind
know, not only that there is a living Justice, but that
they do but get little by all their desperate Enterprizes;
This way he makes them see, that there is no place so
private, but he is present there, and that there is no
design so intricate, but it's naked and open before him;
This way they must come to know, that the darkness
doth not hide from him, and that though no Creatures
can reach them with their Eyes, they cannot abscond
from the All-seeing one of the great Creator.</p>
            <p>7. Such Disorders, <hi>God not only designs, but manages
for his Peoples good; for theirs is the promise, that all things
shall work together for their advantage,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. So
great a lover is God of Holy Men, that though I will not
say with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that for their sakes he Created the
World, yet certainly for their sakes he preserves it, as
much as he would for their sakes have spared <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah,</hi> had any tolerable number of them been found
in those corrupted places; Nay, more than that, for
their sakes he not only suffers Publick Disorders to arise,
but when they arise, so directs and over-rules them,
that they shall receive no small advantage by them. Do
Men gather Grapes of Thorns, you will say, or Figs of
Thistles? Can a Fountain at the same place send forth
both bitter and sweet Water? Yes, here this seeming
contradiction is true; and as great as the mischiefs are,
that issue from such Confusions, the good God's Servants
reap by them, is as remarkable; In Prosperity their Prayers
are apt to slacken; In such Disorders, their Aspirations
become loud and vehement, and whereas before a cloud
of dulness and laziness hung upon their Spirits, now it's
shaken off with scorn and indignation; Ease and Plenty
made their Piety lukewarm; Disorders give them Fire,
and Tumults make them look more carefully to their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49763:21"/>
Souls. Their hatred of Sin before was sincere, may be,
but such Confusions make them Zealous; These make
their Faith more lively, their Hope more vigorous, and
their Love more fervent; these whet their charity and
confidence, and when the Storms are gone, make them
not only rellish their deliverance better, but engage
them to greater gratitude.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; As Godliness hath the promise of
this present Life, as well as that of a future, so the
good that arises to Gods People from such Disorders,
hath respect to their Temporal felicity too; for this way
a lasting Foundation many times is laid for their future
Tranquility, and as Trees shaken with the Wind, take
the deeper Root, so these Disorders make way for a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
settlement of their outward Peace Plenty. By
the troubles which happened to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
they are fitted for a quiet settlement in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
the Land that flow'd with Milk and Honey; and
whereas their Captivity lasted but 400, their possession
of that promised Land continued at least 800 years. Thus
the first Persecutions of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church under <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Emperors</hi> made way for their free enjoyment of the
Comforts of this Life, after the Empire began to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and though it was now and then interrupted partly
by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and partly by <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> yet it
settled again after a little while, upon its former Basis,
and hath continued, at least in the West, unto this day;
And what we say of the Universal, is true also of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches, whose Tranquillity by such Disorders
comes to be more durable, as were an easie matter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the Reformed <hi>European</hi> Churches, when they
had for some time struggled under the Seditions and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
raised by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and though I do not
take all those, who are Members of a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49763:21"/>
and visible Church to be Gods true Servants, yet
even they who are sincere, share in the Tranquility, Peace
and Plenty, and Temporal Prosperity of the Church
they are of, and consequently the Disorders which are
suffered to arise, may reasonably be said to promote the
durableness, even of their particular Prosperity.</p>
            <p>Having thus asserted the Order, Regularity, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Gods Providence in the midst of Disorders and
Confusions, it will not be proper to dismiss this Subject
without some practical inferences;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Lord reigneth;</hi> Let all Sinners tremble; Be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
ye workers of Iniquity, there is a King above, who
as patient as he is, will make you know erelong he hath a
Trumpet of War, as well as a Scepter of Love. Good
God! How little do Men regard thy Power and Reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arm! If they can but save themselves from the
wrath of Men, and the lashes of the Law, how little are
they concern'd at thy Indignation! Thou hast <hi>Magazines</hi>
of Vengeance, <hi>Store-houses</hi> of Curses, and canst undo a
thousand ways; Thou hast <hi>Waters</hi> to drown, <hi>Fire</hi> and
<hi>Brimston</hi> to consume, <hi>Arrows</hi> to wound, <hi>Pestilence</hi> and
<hi>Famine</hi> move by thy direction, nay, thou canst destroy
both Soul and Body into Hell; Thou hast threatned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
and howling and gnashing of Teeth, outward
darkness, and what is more, Fire, that is not quench'd,
to Men that chuse rather to gratifie their sinful humours,
than obey thy Laws; Yet they look not pale upon it,
their colour changes not, they find no alteration in their
dispositions, thy terrours fright them not, thy anger
moves them not; how securely do they laugh and quaff,
and sing fear and care away!</p>
            <p>How Merry notwithstanding all this, is the Drunkard
over his Cups! How unconcerned doth the Fornicator
and Adulterer lie in the Embraces of his Harlot! How
chearfully doth the Covetous hug his Bags; and how boldly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49763:22"/>
doth the Swearer send up his fearful Oaths to Heaven!
How undisturbed doth the Oppressour, Extortioner, and
Murtherer sleep! and all because they think thou art Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and Merciful: Thy Mercy makes them wanton,
and thy Patience causes Sin to live in their Souls; Thy
Goodness tempts them to be foolish, and thy Compassion
prompts them to affront thy Glory; Thy Kindness proves
their Bane, and the Meat thou givest them, encreases their
Corruption; Thy Oyl they turn into Poison, and thy
Corn and Wine feeds them into contempt of thy Majesty;
The ease thou givest them, they make use of to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy Laws, and the plenty, they enjoy by thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
gives them courage to make War with that
Heaven, from whence that plenty flows.</p>
            <p>Monstrous Abuse! Strange Stupidity! When ever
Gods Indignation breaks forth, how violent will the
Torrent be? Deluded Men! what pains do you take to
treasure up Wrath unto your selves! Were there but the
least spark of ingenuity in you, how durst you make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
goodness the Object of your scorn! How could you
find in your hearts, to declare your selves Rebels and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to your greatest Benefactor! Shall Goodness harden
you, or Patience make your Breasts impenetrable! Shall
Bowels of Mercy make you hard as Rocks, and Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be the <hi>Opiate</hi> to lull you asleep in your follies! If
your Children served you so, what plagues would you
think too big for them! Or, if your Servants should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
your kindnesses thus, would not you hate the
very sight of their Persons! And must God put up affronts
which you will not! Must he be contented under scorns
and abuses, which you will not bear! Can such ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
be pleasing to him, which is so odious to you! What
conceptions do you entertain of God, that you deal with
him thus! If you believe him to be jealous of his Glory,
Will not be vindicate these Injuries? See how loath he is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49763:22"/>
to punish you, and will you force him to it! See how
slowly he proceeds to Vengeance, and will you hasten
him! See how he waits for your Repentance, and will
you make him despair of it! He is Patient, because he
would have you prevent the blow, and will you pull it
down on your heads! He delays his anger, because he
would have you kiss the Son, and will you still fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, that you may perish in good earnest! By
your trespassing upon his Patience, you aggravate your
guilt, and must necessarily aggravate your Condemnation
too; you make Mercy a Witness against you, and Gods
goodness your Accuser, and are these Arguments to be
Answered! I mean, the Arguments, that the Mercy and
Patience of God will alledge against you in the last day;
If you allow God but the ordinary Wisdom of a great
Man, you must needs think, that his Mercies abused thus,
will prove your Ruine. Doth not every Wise Man, if
he have entrusted his Steward with an Estate, demand of
him, how he hath employ'd it, and will not you allow
God so much Wisdom, as to be concern'd about the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
he hath entrusted you withall? His Mercy and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
are those Talents, he gave you to improve into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness,
and hatred of Sin, and resistance of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
will you bury them under ground, or lay them up
in a Napkin, or what is more, misuse them to dishonour
the Omnipotent God, and his Law, and expect an
<hi>Euge?</hi> Will you turn his Grace into wantonness, and
believe, you shall be applauded at last, with a <hi>well done
good and faithful Servant?</hi> Have not you read of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Servant, that was deliver'd to the Tormentors,
till he should pay what he ow'd; and is not this your
case, that make light of Gods anger, because he doth
not power it out upon you, so soon, as your Sins deserve
it? <hi>Therefore art thou inexcusable,</hi> O Man, <hi>whosoever thou
art, who despisest the riches of his goodness, and forbearance,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49763:23"/>
and long-suffering, not knowing, that the goodness of God
leads thee to Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2. 1, 5.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Lord reigneth,</hi> Let's admire the Wisdom of
God, who can draw light out of darkness, and wholsom
Medicines from the rankest Poison; The brutish Man
knows it not, neither doth a Fool understand this, and
hence come the rash censures of Gods actions; A Man
who is no careless observer of things, will find very
strange and uncouth passages, and dispensations in this
World, which possibly he cannot reconcile to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of that Reason, God hath given him; yet may he
be confident, that as absurd as some Dispensations seem to
him, they are carried on with singular Wisdom and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
by the Supream mover of all, it being impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but the All-Wise, God, who sees and knows, and
takes care of all, must act, and suffer things to be acted
upon very weighty and prudential Motives; and I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
not, but should God be so kind, as to give us a Key
to open the Cabinet of some of his Mysterious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
I mean, communicate his Reasons to us, why he
disposes and martials things in that order, method, and
manner we see he doth, we should be forced with the
Apostle to cry out, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>O the depth of the Riches,
both of the Mercy and Wisdom of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Holy Ghost should be bestow'd on the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised
Gentiles, was a thing which to the <hi>Jews</hi>
seemed not only impossible, but in a manner Impious
to believe, it having been a Maxim with them from
immemorial times, That <hi>the Divine Presence rests on none,
but an Israelite,</hi> yet when they saw the thing effectually
done, and understood the Reasons, they could not but
break forth into admiration of the infinite Wisdom of
God, and praise and magnifie him whose Understanding
is Infinite, and whose Wisdom cannot by searching be
found out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49763:23"/>
It's a very strange Dispensation, that the greatest part
of the World should continue Heathenish and Idolatrous,
and the <hi>Mahometans</hi> exceed the <hi>Christians</hi> in number by
three parts at least, yet he that shall consider seriously,
how Christians are sunk, as to the holiness of their
Lives, and how unfit by reason of that decay they are
for propagating that Holy Religion, they profess; how
careless and negligent <hi>Christian Princes</hi> are grown, as to
the enlarging of <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom, and those that have
made some attempts that way, have gone about it with
sinister designs; how others had rather spend their time
at home in picking and feeding Quarrels in the Church,
than advance the Unity of the Faith abroad; and how
the generality of Christians have learn'd to mind the
World more than Heaven, and are become lovers of
Pleasures, more than lovers of God: and the Religion
that is left among them, is either mixt with Idolatry or
gross Superstitions, or some other notorious Abuses, and
is become a Carnal, rather than a Spiritual Worship,
and a Formal rather than a Rational Service; and how
many of the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> exceed Christians
in Vertue and Morality, and how that Charity, Love,
and Peace, which was once the great Character of
<hi>Christs</hi> Disciples, is banished, and the Seamless Coat of
Christ torn in a thousand pieces, and those Dissentions
cherish'd, maintained, encouraged, and how Religion
is become a meer Politick thing; I say, he that shall
consider all this, will not wonder so much, that there are
no more <hi>Christians</hi> in the World, as admire, there are so
many, and that the greatest part of them are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
or led into Captivity, when they abuse, and so
grosly abuse the best, the noblest, and the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Religion, and reproach and dishonour that God,
who sent his Son into the World to Reveal it, thinking,
<hi>Surely, they will reverence my Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49763:24"/>
It was Self-denial, contempt of the World, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Patience under Injuries, Stupendous Charity,
and very great strictness of Life, that first spread the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Religion; and the Apostles having shewn us the way,
we should have trod in their steps, and if we had, we
should without all peradventure have had the same suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
for God works by Means, and those having been
the Means in the beginning of <hi>Christianity,</hi> they may
justly be supposed to be the genuine Means at this day,
and where those are neglected, it's part of VVisdom to
punish Men for their wilful neglect of those Means, by
suffering <hi>Heathenism</hi> and <hi>Mahometanism,</hi> not only to
continue unmolested, but to grow and advance every
day more and more, to the weakening of the Christian
Interest; for no <hi>wounds</hi> provoke so much as those which
are given God in the House of his <hi>Friends,</hi> as we see by
Gods proceedings with the <hi>Jews,</hi> both in their first and
second Captivity.</p>
            <p>So that notwithstanding this seeming inequality of
Providence, Gods VVisdom continues unspotted, and
we have reason to give it the highest Encomiums and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrations.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Lord reigneth;</hi> Let's not despair, when either
Publick or Private Calamities fall upon us. God is our
Refuge, a present help in the time of trouble, therefore
will we not fear, though the Earth be moved, and
though the Mountains be carried into the midst of the
Sea, though the VVaters thereof roar, and be troubled,
though the Mountains shake with the swelling thereof,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 46. 1. with this <hi>Psalm, Pachomius</hi> is said to have chased
away a Legion of Devils from his Cell, and I see no
reason, but it may serve to support the Soul in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
dangers. However things go, God is still good to
<hi>Israel,</hi> to them that are of a clean heart; what ever Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
arise, <hi>Go tell the Righteous,</hi> saith God, <hi>it shall be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49763:24"/>
well with him.</hi> What comfort must this be to a serious
Christian! though every thing goes contrary to his
wishes and expectations, yet he may be cofident, that
from those contrarieties of Providence his Soul shall be
refresh'd. The Prophet therefore had reason to cry,
<hi>Es. 50. 10. Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that
obeyeth the voice of his Servant that walks in darkness, and
hath no light, let him trust in the name of the Lord, and
stay upon his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From such a chearful Confidence we may promise our
selves great matters, for God looks upon himself as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to reward our extraordinary Faith with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Providence, as we see in the poor VVidow of
<hi>Sarepta;</hi> who had the courage to give the remainder of
the Meal and Oyl she had, to the man of God, and was
therefore miraculously supplied in the time of Famine.
<hi>Christ</hi> could do no mighty works in his own Countrey,
because of the Peoples unbelief, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 5, 6. it's our
diffidence in the time of danger, that makes God stay
his hand, and our unbelief keeps the former and latter
rain of his favour from us. To trust God, when the
Figg-Tree doth not blossom, and to rely upon his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when the labour of the Olive doth fail, is the way
to see Miracles, and a preparative for the richest Mercies.</p>
            <p>Let come, what will come upon us, nothing can
come, but by the order and Providence of God, infinitely
Good, and infinitely VVise; And what is there, that can
come amiss, if it come from these two Fountains? If
Infinite Goodness sends that, which the VVorld calls Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
upon me, most certainly there can be no hurt in it;
and if Infinite VVisdom sends it, most certainly, it must
be best for me, for if Infinite VVisdom thinks it so, my
shallow Understanding hath reason to submit to its most
solid Judgment: God denies me what I would have,
because he would fain give me, what I should have.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49763:25"/>
That which he takes away, may be I do not want, and
that Grace, I stand in need of, may be I cannot have,
without the other be taken away. A Temporal Blessing
sometimes stands in the way of a Spiritual one, and if
the lesser be taken away to make room for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it's no more, but what mine own VVisdom would
approve of in more trivial concerns. God would have
me follow him, not for the <hi>Loaves,</hi> but for the <hi>Miracles</hi>
of his Love, and if to make me enamoured with him,
he sees it necessary to take away the <hi>Loaves,</hi> it's no more
than what a VVise <hi>Physician</hi> doth to a Patient, from
whose Lips he takes away the pleasant Draught, to make
way for a more wholsom Potion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord reigneth:</hi> Rejoyce Christian; Let <hi>Israel</hi>
rejoyce in him that made him, and let the Children of
<hi>Zion</hi> be joyful in their King: Fear not thou Worm <hi>Jacob,</hi>
when affliction, when trouble, when anguish comes,
when the VVaves and Billows of the VVaters of <hi>Marah</hi>
rise. Thy God reigneth, thy King watches over thee,
the All-sufficient God is thy refuge, and thy hiding place.
Surely he shall deliver thee from the Snare of the Fowler,
and from the noisom Pestilence: He shall cover thee
with his Feathers, and under his Wings shalt thou trust,
his Truth shall be thy Shield and Buckler; Thou shalt
not be afraid for the Terrour by Night, nor for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that flieth by Day, nor for the Pestilence that walks
in Darkness, nor for the Destruction that wasteth at
Noon-day; a thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten
thousand at thy Right hand, but it shall not come nigh
thee.</p>
            <p>Nothing can hurt a good Christian, for whom is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Crown Righteousness in Heaven; Men may
prejudice his Body, but they cannot hurt his Soul; They
may rob him of his Goods, but they cannot take away
his Graces; They may imprison him, but they cannot
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49763:25"/>
keep God out of his Heart; They may beat him, but
they cannot ruine him; They may make this World
bitter to him, but they cannot hinder him from feeding
on the sweet Promises of the Gospel. God is thy Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
<hi>Christian,</hi> therefore thou shalt not want. He will
anoint thy Head with Oyl, and spread a Table for thee
in the midst of thy Enemies, nay, thy Cup shall run
over Goodness and Mercy shall follow thee all the
days of thy life, and thou shalt dwell at last in the House
of God for ever, even in that House, made without hands,
Eternal in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Lord reigneth:</hi> Let's chearfully submit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to his Government; Shall we pretend to be his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and not be Ruled by him? Shall we call him our
King, and follow our own Imaginations? Shall he only
have the name of our Ruler, while we are resolved to
be guided by the Flesh, and by the World? This were
to call him King in jest, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did our Saviour,
and to bow the Knee before him, while we buffet him,
or run our Sword into his Bowels. Kings on Earth,
though they can give Protection to their Subjects, yet
they cannot give them being, nor keep their Souls in
life, nor protect them from outward and inward troubles.
God who is your King, not only can do all this, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
doth it, and consequently the Motives to be ruled
and governed by him, are far greater. I will not launch
out here into the vast Sea of his Mercies, what he hath
done for our Souls and Bodies, how he hath been with
us, when we have gone through the Waters, and with
us, when we have passed through the Fire, how he hath
loved us in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and what pains he takes with
our Immortal Souls, to make them happy; What a
bountiful, what a charitable, what a condescending
Prince he hath been to us upon all occasions; what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
we reap by his Government, and how every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49763:26"/>
he gives us instances of his kindness. It's enough to
put you in mind, that you acknowledge him to be your
King, and that <hi>word</hi> imports obedience to his Laws,
else he is either no King to you, or you are Rebels and
Apostates.</p>
            <p>But while I exhort you to be Ruled and Governed by
him, I must not forget, to tell you the measures, you
are to observe in your Submission to his Government,
and they are these following;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Take heed of thinking, that you please the great
King of Heaven, by disobeying your King here on Earth
in things lawful, and not contrary to the Word of God.</hi>
It's impossible you can believe the truth of the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
think so. Obeying God, and being subject to the higher
Powers, are not contrary, but subordinate Duties. To
think you are Saints, when you have courage to control
the Orders of your Superiors, is a sign of a graceless
heart; and to fancy, it's Religion, to laugh at what the
Supream Magistrate Commands, is to exclude your
selves from the Kingdom of Heaven. Such <hi>Divinity</hi>
was never heard of in the World, till Vice and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
had debaucht it, and had such Doctrines been
broacht in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, they would have
called them Rebellion and Heresie. The Primitive Saints
never contradicted the Laws of their Superiors, but
where God gave an express Command to the contrary,
and they look't upon't as pride and peevishness to shew
disrespect to that Order of Men, which God intended as his
Vice-gerents. It was not the wickedness of their Prince,
made them neglect their Duty to his Person, nor could
the Injuries he did them, tempt them to forget their
Obedience. They remembred, what Authority there
was in the Country they lived in, it was of God, and
because it was so, thought themselves obliged to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49763:26"/>
not so much for Terrour, as for Conscience sake.
That <hi>Dominion is founded in Grace,</hi> was a Principle, the
<hi>Apostles</hi> had never taught them, and they justly found
fault with those that tore the Orders of the Magistrate,
which were given for their Persecution and Banishment;
where they could not comply, they suffered, and thought
it a greater piece of Devotion, to be Patient under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and Oppositions, than to be their own Carvers,
by repelling Force by Violence. <hi>Christ</hi> had taught them
not to resist Evil, and they Rationally believed, they
were no <hi>Christians,</hi> except they did whatsoever he did
Command them.</p>
            <p>The Wisdom which is from above, is without Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
and he that assents to what God saith, in one
thing, but not in another, shews, that the love of the
Father is not in him. Where the Conscience suspects
the Magistrates Command, as unlawful, it must suffer
it self to be informed, not only by persons that serve an
Interest, but Impartial Men; and care must be taken,
that what we call Conscience, is not unwillingness to
cross our Pride or Humour. Conscience is too often
pretended, when we have hardened our selves into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and therefore the best Rule to go by, in such
cases, is to lay by Interest, and hearken to the clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of unbyassed Reason. When the Magistrate
Commands a thing that's doubtful, it's safer to keep
our selves to a known Duty, which is submission to their
Orders, than to be obstinate in an uncertain conclusion;
and that Christian is likest to have the greatest peace,
that walks on the surest side of the Hedge.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Then you submit to him, when you reign over your
inordinate desires and passions;</hi> When you curb your
anger, restrain your lusts, moderate your joys, bid
your grief and sorrow break forth into Tears for your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49763:27"/>
Sins, watch over your Sensual Delights, and keep them
within bounds, mortifie your hatred to your fellow
Christians, grow eminent in the Love of God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in charity to your Neighbours, kill your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
and give flame to your Desires after Grace and
Mercy. This government in your little World, is that,
which pleases the King of Heaven, and you then live
like his Subjects, when you Reign and Triumph thus
over your Lusts, and force your Hearts into such reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and reasonable Services. He serves not God, but
himself, that lets his evil Desires reign over him, and is
so far from being submissive to the King of Heaven,
that he makes himself a Vassal of the Devil; This is
the mighty priviledge of all the Loyal Subjects of the
King of Heaven; Their being so, makes them Kings,
and their inordinate Passions, are the Slaves on which
they exercise Dominion and Authority; Over these
God gives them power, and it hath been acknowledged
by all Wise Men, that he that conquers these Rebels, is
a greater Commander, than he that lays whole Cities
and Countreys waste; for in wasting these, he acts
according to his Brutish Desires, but in conquering
those Desires, he overcomes himself, and in that consists
the perfection of Vertue.</p>
            <p>Without a serious attempt of this Self-conquest,
your Prayers prevail not in Heaven, and the little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
you pay the Immortal King, are rejected, as
sapless Services. Without this, your New Moons, and
solemn Assemblies are Abominations, and your treading
the Courts of the Lord is looked upon, as the Sacrifice
of Fools. The King above is not for outward shews,
and he that doth not give him the inward Man, as well
as the outward, instead of paying Homage to him,
turns his Grace into wantonness. The restraining of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49763:27"/>
one inordinate Desire, is more valued in Heaven, than
twenty formal Prayers, and the curbing of one Passion,
receives greater applauses from the Holy Angels, than a
hundred <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me's.</hi> That one act of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
in resisting the Temptations of his Mistress, and
his own Natural Desires, God approved of more, than
of all the Peace-offerings of the Harlot in the <hi>Proverbs,
chap. 7. vers.</hi> 14. And <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s Tears and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for Sins, melted <hi>Christs</hi> heart more, than all the
pompous Devotions of the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> for in this Sorrow,
she reigned gloriously over her sinful Inclinations, while
the other continued a Slave to his desire of Vain-glory.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Then you submit to him, and acknowledge him for
your King, when you seek first his Kingdom, and his
Righteousness;</hi> When you offer unto God the best of
your Flock, and let the World have his refuse, and
leavings. To give God the sleepiest hours of the day,
and to bestow the most lively upon the World, is not to
acknowledge him for your King, but to make him the
VVorlds Servant; and to give him the Lame and Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
while your profit, and gain engrosses the Sound,
and the fat of your thoughts, is Preposterous Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
To Sin as long as you can, and then to turn to
him, is to play with Religion, and most certainly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
looks so like Mockery, as to think of being serious,
when you can serve the VVorld and the Flesh no longer.
Either God is not the best of Beings, if he must not have
our Principal Adorations; or if he be, our warmest
Affections must of necessity be his due. First to secure
our Temporal Interest, and then to think of making sure
of the Everlasting Riches, is to imagine, that Death
will stay for us; And to give our Youth and tender
years to the Devil, is to say our Lesson, as they say,
VVitches do the Lords Prayer, backward. To be sure,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49763:28"/>
this is not to be Subject to that King, who in his actions,
is ever Orderly and Regular, and therefore requires his
Subject; should be so too.</p>
            <p>No Man serves him, that doth not serve him orderly,
and to begin our Day, and all our lawful VVorks, and
Enterprizes with him, to Consecrate to him the Morning
and Strength os our Age, and to make our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Temporal Interest, truckle to his VVill, is true
<hi>Canonical Obedience.</hi> Those that do so, shall reign with
him in that Life, his Son hath promised in the Gospel;
who died for this end, that such as yield to these Terms
might wear Crowns in Heaven, Crowns not like those
of perishable Gold, which decay with Age and Time,
but Crowns immarcescible, Crowns which Angels wear,
Crowns of Glory, Crowns which are made splendid by
the Light of Gods Countenance, Crowns made of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Light, Crowns which will shine, when the
Sun shall shine no more, Crowns which will glitter,
when the Stars shall have done twinckling; in a word,
Crowns, the thoughts of which, will transport the
Souls that are incircled with them, into Everlasting
Comforts and Consolations.</p>
