            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Answerable to this dignitie there is also a two folde vse: one, in that it serueth to collect the Church, and to accomplish the number of the Elect: the other, for that it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth away the Woolues from the foldes of the Lord. For this is indeede that <hi>Flexanima,</hi> that allurer of the Soule, whereby mens froward mindes are miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and moued from an vngodly and barbarous life vnto Christian faith and repentance. This also is that Engine, which as it hath shaken (the foundation of) auncient heresies, so it hath in these few by-past yeares, cut asunder the sinews of that great Antichrist.

Therefore, when I saw this common place so handled of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as that it would remaine naked and poore, if all other arts should call for those things, which are their owne: I perused the writings of Diuines, and hauing gathered some rules out of them, I haue couched them in that methode, which I haue deemed most commodious: that they might be better for vse, and fitter for the memorie. I doe also publish them, that they might be approoued, if they bring with them that which is good: if any euill, that they may receiue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued punishment.

               <p>The perfection is either the sufficiencie or the puritie. The sufficiencie is that, whereby the word of God is so compleat, that nothing may be either put to it, or taken from it, which appertaineth to the proper end thereof. Psal. 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the soule.</hi> Deut. 12. 32. <hi>Whatsoeuer I commaund you, take heede yee doe it: thou shalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom.</hi> Reuel. 22. 18. 19.</p>
               <p>The puritie thereof is, whereby it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth entire in it selfe, voide of deceit and errour, Psalm. 12. 6. <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words, as siluer tried in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of earth fined seuen times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eternity of the word is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27583:11"/>
it abideth inuiolable, and cannot passe vntill all that, which it commandeth, bee fully accomplished, Matth. 5. 18.</p>
               <p>The excellencie of operation is that, wherby it is endowed with virtue; first to discerne the spirit of man, Heb. 4. 12. <hi>For the word of God is liuely, and mightie in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and sharper then any two-edged sword, and entreth through euen to the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding asunder of the soule and spirit, and of the ioynts and the marrow, aad discerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to bind the conscience. Iam. 4. 12. <hi>There is one Law-giuer, who is able to saue and to destroy.</hi> Esa. 33. 21. <hi>The Lord is our Iudge, the Lord is our Law-giuer, the Lord is our King, he will saue vs.</hi> To bind the conscience is to constraine it either to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse vs or to excuse vs of sinne before God.</p>
               <p>The Word is in the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Scripture is the word of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a language fit for the Church by men immediately called to be the <hi>Clerks</hi> or <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the holy Ghost. 2.

The <hi>New</hi> Testament is the second part of the Scripture written in the Greeke tongue by the Apostles, or at least appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them, propounding plainely the doctrine of the new couenant.

               <p>The new Testament containeth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Histories, and partly Epistles. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories are:</p>
               <p n="1">1 The foure Gospels of Matthew, Marke, Luke, and Iohn: which are an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27583:15"/>
of the life, deedes, and doctrine of Christ exhibited vnto the world, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his conception euen vntill his ascension into heauen.</p>
               <p>And there are foure writers: two that were hearers, and two that were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that they might giue greater assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of the historie.</p>
               <p>The difference betwixt the Euangelists is on this wise: Matthew layeth open the doctrines which Christ deliuered. Marke sets downe the historie briefly: yet did he not make an abridgement of the Gospell which Matthew wrote, as Hierome sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. For hee begins his discourse in a diuers manner, and proceedes in another order, partly intreating of things more largely, and partlie interlacing of new matters. Luke aimeth at or frameth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect historie, and described in a certaine order. Iohn is almost wholy taken vp in laying open the Godhead and benefit of Christ, which is deriued from his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Hierome distinguisheth the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists by their beginnings or entrance. He saith Matthew is like a <hi>man,</hi> because hee


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27583:15"/>
begins with the <hi>Man-hood</hi> of Christ. He likens Marke to a <hi>Lion,</hi> because hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the preaching of Iohn, which was like the roaring of a Lion. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Luke to an <hi>Oxe,</hi> because he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with Zacharie the Priest offering his sacrifice. He compareth Iohn to an <hi>Eagle,</hi> because he doth (as it were) so are vp aloft and begin with the <hi>Godhead</hi> of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The Acts of the Apostles,</hi> which is an orderly historie, specially relating the deeds of Peter and Paul: that there might be an ensample of gouerning the Church extant. 2. Tim. 3. 10. 11.</p>

                  <hi>And thus the Canonicall Scripture is distinguished by her bookes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are verie strong proofes, which shew that she alone is the word of God, and no other besides.</p>
               <p>Of these proofes one doth make a man certainelie to <note n="*" place="margin">Probatio <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> know the same, the other doth but declare or testifie it.</p>
               <p>Of the former kind there is onelie one, namely the inward testimony of the holy Ghost speaking in the Scriptures, and not only telling a man within in his heart, but also effectually perswading him that these bookes of the Scripture are the word of God. Isai. 59. 21. <hi>My Spirit, that is vpon thee, and my words which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth‚Äîfrom henceforth euen for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:27583:17"/>
The manner of perswading is on this wise: The Eelect hauing the Spirit of God doe first discerne the voyce of Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the scriptures. Moreouer, that voyce, which they doe discerne, they doe approoue: and that which they doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, they doe beleeue. Lastly, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing they are (as it were) sealed with the seale of the Spirit. Ephe. 1 13. <hi>Wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so after that ye beleeued, yee were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church also may beare witnesse of the Canon, perswade she cannot. For by this meanes the voyce of the Church should be of greater force then the voyce of God: and the whole state of mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation should depend vpon men; than which what can be said to be more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Scripture is the word of God by it selfe, but it is not so to vs, but by the iudgement of the Church. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The distinction is vaine. For, the first part thereof sheweth the manner, whereby the Scripture is the word of God: the latter part sheweth not the manner how, but the person to whom. 2. The Scripture doth


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27583:17"/>
also testifie the same thing with that kind of testimonie, which is surer euen then all the oathes of men. For we haue the voyce of the holy Ghost speaking in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: who doth also worke in our hearts a certaine (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>) full perswasion of the Scriptures, when we are exercised in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, reading and meditating of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we beleeue a thing, because the Church saith it is to beleeued: but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we doe beleeue a thing, because that which the Church speaketh, the Scripture did first speake. Yea the Church cannot stand, nor yet be imagined without faith: faith is not without the word: which word is the Rule or Obiect of faith: and not the iudgement, though it be of most holy men. 3. He which doubteth of the Scriptures, will doubt as well of the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. The Church hath a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to determine of matters, Act. 15. 28. <hi>It seemeth good to the holy Ghost and to vs. Ans.</hi> 1. The soueraigne or supreame iudgement concerning matters of faith belongeth to the holy Ghost speaking in the Scriptures. The ministerie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27583:18"/>
(or a ministeriall iudgement) is only giuen vnto the Church: because she must iudge according to the Scriptures: and because she doth not this alwaies, but sometimes faileth. 2.

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the studie of Diuinitie take this aduice. First, diligently imprint both in thy mind and memory the substance of Diuinitie described with definitions, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and explications of the properties. Secondly, proceede to the reading of the Scriptures in this order. Vsing a gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, rhetoricall, and logicall <note n="*" place="margin">Opening of the text.</note> analysis, and the helpe of the rest of the arts, reade first the Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Rom. after that the Gospell of <hi>Iohn</hi> (as being indeed the keyes of the new Testament) and then the other books of the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t. will be more easie when they are read. When all this is done, learne first the dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27583:21"/>
bookes of the old Testament, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie the Psalmes: then the Propheticall, especially <hi>Esay:</hi> Lastly the historicall, but chieflie Genesis. For it is likelie that the Apostles and Euangelists read <hi>Esay</hi> and the Psalmes very much. For there are no bookes of the old Testament, out of which we can reade more testimonies to be cited, then out of these. There are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout threescore places alledged out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say:</hi> and threescore and foure out of the Psalmes. Thirdly, out of <note n="*" place="margin">Of sound iu de ement: or sound, &amp; iudicious, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods word.</note> orthodoxall writings, we must get aid not onely from the latter, but also from the more ancient Church. Because Sathan hath raised vp from the dead the old Heretiques, that he might hinder the restoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the Church, which is begun to bee made in our time. For the Antitrinitaries haue newly var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished that opinion of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> The Anabantists renew the doctrines or sects of the Essees, Catharists, Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts, and Donatists. The Swenkseldians reuiue the opinions of the Eutychians, Enthusiasts, &amp;c. <hi>Menon</hi> followeth <hi>Ebion:</hi> and the Papists resemble the Pharisies, Encratites, Tatians, Pelagians. The Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines

renew the opinions of the Gnosticks and Carpocratians. <hi>Seruetus</hi> hath reuiued the heresies of <hi>Samosatenus, Arrius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches, Marcion,</hi> and <hi>Apollinaris.</hi> Lastly, the Schismatiques, that separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from euangelical Churches, receiue the opinions, facts, and fashions of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anus</hi> in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of the Audians, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists. Therefore in like manner, wee must not so much seeke for new repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and confutations of these heresies, as wee are for our vse to fetch those anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ones out of Councils and Fathers, and to accompt them as approued and firme. Fourthly, those things, which in studying thou meetest with, that are necessarie and worthie to be obserued, thou must put in thy tables or Common-place books, that thou maiest alwaies haue in a readines both old and new. Fiftly, before all these things God must carnestly be sued vnto by prayer, that hee would blesse these meanes, and that he would open the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scriptures to vs that are blind. Psalm. 119. 18. <hi>Open mine eies, that I may see the wonderfull things of thy Law.</hi> Reuel. 3. 18. <hi>I aduise thee to buy gold for thee‚Äîand


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27583:22"/>
to annoint thine eyes with eye-salue, that thou maist see.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto pertaineth the framing of Common-place bookes. Concerning which obserue this slender counsel. 1. Haue in readinesse common-place heads of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery point of diuinitie. 2. Distinguish the formost pages of thy paper booke into two columnes, or equall parts length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. In euery one of those pages set in the top the title of one head or chiefe point, the contrarie side remaining in the meane while emptie, that fresh paper may be put to. 3. All things, which thou readest, are not to be written in thy book, but those things that are worthie to bee remembred, and are seldome met with-Neither must thou put the words of the Author in thy common places, but briefly note downe the principall points of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and of things, that thou mayst know from what author to fetch them, when thou shalt haue vse: and make a point in the author himselfe, that thou mayst know, that the thing is there handled, which thou wrotest in thy common-place booke. 4. Because some things do


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27583:23"/>
very often offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>selues with a doubtful signification, so as that thou canst not tell, if thou write the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in thy common places, from whence to fetch them, therefore to thy common places thou must ioyne an alphabeticall table. 5. Alwaies prouided that thou trust not too much to thy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For it is not sufficient to haue a thing written in thy booke, vnlesse it be also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie laid and locked vp in thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>

                  <hi>Opening</hi> of the words and sentences of the Scripture, that one entire and naturall sense may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome maketh 4. senses of the scriptures, the literall, allegoricall, tropological, &amp; anagogicall, as in this her example. <hi>Melchizedek offered bread and wine.</hi> The literall sense is, that the King of Salem with meate which he brought, refreshed the souldiers of <hi>Abraham</hi> being tyred with trauell. The allegoricall is, that the Priest doth offer vp Christin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse. The tropologicall is, therefore something


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27583:23"/>
is to be giuen to the poore. The Anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall is, that Christ in like manner being in heauen, shall be the bread of life to the faithfull. But this her deuice of the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold meaning of the scripture must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded and reiected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is one onelie sense, and the same is the literall.</hi> An allegorie is onely a certaine manner of vttering the same sense. The Anagoge and Tropologie are waies, whereby the sense may be applied.</p>
               <p>The principall interpreter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the holy Ghost. 2. Pet. 1. 20. <hi>So that ye first know this, that no prophecie in the Scripture is of any priuate</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Moreouer, he that makes the law, is the best and the highest interpreter of the law.</p>
               <p>The supreame and absolute meane of interpretation is the Scripture it selfe. Nehem. 8. 8. <hi>And they read in the booke of the Law of God distinctly, and gaue the sense, and caused them to vnderstand by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe, per Scripturam ipsam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meanes subordinated to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are three; the Analogie of faith, the circumstances of the place propounded,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27583:24"/>
and the comparing of places together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>analogie</hi> of faith is a certaine <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement</hi> or <hi>summe</hi> of the Scriptures, collected out of most manifest and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar places. The parts thereof are two. The first concerneth faith, which is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Apostles Creede. The second concerneth charitie or loue, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in the ten Commaundements. 2. Tim. 1. 13. <hi>Keepe the true</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>paterne of the wholsome words, which thou hast heard of me, with faith and loue which is in Christ Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The circumstances of the place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded are these: <hi>Who? to whom? vpon what occasion? at what time? in what place? for what end? what goeth before? what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The collation or comparing of places together, is that, whereby places are set like parallels one beside another, that the meaning of them may more euidentlie appeare. Act. 9. 22. <hi>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Iewes, which dwelt at Damascus, confirming</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, conferring or conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of places of Scriptures, as Artificers

being about to compact or ioyne a thing together are wont to fit all the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues, that one of them may perfectly agree with each other) <hi>that this was that Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Collation of places is two-fold. The first is the comparing of the place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with it selfe cited and repeated else-where in holy writ. Esa. 6. 10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, make their eares heauie, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnderstand with their hearts, and conuert, and he heale them.</hi> This place is sixe times repeated in the new testament. Mat. 13. 14. Marke 4. 12. Luke 8. 10. Iohn 12. 40. Act. 28. 27. Rom. 11. 8.</p>
               <p>Places repeated haue often alterations for sundrie causes. These causes are, first exegeticall, that is, for exposition sake, as</p>

               <p>Analogicall places are such, as haue an apparent meaning agreeable to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of faith, and that at the first view. Concerning these places receiue this Rule:</p>

                  <hi>If the naturall signification of the words

               <p>We must further know, that euery arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and doctrine concerning faith and maners, which is necessary vnto saluation, is very plainely deliuered in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

               <p>In this place the bread is a signe of my

bodie: by a Metonymie of the subiect for the adiunct.</p>
               <p>The fitnes of this exposition.</p>
               <p>First, it agrees with the analogy of faith, 1. <hi>He ascended</hi> truly <hi>into heauen,</hi> that is, he was taken vp out of the earth into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued locally and visibly. Therefore his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is not to be receiued with the mouth at the Communion, but by faith <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending it in the heauen. 2. <hi>Borne of the Uirgin marie, &amp;c.</hi> Therfore he had a true and naturall bodle, being long, broad, thicke, seated and circumscribed in some place. Whereby it appeareth that the bread in the Supper cannot bee properly his very bodie, but only a signe or pledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this sense consenteth with the circumstances of the place propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He tooke, he brake it.</hi> Here it is not likely that Christ sitting amongst his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did take and breake his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with his hands. Therefore the bread is no more then a signe and seale.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:27583:32"/>
2. <hi>Deliuered (or giuen) for you.</hi> The bread can in no wise be said to bee giuen for vs, but the bodie of Christ: therefore the bread is not properly the bodie, but symbolically or by way of signification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Cup is the new Testament,</hi> not properly, but by a Metonymie: therefore nothing hindreth, but that a Metonymie may be as well in these words, <hi>This is my bodie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ himselfe did eate of the bread; but he did not eate himself.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Doe yee this in remembrance of me:</hi> therefore Christ is not corporallie present to the mouth, but spiritually to the faith of the heart.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Untill he come:</hi> therefore Christ is absent in his bodie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Christ said not, <hi>Vnder the forme of bread,</hi> or <hi>in the bread:</hi> but he said, <hi>This,</hi> that is, <hi>This bread is my bodie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this sense accords with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a sacrament: in which wee must make a proportion and resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the signe and the thing signified: which here can bee none, if the bread bee properly the bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:27583:33"/>
Fourthly, it agrees with like places.</p>
               <p>Gen. 17. 10. <hi>This is my couenant, which yee shall keepe betwixt you and me‚Äî.11. Ye shall circumcise the fore-skin of your flesh, and it shall be a signe of the couenant between me and you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Cor. 10. 4. <hi>They dranke of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Rocke, that followed them: and the Rocke was Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rom. 4. 11. <hi>Hee receiued the signe of Circumcision, which might seale the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Exod. 12. 1. <hi>The Lambe is the Lords Passeouer.</hi> Verse 13. <hi>It is a signe of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ouer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Act. 2. 38. <hi>Be baptised for the remission of sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ioh. 6. 35. <hi>And Iesus said vnto them, I am the bread of life: he that commeth vnto me shall not hunger, and hee that beleeueth in me shall neuer thirst.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The cup of blessing which wee blesse, is it not the Communion of the bloud of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</hi> that is, a signe of the communion.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it agreeth with the lawes of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique.


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:27583:33"/>
For one disparate is not spoken or predicated of another but by a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed speech.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, it is agreeable to the common custome of speaking. So we put the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sces</hi> or bundle of rods (vsed to bee caried before Magistrates) for <hi>gouernement it selfe:</hi> the <hi>gowne</hi> we put for <hi>peace:</hi> and the <hi>laurell garland</hi> for a <hi>triumph:</hi> as in <hi>Tully,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cedant armatogae, concedat laurea linguae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore this other sense is proper.</p>
               <p>Now from this fruitfull <hi>Rule</hi> doe arise many consectaries or conclusions neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for the vnderstanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

The supply of euery word, which is wanting, is fitting for the place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, if it agree with the analogie (or squire) of faith, and with the circumstances and words of the same place. <hi>As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>

with their conditions. Those are to bee conceiued with the condition of faith and repentance: and these, specially if they bee corporall, with the exception of chastisement and the crosse. Ezech. 33. 14. <hi>When I shall say vnto the wicked, Thou shalt die the death: if he turne from his sin, and do that which is lawfull &amp; right,‚Äî15. he shall surely liue, and not die.</hi> Reuel. 21. 8. <hi>But the fearfull and vnbeleeuers &amp;c. shall haue their portion in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</hi> But in the sixt verse hee annexeth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, saying, <hi>I will giue vnto him that is a thirst of the well of the water of life freely.</hi> Ionah 3. 4. <hi>Yet fourtie daies, and Nineue shall be subuerted.</hi> By those things which follow it appeareth that a condition is to be vnderstood.

                  <p>Hence arose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> distinction in the schooles of the <note n="*" place="margin">Signi. Beneplaciti.</note> Signifying will, and the will of Gods Good-pleasure. The wil of Good-pleasure is that, whereby God doth will something absolutely and simply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any condition, as the creation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the world, and the sending of his Sonne. The Signifying will is that, whereby he willeth somethings for some other thing and with condition: and so wee say, because that the condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed is a signe of the will, that God doth so will.</p>

thinke that the Hebrew and Greeke text is in all copies corrupted through the malice of the Iewes, as <hi>Lindanus</hi> doth wickedly calumniate, and after him all Papists: but that the diuers readings, which in some places haue crept in, either by reason of the vnskilfulnesse or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ouersight of the Notaries, might be skanned and determined.

               </p>
               <p>The foundation of Application is to know whether the place propounded be a sentence of the Law, or of the Gospell. For when the word is preached there is one operation of the Law, and another of the Gospell. For the Law is thus farre forth effectuall, as to declare vnto vs the disease of sinne, and by accident to exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and stirre it vp: but it affords no remedie. Now the Gospel, as it teacheth what is to be done: so it hath also the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the holy Ghost adioyned with it, by whom we being regenerated, we haue strength both to beleeue the Gospell, and to performe those things which it commaundeth. The Law therefore is the first in the order of teaching: and the Gospell second.</p>
               <p>It is a sentence of the Law, which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of perfect inherent righteousnes, of eternall life giuen through the works of


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27583:59"/>
the Law, of the contrarie sins, and of the curse that is due vnto them. Gal. 3. 10. <hi>So many as are of the workes of Law, are vnder the curse; for it is written, cursed is he who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer abideth not in all things, which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them.</hi> Matth. 3. 7. <hi>O generation of Vipers, who hath fore-warned you to flee from the anger to come? 10. And now also is the axe put to the roote of the trees: therfore euery tree, which bringeth not forth good fruit, is cut vp</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>A sentence of the Gospell is that, which speaketh of Christ and his benefits, and of faith being fruitfull in good workes: as, Iohn 3. 16. <hi>So God loued the world, that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeueth in him, should not perish but haue euerlasting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is that many sentences, which seeme to belong to the Law, are by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ to bee vnderstood not legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:27583:63"/>
the faith: as when a man doth teach y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we must beleeue one God and three persons, Father, Sonne &amp; holy Ghost; and that we must relie only vpon the grace of God in Christ; and that wee ought to beleeue the remission of sinnes; and when wee are taught that we ought to repent, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from euill, and to doe that which is good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strong meate</hi> is a speciall, copious, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent and cleere handling of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith: as when the condition of man before the fall, his fall, originall and actuall sinne, mans guiltinesse, free-will, the mysteries of the Trinitie, the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Christ, the personall vnion, the office of Christ, the imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, faith, grace, and the vse of the law, are deliuered out of the word of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and exactly.</p>

                  <p>In such the foundation of repentance ought to bee stirred vp, that is to say, a certaine sorrow which is according to God. 2. Cor. 7. 8. <hi>For though I made you sorrie with a letter, I repent not, though I did repent: for I perceiue that the same E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle made you sorie, though it were but for a season. 9.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sorrow according to God, is a griefe for sinne, euen because it is sinne.</p>
                  <p>To the stirring vp of this affection, in the first place a man must vse the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Law, which may beget contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>Now, that this legall sorrow may be wrought, it is fit to vse some choyce par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the law, which may reprooue some one notable sinne in men that are not as yet humbled.

                  <p>Yea further, if any man being afflicted with the crosse, and with outward calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue only a worldly sorrow, that is, if he mourne not for sinne as it is sinne, but for the punishment of sinne, hee is not by and by to be comforted, but first this sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

is to be turned into that other sorrow which is <note n="*" place="margin">Godly.</note> according to God: as is the counsell of Physitians in the like case.

Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Iesus.</hi> 1.

The fall which is in <hi>apprehending</hi> Christ, is desperation.</p>
                  <p>For the restoring of those that doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, there are to be vsed a <hi>Triall,</hi> and the <hi>Remedie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Triall</hi> or <hi>Search</hi> is either of the cause of the temptation, or of their estate.</p>
                  <p>The triall of the <hi>Cause</hi> is made fitly by priuate confession. Iam. 5. 17. <hi>Confesse your sinnes one to another, and pray for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ye may be healed.</hi> But lest that confession should bee made a kinde of racke or torture, it must be limited with these prouisoes. 1. It ought to be free, and not compelled: because saluation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not vpon it. 2. It must not be of all sinnes, but of those onely which wring the conscience, which vnlesse they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale, greater danger may hang ouer their heads. 3. Let it chiefely be made to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours; yet so as that we must know that it may be safely made to other faithfull men in the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Triall of their <hi>estate</hi> is, whereby we make diligent inquirie whether they be vnder the law, or vnder grace.</p>
                  <p>That this may manifestly appeare, we


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27583:68"/>
must by asking of questions first draw out of them, whether they be displeased with themselues, because they haue displeased God, that is to say, whether they hate sinne as it is sinne: which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of repentance vnto saluation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we must demaund of them, whether they haue or doe feele in their heart a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be reconciled with God, which is the ground of a liuely faith.</p>
                  <p>When Triall is made, the <hi>Remedie</hi> must be applied vnto them out of the Gospell, which is double. First, some euangelicall meditations are to bee often inculcated and pressed vpon them: as 1. That their sinne is pardonable. 2. That the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are generall in respect of beleeuers, and that they are indefinite in respect of particular men, and doe exclude no man. 3. That the will to beleeue is faith, Psalm. 145. 19. Reuel. 21. 6. 4. That sinne doth not abolish grace, but rather (God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all things vnto the good of those that are his) doth illustrate it. 5. That all the works of God are done by contrarie meanes. Secondly, they must be intreated to stirre vp in them in the very bitternes of

It dulleth wit and memorie, because it requireth a threefold memorie for one: the first of the places: the second of the images: the third of the thing that is to be declared.</p>

It is not therefore an vnprofitable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, if he that is to preach doe diligentlie imprint in his mind by the helpe of dspo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition either axiomaticall, or syllogisticall, or methodicall the seuerall doctrines of the place he meanes to handle, the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall proofes and applications of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, the illustrations of the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and the order of them all: in the meane time nothing carefull for the words, <hi>Which</hi> (as <hi>Horace</hi> speaketh) <hi>will not vnwillingly follow the matter that is preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated.

He which through feare doth stumble at one word, doth both trouble the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and confound his memorie. 3. Pronunciation, action, and the holie motions of affections are hindred; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mind is wholly bent on this, to wit, that the memorie fainting now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her burthen may not faile.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> two things are required: the hiding of humane wisedome, and the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (or shewing) of the spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humane wisedome</hi> must bee concealed, whether it be in the matter of the sermon, or in the setting forth of the words: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the preaching of the word is the <hi>Testimonie of God, and the profession of the knowledge of Christ,</hi> and not of humane skill: and againe, because the hearers ought not to ascribe their faith to the gifts of men, but to the power of Gods word. 1. Cor. 2. 1. <hi>When I came vnto you brethren, I came not with the eminencie of eloquence or of wisdome, declaring vnto you the testimonie of God. 2. For I did not decree


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27583:75"/>
to know any thing among you but Iesus Christ, and him crucified. 5. That your faith should not consist in the wisedome of men, but in the power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man thinke that by this meanes barbarisme should bee brought into pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits; hee must vnderstand that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may, yea and must priuatly vse at his libertie the artes, philosophie, and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of reading, whilest he is in framing his sermon: but he ought in publike to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale all these from the people, and not to make the least oftentation. <hi>Artis etiam est celare artem; it is also a point of Art to conceale Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the spirit is, when as the Minister of the word doth in the time of preaching so behaue himselfe, that all, euen ignorant persons &amp; vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers may iudge, that it is not so much hee that speaketh, as the Spirit of God in him and by him. 1. Cor. 2. 4. <hi>Neither was my speech and my preaching in the perswasiue words of mans wisedome, but in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the spirit and of power.</hi> And 14. 42. <hi>If all prophecie, and there enter in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer, or one that is ignorant, hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued

And so the secrets of his hart are disclosed, &amp; so fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon his face, he willworship God, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning word that God indeed is amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g you.</hi> And 4. 19. <hi>I wil come vnto you shortly‚Äîand I wil know not their</hi>

                  <hi>words that are puffed vp, but their power. 20. For the kingdome of God is not in words but in power.</hi> Mich. 3. 8. <hi>I am filled with power by the spirit of the Lord, and with iudgement and might to shew Iacob his defection, and to Israel his sinne.</hi> This makes the ministerie to bee liuely and powerfull. Luk. 11. 27. <hi>And it came to passe, when he had spoken these things, that a certaine woman of the multitude lifting vp her voyce said vnto him, Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the breasts that gaue thee sucke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This demonstration is either in <hi>speech</hi> or in <hi>gesture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>speech</hi> must be <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That speech is <hi>spirituall,</hi> which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit doth teach. 1. Cor. 2. 13. <hi>Which things also we speake, not in the words, which mans wisedome teacheth, but which the holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spirituall things


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27583:76"/>
with spirituall things.</hi> And it is a speech both simple and perspicuous fit both for the peoples vnderstanding and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the maiestie of the spirit. Act. 17. 2. <hi>Paul disputed with them three sabbath dayes out of the Scriptures. 3. Opening</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

Cor. 4. 2. <hi>But wee haue cast from vs the clokes of shame, and walke not in craftines, neither handle we the word of God deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: but in declaration of the trueth wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue our selues to euery mans conscience in the sight of God. 3. If our Gospell be then hid, it is hid to them that perish. 4. In whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes, that is, of the infidels. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore neither the words of arts, nor Greeke and Latin phrases and quirks must bee intermingled in the sermon. 1. They disturbe the mindes of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, that they cannot fit those things which went afore with those that follow. 2. A strange word hindreth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of those things that are spoken.


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27583:77"/>
3. It drawes the mind away from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to some other matter.</p>
               <p>Here also the telling of tales, and all profane and ridiculous speeches must be omitted.</p>
               <p>The speech is gracious, wherein the grace of the heart is expressed. Luk. 4. 22. <hi>And all bare witnes of him, and wondred at the gracious words, which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> Iohn 7. 46. <hi>The Officers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, neuer man spake like this man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grace is either of the Person, or of the Ministerie.</p>
               <p>Grace of the person is the holines of the heart, and an vnblameable life: Which howsoeuer it makes not a Minister, yet is it very necessarie. 1. Because the doctrine of the word is hard both to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and to bee practised, therefore the Minister ought to expresse that by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which he teacheth, as it were by a type. 1. Pet. 5. 3. <hi>Not as though yee were Lords ouer Gods heritage, but that yee may be examples</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> types) <hi>to the flocke.</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 12. <hi>Be an example to the faithfull, both in word and conuersation.</hi> Phil. 4. 8. <hi>Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, brethren, whatsoeuer things are true,


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27583:77"/>
whatsoeuer things are honest‚Äîthinke on these things. 9. Which yee haue both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and receiued, and heard, and seene in me, those things doe, and the God of peace shall be with you.</hi> 2. He that is not godly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he may vnderstand the scriptures, yet doth he not perceiue the inward sense and experience of the word in his heart. Psalm. 25. 8. <hi>The Lord is good and right, therefore he teacheth sinners his way. 9. He maketh the meeke to walke in the Law, and teacheth the meeke his way.</hi> Amos 3. 7. <hi>Surely the Lord God will doe nothing, but he reuealeth his secret to his seruants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Gen. 18. 17. <hi>And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do? 18. Seeing that Abraham shall be indeede the father of a great and mightie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. 29. For I know him that he will command his sonnes and his household after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord to doe righteousnes and iudgement.</hi> 3. It is a thing execrable in the sight of God that godly speech should bee conioyned with an vngodly life. Psalm. 50. 16. 17. <hi>Vnto the wicked God saith, what hast thou to doe to declare mine ordinances, and to take my


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27583:78"/>
couenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest to be reformed.</hi> It is a strange sight to see him, that is the guide of the way to others, to wander out of the way himselfe, and to see a Physitian of others to be full of bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches himselfe in the meane while, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi> speaketh. 4. It is an ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call secret: <hi>That the Minister ought to couer his infirmities, that they bee not seene.</hi> For the simple people behold not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, but the person of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Minister. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> heard <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> willingly, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee was a <hi>good minister,</hi> but because he was <hi>a good man.</hi> Mark. 6. 20. Well saith <note n="*" place="margin">In verse.</note> 
                  <hi>Nazianzene, He that teacheth sound doctrine, and liues wickedly, reacheth that with one hand, which he cleeketh away with the other. Chrysostome</hi> vpon the 25. of Matthew saith: <hi>The doctor of the Church by teaching well and by liuing wel instructeth the people how they ought to liue well: but by liuing ill he doth instruct God how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him.</hi> And in his 30. Hom. in Act. <hi>It is an easie matter to shew wisedome in words, teach me to liue by thy life: this is the best teaching.</hi> For words make not such an impression in the soule as workes doe.


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27583:78"/>
5. A Minister, that is wicked either open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or secretly, is not worthie to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of the most holy, and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. Ier. 15. 19. <hi>Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou returne, then will I bring thee againe and thou shalt stand before me.</hi> Isai. 6. 6. <hi>Then flew one of the Seraphims vnto me with an hot coale in his hand, which hee had taken from the Altar with the tongues. 7. And hee touched my mouth and said, Loe, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquitie shall bee taken away, and thy sinne shall bee purged. 8. Also I heard the voyce of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? and who shall goe for vs? Then I said, Here am I, send me.</hi> Leuit. 10. 3. <hi>Then Moses said to Aaron, This is that which the Lord said, I will be sanctified in them that come neere vnto me, and I will bee glorified before the sight of all the people.</hi> And hence it is that the iudgements of God remaine for wicked Ministers to tremble at. 1. Sam. 2. 17. <hi>Therefore the sinne of the young men was very great before the Lord: for men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the offering of the Lord. &amp;c.</hi> ver. 25. <hi>They obeyed not the voyce of their father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord meant to slay them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:27583:79"/>
The parts of sanctitie are especially, 1. A good conscience. 2. Cor. 1. 12. <hi>For our reioycing is this, the testimonie of our conscience, that in simplicitie and godly sinceritie, and not in fleshly wisedome, but by the grace of God, wee haue had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation in the world.</hi> 1. Timothie 1. 19. <hi>Keeping faith and a good conscience, which some hauing put away as concerning the faith haue made Ship-wreck.</hi> Act. 24. 16. <hi>And herein I endeauour my selfe to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a cleere conscience towards God, and towards men.</hi> If this bee wanting, the mouth of the speaker is shut. Isai. 56. 10. <hi>Their Watchmen are all blind: they haue no knowledge, they are all dumbe dogges, they cannot barke, they lie and sleepe, and delight in sleeping.</hi> 2. An inward feeling of the doctrine to be deliuered. Wood, that is capable of fire, doth not burne, vnles fire be put to it: and he must first be godly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected himselfe, who would stirre vp god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections in other men. Therefore what motions a sermon doth require, such the Preacher shall stirre vp priuatly in his owne mind, that hee may kindle vp the same in his hearers. 3. The feare of God,


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27583:79"/>
whereby, being throughly strucken with a reuerent regard of Gods Maiestie, hee speaketh soberly and moderately. 4. The loue of the people. 1. Thess. 27. <hi>But were gentle amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gst you, as a nurse that cherisheth her children.</hi> And that this affection may appeare, the Ministers dutie is to pray se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and feruently for the people of God. 1. Sam. 12. 23. <hi>God forbid that I should sin against the Lord and cease pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you.</hi> 5. The Minister must also be (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) venerable, that is, such a one as is to be reuerenced for constancie, integritie, grauitie and trueth-speaking, who also knoweth how to performe reuerence to others either priuatly or publikely, as is befitting the persons of all his hearers. 6. Hee must bee (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) temperant, who restraineth inwardly his ouer vehement affections, and hath his outward fashions and gestures moderate and plaine, by the which dignitie and authoritie may bee procured and preserued. Therefore hee must be neither couetous (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> a louer of siluer) nor (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27583:80"/>

               <p>The grace of the ministerie is. 1. to be apt to teach (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) 1. Timothie 3. 2. Now <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decent and laudable if this gift be had, but also that it is so necessary, as that may not be wanting. For this consideration <hi>Nazianzene</hi> refused a bishopricke: and <hi>Theophylact</hi> vpon this place saith, that <hi>this dutie of teaching is especially of all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to be found in Bishops.</hi> In the Nicene and Miletian Councell, this was imposed in stead of a punishment, to hold the name of a Minister, but not to preach the Gospell. 2. Authoritie, whereby he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as the Embassadour of the great <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah.</hi> Tit. 2. 15. <hi>These things speake and exhort, and rebuke with all authoritie.</hi> 1. Pet. 4. 11. <hi>If any man speake, let him speake as the oracles of God.</hi> 3. Zeale, whereby being most desirous of Gods glory he doth endeuour to fulfill and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the decree of election concerning the saluation of men by his ministerie.

               <p>Gesture is either in the action of the voyce or of the bodie.</p>
               <p>The voyce ought to be so high, that all may heare. Isai. 58. 1. <hi>Crie aloud, and spare not: lift vp thy voyce like a trumpet.</hi> Iohn 7. 37. <hi>In that last and great day of the feast Iesus stood vp and cried,</hi> Act. 2. 14. <hi>And Peter standing with the eleuen lift vp his voyce and said.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the doctrine hee ought to bee more moderate, in the exhortation more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and vehement.</p>
               <p>Let there be that grauitie in the gesture of the body, which may grace the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God. It is fit therefore, that the trunke or stalke of the bodie being erect and quiet, all the other parts, as the arme, the hand, the face and eyes haue such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as may expresse and (as it were) vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the godly affections of the heart. The


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27583:81"/>
lifting vp of the eye and the hand signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth confidence. 2. Chron. 6. 13. <hi>Salomon made a brazen scaffold, and set it in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the court‚Äîand vpon it hee stoode, and kneeleddowne vpon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and stretched out his hands towards heauen. 14. And said, O Lord God of Israel, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 7. 55. <hi>And Steuen being full of the holy Ghost, bending his eies vp to heauen beheld the glory of God.</hi> The casting downe of the eyes signifieth sorrow and heauines. Luk. 18. 13. <hi>But the Publican standing afarre off would not so much as lift vp his eyes vnto heauen, but hee smote his breast saying, God be mercifull to me a sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the gesture other precepts cannot be deliuered; only, let the ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the grauest Ministers in this kind be in stead of a <hi>Rule.</hi>
