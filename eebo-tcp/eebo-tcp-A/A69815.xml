         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat poſterity is likely to judge
of theſe matters concerning
Church-diſcipline, wee may
the better conjecture, if wee
call to mind what our own age, within few
yeares, upon better experience hath already
judged concerning the ſame. It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that at firſt, the greateſt part of
the learned in the land were either eagerly
affected, or favourably inclined that way.
The Bookes then written for the moſt part
favoured of the diſciplinary ſtile: it ſounded
every where in pulpits, and in the common
phraſe of mens ſpeech: the contrary part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to feare they had taken a wrong courſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64785:4"/>
many which impugned the diſcipline, yet
ſo impugned it, not as not being the better
forme of government, but as not ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for our State, in regard of dangerous
innovations thereby likely to grow. One
man alone there was, to ſpeake of, (whom
let no ſuſpition of flattery deprive of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
commendation;) Who, in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the one part, and courage of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtood in the gap, and gave others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
to prepare themſelves to their defence;
which by the ſudden eagerneſſe and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their adverſaries had otherwiſe
been prevented. Wherein God hath made
good unto him his owne empreſe, <hi>Vincit
qui patitur,</hi> for what contumelious indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he hath at their hands ſuſtained, the
world is witneſſe; and what reward of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
above his adverſaries God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon him, themſelves (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
glad thereof) muſt needs confeſſe.
Now of late yeares the heate of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Diſcipline is greatly decaied: their
iudgments begin to ſway on the other ſide:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64785:4"/>
the learned haue weighed it and found it
light: wiſe men conceiue ſome feare, leſt it
prove not only not the beſt kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the very bane and deſtruction of
all government. The cauſe of this change in
mens opinions may be drawen from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
nature of error, diſguiſed and clothed
with the name of truth; which is mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and violently to poſſeſſe men at firſt; but
afterwards, the weakneſſe thereof being by
time diſcovered, to looſe that reputation,
which before it had gained. As by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of an houſe the Paſſers by are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
deceived, till they ſee the conveniency
of the roomes within: ſo by the very name
of Diſcipline and Reformation men were
drawen at firſt to caſt a fancy towards it, but
now they have not contented themſelves
only to paſſe by and behold a farre off the
forefront of this reformed houſe; they have
entred in, even at the ſpeciall requeſt of the
Maſter workmen and chiefe Builders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
they have peruſed the roomes, the lights,
the conveniences, they finde them not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64785:5"/>
to that report which was made of
them, nor to that opinion which upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
they had conceived. So as now the
Diſcipline which at firſt triumphed over
all, being unmasked, beginneth to droope
and hang downe her head.</p>
            <p>This cauſe of change in opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Diſcipline, is proper to the
learned, or to ſuch as by them have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed:
another cauſe there is more open
and more apparent to the view of all: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the courſe of practice which the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
have had with us from the begining.
The firſt degree was only ſome ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
about Cap and Surpleſſe, but not ſuch
as either bred diviſion in the <hi>Church,</hi> or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the ruine of the government then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed.
This was peaceable; the next
degree more ſtirring. Admonitions were
directed to the Parliament in peremptory
ſort againſt our whole forme of Regiment:
In defence of them volumes were publiſhed
in Engliſh, in Latin: Yet this was no more
than writing. Devices were ſet on foot to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64785:5"/>
erect the practice of the diſcipline without
authority; yet herein ſome regard of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
ſome moderation was uſed. Behold, at
length it brake forth into open outrage, firſt
in writing by <hi>Martin:</hi> in whoſe kind of
dealing theſe things may be obſerved. 1.
That whereas <hi>T. C.</hi> and others his great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
had alwaies before ſet out the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
as a Queen, and as the daughter of
God, he contrariwiſe to make her more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the people, brought her forth as
a vice upon the ſtage. 2. Which conceit of
his was grounded (as may be ſuppoſed) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this rare policie, that ſeeing the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
was by writing refuted, in Parliament
rejected, in ſecret corners hunted out and
deſcried, it was imagined that by open rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(which to the vulgar is commonly moſt
plauſible) the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall might
have been drawen into ſuch contempt and
hatred, as the overthrow thereof ſhould
have been moſt gratefull to all men, and in a
manner deſired of the common people.
3. It may be noted (and this I know my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64785:6"/>
ſelfe to be true) how ſome of them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they could not for ſhame approve
ſo lewd an action, yet were content to lay
hold on it to the advancement of their
cauſe, acknowledging therein the ſecret
judgements of God againſt the Bps, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that ſome good might be wrought
thereby for his Church, as indeed there
was, though not according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
For, 4. contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that railing ſpirit did not only not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but extreamly diſgrace and prejudice
their cauſe, when it was once perceived
from how low degrees of contradiction at
firſt, to what outrage of contumely and
ſlander they were at length proceeded, and
were alſo likely further to proceed.</p>
            <p>A further degree of outrage was in fact.
Certain Prophets did ariſe, who deeming
it not poſſible that <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſuffer that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
which they did ſo fiercely deſire to
have done, namely, that his holy Saints, the
favourers and fathers of the Diſcipline
ſhould be enlarged, and delivered from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64785:6"/>
and ſeeing no meanes of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
ordinary, were faine to perſwade
themſelves that <hi>God</hi> muſt needs raiſe ſome
extraordinary meanes: and being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of none ſo well as of themſelves, they
forthwith muſt needs be the inſtruments of
this great worke. Hereupon they framed
unto themſelves an aſſured hope, that upon
their preaching out of a peaſe-cart, all the
multitude would have preſently joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and in amazement of mind have
asked them, <hi>Viri fratres, quid agimus?</hi>
whereunto it is likely they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
an anſwer farre unlike to that of S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> ſuch and ſuch are men unworthy to
govern, pluck them down; ſuch and ſuch
are the deare children of <hi>God,</hi> let them be
advanced. Of two of theſe men it is meet to
ſpeake with all commiſeration, yet ſo that
others by their example may receive inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and withall ſome light may appeare
what ſtirring affections the Diſcipline is
like to inſpire, if it light upon apt and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
minds. Now if any man doubt of what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64785:7"/>
ſociety they were, or if the reformers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
them, pretending that by them they
were condemned, let theſe points be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
1. <hi>Whoſe aſſociats were they before
their entring into this frantick paſsion? Whoſe
Sermons did they frequent? Whom did they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire?</hi>
2. Even when they were entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, <hi>Whoſe adviſe did they require?</hi> and when
they were in, <hi>whoſe approbation? Whom adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
they of their purpoſe? Whoſe aſsiſtance by
prayers did they requeſt?</hi> But wee deale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly
with them to lay this to their
charge: for they reproved and condemned
it. How? did they diſcloſe it to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that it might be ſuppreſſed? or were
they rather content to ſtand aloofe and ſee
the end of it, and loath to quench the ſpirit?
No doubt theſe mad practitioners were of
their ſociety, with whom before, and in the
practiſe of their madneſſe they had moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.
Hereof read Doct. <hi>Bancrofts</hi> book.</p>
            <p>A third inducement may be to diſlike of
the Diſcipline, if we conſider not only how
farre the reformers themſelves have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64785:7"/>
but what others upon their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have built. Here come the <hi>Browniſts</hi> in
the firſt ranke, their lineall deſcendants, who
have ſeiſed upon a number of ſtrange opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereof although their Anceſtors the
reformers were never actually poſſeſſed, yet
by right and intereſt from them derived, the
<hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Barrowiſts</hi> hath taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them. For if the poſitions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
be true, I cannot ſee how the maine
and generall concluſions of <hi>Browniſme</hi>
ſhould be falſe. For upon theſe two points,
as J conceive they ſtand, 1. <hi>That becauſe we
have no Church, they are to ſever themſelves
from us: 2. That without Civill authority they
are to erect a Church of their owne.</hi> And if the
former of theſe be true, the latter, I ſuppoſe
will follow. For if above all things men be
to regard their ſalvation, and if out of the
Church there be no ſalvation; it followeth,
that if we have no Church, we have no
meanes of ſalvation, and therefore ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from us, in that reſpect, both lawfull and
neceſſary: as alſo that men ſo ſeparated
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64785:8"/>
from the falſe and counterfeit Church, are
to aſſociate themſelves unto ſome Church;
not to ours; to the Popiſh much leſſe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to one of their owne making. Now
the ground of all theſe inferences being this,
that in our Church there is no means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
is out of the Reformers Principles
moſt clearely to be proved. For whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any matter of faith unto ſalvation neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
is denied, there can be no meanes of
ſalvation: but in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the
Diſcipline, by them accounted a matter of
Faith, and neceſſary to ſalvation, is not only
denied, but impugned, and the profeſſors
thereof oppreſt: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Againe, (but this
reaſon perhaps is weak.) Every true Church
of Chriſt acknowledgeth the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
of Chriſt: the diſcipline, in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is a part of the Goſpell, and yet by our
Church reſiſted, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Againe, The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is eſſentially united to the Church: by
which terme, <hi>eſſentially,</hi> they muſt meane
either an eſſentiall part, or an eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.
Both which waies it muſt needs be,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64785:8"/>
that where that eſſentiall Diſcipline is not,
neither is there any Church. If therefore
between them and the <hi>Browniſts</hi> there
ſhould be appointed a ſolemne Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereof with us they have been often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſo earneſt Challengers: it doth not yet
appeare what other anſwer they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
frame to theſe and the like Arguments,
wherewith they might be preſſed, but faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deny the concluſion, (for all the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are their own) or rather ingeniouſly to
reverſe their own principles before laid,
whereon ſo foule abſurdities have been ſo
firmely built. What further proofes you
can bring out of their high words, magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Diſcipline, I leave to your better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:
but above all points, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
this one ſhould be ſtrongly inforced
againſt them, becauſe it wringeth them
moſt of all, and is of all others (for ought I
ſee) the moſt unanſwerable. You may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſay that you would be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glad theſe their poſitions might ſo be ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as the <hi>Browniſts</hi> might not appeare to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64785:9"/>
have iſſued out of their loines: but untill
that be done, they muſt give us leave to
thinke that they have caſt the ſeed whereout
theſe tares are growen.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of men there is, which have
been content to run on with the reformers
for a time, and to make them poore Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their owne deſignes. Theſe are a
ſort of godleſſe politicks, who perceiving
the plot of Diſcipline to conſiſt of theſe two
parts, the overthrow of Epiſcopall, and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Presbitriall Authority, and that this
later can take no place till the former be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
are content to joyn with them in
the diſtructive part of Diſcipline, bearing
them in hand, that in the other alſo they
ſhall find them as ready. But when time
ſhall come, it may be they would be as loath
to be yoaked with that kind of regiment, as
now they are willing to be releaſed from
this. Theſe mens ends in all their actions,
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their pretence and colour, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
Thoſe things which under this
colour they have effected to their own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64785:9"/>
good, are 1, by maintaining a contrary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
they have kept the Clergy alwaies in
awe, and thereby made them more pliable
and willing to buy their peace. 2. By main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an opinion of equality among Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
they have made way to their own
purpoſes for devouring Cathedrall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Bps Livings. 3. By exclaiming
againſt abuſes in the Church they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
their own corrupt dealings in the civill
ſtate more covertly. For, ſuch is the nature
of the multitude, they are not able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
many things at once, ſo as being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with diſlike or liking of any one
thing, many other in the meane time may
eſcape them without being perceived. 4.
They have ſought to diſgrace the Clergy in
entertaining a conceit in mens minds, and
confirming it by continuall practiſe, that
men of learning, and ſpecially of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
which are imployed in the chiefeſt kind
of learning, are not to be admitted, or ſpare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
admitted to matters of State; contrary
to the practiſe of all well governed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64785:10"/>
and of our own till theſe late
yeares.</p>
            <p>A third ſort of men there is, though not
deſcended from the reformers, yet in part
raiſed and greatly ſtrengthened by them,
namely the curſed crew of <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> This
alſo is one of thoſe points, which J am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
you ſhould handle moſt effectually,
and ſtraine your ſelfe therein to all points of
motion and affection, as in that of the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
to all ſtrength and ſinewes of reaſon.
This is a ſort moſt damnable, and yet by the
generall ſuſpition of the world at this day
moſt common. The cauſes of it, which are
in the parties themſelves, although you han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in the beginning of the fift booke, yet
here againe they may be touched; but the
occaſions of helpe and furtherance which
by the reformers have been yeilded unto
them, are, as I conceive, two, ſenceleſſe
preaching, and diſgracing of the Miniſtry;
for how, ſhould not men dare to impugne
that which neither by force of reaſon, nor
by authority of perſons is maintained: But
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64785:10"/>
in the parties themſelves theſe two cauſes I
conceive of Atheiſme. 1. More abundance
of Wit than judgement, and of Witty than
Iudicious learning; whereby they are more
inclined to contradict any thing, than wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be informed of the truth. They are
not therefore men of ſound learning for the
moſt part, but ſmatterers, neither is their
kind of Diſpute ſo much by force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as by ſcoffing. Which humour of
ſcoffing and turning matters moſt ſerious
into merriment, is now become ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as we are not to marvaile what the
Prophet meanes by the ſeat of ſcorners, nor
what the Apoſtels by fore-telling of ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to come: our own age hath verified
their ſpeech unto us. Which alſo may be an
Argument againſt theſe ſcoffers and <hi>Atheiſts</hi>
themſelves, ſeeing it hath been ſo many ages
agoe foretold, that ſuch men the later daies
of the world ſhould afford; which could
not be done by any other ſpirit ſave that
whereunto things future and preſent are
alike. And even for the maine queſtion of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64785:11"/>
the Reſurrection, whereat they ſtick ſo
mightily, was it not plainly fore-told that
men ſhould in the later times ſay, <hi>Where is
the promiſe of his coming?</hi> Againſt the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Arke, and divers other points, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are ſaid to be taken; the ground
whereof is ſuperfluity of wit without
ground of learning and judgement. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cauſe of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> is ſenſuality, which
maketh men deſirous to remove all ſtops
and impediments of their wicked life: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which becauſe Religion is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
ſo as neither in this life without ſhame
they can perſiſt therein, (nor if that be true)
without torment in the life to come, they
whet their wits to annihilate the joyes of
Heaven, wherein they ſee (if any ſuch be)
they can have no part, and likewiſe the
pains of hell, wherein their portion muſt
needs be very great. They labour therefore
not that they may not deſerve thoſe pains,
but that, deſerving them, there may be no
ſuch pains to ſeize upon them. But what
conceit can be imagined more baſe then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64785:11"/>
that man ſhould ſtrive to perſwade himſelfe
even againſt the ſecret inſtinct (no doubt) of
his own mind, that his ſoule is as the ſoule
of a beaſt, mortall and corruptible with the
body. Againſt which barbarous opinion
their own <hi>Atheiſme</hi> is a very ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For were not the ſoule a nature ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from the body, how could it enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
diſcourſe of things meerely ſpirituall, and
nothing at all pertaining to the body? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſoule were not able to conceive any
thing of heaven, no not ſo much as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
againſt heaven, and againſt God, if
there were not in it ſomewhat heavenly,
and derived from God.</p>
            <p>The laſt which have received ſtrength &amp;
encouragement from the reformers are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;
againſt whom although they are moſt
bitter enemies, yet unwittingly they have
given them great advantage. For what can
any enemy rather deſire then the breach and
diſſention of thoſe which are Confederates
againſt him? wherein they are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that if our Communion with Papiſts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64785:12"/>
in ſome few Ceremonies doe ſo much
ſtrengthen them, as is pretended, how much
more doth this diviſion and rent among our
ſelves, eſpecially ſeeing it is maintained to
be, not in light matters only, but even in
matter of faith and ſalvation. Which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching
ſpeech of theirs, becauſe it is ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to advantage both for the <hi>Barrowiſt,</hi> and
the Papiſt, we are to wiſh and hope for, that
they will acknowledge it to have been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
rather in heat of Affection, then with
ſoundneſſe of judgement, and that through
their exceeding love to that creature of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
which themſelves have bred, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and maintained, their mouth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of her did ſomewhat overflow.</p>
            <p>From hence you may proceed (but the
means of connextion I leave to your ſelfe)
to another diſcourſe, which I think very
meet to be handled either here or elſewhere
at large: the parts whereof may be theſe:
1. That in this cauſe between them and us,
men are to ſever the proper and eſſentiall
points and controverſy, from thoſe which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64785:12"/>
are accidentall. The moſt eſſentiall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
are theſe two, overthrow of Epiſcopall
erection of Presbyteriall authority. But in
theſe two points whoſoever joyneth with
them is accompted of their number; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
in all other points agreeth with
them, yet thinketh the authority of Biſhops
not unlawfull, and of Elders not neceſſary,
may juſtly be ſevered from their retinew.
Thoſe things therefore which either in the
perſons, or in the Lawes and orders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are faulty may be complained on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and amended; yet they no
whit the neere their maine purpoſe. For
what if all errors by them ſuppoſed in our
Liturgy were amended, even according to
their own hearts deſire? if <hi>Non-reſidence,
Pluralities,</hi> and the like, were utterly iaken
away; are their Lay-elders therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
authorized, their Soveraigne Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
Iuriſdiction eſtabliſhed?</p>
            <p>But even in their complaining againſt
the outward and accidentall matters in
Church-government, they are many waies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64785:13"/>
faulty. 1. In their end which they propoſe
to themſelves. For in declaiming againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes,
their meaning is not to have them
redreſſed, but, by diſgracing the preſent
ſtate, to make way for their own Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
As therefore in <hi>Venice,</hi> if any Senator
ſhould diſcourſe againſt the power of their
Senate, as being either too Soveraigne, or
too weake in government, with purpoſe to
draw their authority to a moderation, it
might well be ſuffered; but not ſo, if it
ſhould appeare he ſpake with purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
another State by depraving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ſo in all cauſes belonging either to
Church or Common-wealth, wee are to
have regard what mind the complaining
part doth beare, whether of amendment, or
of innovation, and accordingly either to
ſuffer or ſuppreſſe it. Their objection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is frivolous, <hi>Why, may not men ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
abuſes?</hi> Yes, but with deſire to cure
the part affected, not to deſtroy the whole.
2. A ſecond fault is in their manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
not only becauſe it is for the moſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64785:13"/>
part in bitter and reproachfull termes, but
alſo becauſe it is unto the common people,
Iudges incompetent &amp; inſufficient, both to
determine any thing amiſſe, for want of skil
and authority to amend it. Which alſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
their intent and purpoſe to be rather
deſtructive than corrective. Thirdly, thoſe
very exceptions which they take, are frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and impertinent: Some things indeed
they accuſe as impious: which if they may
appeare to bee ſuch, God forbid they ſhoud
be maintained.</p>
            <p>Againſt the reſt it is only alleadged, that
they are idle Ceremonies without uſe, and
that better and more profitable might be
deviſed. Wherein they are doubly deceived:
for neither is it a ſufficient plea to ſay, <hi>This
must give place, becauſe a better may be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi>
and in our judgements of better and
worſe, we oftentimes conceive amiſſe,
when we compare thoſe things which are
in deviſe with thoſe which are in practiſe,
for the imperfections of the one are hid, till
by time and triall they be diſcovered: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64785:14"/>
are already manifeſt and open to all.
But laſt of all, (which is a point in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of great regard, and which I am deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to have enlarged) they doe not ſee, that
for the moſt part when they ſtrike at the
ſtate Eccleſiaſticall, they ſecretly wound the
Civill State; For perſonall faults, what can
be ſaid againſt the Church, which may not
alſo agree to the Common-wealth? In both
States men have alwaies been, and will be
alwaies men, ſometimes blinded with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
moſt commonly perverted by paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
many unworthy have been and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in both, many worthy not regarded.
As for abuſes which they pretend to be in
the Lawes themſelves, when they inveigh
againſt <hi>Non-reſidence,</hi> doe they take it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
lawfull or expedient in the Civill-ſtate,
for a man to have a great and gainfull office
in the North, himſelfe continually remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the South? <hi>Hee that hath an office, let
him attend his office.</hi> When they condemne
plurality of livings ſpirituall to the pit of
hell, what think they of infinite of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64785:14"/>
promotions? By the great Philoſopher,
<hi>Pol. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 9. it is forbidden as a thing
moſt dangerous to Commonwealths, that
by the ſame man many great offices ſhould
be exerciſed. When they deride our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
as vaine and frivolous, were it hard
to apply their exceptions even to thoſe civill
ceremonies, which at the Coronation, in
Parliament, and all Courts of Iuſtice are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
Were it hard to argue even againſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
the ordinance of God, as being
a cruell ceremony; againſt the Paſſeover, as
being ridiculous; ſhod, girt, a ſtaffe in their
hand, to eat a lambe?</p>
            <p>To conclude, you may exhort the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
(or what if you direct your Concluſion,
not to the Clergy in generall, but only to the
learned in, or of both Univerſities) you may
exhort them to a due conſideration of all
things, and to a right eſteeme and valuing
of each thing in that degree wherein it
ought to ſtand: for it oftentimes falleth out,
what men have either deviſed themſelves,
or greatly delighted in, the price and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64785:15"/>
thereof they doe admire above deſert.
The chiefeſt labour of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſhould
be to know; of a Miniſter, to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi>
crucified: in regard whereof not only
worldly things, but even things otherwiſe
precious, even the Diſcipline it ſelfe is vile
and baſe: where as now, by the heat of
contention, and violence of affection, the
zeale of men towards the one hath greatly
decayed their love to the other. Hereunto
therefore they are to be exhorted, to Preach
<hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> the mortification of the fleſh,
the renewing of the ſpirit, not thoſe things,
which in time of ſtrife ſeeme precious,
but paſſions being allayed, are
vaine and childiſh.</p>
