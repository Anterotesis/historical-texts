         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE LORD
MARQUIS

            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have mentioned in my other Books,
that I think it not fit I Should Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
unto your Lordship the Single
parts of my Works, before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
all the parts in the Whole;
yet I cannot chuse but declare to the World how
happy I and my works are in your Approvement,
which makes the pastime of my Writing very
Delightfull; besides, it makes me confident and
resolute to put them to the Press, and so to the
Publik view, in despite of these Critical times
and Censorious age, which is apt to find fault
with every Action, let it be never so innocent or
harmlesse, or with any Work although good and
<pb facs="tcp:44350:4"/>
profitable, yet they will sting spiteful Aspersions
on them: But I have heard your Lordship say,
that most men Believe themselves not Wise if
they find no Fault with their Neighbours Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that it is as Easie to find Fault, as it is
Hard to do Well; It seems such men have more
Evil in their Natures, than fustice in their
Censures; but your Lordship, who is full of
Truth and Generosity, Reason and Knowledge,
will give your Opinion Clearly and Uprightly,
and my Works having your Approbation, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not the Dislike of other men, for I have
Dedicated my Self and all my Actions to your
Lordship, as becomes</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:44350:4"/>
            <head>TO THE
READERS
OF MY VVORKS.</head>
            <p>I Know not how to Please All, that are pleased to
Read my Works; for do what I can, Some will
find Fault; and the worst is, that those Faults or
Imperfections, I accuse my-self of in my Praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Epistles, they fling back with a double
strength against my poor harmless Works, which shewes their
Malice and my Truth: And as for my Playes, which they say
are not made up so exactly as they should be, as having no Plots,
Designs, Catastrophes and such like I know not what, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Epistles praefixed before my Playes, that I had
not Skil nor Art to Form them, as they should be, for that
Work was like a Taylors Work to make Cloaths: But many
that find such Faults, are not so good as a Taylor, but meet
Botchers or Brokers, to Patch and Set several Old and New
Pieces together to make up a Play, which I never did, for I
thank my Fates, all is not only New, but my Own, what I have
Presented to the World; But this Age is so Censorious, that
the Best Poets are found Fault with, wherefore it is an Honour
to my Writings, which are so much Inferiour to theirs; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can their Dislikes Deterr me from Writing, for I Write to
Please my Self, rather than to Please such Crabbed Readers.
Yet all my Readers have not been so Cross nor Cruel, for
there are Many, to whom my Endeavours and Works are Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
and the more Honour it is to my Works, as being
Approved and Known by Worthy and Judicious Men, and
Noble Persons; But many Men have more Ill Natures to Find
<pb facs="tcp:44350:5"/>
Faults with their Neighbours, than Virtue to Mend Faults in
Themselves; also they are apt to Censure Other mens Wit,
and yet have None of their Own; the truth is, they are a sort
of Persons that in Playes preferr Plots before Wit, and Scenes
before Humours; in Poëms, Rime before Similizing, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
before Distinguishing; in Theology, Faction before Faith,
and Sophistry before Truth; in Philosophy, Old Authors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
New Truths, and Opinions before Reason; And in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they preferr Artificial Connexions, before Natural
Eloquence: All which makes them Foolish, Censorious, and
Unjust Judges. Wherefore, I desire, these my Orations may
not be Read by such Humour'd men, but by the Just and VVife,
which will be a Satisfaction to me.</p>
            <p>'Tis Probable, had I been a Learned Scholar, I might have
Written my Orations more Short than I have done, but yet
some of them are so short, that had they been shorter, they
would not have been of Force to Perswade, whereas the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of an Orator, or Use of Orations, is to Perswade the
Auditors to be of the Orators Opinion or Belief, and it is not
Probable, that Forcible Arguments or Perswasions can be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in two or three Lines of VVords; Also had I been a
Learned Scholar, I might have Written them more Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously,
and not so Loose, but I affect Freedome and Ease, even
in my Works, of VVritings; Besides, I have Observ'd, that
whatsoever is Bound or Knit Close, is difficult to Disclose, and
for VVritings, whatsoever is very Compendious, requires some
Study to Conceive and Understand the Sense and Defign of
the Authors Meaning: But I hope that Defect or want of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
will not Blemish my VVork, nor Obstruct the Sense of
my Orations, nor Puzzle the Understanding of the Reader.
Only one thing more I desire my Noble Readers, as to Observe
that most of my Orations are General Orations, <hi>viz.</hi> such as
may be spoken in any Kingdome or Government, for I suppose,
that in All, at least in Most Kingdomes and Governments there
are Souldiers, Magistrates, Privy-Counsellours, Lawyers, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and University Scholars.</p>
            <p>VVe have, its true, gotten a Foolish Custom both in our
VVriting and Speaking, to Indeavour more to Match or Marry
VVords together, than to Match and Marry Sense: and Reason
<pb facs="tcp:44350:5"/>
together, which is strange, we should Preferr Shaddows before
Substances, or the Spig or Tap before the Liquor, for VVords
are but to Conveigh the Sense of an Cration to the Ears, and
so into the Understanding of the Hearers, like as Spouts do
VVine into Bottels; and who, that is VVise, will Regard what
the Vessel is, so it be VVholsome and Clean? for should not we
believe those to be Fools, that had rather have Foul VVater
out of a Golden Vessel, than Pure VVine out of Earthen or
VVoodden Vessels? the like may be said for VVords and Sense,
for who, that is VVise, would Choose Choice VVords before
Profitable Reasons? VVherefore, Noble Readers, let me Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you to Leave this Custom in VVriting and Speaking, or
rather be Silently Wife, than Foolish in Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>I have Indeavoured in this Book to Express Perfect Orators,
that Speak Perfect Orations, as to Cause their Auditors to Act,
or Believe, according to the Orators Opinion, Judgement,
Design, or Desire; But before I did put this my Book forth,
Know, Noble Readers, I did Inquire, to find whether any
Person had Composed and Put out a Whole Book of Pure and
Perfect Orations, but I could neither hear of, nor see any such
Works of any Person that Composed and Set forth to the
Publick View, a Book of Pure Orations, Composed out of One
Orators Own Fancy, Wit, and Eloquence. 'Tis true, I have
heard of Single Orations, made by Single Persons, in Single
Parts; Also I have seen Orations mixt with History, wherein
the Substance of the History is the Ground of their Orations;
Also I have seen two Translations call'd Orations, but they
are rather Orations in Name than in Reality, for their Nature
is History, the One contains Relations of several Countries,
in the Other are Relations from several Princes of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Fortunes, or Both, Exprest in an Orators Style; yet
those are not Perfect or Right Orations, but Adulterated, or
rather Hermophrodites. But perchance my Readers will say,
I Understand not True Orations; If I do not, I am Sorry for,
and ask their Pardon for Speaking what I Understand not. But
I desire, Noble Readers, you will not think or believe, I speak
to Illustrate my Own VVorks, and to Detract from the VVorks
of Others, for upon my Conscience I Speak and VVrite as I
Believe, and if I Commit an Error in this Belief, I ask your
<pb facs="tcp:44350:6"/>
Pardon, and if you Excuse me, I shall take it for a Favour and
Obligation.</p>
            <p>I have Written Orations and Speeches of all Sorts, and in
all Places sit for Orations, Speeches, or particular Discourses;
and first imagining my Self and You to be in a Metropolitan
City, I invite you into the Chief Market-place, as the most
Populous place, where usually Orations are Spoken, at least
they were so in Older times, and there you shall hear Crations
Concerning Peace and Warr; but the Generality of the People
being more apt to make Warr, than to keep Peace, I desire
you to Arm your Selves, supposing you to be of the Masculine
Sex, and of Valiant Heroical Natures, to enter into the Field
of Warr; and fince Warrs bring Ruine and Destruction to
One or Some Parties, if not to All, and Loss causes men to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
Peace, out of Warr I bring you into great Disorders,
caused by the Ruins Warrs have made, which I am Sorry for,
yet it Must be so, the Fates have Decreed it; and Misery cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
men to be Prudent and Industrious, by which they come
to Flourish again, at least their Successors, and to shew you
their Industry, I bring you out of the Field of Warr into a
New-built City, where you must stay the Building of it, for it
will be Built Soon, having Many Labourers, and after it is Built,
there being a Large Market-place, you may stand or sit with
Ease and hear the Orations that are there Spoken; and by
Reason, there are some Causes or Cases to be Pleaded, I shall
indeavour to Perswade you, after some time of Refreshment, at
your own Homes, to go into the Courts or Halls of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
after these Causes are Judged or at least Pleaded, I shall
desire you, to Adorn your Selves fit for the Court, then to
Wait upon the Kings Majesty, and if you be Privy-Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
or have any Business or Petitions at the Council-Table,
by the Kings Permission you may Enter into the Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chamber;
but great Monarchs having Many Subjects, whereof
some are more Active than Wise, and more apt to Complain
than to Obey, you may hear the Petitions of the Subjects, and
the Speeches or Orations of the Soveraign, and after a good
Agreement, Unity, and Love, you may Rest your Selves in
Peace, untill such time as your Charity calls you forth to Visit
the Sick, and when as Death hath Releas'd those Sick Persons
<pb facs="tcp:44350:6"/>
of their Pains, Humanity will perswade you to wait on their
Dead Corps to the Grave, and after some Tears showred on
their Graves, and having Dried your Eyes, and Heard some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Reproof and Instructions, you will be Invited as
Bridal-Guests to see some Men and VVomen United in Holy
Matrimony; after the VVedding Ceremonies are ended, you
may, as formerly you have done, go into the Market-place
again, and hear what Orations there are Spoken, wherein one
short Oration concerning the Liberty of Women hath so An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd
that Sex, as after the Mens Orations are ended, they
Privately Assemble together, where three or four take the
place of an Orator, and Speak to the rest; the only Difficulty
will be, to get Undiscovered amongst them, to hear their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Conventicles; but if you regard not what Women say,
you may Ride to a Country Market-Town, and hear a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Gentlemen associate together their Discourse and
Pastime; and if you like not their Pastime, then you may
Walk into the Fields of Peace, to Receive the Sweet and
Healthfull Air, or to View the Curious and Various VVorks of
Nature, and for Variety of Pastime, you may stand or sit under
a Spreading Tree, and hear the Country Clowns or Peasants
speak, concerning their own Affairs and Course of Life; in
which Shady place, Sweet Air, and Happiness of Peace I leave
you, unless you will Travel to see the Government or rather
Disorders in other States or Kingdomes, to which Observation
I will VVait upon you, and when all is in Peace, before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
Home, we will, if you Please, enter some of their Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and hear some School-Arguments, after which return, I
shall Kiss your Hands and take my Leave.</p>

been bred, being a Woman, to publick Affairs,
Associations, or Negotiations, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
I should speak or write wisely., the truth
is, it were more easie and more proper for one of my

probable, my Auditors will think or judge, that
I have done neither. Yet I can assure you, Noble

be acceptable to your Minds, profitable to your

               <head>An Oration for Warr.</head>
               <p>BE not Offended, <hi>Noble Citizens,</hi> if
I labour to perswade my Country,
to make Heroick Warrs, since it is
neither safe, profitable, nor honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for it, to live in sluggish Peace:
for in Peace you become ignorant of the Arts in
War, and living sluggishly, you lose the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of men, and become Effeminate, and having
neither skil nor courage, you cannot expect safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for should you chance to have Enemies, you
would not have abilities to help your selves,
having neither Experience by practice, nor Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
by use and custom; for custom and use work
much upon the natures of men. And as for Arms,
in times of Peace they lie like Garments out of
fashion, never worn, but despised and laught at
as ridiculous things, and men of action like as
arms, they jear and make a mock of. Thus
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44350:9"/>
Martial men and arms in time of Peace are scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
although in time of Warrs they only are a
Kingdomes safety, to guard it from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Indeed, Peace spoils both youth and age,
it makes the one sort Covetous, the other Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:
for aged men study only to get Wealth;
the young men how to spend it. Besides, it
makes the Poor men Richmen's Asses, and Rich
men Poor men's Burdens. Also peace makes old
men Fools, and young men Cowards: for in long
times of Peace grave Counsels are meer gossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
meetings, rather idely to talk, than wisely
to advise, they propound many things, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
not any, debate not, but conclude, and
sometimes find faults, but never help to mend
them. The truth is, for the most part, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make errors, than help to rectifie defects,
and in Warrs they had rather suffer calamity,
than stir for necessity; Neither will they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they are in danger, untill their Enemies
be at their Gates. And as for youth, Peace
quenches out their Heroick spirits and noble
ambitions: for their only ambition is their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
favours, and they will go to no other
Warrs, but <hi>Venus,</hi> where <hi>Cupid</hi> is General,
where they only make Love-skirmishes, and are
shot through their hearts with glances from their
Mistresses eyes. Thus Peace makes men like
Beasts: for in peace they feed like Swine, sport
like Apes, live like Goats, and may be brought
to the Shambles like silly Sheep. Nay, it makes
men not only Live, but Die like Beasts, having
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44350:9"/>
neither spirits, skil nor conduct to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or fight an Enemy. And how should it
be otherwise, when as the young men are only
armed with Vanity, march with Pride, intrench
with Luxury, fight with <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by <hi>Venus?</hi> Thus we may observe, that all
which causes Peace, and takes away the courage
of young Vigorous men, rots their Bodies with
excess, and corrupts their Blood with idleness,
by which their Spirits are quenched, their
Strengths weakned, their Minds softned, and
their Natures become effeminate, which makes
their Lives vacant, and when they die, they are
buried in Oblivion: for Fame lives in Heroick
actions. And surely it is better for Noble men,
to have Fame than Wealth, and for young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
to have Honour than gay Cloaths, and
more honour to have Scarrs, than black Patches,
to fight with an Enemy, than to dance with a
Lady, to march to a Battel, than to tread a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
And for the meaner sort, it is better for
them to wear honourable Arms, than to bear
slavish Burdens; and how happy is that man,
that can raise himself from a low Birth, to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Renown? Thus from the Noblest to the
meanest, Warr is the way to advance them to
honour, if the common Souldiers fight with
courage, and the Nobles command and direct
with skil, for which their Posterity will glory
in their Valours, Poets will sing their Praises,
Historians write their Acts, and Fame keep their
Records, that after ages may know, what He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44350:10"/>
men they were; and as for Kingdomes,
those are safest that are protected by <hi>Mars.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>THe Oration that was last spoken unto you,
hath stirr'd your spirits and incumber'd
your thoughts with Warrs, and your desire for
Warr is such, that you will not only seek for
Enemies, but make Enemies to fight with,
which is neither Heroick nor Just, to fight with
those that have done you no injury or wrong;
and what can be a more unworthy Act, than to
assault peaceable Neighbours? it cannot be call'd
an honourable Warr, but a base Outrage; like as
Pirats at Sea, so you will be Robbers at Land,
taking that from others, which you have no right
to. But say you have some slight injuries done
you, If you were wise, you had better wink at
small faults than make Warrs, which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
your Treasures, wast your Strength, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate
your Nation, and leave your Lands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manured.
Besides, Warrs corrupt all good
manners, nay, even good natures, making the
one rude, and the other cruel; and though long
Warrs may make men Martial, Skilfull, and
may highten their courage, yet neither skil nor
courage can alwayes bear away Victory, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from a powerfull Enemy, unless Fortune
be on their side. The truth is, Fortune is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44350:10"/>
chief Actor and decider in Warrs; and who
that are wise, will trust their Goods, Lives and
Liberties to Fortunes disposal, if they may
choose? Wherefore they are either fools or
mad, that will make Warr, when they may live
in Peace. And give me leave to tell you, that
it is not the way to keep our Country safe, to
make Warrs abroad, but to make our Country
strong with Forts on the Frontiers, and Ships on
the Seas that beat on our shores, and to practise
our men with training, not fighting; and it is
easier to keep out an Enemy, than to Conquer
an enemies Kingdome: for at home we have all
Provisions needfull and near at hand, when in a
forein Country we shall be to seek. But say,
good fortune may inrich us, yet ill fortune will
absolutely ruine us: I answer, Warr inriches
few, for it makes spoil of all; the truth is, War
is a great devourer, for it consumes almost all
that is consumable, wheresoever it comes, and is
like a Glutton, that eats much, and yet is very
lean; for most commonly the under Souldiers
are very poor, and the Commanders only rich
in fame, yet not, unless they have good fortune,
otherwise if they have ill fortune, they are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
scorn'd, at least but pittied, but never praised.
Wherefore it is neither Courage nor Conduct,
that gets fame in the Warrs, but Fortune that
gives it, and she many times gives glorious fame
to Cowards and Fools, and blemishes, at least
obscures the worth and merit of Wise and Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
men. Wherefore, let me perswade you not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44350:11"/>
to follow unjust and inconstant Fortune to the
Warrs, but to live at home in Peace with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi>
and <hi>Pallas,</hi> the one will defend you, the
other will imploy you, and both will make you
happy in present Life, and will give you Fame
and Renown according to your desert, that your
memory may live in after-ages.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Perceive, all this Nation, or the most part,
their minds are hot, and their spirits inflam'd
through an over-earnest desire to be in Warr,
which expresses you have surfeited with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
fruits of Peace, which hath made your
reason, judgement and understanding sick and
faint, so that it desires a change, as from rest to
trouble, from plenty to scarcity, from palaces to
tents, from safety to danger, from gay apparel
to bloody wounds, from freedom to slavery, all
which Warr will bring upon you. The truth
is, Warr is more likely to kill you, than cure
your surfeit: for Warr is a dangerous Physick,
and the more dangerous, by reason your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
must be your Physicians. But let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you, to cure your selves with Temperance
and Prudence, by which you will flourish with
Wealth, and grow strong with Wisdom: for
wealth and wisdome is the health and strength
of a Common-wealth, which will preserve it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44350:11"/>
from destruction, For what is the strength of a
Kingdome, but Riches and wise Government?
and what exhausts the one, and confounds the
other more than Warr? which for the most
part is in Fortune's power, to order as she pleases,
and Fortune in VVarrs hath power to puzzle
the wise, and impoverish the rich. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Noble Country-men,</hi> do not make your
selves beggers and fools in VVarring actions,
and ruine not your Country through the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pre-eminence or applause, or through the
ill nature of Revenge; But be wise and rich with
Peace, by which you will become impregnable
against your Enemies, and happy amongst your
selves; for certainly VVarr is better to hear of,
than to feel; for though in VVarrs you may
Cover much, yet in the end In joy but little, you
may have high Designs, but you are not sure to
have prosperous Success, and instead of being
Conquerers, be Conquered, instead of being
Masters, become Slaves. But to conclude, it
were more happy to lie Peaceable in the Grave
with our Fore-fathers, than to live in the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moils
of VVarr with our Enemies.</p>

Agreement made betwixt our Nation, by which
they have broken the Peace; but yet we, out
of Laziness or Fearfull natures, suffer them to
make Riots, and never stirr against them,
when we are so far from being Abusers, as we
suffer our selves to be Abused. 'Tis true, the
first shews us to be Honest Men, but the last
proves us to be Fools, if not Cowards, which,
if our Enemies know, (for now they are but a
proving, making a trial of us,) they will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
us without Resistance, and will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
us in our own Territories, so that we shall
labour for our Enemies, and have no Profit our
selves. Thus whilst we sit still, we shall have a
Yoak cast on us, we shall be bound in Fetters, and
they injoy their own and our Liberties, which
rather than suffer or yield to, were a thousand
times better to Dye; Wherefore, bethink your<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves,
and consider the danger, be not so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
as not to be able to help your selves; and
if you be Wise and Valiant, as I hope you are,
you will be VVatchful and Active; let not your

Worms, or drive you into Bondage, like silly
Sheep into a Pinfold, but rather be as the subtil

               <p>I Perceive, you desire, or rather are resolved, to
be no longer in Peace, but to make Warr on
the <hi>U. G.</hi> for some slight injuries, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
could not be avioded: for there is no
Friendship between Man and Man, or the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
natural affections betwixt Brethren, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Children, or Husbands and VVives,
but will give some occasions, either by VVords
or Actions, or both, to take exceptions, and to be
angry with each other; and should they for
some small Offences, or indiscreet Actions,
break off all Bonds of Friendship or Natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
Or should they indeavour to destroy
each others Lives, this would be Inhumane,
Unnatural, Uncharitable, Unjust, and Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and if neer and dear Friends cannot live
without Exceptions and Faults, much less can
two several Nations under two several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And give me leave to tell you, that if it
be not Wicked, yet it will be very Unwise to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
your Lives, Liberties, Possessions, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
in Warr, only to be revenged for some
few abuses or faults, that should rather be wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, than taken notice of; But should you be
Victorious, though it is probable you may be
Overcome, yet you will be in the end of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44350:13"/>
Warr but like Chymists, who to make some
grains of Gold spend many thousand, or at least
hundred pounds, and ruine their Estates and
Posterity through Covetousness; so will you
through Anger, and desire of Revenge, lose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousand Lives, and impoverish the State;
but Experience will tell you, that Anger and
Rashness for the most part cause Repentance,
whereas Patience and Discretion many times
bring men out of great Evils; and though
Warrs begin Flantingly and Boastingly, yet
commonly they end Miserably and Dejectedly,
at least of one side, if not on both, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
are more certain to have Wounds or
Death, than Victory and Spoils: and though
Covetousness and Revenge is their hire, yet
Loss and Slavery is many times their reward;
they advance with Hopes, but draw back with
Doubts, and are oppress'd with Fears. But you
imagine, you shall be Victorious, otherwise you
would not make Warr, for Imagination can
easily and suddenly Conquer all the World;
yet you will find it not so in action as in thought,
it is one thing to fight a Battel in the Brain, and
an other thing to fight a Battel in the Field: and
if I might advise you, you should fight only
with Thoughts and not with Arms, with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
not with Real Enemies. But to conclude,
this Warlike Preparation or Resolution is not
only inconsiderable and Foolish, but Mad, as to
leave and forsake your delicious Pleasures, sweet
Delights, happy Contents, dear Friends, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44350:13"/>

Warr, if not timely hindred or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the chief signs of this Warr are Vanity,
Pride, Luxury, Ambition, Corruption, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Envy, Faction and Poverty. As for Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Pride, and Luxury, they are amongst our
young Nobles; Envy, Ambition, and Faction,
amongst our States-men; Corruption and Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
amongst our Magistrates and Officers, and
Poverty is amongst our Commons, as also in
our Common and Publick Treasury; All which
will bring our City and Kingdome to ruine, if
the Disorders and Grievances be not timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.
Wherefore <hi>Noble Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Dear
Country-men,</hi> prevent your own ruine, by refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
your own State both of publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Mis-demeanors; but the chief Rectifiers
must be the States-men, Magistrates, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
for wise States-men and good Magistrates
will not only indeavour to abolish Vanity and
Luxury by their frugal Examples, but by their
wise and severe Laws; for without strict and
severe Laws, wise Government cannot be; also
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44350:14"/>
wise States-men and honest Magistrates will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to fill the publick Treasury by just and
regular means, and not their private Purses by
Extorsion and Corruption, for the one relieves
the Poor, the other starves them, and not only
relieves the Poor, but is a means to supply the
publick Wants, to guard the publick State, and
to keep the publick Peace; all which makes
wise and honest States-men and Magistrates to
be provident to Inrich, and sparing to Spend the
publick Treasure, that the publick State may
have Means and Wealth for necessary occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Also wise States-men and Magistrates
will imploy the Common people to keep them
from Want and Idleness, which will keep them
in Order and Peace; But the greatest good, and
greatest scarcity in a Common-wealth, is wise
States-men and just Magistrates, which are free
from private Interest and ambition of particular
Power, not making their self designs the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ruine: but such men, if any such there be,
ought to be chosen out from the rest of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to Govern and Rule so, that Prudence,
Fortitude, Justice and Temperance, as also Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Love, and Unity, may be the Bond and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity

               <p>GIve me leave to tell you, that both the

their times idlely; the one sort Sleeps away their
time, the other Playes it away. But it may be
said, that Rest is proper for Aged men, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for Young men; I answer, Rest to the
bodies of Aged men doth well, and Action for
Young men; but Aged men might imploy their
Brains in Counsels, and Young men their Arms
in Warrs; for aged Brains are wisest, and Young
mens Bodies strongest, and both may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Service of this Nation. But this
Nation is like a man that increases his Issue, and
doth not increase his Estate: for this Nation
grows Populous, but the Men not Industrious to
inlarge it. The truth is, we have more Men,
than Means to maintain them, or Business to
imploy them, which makes them Idle, having
nothing to Husband or Manage, and Idleness will
in time make them Evil; Wherefore, if some of
the wise Aged men, send not some of the Young
strong men, to make Warrs abroad, to imploy
or inrich them, or to destroy them, they will
make Warrs at home, and destroy themselves
and others for want of wealth and imployment:
for this Nation is like a Body over-grown, or
rather full of Humours, which requires Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44350:15"/>
Wherefore, send some to Sea, others to
march by Land, to seek new Habitations, and to
Conquer Nations; and men of Fortune will be
more willing to go, than you to send them, if
you help them with necessaries to begin the
Warr; and they having nothing to lose, nor
nothing to live on, will Fight without Fear, and
therefore probably destroy their Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Favour, that they may come to be absolute
Conquerers.</p>

               <p>YOu know, that this Country is an Island, and
therefore it is well to put you in mind of
the Proverb, which saies, Take care of your
Ships, and look well to your Tacklings, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you can have no safety: for the strength of
an Island are Ships, which are the guard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, not empty unrigged Ships in your Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
but good strong Ships well Mann'd on the
Seas; for to have Ships only in your Havens will
be no security; besides, it spoils both Ships and
Mariners for want of use and practice. Thus
the close Havens destroy more Ships and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
than the open Seas: for that which makes
good Mariners is Navigation, and the more
Stroms they have been in, the more Experience
they have gained. It is true, 'tis a laborious and
dangerous Profession, but yet it is Expedient,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44350:15"/>
both for security and profit, to those that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
an Island; for Islands commonly have more
Men than Land, and therefore require Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
from abroad, besides many things for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Delight. But though Islands be not so
Spacious as Continents, yet they are for the most
part Richer, for Shipping of Burdens is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
although Shipping of Warr is chargeable;
and perchance you will say, that the Charge of
the one sort eats out the Profit of the other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you can make them serve for both, as for
Traffick, and for Warr, which in my opinion
cannot well be done; for Ships for Warr will be
too heavy and unwieldy for Burden, and too
bigg for Speed, as also too slow for Flight; for
Merchants do seldome Fight, if they can possibly
Flye, not only that their Wealth makes them
fearful, but their Rich fraights would be spoiled,
although they should not be taken from them.
But howsoever, Safety is to be preferr'd before
Wealth, wherefore Ships of Warr are to be
considered before Ships of Burdens, and that
there be good Mariners and Ship-masters for
both; and not only to repair Ships, but to build
Ships yearly, that you may be so strong, as to be
Masters of the Seas; also to pay well your poor
laborions Mariners, and carefull and skifull
Ship-masters, who keep you in Safety, and bring
you Riches and forein Rarities and Curiosities
for Pleasure and Delight; although they be but
Poor themselves, and have less or as little Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
as Riches, being for the most part accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44350:16"/>
with Dangers and Fears, as much as with
Want and Necessity; the truth is, they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
indure great Extremities; for in a Strom
they fight for Life, and in a Calm they starve
for Want; for they fight not like those that
fight at Land, as Men with Men, but they fight
with the blustring VVinds and raging VVaves,
where, although they get the Victory, yet they
are sure to be Losers, their Ships being VVoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and their Tacklings tatter'd and torn, and
every thing out of Order; besides, their Spirits
are spent, and their Limbs sore, and their whole
Bodies wearied and tyr'd with Labour, having
nothing to Refresh them, but Joy that they were
not Drown'd. VVherefore, Mariners deserve
more pay and thanks, than Land-Souldiers, who
fight with Men equall to them, not with the
Elements above and beneath them, as VVind
and VVater, which are strong, fierce, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring:
Besides, when Land Soldiers get a
Victory, they are Inriched with the spoil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
themselves with Luxurious Pleasures,
Sporting and Feasting; whereas poor Mariners
and Sea-men are forc'd to Fast rather than to
Feast, having never much Plenty, but after a
Storm more Scarcity, their Provision being
spoiled by their Enemies, the Elements. But to
conclude, the Sea-men want pay, and their Ships
repairing, for which you must disburse a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
summ of Money to mend the one, and to
relieve the other, who deserve not only Pay,
but Reward to encourage them.</p>

that you are so loath to raise, and so slow to
pay Contribution-Money towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Army, which is to fight not only
for your Lives and Liberties, but to protect
your Goods, and that every man may without
Disturbance injoy his own: but you are so Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
that rather than you would part with
Some, you will endanger the Whole; and as you
are Covetous, so you are Fearfull, for you will
neither maintain poor Souldiers, that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to fight for you, nor yet go to the VVarrs,
to fight for your selves; you Fear your Enemies,
and yet will take no care to Overcome them.
And give me leave to tell you, that your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
and Fear doth make you Treacherous;
for if you will neither help with your Purse, nor
your Person, you betray your Country to the
Enemies power, also your old Parents, tender
VVives, and young Children, that cannot help
themselves, all which you betray to Slavery,
leaving them for a prey to the Enemy; and not
only your fertil Country, and shiftless Friends,

seems by your Covetousness and Cowardliness,
that you had rather have your Throats cut, than
part with your Money, or fight in your own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44350:17"/>
which is a strange Madness, as to be afraid
to Dye, and yet to take no care, to provide for
your Safety, nor to have Courage to fight for
your Lives. The best that can be said or
thought of you, is, that you relie upon base
hopes, as that the Enemy may spare your Lives
to inslave your Persons: But I can only say this,
that either you must Fight your selves, or Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

which is besieged by your Enemies, which you

neither your Limbs nor your Lives; nor
do I fear the power of your Enemies, for,
whilst your Courages, Strengths, Patience and
Industries be united together, it is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
you will raise the Siege, than the Enemies
take this City; for though your Victuals be
scarce, and your Ammunition wasted, yet your
Temperance doth supply the scarcity of the one,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44350:17"/>
and your Courage the want of the other; Only
that I fear will make you yield upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
is the Love to your Wives, Daughters,

not so much their safety, for so long as your

yield to your Enemies, by yielding to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Effeminate fears, if your Enemies do not
say or think you base Cowards, they will say
or think you facil Fools. For give me leave to
tell you, that, though men of Honour, as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men, will Fight for the safety and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Women, not only for those that are neer
Allied to them, but for those that are neither
of their Country nor Kinn; Yet no man that
would keep the Reputation of Valour, will quit
that Honour for a Womans sake, no, although
it be to save his Daughter, Wife, or Mother
from their Enemies: for a Gallant man dreads
more the name of a Coward than any thing in
the world; and it is no dishonour to a Man, to
have his Wife taken and abused by his Enemy,
when he could not Honourably help her; for
Force is no Dishonour, but a Base free Act; for a
man cannot be forced to be a Coward, nor a chast
Woman to be a Whore, they may both have
Misfortunes, Injuries, and Hatefull abuses done
to them, but not Wicked, Base, or Ignoble
minds. VVherefore, let me perswade you for
your own Honour's sake, not to yield through
the VVomens desires; let not their tears move
you, nor their intreaties perswade you; for if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44350:18"/>
you yield, though upon the assurance of your
Lives and Liberties, where will you wander to
seek an Habitation? for if you could not keep
your own City and Wealth, it is not likely you
will get the like from other men; alas your
Neighbours will shut their Gates and Doors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, for Poverty and Misfortune hath not
many Friends or Hosts, for few are so Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

find Charity cold, but those that have envied
you in your Prosperity, will despise you in your
Adversity, and what Masculine spirits can bear
such misery, as Neglect, Want, and Scorn, and
the Infamy of yielding Courages? Wherefore,
it is better to Dye in the Defence of your own
City, and be Renowned for your Valour and
Constancy in after-ages, wherein your Lives,

               <p>VVE have been long at the Siege of this
City, where we have not only been
obedient to our Commanders, carefull, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and laborious, as also Valiant in assaulting,
regarding not our Limbs, nor Lives, but we have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44350:20"/>
patiently indured want of Victuals, and yet for
all this, the Town being ready to be taken, our
Commanders intend to rob us of the Spoils,
which by the Law of Arms ought to be ours, as
a Reward; for those that Venture most, ought to
have the Greatest shares in the Conquest, and the
Common Souldiers venturing more than the
Commanders, ought to have the Spoil: For
though they Direct, yet it is we that Fight, and
win the Victory. Wherefore, let us not suffer
them to make a Composition, but enter the Town
by Force, and plunder it, otherwise the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
or rather the General alone will be the
only gainer, and all the rest losers; and shall one
man go away with the Wealth, when as the
poor Common Souldiers are naked and almost
starved for Want? Shall our sick and wounded
friends, that cannot remove, or be removed, nor
help themselves, be left as a prey to those, which
they have holpen to Conquer with the loss of
their Blood and Limbs? For no doubt, but those
new-made Friends will be their deadly Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and cut their Throats when we are gone
and left them. Thus we shall betray our friends,
and lose our shares, if they make Peace and enter
not the Town by assault: for to take a Town
by Force, is a gain to the common Souldiers, but
little or none to the General or great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
but to take a Town by Composition, is a
gain to the General and chief Commanders, but
not to the Common Souldiers; for we shall lye
without the Gates, whilst they are receiv'd in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44350:20"/>
Triumph, where they will Feast, whilst we do
Fast, and will be inriched with Treasures, but

for it is not only Human and Charitable,
Generous and Noble, to spare the Lives of
Yielding and conquered Enemies, but Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for their Lives will serve you, and their
Industry maintain you; wherefore it is better,
to spare their Lives, and make Peace with them,
also to take their Money, and spare their cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome
and combustible Goods, which will
trouble your carriage, and hinder your march;
Neither can you make so much profit of them,
as they will give you for them. And as for
their City, and Lives, it were a great folly, to
Kill and Destroy them to no purpose, unless to
satisfie your Bloody minds, and furious Rage;
for Death and Destruction will bring you not
any Profit; but if you give them their Lives,
and let their City stand, they will give you a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and setled Contribution towards your
maintenance, also they will be Surgeons, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
and Nurses to our sick and wounded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44350:21"/>
Souldiers, by which means they may recover
their former health and strength again, and be
able to do their Country more Service; but if
they be left behind us, and none to take care of
them, nor Men to help them, nor Houses to
lodge in, they must of necessity perish in great
misery; and we have no reason to fear they
will be Cruel to them, because they know we
shall Return to revenge their Cruelty: Besides,
they will be very carefull of them, and kind and
helpfull to them, to keep Peace, and to Merit
our favours; for Conquerers are alwayes flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
obeyed, and served with ceremony, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and fidelity, so long as Fortune favours
them. Thus you know by what I have spoken,
that it is the best for the Common Souldiers and
Commanders to spare the City and Citizens.
And now give me leave to tell you, that you are
Unjust Judges of me, your Generals actions, and
evil Censurers and malicious Accusers, to accuse
my Prudence for my Souldiers, of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for my self, and my carefull love for my Sick
and wounded Souldiers, of an insensible and
cruel Neglect, whereas you might more truly
accuse me for using too much Clemency to my
Mutinous and Rebellious Souldiers, wincking
at their faults, and pardoning their crimes, when
they ought to have been severely punished, by
which they would have been better taught, and
I obeyed: for Severe Generals make Humble,
Obedient, Industrious, Laborious, Patient, and
Couragious Souldiers, whereas a Compliant
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44350:21"/>
General quite spoils them; But I have shewed
Mercy to offenders, Love and Care to the
wounded, sick, tyred, and weary, and I have
been Bountifull to the well-deservers; all which
I am forced to remember you of, because you
have forgotten, at least are unwilling to take any
notice thereof; Yet I perceive it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of most of Mankind, especially Mean
births, Low fortunes, and Brute breedings, to
be Ungratefull, Malicious, Revengefull, and
Inhumane.</p>

malice, giving her no advantage, if you can
possibly hinder her from taking any. Yet was
it neither for want of Conduct or Valour, that
we wonn not the Victory, but Heaven and Earth
was against us: for the Sun, Wind and Dust
beat on our faces; for you indeavouring to get
the side of the Wind, went against the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams,
so that with the Sun-beams and the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Dust, that flew up by the motion of the

so blinded, as to mistake our friends for our foes,
and our foes for our friends; which tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wind, had it been before we begun to fight,
we might have prevented the mischief, it did us,
some way or other; but the wind did rise,
when we were so ingaged, as we could not help
our selves; the truth was, it blew so fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the main part of our Battalio, and with
that violent force, as it press'd the former ranks
so much back, that they did disturb the hinder
ranks, and so disorder'd them, till at last it blew
them quite away; for they were forced to turn
their backs and to flye for their Lives, and when
that part of the Army fled, others had no hearts
to stay; but do not mistake so, as to believe, that
the Divine power was against us, but only the
Elements, and they were against us more by
chance than malice. Wherefore take courage
again, and rowse up your dejected Spirits, and
repine not for that we could not fore-see to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void:
for I make no doubt, but the next time

our Camp is vexed and tormented with scarcity,

Yet give me leave to tell you, it expresseth, you
have partaken too much of your Mothers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

Armies powerless, and a Little Body with a

Shame or Disgrace, though you may run from

The third and last way, which is the best, is to

you will have the honour of Victory, and the

               <p>SOrrowfull Penitents, (for so you seem by
your Countenances and your Words, the
one being sad, the other full of promises,) I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44350:24"/>
must confess, it becomes you well, for you have
been great Cowards, and fearfull Run-aways,
which are Faults that cannot be enough lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but your Actions may be amended, and so
you may have a Pardon, and your Disgrace ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off with some Valiant and Couragious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
against your Enemies, where I, your
General, who am one of <hi>Mars'</hi> s high Priests,
shall guide and direct you the way; and you
may relie upon me; for I am well Learned and
Practised in the mystery of Warr. But pray be
not as flock of Sheep, making me as a Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Priest,
as only to Talk, and you to Run away;
for then I shall Curse you, instead of Blessing
you; and though it be requisite you should be
as meek Sheep in <hi>Ioves'</hi> s Temple, yet you must
be as raging Lions in <hi>Mars'</hi> s Field, and the
Prayers you make to <hi>Mars,</hi> must be for Victory
and Fame; but let me tell you, you must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<hi>Pallas'</hi> s help, and <hi>Fortune'</hi> s favour; and
therefore, fight Valiantly and Fiercely, and take
your advantages Prudently, stick Closely, and
fight Orderly, and leave the rest to Fortune;
which if you do thus, as I advise you, your
Actions will wipe out all former Faults, and take
away all your Reproach or Disgrace so clean, as
if they had never been, especially if you have
the Victory.</p>

               <p>GIve me leave to tell you, that although you
have proved your Valours in the Battels
you have fought, and the Assaults you have
made, yet you have not proved your selves Wise,
to leave your Native Country, and Peaceable
Habitations, only to fight with Foreiners, who
are as Industrious, Valiant, and Active to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and kill you, as you to overcome and kill
them; and what do we fight and hazard our
Lives for? not for Riches; for what we get, we
are subject to lose again, and should we get
Riches, we should soon consume them, having
no setled abiding to thrive upon the Stock, or to
get out use of the Principal, nor to have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
by Traffick or Commerce, but those spoils
we can get, are only Cumbersome Goods, which
we are forc'd to fling away in times or places of
Danger, or when we make sudden or long
Marches; and albeit we could easily and safely
carry them along with us, yet we should make
but Small Profit of them, and get Little ready
Money for them, although they were not spoil'd
in the Carriage. By this we may know, the
Warrs will not Inrich us; and as for Fame,
Common Souldiers are never mentioned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are the only Fighters, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44350:25"/>
sands of them, when Kill'd, are buried in Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vions
grave, and no other Burial they have; for
their slain Bodies for the most part lie and rot
above ground, or are devoured by Carrion-birds
or Ravenous Beasts; but the Fame or Renown is
given to the General alone, some Under-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
may chance to be Slightly mentioned,
but not Gloriously famed; And if you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
get Wealth nor Honour, in or by the
Warrs, why-Should you be Souldiers? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let us return home, and rather be Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in our Own Country, than Souldiers in a
Forein Nation, rather feed with our own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
than starve at our Generals Command,
and rather choose to die Peaceably, than to live
in the Warr, wherein is nothing to be gotten,
but Scarrs and Wounds; where we may lose
our Limbs and Lives, but not make our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>

               <p>THe Souldier that spake to perswade you to
mutiny, as to leave the Warrs dishonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
by his speech, any man of Courage would
believe he were a Coward: for no man of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
would leave an Enemy in the Field, for
that would be as bad as Running away; and
will you, who have gotten Honourable Renown
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44350:26"/>
by the Warrs, quit that Renown for Disgrace?
Shall the speech of a Cowardly, Idle, Base man
perswade you more than your Reputations? can
any man Live, Act, or Dye more honestly than
in the Service of his Country? besides, it will
not only be a Disgrace to You, and also a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to your Country, to leave the Warrs, but
you will indanger your Country; for no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
but your Enemies will follow you at the
heels, so that instead of carrying home Victory
and Spoils, you will carry home Danger, and
perchance Ruine, betraying your Country by
Faction, Mutiny, or Cowardly fears. Thus,
although you came out of your Country Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
you will return Traitors. But should they
not Follow you, they would Scorn you, and your
Friends would Despise you at your return, and
what is worse than to be Scorn'd and Despised of
Enemies and Friends? when as by your Gallant
actions the one would be Afraid, the other Proud
of you. And let me tell you, to be a Souldier,
is the noblest Profession; for it makes Mean men
as Princes, and those Princes that are not Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
are as Mean men; and though Fame doth
not mention every particular Souldier, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all together, yet the memory of every
particular Souldier and their particular Actions
never die, as long as their Successors live; for
their Children mention their Fore-fathers Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Actions with Pride, Pleasure, and Delight,
and Glory that they descended from such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Ancestors; and as for Scarrs gotten in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44350:26"/>
Warrs, they are such Graces and becoming
Marks, as they Woo and Win a Mistress, and
gain her Favour, sooner than Wealth, Title, or
Beauty doth. But I hope you will neither shew
your selves Cowards, nor prove your selves
Traitors, by leaving the Warr when you ought
to follow it.</p>

               <p>I Hear you Murmur, Complain, and Speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, forgetting your Respects, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Duty, and Fidelity to me your General;
for which I am sorry, not for my Self, but for
my Souldiers; for I am never the worse for
my Souldiers being evil; but I am sorry, my
Souldiers are not what they ought to be; and
though I do not wonder at the Disobedience of
my Common Souldiers, yet I cannot but wonder
at the Baseness of my Officers and Under-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders;
for though Inferiour Men have infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Minds, rude and wild Natures, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Manners, yet Men of quality usually have
Generous, and noble Minds, gentle Natures,
and civil Manners, and of all men, Gallant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
have the noblest Minds, and ought to have
the reformedst Manners; for though Heroick
men fight in Blood to kill their Enemies, yet
they will spill their Blood, and sacrifize their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44350:27"/>
Lives for their Friends, Country, or Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as also for Honour, Generosity, and Fame,
and they will rather choose to indure all kind or
manner of Torments, and to die a thousand, nay,
millions of Deaths if it could be, than to do one
act of Dishonour, or that is not fit for a man of
Honour to do; Indeed Heroick and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men are petty Gods, whereas other men are
Beasts, the one having Celestial natures, the
other Terrestrial. But by your mutinous spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
I perceive, I have not those Gallant, Noble,
Generous, and Valiant Souldiers, as I thought
I had in this my Army, which I am sorry for
especially that there is none like my Self; for I
utterly Renounce all Actions or Thoughts that
ought not be to be done by Worthy men, or to
be inherent in Worthy men; I hate Treachery,
as I hate Cowardliness, and I hate Cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as I hate Disgrace, or Infamy, and I hate
Infamy worse than Oblivion; for Oblivion is the
Hell of Meritorious and Gallant men; and as I
prefer after-Memory, which is Fame, before
present Life, which Fame is the Heaven where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Worthy and Honourable men and actions are
Glorified, and live to all Eternity, so would I
have my Souldiers there to Live, and be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;
which Desire expresses, that I love my
Souldiers equal with my Self; and as I do prefer
Honour and Fame before sensual Pleasures or
Life, so I have alwayes preferr'd my Souldiers
Lives before my Own; for I never indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to save my own Life, when my Souldiers
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44350:27"/>
Lives were in Danger, but have put my person
in the same danger they were in, nay, I have
ventured One more danger than they have done;
for I have led them Singly to the face and front
of their Enemies; neither have I been Idle,
when as my Souldiers have taken pains, but to
the contrary I have taken pains, when as they
have been Idle; for my Person hath not only
been imployed in Ordering, Appointing, and
Directing of every particular, but I have
march'd on Foot with the Infantery, whilst the
Cavallry hath Rid easily on Horses, or the chief
Commanders have rid lasily in their Waggons;
as also I have taken pains in Teaching, Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and Marshalling my Souldiers, as well as
time, place, and opportunity would give me
leave; and my Body hath not only labour'd, but
my Mind and Thoughts were alwayes and at
all times busily imployed for the affairs of the
Army, and for my Souldiers Advantage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
the Best, as how to prevent the Worst.
Thus my thoughts have Labour'd for you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
Keeping me waking, whilst you have
slept and rested in ease. Neither did I ever rob
my Souldiers of their Spoils, but was pleased to
distribute my Share amongst them; nor did I
ever make a Scarcity of your Victuals through
my Luxury; nor have I ever brought my Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
into Want through my Imprudence; for
whatsoever Want or Loss you have had, it came
meerly from Fortune, whose power the Wisest
and Valiantest cannot alwaies and at all times
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44350:28"/>
withstand. But yet the Common Souldiers and
Under-Commanders for the most part Accuse
their Generals, laying the Disfavour of Fortune
to their Generals charge, although it is not in
any Man's power to avoid Fortune's malice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
men could Divine what would fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Reason or Probability; and though
Wise men may imagine such chances, yet they
will never order their Affairs, or Designs, or any
Action against Reason, Sense, and Probability;
besides, Foolery and Knavery cause loss and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
without Fortune's help, making more Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and Confusion, than the Wisest men can
rectifie. But I will not trouble you with many
more Words nor Reproofs; for neither Words,
Reproofs, nor Perswasions will do any good on
a Mutinous and Rebellious Army, who hath
more Strength to do Evil, than Honesty to do
Good; more Fury to mutine, than Courage to
fight; more Envy to their Leaders, than Love to
their own Honours. I add only this, your Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
I abhorr, your Rudeness I scorn, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
I despise, your Designs I slight, and your
intended Cruelty I fear not.</p>

me a Threatning message, that although you at

yet now, whereas I did slight your Love,
you would Force me to take that Charge upon
me; but let me tell you, I care not for your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,

Mutinous Souldiers, is to be a Knave, to Fear

Wherefore I, preferring Honour before Life,
will rather Die, than be your General. But who
gave you Authority to Depose your General, and
to make an other? Or what right have you to
Take away, and Give Commissions? You will
answer, by Force of Arms, or rather force of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
for Arms are, or ought to be, for Justice,
Right, Truth, or Honour, not for Injustice,
Wrong, Injury, Falshood, and Dishonour; and
strong Arms and couragious Hearts, do not agree

your Actions have shew'd you to be Rebellious
Cowards; for which I am not only Asham'd, that

to perswade you to Patience, although it be the
part of good Souldiers to suffer Patiently, as well
as to fight Vigorously, also to be patient with
painfull Labours; but I perceive, Patience and
Industry, that accompany Valour, have also
forsaken you. Nor shall I perswade you to
stick close to me, as to defend my Life from the
Enemies, although I have been more carefull to
defend your Lives with Skill and Knowledge in
Warr and Arms, than you have been to defend
my Life with your Strength and Courages.
And give me leave to tell you, that the Renown
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44350:29"/>
you have gotten in the Warrs, hath been gain'd
as much by my Conduct, as your Valours.
Thus I neither perswade you to Fight, to Suffer,
nor to Help me in time of need; but my Desire
is to perswade you, not to Bury the Renown
you have gotten in these Warrs, in the Grave
of Treachery, nor to cast down your Glorious
Acts from the Palace of Fame, into the Pit of
Infamy, which you will do, if you put your Evil
Designs into Acts: for I perceive well by your
Secret Meetings and Gatherings in companies
together without Order, and by your Whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
into each others Ears, as also by your Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings,
Complaints, and Exclamations, you
intend some Evil, but in what manner you will
execute your Evil Designs, I cannot tell; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it is, either that you will Desert me, or
Make Peace with the Enemy without me, on
Dishonourableterms, or that you will Betray me
to the Enemy, and Deliver me into their hands;
or else it is, that you have conspir'd to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me with your own hands, either of which
will be unworthy for good Souldiers to do.
Wherefore I would, if I could, disswade you for

Acts, as to cause Honest men to Hate you, Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

you, your Enemies to Scorn you, your Country
to Exclame against you, your Acquaintance to

your Posterity, if they have any Worth or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

your Design is against Me, here I offer my Self

               <p>YOu know, we are a people that have been
Conquered, and made Slaves to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which Slavery we did Patiently indure a
long time, but at last we had an Impatient desire
of Liberty, and had our Prudence been accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Desires, no doubt but we should have
Gain'd it, but our Over-hasty Desires have put
us into a greater Misery; for now we are not
only like to Lose our Liberties again, but our
Lives, or to Live in worse Bondage than we did
before, which we had better Dye than Indure:
but since we were not so Wise for our selves to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44350:31"/>
Prevent our Danger, as we were Just to our selves
to Indeavour our Liberty, yet we must not leave
Indeavouring our own Good, so long as Life
lasts; Wherefore, we must consider, what is
best to be done in this Extremity. First, we
have of our selves a Great Body, though not so
well Armed as I wish we were, yet so, as we are
not left Naked to our Enemies; but though we
have a great Number, yet our Enemies have a
greater Number, and though we be Arm'd, yet
our Enemies are Better Armed, the worst of all
is, that we are in a place of such Disadvantage, as
either we must Starve, or Yield our selves, or
Fight it out at all Hazards; As for Starving, it
is a lingring and painfull Death, and to Yield,
will be a miserable and painfull Life, wherefore
to Fight it out at all Hazards, will be best for us
to choose; for Death is the End of Misery, and
Pain is not felt in a Raging or Acting Fury; and
if we Resolve, let the worst come to the worst,
we can but Dye, and that we must do in time,
had we no other Enemies than what are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
as Sickness and Age; and these Hopes we
have, that Desperate Men in Desperate Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
have many times Good Fortune, and those
that are Desperate, want no Courage, but they
are apt to be Careless of Conduct; Wherefore
let me advise you, to Listen to Direction, and be
carefull to Obey your Instructions; for if we
should Overcome our Enemies, we should not
only save our Lives, which we give for lost, but
we should have our Liberties, and also Honour,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44350:32"/>
Power, and Wealth too, whereas our Enemies
only venture their Lives to keep us in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
which will cause them to Fight but
Faintly; for where there is neither Profit, nor
Honour to be gain'd, they will sooner Run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
than Venture their Lives in the Battel, so
that our Poverty will Defend us, and our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
help to Fight for us; Prudence shall
Guide us, and then perchance Fortune may Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
us. Wherefore, let us Assault our Enemies
before they Expect us, and indeavour to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them before they are ready to Fight with
us; for if we take them Unprepar'd, we shall find
them without Defence, and in such Disorder, as
we shall Destroy them without Hazard.</p>

               <p>YOu now seem to be as much cast down
and dejected in your Misery, as you
were puft up with Pride in your
Prosperity, in which Prosperity you
were so Confident, and so Careless
of your Security, as you would neither believe
your Danger, nor provide for your Safety, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that you Murmured and Mutined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Assessments and Payments, although
it were to keep the Kingdome in Peace, and to
strengthen it against Forein force; but now you
do not Murmur at small Taxes, but Mourn for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44350:33"/>
your great Losses, not for your Security, but
your Ruine; your Vanity is vanished, your
Pride humbled, and Plenty and Prosperity fled
from you; Where are your brave Furnishings
your gay Adornings? your far-fetch'd Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and your curious Rarities? your Numerous
Varieties, and Rich Treasures? all plunder'd
and gone. Where are your Chargeable Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
your Stately Palaces, your Delightfull
Theatres, your Pleasant Bowers? all Burnt to
ashes. Where are your Races of Herses, you
Fleecy Flocks, your Lowing Herds, your Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
Poultry, and your full-stored Barns?
all Ruined and gone. Where are your Rich
Merchandises, and your Thriving Trades? all
Spoiled. Where are your Wife Laws? all
Broken; your Sporting Recreations? all Ceased;
your Ancestors Monuments? all Pull'd down
and your Fathers Bones and Ashes dispersed.
Where are your Camerads, Companions, and
Acquaintance? most of them Kill'd; where are
your Beautifull Wives, Daughters, Sisters, and
Mistresses? the Enemy injoyes them, and your
Country is Desolate, Ruined, and Forlorn; and
you that are left, are Miserable; but what was
the cause of your Misery? your Pride, Envy
Factions, Luxury, Vanity, Vice, and VVicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for you would neither be Instructed, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
Perswaded, nor Ruled; you Neglected
the Service of the Gods, Disobeyed the Orders
of your Governours, Trampled down the Laws
of the Nation, and Despised your Magistrates,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44350:33"/>
and did all what you would; which brought
this Confusion, and so a Destruction, in which
Destruction you must have patience, for Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will Mediate and Qualifie your Misery.</p>

               <p>I Confess, our Condition is miserable, and our
Lives unhappy, in that we are so unfortunate,
as to be Overcome by our Enemies, and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished
by our Losses; but yet it was Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
nay, Inhumane, for the former Orator
to open our Wounded thoughts, with Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Losses, and to rub our sore Minds
with bitter and salt Reproaches; for if we have
Committed faults, I am sure we have been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
Punished for them, and if the Gods
be Just, as we believe they are, our Loss and
Misery hath made them a Satisfaction, for
which I hope they are Pacified; and though we
ought to Repent of our past Disobedience to the
Divine and National Laws, yet we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to Repent of our past Lawfull Pleasure; for
who, that is Wise, will not make use of his
Riches, and Liberties, whilst he hath them?
for were it not a madness for fear of a Dearth to
Starve our selves Slaves in Plenty? for fear of an Enemy,
to make our selves Slaves in Prosperity? this
were as much as if we should take away our own
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44350:34"/>
Lives before their Natural time, because we
know we shall Dye; No, <hi>Dear Country-men</hi>
it is soon enough to quit Pleasure, Liberty, and
Life, when we can Injoy them no longer; and
since our Fortune is bad, we must indeavour
with Industry to amend it, and if we cannot, we
must Suffer Patiently, and please ourselves with
Hopes; for Hope is a Food the Mind delights
to feed on, and entertains it self with Pleasing
Imaginations: and those are Fools, that will
trouble their Minds for that, which cannot be
help'd; for shall we have not only Enemies
without us, but also within us? shall we Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
our Minds with Grief, Sorrow, Fear, an
Despair, for our misfortunes? No, <hi>Dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,</hi>
let us wipe the Tears from our Eyes,
and defie Fortune's malice, and when she knows
we regard not her Frowns, She may chance to
Favour us, for she is of the Femal gender, whose
Nature is such, as the more they are Neglecte
or Despised, the Kinder they are.</p>

               <head>An Oration for Rebuilding a City ruined
by Warrs.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>UNfortunate Citizens;</hi> for so I may call you
having been ruined by Warrs, and spoiled
by our Enemies; for our City is not only Burnt
to the ground, and all our Goods Plunder'd, but
many of our Citizens and Country-men Kill'd,
and we that remain, are preparing with our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44350:34"/>
Wives and Children to seek new Habitations
and Acquaintance in Forein Countries, from
which I would, if I could, disswade you, since
our Enemies are Gone, and not like to Return;
for though they had the Victory, and won our
City, yet it was with such Loss to them, as will
force them to keep Peace for a long time, not
being able to make Warrs any longer; for their
Valiant'st and most Experienc'd Souldiers are
Kill'd, and most of the Flour of their Youth;
besides, they have spoiled and lost many of their
Horses, and have wasted and spent abundance of
Ammunition and Arms; all which considered,
they have not Gain'd much by this Warr; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Warr makes more Spoil than Profit; for
though we are Ruined, yet our Enemies are not
much Inriched; but leaving them, let us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what is the best for our selves in these our
Misfortunes, and to be Industrious to Repair our
Losses; my Advice is, not to Separate, but to
keep in an United Body together, and to Rebuild
our City: for shall we be worse Citizens than
the Ants or Pismires? which will Rebuild their
Hill or Mount over their Heads, whensoever it
is pull'd down, either by Beast, Men, or Birds,
and though it be often pulld down, and the Dust
dispers'd, yet they will bring new Earth, or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up the Relicks of the former Farth, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build,
and will never leave Rebuilding so long
as they Live; and certainly, they are very wise
in so doing. The like for Men; for it is better,
as the wisest way, to Unite in a Common-wealth,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44350:35"/>
than to live Disperst, and to Wander about like
Vagabonds, or to live with Strangers in Forein
Lands, or to be Governed by Unknown or new
Laws, or to Marry with Strangers, that mix or
corrupt their Generations; for those Men are
happiest, that Live in their Native Countries,
with their Natural Friends, are Govern'd by
their Ancient Laws, Marry into their own
Tribes or Natives, increase their own Breed,
continue their own Races, uphold their own
Families, and are Buried with or by their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.
Wherefore, <hi>Good Citizens,</hi> be Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
to Rebuild your City, whereby and
wherein, you may be as Happy and Flourishing,
as formerly you were; but if through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Discontent, you leave your City in its
Ruins, 'tis probable you will Live unhappy, and
in Slavery all your Lives, as also your Posterity
after you.</p>

               <head>An Oration for Building a Church.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Noble Citizens, and Dear Country-men,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOu have Built many Streets of Houses, but
never a Church, which shews, you think
more of the World, than you do of Heaven,
you take more care for your Bodies, than your
Souls; for you build Stately Palaces to Live in,
but not a Church to Pray in, Rooms to Feast in,
not Churches to Fast in, to Unite in Riot, not to
Unite in Religion, to Talk Extravagantly, not to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44350:35"/>
Pray Piously, to Rejoyce in Evil, not to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in Thanksgiving. But the Nature of
Mankind is such, that they Spend Foolishly, and
Spare Foolishly, they will Spend to their own
Hurt, and Spare to their own Hurt, they fear E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
but never indeavour to avoid Punishment,
they Repent what is Past, but never take War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for what is to Come; As for Spending their
Means, they will spend so much as to make
themselves Sick and Poor, with Surfeiting, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
Drunken Drinking, Pocky whoring,
Covetous Gaming, Vain Shews, Idle Sports,
and the like; and when they Spare, they are so
miserable as not to allow themselves Necessaries,
so that they make themselves Unhappy through
Want, and yet have more than enough to Spend;
also they fear Pain, and Sickness, but will not
indeavour to Avoid either; for men Drink so
much as they are sure to be so sick as to Vomit,
and will Eat such Meat, or Drink such Drinks,
as they are sure to have painfull fits of the Gout
after them. But it may be said, that the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Appetite is so Perswading, and Over-ruling,
as they cannot Forbear; but some men will Drink
when they are not Dry, and Eat when they are
nor Hungry, or have any desire thereto, but will
Drink meerly for Company, or being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Others, or out of a Humour, and so for
Eating; Which is strange, that men should be
perswaded to suffer and indure great pain for
the sake of idle Company, or through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of Fools, or out of a foolish or mad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44350:36"/>
Likewise all men are loath to Dye, and
yet most Men will Venture their Lives unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
or for very small occasions; and all men
are Afraid of Damnation, and yet they will not
Indeavour Salvation, nay, they will venture
Damnation for a trifle, yea, for nothing: as for
Example, they will Lie, Swear, and Forswear,
when they are not Provoked or have any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Swear, Lie, and Forswear; and for
Worldly Riches, men are so Covetous and
Greedy, as they will Extort, Coosen, Steal,
Murder, and venture Soul, Body, and Life for
it, yet when they Have it, they Spend it, as if
they did not Care for it, nay, as if they did Hate
such Riches; and not any man would willingly
be Poor, yet they will spend their Wealth so
Foolishly, as neither to have Pleasure, Thanks,
nor Fame for it. The truth is, that by mens
Actions it could not be believed, that Mankind
had Rational Souls; for though many men will
Speak Wisely, yet most Act Foolishly or rather
Madly, so that mens Rational Souls Live more
in their Words than in their Deeds. But if you
have Rational Souls, and a Saving Belief, you
ought to Build a Church, wherein you may Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together, to Repent your Sins, to Pray for
Forgiveness, to Promise Amendment, and to
Reform your Lives, also to Hear Instructions,
and to give good Examples to each other, and to
accustom your selves to Devotion; so shall you
become Holy men. Besides, Churches ought
to be Built not only for the Souls of the Living,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44350:36"/>
but for the Bodies of the Dead, wherein they
may be inurned Decently, Humanly, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously.</p>

               <p>N. N. who is now Dead, was the Wisest,
Justest, and Honestest Magistrate, that a
Common-wealth could Desire or Have; and as
he Served the Common-wealth Justly, so he
ought to be Rewarded Honourably, for he did
well Deserve it; But his Death must not be an
Excuse for Ungratefulness, for Honours are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Dead, as well as to the Living; for
mens Good Works Live after them, although
their Bodies Dye, and Living men are Benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereby; but should the Benefit cease with
their Death, yet men ought not to Forget the
Good they have Received; for those are very
Unthankfull, Unworthy, and Base men, that
will not acknowledge what they Have had, but
only respect the Present good; indeed such men
are worse than Beasts, and ought to live and dye
like Beasts, as to live in Slavery, and to dye in
Oblivion, whereas Virtuous, Worthy, Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,

be Remembred after their Lives, and those that
have done Wise, or Ingenious, or Good, or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44350:37"/>
Profitable, or Valiant, or Great Works, Deeds,
or Acts, ought to be remembred in the Minds
of men, mentioned by the Tongues of men, and
figured by the hands of Art, so as to Live in the
Minds, Ears, and Eyes of Living men; as for
their Merits to be Praised, their Acts Recorded,
and their Bodies figured to the Life, not only
Pencilled, but Carved, or cast in Moulds, as
Carved in stone, or cast in Metal, that all Ages
may not only hear of their Name, read of their
Acts, but see their Figures, all which are due
Rights and right Honours to the Memory of
Worthy deceased men; Wherefore, this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Deceased man, who was a VVife and Just
Magistrate, ought at the Common-wealth's
charge to have his Statue in Stone or Metal, and
to be set up in the most Publick place in the
City, that every Particular Person may think of
Him, and remember his Acts, when they see his
Figure, which will not only be a due Honour to
him that is Dead, but an Incouragement to those
that Live after him, to imitate and follow his
Example, and that such Magistrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of State, that are imployed after him, may
do as he hath done, as to be Just, Prudent, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and Industrious, which the Gods grant for

               <p>I Have assembled you at this time, to make a
Complaint against <hi>D. D.</hi> who being chosen
a Magistrate, as believing him to be one of the
Ablest men for his. Wisdome amongst us, and so
Fittest to be imployed in the Service and Affairs
of the Common-wealth, hath refused the Office
and Imployment, choosing rather to live Idlely,
than to take Pains and Labour to do Good, for
which he ought to be Punished either in Body
or Estate; for it is not only an Obstruction to
the affairs of the Common-wealth, but a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Example; for if all the Wisest men
should refuse the Imployment and Management
of State-affaris, leaving the Government only
to Fools, the Common-wealth would be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought to Ruine, in which Ruine the Wise
men would suffer as much as other men;
Wherefore, for their Own sakes, as well as for
the sake of their Country, they ought to imploy
their Bodies and Minds in the Service of the
Common-wealth, otherwise Foolish States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Magistrates will make such Disorder,
as no particular family or Man could live Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
much less Plentifully, for Peace and Plenty
would be utterly destroyed with Civil Warr,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44350:38"/>
were there no Forein Enemies; whereas, Wise
men can keep Peace, and make a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
or Kingdome Flourish: for it is as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and hard to keep a Common-wealth in
Peace and Order, as it is easie to cause Warrs
and Ruine, and more difficult to make Peace,
when Warr is begun. Wherefore, the best
way to keep a Common-wealth in Order, Peace,
when Warr is begun. Wherefore, the best
way to keep a Common-wealth in Order, Peace,
and Plenty, is, to choose Wise and Able Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and not to let the VVise men follow
their own Pleasures and Delights, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

and to tell you, I deserve not to be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
either in my Estate or Person, for refusing
a Charge and Imployment, I am not Capable or
fit to be imployed in; for I confess, I am natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Dull and Lasie, no wayes Busie or Active,
and therefore Unfit for State-imployments; and
since it is a Natural imperfection, I ought to be
free from Punishment, for the fault lies in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not in Me, and it would be a great Injustice
to lay Nature's fault to My charge, and to punish
me for that I cannot help; but perchance you
will say, this is only an Excuse, and I may help
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44350:38"/>
this Defect; but put the Case it were so, and I
could Help it, yet I do not find in my Self such
a Supreme Wit, Judgement, Understanding,
Knowledge, Contrivance, Prudence, Patience,
Experience, and the like above other Men, but
that there be other men far Beyond me; for
though the Orator that spake the last Speech,
said, I am a VVife Man, yet it is more than I
know, and probable, he sayes more than he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves;
for it is the Nature of some men, to
Praise other men to their Ruine, and Praise in
some Cases, and at some Times, and to fome
Assemblies, or Persons, doth more Hurt to the
Praised, than all the Dispraises could have done,
nay, some times Men receive a Benefit by being
Dispraised, where as Praises would utterly
Ruine them. But as I said, put the Cafe, I were
a Wise man, and could Discharge the Office of a
Magistrate, as a VVife man should do, yet if a
Company of Fools or Knaves joyn together to
oppose my Orders or Power, I can do little
Good, nay, had I other VVise men joyn'd in
Power and Authority with me, yet we should
do little Good, for Fools and Knaves are too
strong for Honest and VVise men, because they
are far more in Number, and so much Odds there
is, as there are thousands of Fools for one VVise
man; VVherefore it is Fortune, or Chance, or
some particular Favour from the Gods, that
Govern Common-wealths, and not those they
call VVife men; for the VVisest men in the
VVorld cannot keep a People in Peace, if they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44350:39"/>
be resolv'd and set to Rebell; for when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralilty
is up in Arms, it is a Folly for Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Persons to oppose them; and when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
will pull down Particular Persons from
their Power, Particular Persons can not stand;
and when the Generality will alter a particular
Government, the Government must change;
VVherefore, the only and best means to keep up
the Common-wealth, is to Pray to the Gods for
Peace, and to keep the People as niuch as may
be to Religious Ceremonies, that they may Fear
the Gods, which Fear and Devotion will make
them Obey their Magistrates, which I wish, and
leave them.</p>

they are States-men in Books, VVriting of State
affairs; but how do they VVrite? not like
VVife, but like Learned men; not to Teach
men what is Best to be done, but what Evil hath
been done, which is a Relation of Past, not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to Future Actions. The truth is, they
make an Hash of many several Authors, taken
out of several Pieces, to make up a Dish to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

these Cooks of Other mens Meat, which are

would do more Hurt than Good, and rather
make Division than Unity, Warr than Peace;
for instead of Declaring the Policy of State,
they Teach men to be Politick against the State;
and it is to be Observed, that much VVriting of

Pen doth more mischief than the Sword, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Controversies, that make Atheism; for
the more Ignorant a people are, the more Devout

Write any more Books of that Nature; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
not only every Writer, but every Reader
will pretend to be States-men, which will bring
an infallible Ruine to the Common-wealth,
having more Politicians than Business, which will
produce more Faction than Reformation. The
truth is, many Politicians will be apter to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
than agree to make Good Laws, and will
sooner cause a Destruction, then Govern a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
for every several Politician would
have a several Policy; but could or would they
all Agree in their Opinions, yet if every Man
were a States-man, all Particular Affairs would
be laid aside, which Particular Industries make
up a General Commerce, Trade and Traffick in
the Common-wealth: Wherefore, take the
former Orators advice, for the Peace and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of this State, and suffer none to Write
or Read any Books, but what Recreates the
Mind, as Poems, what Increases their Stores, as
Husbandry, what Restores Health, as Medicines,

               <p>I Confess, it is Dangerous in a State, when as
Some men think they are VViser than really
they are, but More dangerous, when as Every
man thinks himself VViser than his Neighbour,
for those thoughts make them Proud, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Factious, and in the end Mutinous and
Rebellious, and of all Self-conceited Persons,
the Self-conceited States-men are the most Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and oftentimes the most Foolish; the
greatest Danger is, that there are more Fools
than VVise men, through which General de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
a Self-conceited States-man may be the
Head of Fools, although but the Tail of VVise
men, and Head to Tail is Disproportionable;
but it may be that this Disproportion may make
them Unactive, by which they become less Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
VVherefore, I am not of the former
Orators opinion, as to have all such Books as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44350:41"/>
treat of State-affairs Burnt, for the Burning of
such Books may advance their Authors Fame,
but not advance the Publick Good; neither do
such Books Publick Hurt, by reason none, but
some few Private Persons read them, for the
Generality delights not in such Studies; so as
they will partly Dye in Oblivion, especially if
you take no notice of them.</p>

               <p>VVE have some Ill-natured people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, that indeavour to turn all
other mens Actions, but their own, to the worst
Sense or Construction; as for Example, some of
our Nobles retire to their Country Habitations,
for which those Ill-natured or Foolish persons
Exclame against them, both in Books and Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as that they Retire through Pride, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Revenge, being Discontented they are
not the Chief Ministers of State, Rulers in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or Counsellers for Advices; also they
would make their harmless Country Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as Hunting, Hawking, Racing, and the
like Sports, as also Hospitality, Dangerous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
which is unjustly Censured, and wickedly
Wrested, to pull out the Right and Truth, to
place Falshood, when as it may be easily known,
that most of our Nobles, which Retire out of this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44350:41"/>
Metropolitan City to their Country Houses,
Retire either for Pleasure, Profit, Quiet, or
Health, or all; for it is manifest, that in a very
Great and Populous City, there is nothing but
Trouble, Expenses, Noise, and oftentimes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Diseases, all which some Ill-natured
men and Pretending Politicians would have
theem suffer rather than to avoid. But those
men that are so Wise, to choose the Best, are not
Afraid of a Bawling Pen or Tongue, and seldom
Consider or Regard what they Write or Speak,
and if they do, they only give such Find-faults
Pity or a Scorn. But put the Case, <hi>Noble
Citizens,</hi> that some Noble men did Retire out
of some just Discontent, as for Example, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
this Kingdome or Monarchy had been in a
long Civil Warr, and some Noble men had not
only been so Loyal, as never to Adhere to the
Rebels, but had Serv'd their Prince to the last of
their Power, Ventured their Lives, Lost their
Estates, and had Indured great misery in a long
Banishment, and after an Agreement of Peace,
and the Proof of their Honesty and Loyalty,
should be Neglected or Affronted, instead of
Reward and Favour; if these Forsaken and
Ruined, although Honest Persons, should Retire
from Court and City into the Country, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
their Misfortunes in solitary Groans, or to
pick up their scattered Goods, broken Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and tattered States, or to restore their Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
Posterity to some time of Life, should
they be Rail'd and Exclamed against? can Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44350:42"/>
Bless a State or Kingdom, that will suffer
such Uncharitableness and Inhumanity? or can
Nature suffer her most Noble-minded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to stay in the presence of Publick Affronts,
Disgraces, and Neglects, and not humbly turn
their Faces from them, or Honestly indeavour
not to Trouble those, that have a desire to Please?
and if by their Wise Prudence, those Retired
Persons can afford themselves some Harmless
Recreations to mix and temper their Over-care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and Industrious Labours, they ought not to
be Condemned for it; for God and Nature
mixes Good and Evil, and the greatest Grief hath
some Refreshment of Ease, and the hardest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
some Rest, but only these Find-faults are
Restless, through Envy and Ambition, hoping
by their Busie Heads, Restless Pens, and Abusive
Exclamations, to rise to Promotion and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and though they pretend to Discover Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
they are the only Authors of Factions
and Seditions. Wherefore it would be very fit,
<hi>Noble Citizens,</hi> that our Ministers of State and
Magistrates should Silence such bold Persons,
that dare Censure our Nobles private and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Actions; for if they should have that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
they would in time Censure this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

               <p>IT is very probable, we shall fall into a Civil
Warr, through the Divers Opinions in One
and the same Religion; for what hath been the
cause of this Hash in Religion, but the Suffering
of Theological Disputations in Schools, Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Churches, and Chambers, as also Books of
Controversies? all which ought not to have
been Suffered, but Prohibited, by making Laws
of Restraint; but since that Freedome hath been
given, the Inconveniency cannot be Avoided,
unless the Magistrates will give, or at least not
oppose a Free Liberty to all; for if the People
of this Nation is so Foolish, or Wilfull, or Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

and to Unite in One Religion, but will be

the Governours must Yield, or they will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the Civil Government with the Fire of
their Zeal; indeed they will Consume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

the best remedy to prevent their Own
ruine, with the ruine of the Common-wealth,
is, to let them have Liberty of Conscience, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,
that they do not meddle with Civil
Government or Governours; and for Security
that they Shall not, there must be a Law made
and Inacted, that, whosoever doth Preach, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,

shall be Punished either with Death, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

of this Kingdome, there ought to be a strict
Law, that no Governour or Magistrate shall in
any kind Infringe our Just Rights, our Civil or
Common Laws, nor our Ancient Customs; for
if the One Law should be made, and not the
Other, the People would be Slaves, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours

Loose and Idle persons to Live without Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or to pass by their Abuses without Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
also to Reform the Excess of Vanity,
Luxury, Drunkenness, and Adultery, of which
the Chiefest are most Guilty; for the Poor and
Inferiour sort hath not Means to maintain those
Vices, although they indeavour to the utmost
of their Abilities; and as they have not Means,
so they have not that Courage or rather Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to Act Vices so Publickly, as the Richer
sort doth; for Poverty is Humble, which makes
it Modest, when as Riches is Proud and Bold;
the truth is, this City is like a Surfeited Body,
full of Diseases, and I fear, easie Remedies,
which are Perswasions, will not Cure you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Warrs, Plagues or Famine come amongst
you, or be Applied to you, for they may Cure
some, although they will Kill most: But one
thing I VVonder most at, that you send your
Children to School, to be Instructed in Divinity
and Morality, which is to Teach them to Pray
and to Fast, to be Humble and Charitable, to be
Prudent and Temperate, yet at Home they
have Leave and Liberty to be Vain, Idle, and
Expensive, to Feed Luxuriously, to Play Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly,
and to Live Riotously, so that what good
their Tutors teach them by Reading and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
their Fathers corrupt them by Example and
Precepts; they go forth to be Schooled, and
come home to be Fooled. Wherefore, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine, why you should put your selves to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44350:44"/>
that Charge, to have your Children Taught and
Instructed to that which is Good, and yet suffer
them to do what is Bad, unless you desire to
fee whether God or the Devil be Strongest in
them; But if you cannot Live more Soberly,
Moderately, Orderly, and Honestly, the best
way were to send your Children so far from
you, as not to hear of you, untill you Dye, so
that the next Generation may be Better, unless
by Nature you leave your Sons to Inherit your
Vices, as they do your Goods by Birth, and then
there is no Hopes of Amendment. It is likely
you will say, Why I stand here Talking to you,
and Exhorting you? I answer, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p>YOu think your Sons not well Bred, unless

to see and understand Fashions, Customs,
and Manners of the World, by which they may
Learn the better to Know themselves, and to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44350:45"/>
Judge of others; but though you send your
Sons abroad, in Hope they will Profit by their
Travels, yet you are for the most part Deceived
in your Hopes and Expectations: for our Young
men in this Age get nothing by their Travels,
but Vanity and Vice, which makes them Fools;
for they gain not any Profitable Understanding,
or Knowledge, to make them Wise men; the
truth is, they go forth of their Own Country,
Civil Men, but return Brute Beasts, as Apes,
Goats, and Swine, and some few return Foxes,
so that their Travels Metamorphose them from
Men to Beasts; and as for their Learning of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Languages, give me leave to tell you, that
they Learn more Words than Wit, which
makes them speak Much, but not Well. But to
come to the Drist of my Speech, since our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
Gallants being home only Vanity and
Vice, as more Prodigality than Frugality, more
Luxury than Temperance, more Diseases than
Health, more Extravagancy than Discretion,
more Folly than Experience, and more Vice than
Vertue, it were better they should stay at Home,
than Travel as they do; for their Travels are
not only Unprofitable to Themselves, and their
Country, but Destructive; for their Vices and
Vanity, doth not only Corrupt their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and civil Manners, and wast their Bodies
and Estates, but it Corrupts all good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Weal Publick; for which Reason,
I think it most requisite and fit, that none should
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44350:45"/>
Travel without Leave of the State or Publick
Counsel, and at their Return should be Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the State and Publick Counsel of their
Travels, and the Advantages they have made.
Thus their Travels would be Profitable both to
Themselves, and to their Country; for they
would be as a Nursery and School to breed up
Youth to be Wise men.</p>

               <p>HEre is a Company of Players, which are
for Pleasure and Pastime to those that have
Nothing to do, and Money to Spend; but give
me leave to tell you, youMis-spend your Time,
and also your Money, unless the Players were
better Actors, and their Playes better Playes;
for as their Playes have no VVit in them, so the
Actors have no Grace, nor Becoming Behaviour
in their Actions; for what is Constraint, is Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming,
as being not Natural, and whatsoever
is Unnatural, is Deformed: but pray, Mistake
me not, as believing, I am an Enemy to Playes
or Players, for I am an Enemy only to Foolish
Playes, and Ill Actors, but for Good Playes well
Acted, I am so far from being an Enemy to
them, as I think there is nothing so Profitable
for Youth, both to Increase their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44350:46"/>
and to Fashion their Behaviour; and for
those that have Spare time, they cannot pass it
more Pleasingly; therefore let me Advise you,
that are Magistrates of this City, to set up a
Company of Players at the Common charge,
and to Maintain some Excellent Poet, to make
Good Playes, and certainly you will be no Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
in so doing, but Gainers, being the Best
and Readiest way of Education for your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
for the Poet will inform them both of
the World, and the Natures and Humours of
Mankind, an Easier and Delightfuller way, than
the School-men; and the Actors will shew
them to Behave themselves more Gracefully
and Becomingly, than their Dancing-Masters.
Thus they will Learn more both for their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Minds of the Poet and Players, than
of their Tutors and Governours, or by Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Travelling, which is Expensive, Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and Dangerous, whereas the other is
Easie, Delightfull, Safe, and Profitable. Also
one thing more I must advise you, that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a Practick Judicious man, to Instruct the
Players to Act well; for as they must have a
Poet, to make their Playes, so they must have a
Tutor to teach them to Act those Playes, unless
the Poet will take the pains to teach them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as to Humour the Passions, and to Express
the Humours Naturally, and not to Act after
the French Fashion, with High strained Voices,
Constrained Motions, Violent Actions, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44350:46"/>
such Transportation, as is neither Gracefull, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming,
nor Natural; but they must make Love
Soberly, Implore Favour Humbly, Complain
Seriously, Lament Sadly, and not Affectedly,
Fantastically, Constraintly, Ragingly, Furiously,
and the like; all which in my Opinion they do
Senselesly, Foolishly, and Madly; for all Feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

on a sudden came a Man, who as it seems, was
her Husbands Enemy, for he assaulted her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
with a drawn Sword; this Woman seeing
her Husband in Danger, as being Unarmed and
Defenceless, was so afrighted as she knew not
what she did; Wherefore, she having got a
Dagger, which lay in the Room they were in,
and thinking to thrust it into her Husbands Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Unawares thrust it into her Husbands Body,
wherewith he fell down, and immediately Died,
which when she saw and perceived the mistake,
she was as Distracted, and at last fell into a Trance,
but being Recovered out of that faint Fit, she
hath since remain'd a most Sorrowfull and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Widdow; I Express her Sorrow, to

for the Death of her Husband was not
Designed or Intended by her, but by Fate and
Fortune; and it is the Duty of a Loving Wife,
to defend her Husbands Honour, Person, and
Life, with all her Indeavours, and if the success
of her Honest, Loyal, and Loving indeavours
falls out unfortunately, She ought not to be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

from all Suspect, wherefore much more ought
they to accompany their Husbands in Death,
who are liable to be Judged and Condemned for

                     <hi>Most Reverend Judges,</hi> This Adulteress,
and Adulterer, (for so in truth they are) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Woman is ashamed to confess in
Words, only in silent Tears, yet the man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
his fault publickly, and asks pardon, only
he says, it is a Natural fault: for the desire of
Procreation is Born and Bred in all Nature's
Animal Creatures; it is an Orginal Appetite,
but whether it be an Original Sin, he says, he
doth not know; yet if it be, it may more justly
be Pardoned, than Gluttony, which was the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44350:49"/>
cause of Mans Fall, witness <hi>Eve,</hi> and the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Fruit; and that Damnable Sin, Gluttony,
that destroyes many Lives through Surfeits, the
Law takes no notice of, but Procreation that
begets and makes Life, is Punish'd by the Law,
which seems strange to Reason, that Cursed
Gluttony should be Advanced, and Loving A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
Hang'd. Indeed, it is a great Injustice,
at least a grievous Law; and surely our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
that made that Law, were Defective
either in Bodies or Minds, or at least in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and though I confess it is not fit, we
should break or dissolve those Laws, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Erroneous they are, that our Predecessors
made; yet we, their Posterities and Successors
may Sweeten or Qualifie the Extreme Rigor of
their Laws, as in this Case of Adultery, to
Punish the Bodies, but to Spare their Lives;
or to Fine their Estates, and Spare their Bodies;
for if the Rigor of the Law should be put in
Execution in all Cases, and to all Persons, there
would no man be Free, either in his Estate, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or Life; but howsoever, this Male-offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
my Client, sayes, that if he must Dye, yet
he shall not Dye Basely or Dishonourably, by
reason he shall Dye Loves Martyr; As for the
Femal offender, She sayes, that she was seduced
by Nature, as <hi>Eve</hi> by the Devil, and Women
being of Soft and Tender Dispositions, do easily
yield to an Inticing Appetite; besides, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eloquent in Perswading, Prevalent in Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
Free in Protesting, and Earnest in Vows
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44350:49"/>
and Promises, all which hath such force with
Females, who are Credulous and Believing
Creatures, as she had no Power to deny him his
Desire. But both these Lovers desire these
Most Noble and Just Judges to Consider, their
Crime is not caused through Spite, Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Revenge, Scorn, Pride, Hate, or the like
Sins, but through Love, Kindness, Friendship,
Charity, Generosity, Humility, and such like
Vertues, which caused this Crime, namely A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
so that it is the only Sin, that is Built
upon Vertues: besides, this Sin, namely Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
hath a Well-pleased Countenance, a Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Behaviour, and an Eloquent Speech, which is
the cause, most Men and Women are in Love
with this Sin, the Gods forgive them for it; for
this Sin doth not appear with Terrible and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Aspect as Murder, as to cause the very Soul
as much as the Senses to be Maskered with Fear;
not it doth not appear of so Foul an Aspect as
Gluttony and Drunkenness, as to cause Hate or
Aversion, but it hath so Amiable an Aspect as to
cause Love, and so Fruitfull an Effect as to cause
Life and Living Creatures. They implore
Mercy, and beg your Favourable Sentence, and
since it is a Natural effect for Males and Females
to be Adulterers, at least Lovers, you may as
soon destroy all Animal Creatures as this Sin, if
it be one; and if there be some Men and Women
purely chast, those are of Divine Compositions,
and not Perfect Naturals, their Souls and Bodies
having more of the Purity of the Gods, than the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44350:50"/>
gross Corporality of Nature; but these two
Offendants confess, they have proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Nature's Creatures, and the Woman says
she is <hi>Eve's</hi> Daughter, but if you will Spare her
Life, she hopes to be as great a Saint as <hi>Mary
Magdalen;</hi> for she will beg Pardon by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and wash out her Sin with her

accused for Robbery, which is to take away the
Goods of other men in a Visible way and Forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

not Able to help themselves, and for his Weak;
Sick Wife, that Labours in Child Birth; For
which he appeals to Nature, who made all things
in Common, She made not some men to be Rich,
and other men Poor, some to Surfeit with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
Plenty, and others to be Starved for
Want: for when she made the World and the
Creatures in it, She did not divide the Earth,
nor the rest of the Elements, but gave the use
generally amongst them all. But when Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws were devised by some Usurping
Men, who were the greatest Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
(for they Robbed the rest of Mankind of
their Natural Liberties and Inheritances, which
is to be Equal Possessors of the World;) these
Grand and Original Thieves and Robbers,
which are call'd Moral Philosophers, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
makers, were not only Thieves and
Tyrants to the Generality of Mankind, but they
were Rebels against Nature, Imprisoning Nature
within the Jail of Restraint, Keeping her to the
spare Diet of Temperance, Binding her with
Laws, and Inslaving her with Propriety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all is in Common with Nature. Wherefore,
being against Nature's Laws for any man to
Possess more of the World or the Goods of the
World than an other man, those that have more
Wealth or Power than other men, ought to be
Punished as Usurpers and Robbers, and not those
that are Poor and Powerless. Therefore, if you
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44350:51"/>
be Just Judges of Nature, and not of Art, Judges
for Right, and not for Wrong, if you be Judges
of the most Ancient Laws, and not Usurping
Tyrants, you will not only quit this Poor man,
and set him free from his Accusers, which are
His and such Poor men's Abusers, but you will
cause his Accusers, who are Rich, to Divide
their Wealth Equally with Him and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
for which Judgement you will gain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

Her Government is the Ancientest, Noblest,
Generousest, Heroickest, and Royalest, and her
Laws are not only the Ancientest, (for there are
no Records before Nature's Laws, so that they
are the Fundamental Laws of the Universe, and
the most Common Laws extending to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,)
but they are the Wisest Laws, and yet
the Freest; also Nature is the most Justest Judge,
both for Rewards and Punishments; for She
Rewards her Creatures, that Observe her Laws
as they ought to do, with Delight and Pleasure,
but those that Break or abuse her Laws, as in
destroying their fellow Creatures by untimely
Deaths, or unnatural Torments, or do Riot and
oppress her with Excess, She Punishes them
with Grief, Pains, and Sicknesses, and if you

seem to be very Unjust; the One is, that if
a VVoman be Got / with Child by One Man, and
Marries an Other before her Child is Born, that
Child must Inherit her Husbands Estate, if it be
a Son, so that One mans Son comes to be an Other
mans Heir by the Law. The Other is, that if a
man Begets a Son before Marriage, and he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
not the VVoman till After his Son is Born,
and though the Marriage cancels the Fault of
Adultery, and is an Attonement for the Sin or
Crime, both to God and the Law, yet the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Child, that was in No Fault, is put by the
Inheritance by the Law; indeed, the Son so
Born, Inherits only the Disgrace of a Bastard,
but not his Fathers Estate; and thus if the VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
be Incontinent, a mans Own begotten Son
shall not Inherit, and an Other mans Bastard be
his Heir. The same Case is brought to be Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

VVoman, but not of One Father, the Eldest

who in his Life-time did allow her Little,
and at his Death left her Less; for he only left
her a small Annuity during her Life, which is so
Small, as cannot Maintain her, neither Like his
Widdow, nor indeed in any Decent Fashion;
for she having no Joynture, he to Bar her of her
Widdows share, gave her this small Annuity,
knowing that otherwise she should have had the
Third part of his Estate during Life, but he by
a Deed and Gift of a Little hath cast out her
Claim from the Common Law, wherefore she
doth Appeal to this Court of Equity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
hoping to have Justice accordingly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Most Reverend Judges,</hi> There is no Reason,
Equity, nor Conscience, that the VViddow
should carry away During her Life so Great a
Part of her Husbands Estate, as to Impoverish
his Children, and Ruine his Family; besides,
it hinders the Paying of Debts, and there be
very few Families, that have not Debts as well as
Children, which Creditors ought to be Paid as
well, as Children to have Portions: and were
there no Debts, yet many Childrens Portions,
although but Small, would shrink a Great Estate
almost into Nothing; but if a VViddow carries
out the Third Part, there will be little left for
after Posterity, when every Child hath had
their Portion, indeed so Little, as after Posterity
will have Nothing to Live on, nor to be Bred up
with, which is the Cause there are so many
Noble, Honourable, and Right VVorshipfull
Beggers; nay, it makes them not only Beggers,
but Base and VVicked, for having not Means
according to their Births, nor Minds according
to their Means, Despising their Fortunes, they
take Desperate Courses, or else their Minds are
so Dejected, as they Degenerate from their
Births, and do Base Actions.</p>

                     <hi>Most Reverend Judges,</hi> It is against Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Equity, that the Mother, that Bred and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Most Reverend Judges,</hi> It is against all
Reason, Equity, and Conscience, that Parents
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44350:55"/>
should Get and Bring forth Children, and not
Provide for those Children; for if they give
them no Means to Live, as neither by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Get Means, nor some Allowance or
Means to Live, their Children will have Small
Reason to Thank their Parents, or Natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be Dutifull to them, for giving them a
Miserable Life, which Deserves no Thanks, nor
can Challenge a Duty; for as Children are
Bound by the Laws of Nature to Assist their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
so Parents are Bound by the Laws of
Nature, to Provide for their Childrens Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and when the Bonds are Broken of one
Part, the othe Part is Free. But, <hi>Most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Judges,</hi> I do not Plead against the Mothers
or Wife's Livelihood; for it is not, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Wives ought not to be Provided for,
for a Man ought to be a Kind Husband, as well
as a Loving Father, but a Wife ought not to be
the Ruine either of her Own, or her Husbands
Children, and if she be a Natural Mother, she
ought to Spare for her Children, and not to
Spend what her Children should have, but
most Women do not only Spend what their
Children should have, but Give it away to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Husband, to the Ruine of the First Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Children and Family; for this Reason,
Wise men that are Husbands, not knowing what
their Wives will do, when they are Dead, leave
them as Little as they can, Securing their own
Estates and Familes as much as they possibly can
from the Spoils and Ruins, which Strangers, as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44350:56"/>
Second Husbands make; for it were more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
not to leave a Wife any Maintenance,
than Too much, and better, One should Suffer,
than Many Perish, at least it is better that a
Widdow should live Poorly all her Life, than
that an Honourable Family should be Poor to all
Succession: Wherefore, this Widdow in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
ought to have no more out of her Dead
Husbands Estate, than what he hath Left her,
which is enough for Necessity, though not for
Vanity, enoough to Live a Solitary Widdow, as
she ought to do, although not enough to Inrich
a Second Husband, which a hundred to one, but
she would do, if she had it; but her Husband
was a Wise Man, a Carefull Father, and a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Husband in not giving his VVife the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

whose Cause hath been Heard, Judged, Cast, and
Condemned by the Judges of the Laws of this

acquit or Pardon them; Indeed their cause
is Hard, for they were Forced either to Offend
the Laws of Government, or the Laws of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the Laws of Government threatned Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Death, the Laws of Honour threatned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
and being Worthy Persons, they chose
rather to Venture Life, than to Live Dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably;
But their Crime, or (it may rather be
called) their Justice, which the Laws of the
Land have Condemned them for, is for Killing,
or rather Punishing their Sister for the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44350:59"/>
Immodesty, Dishonesty, and Dishonour of
Inchastity, which was an Offence to the Gods,
a Reproach to her Life, a Disgrace to her Race,
a Dishonour to her Kindred, and an Infamy to
her Family; As for the Sin, they past that by,
to be Judged of by the Gods, her own Reproach
they regarded not, the Disgrace of her Race
they indeavoured to obscure; But as for the
Dishonour to her Kindred, and Infamy to her
Family, her Brothers were resolv'd to Wash off
the Dishonour with her Blood, and to Rub out
the Black spot of Infamy with her Death, which
Resolution they put in Execution, forcing a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
to open an Artery Vein; through which
she Bled to Death. Besides, had they let her
have Liv'd, the Laws of the Land would have
Punished her, which would have been a Double
Dishonour, and a Recorded Infamy, receiving
as much Dishonour by her Public Punishment,
as her Private Crime. Wherefore, to prevent
as well, as to take off all Disgrace, they were her
Executioners, by forcing the Surgeon to strike
an Artery, a very Easie Death for so Great an
Offender: but the Natural Affections from Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to a Sister, did desire she might Dye with
as Little Pain as might be: Now Dead she is, and
they Condemned to Dye for her Death, unless

but Complaints, I shall answer this Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Counsellour,
whose Judgement is more Severe,
than I hope your Majesty will be in your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
He says, it is Inhuman, Uncharitable,
Unnatural, and Impious for neer Allies to Kill
each other; but neither your Majesty, nor
your most Loyal Subjects, should nor would
think, nor believe so, if your Majesty had a
Civil Rebellious Warr, which I Pray the Gods
to keep you from, yet in all Civil Warrs neer
Allies Fight against one an other, and Kill one
another, believing they do not only their King
but God Good Service in so doing; for what
Pious Men or Loyal Subjects would not Kill
their Fathers, or their Sons, that Fight against
their King, or do but Oppose his Will and
Pleasure? nay, those that Speak against it, ought
to be accounted Traitors; and as for Honour,
which is said only to be an Opinion and Fancy
of some men, yet it is such an Opinion and Fancy
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44350:60"/>
that without it men would neither be Generous,
nor Valiant, Just, nor Gratefull, Faithfull, nor
Trusty, but all men would be Sordid, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
Cowards, False Cheats, Unthankfull, and
Treacherous; besides, Wit and Learning would
be quite Abolished or Buried in Oblivion, and
if men care not for Esteem, Respect, and Praise,
men would not care to do that which is Good,
but on the contrary would do all the Hurt and
Evil they could; for Praise keeps men from
Evil, more than Laws or Punishment, and
Praise is more Powerfull to Perswade and to
Allure men to good, than Strength or Authority
hath Power to Inforce men to good, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Lives in Praise, and Praise Lives in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Acts, which Worthy Acts Fame Records,
that After-ages may know, what Just, Valiant,
Generous, Wise, Learned, Witty, Ingenious,
Industrious, Pious, Faithfull, and Vertuous men
Liv'd in Former times, which Knowledge will
make Posterity Desirous and Industrious to do
as their Fore-fathers have done. Thus do Good
and Honourable Acts beget their like in After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
which is a Race of Worthy Deeds.
Wherefore, your Majesty for the Good of the
Present and Future times, will Favour these
men that Love Honour more than Life, and
Fear Disgrace more than Death, which is the

Unruly and Unwieldy to be Govern'd, and being
fully Populated, it will not only be apt to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Air, and so cause Often and Great
Plagues, which may Infect the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
for where Many People are, there is
much Dung and Filth, both within the Streets
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44350:61"/>
and Houses, as also Foul Bodies and Corrupt
Humours, which of Necessity must be very Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome;
but it will Devour the rest of the
Kingdome, for it is the Mouth and Belly that
Devours the Fruitfull Increase of the Land, yet
Labours not to Husband the Ground: Besides,
the Richest and Noblest of your Subjects Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the most part in the City, as being the
Chief City, Rob the Country, and Inrich the
City; for what they Receive in the Country,
they Spend in the City, so that they Feed on
the Labours of the Poor Country-men, and are
Inriched by the Vanities of the Nobles. Thus
they Thrive by Vanity, and Live by Spoils,
Wasting the Plenty, Beggering the Gentry, and
Ruining the Country, and so the Kingdome.
Also too Great and Populous a City is not only
a Head too Great for the Body of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
but like a Head that is full of Gross Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
indeed a Great City is a Head fill'd with
Evil Designs, and not only a Head with Evil
Designs, but it is the Tongue of Detraction, the
Heart of Civil Warr, the Magazin of Warring
Arms, and the Treasury to maintain Rebellious
Armies; for though they are more apt to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
than to Fight, and more apt to Rise in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
than in Arms, yet more apt to Take up
Arms, than to Keep Peace; and though they
have neither Conduct nor Courage, yet they
will Destroy with Force and Fury, whosoever
will offer to Oppose them; and their great Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will make them more apt to Rebell, than if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44350:62"/>
they were Pinched with Necessity; for their
Wealth makes them Proud, their Pride makes
them Ambitious, their Ambition makes them
Envious, their Envy makes them Factious, their
Faction makes them Mutinous, and in a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
Mutiny they will indeavour to pull
your Majesty from your Throne, break your
Laws, and make Havock and Spoil of all the
Goods and Lives of your Loyalst Ministers of
State, and Noblest Persons about you, and for
the most part, the most Honest and Worthiest
Persons they can come to, they will Destroy.
Thus a great City is too Rich to be Obedient,
too Proud to be Govern'd, too Populous to be
Quiet, and too Factious to Live Peaceably.</p>

               <head>A Privy-Counsellours Speech to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,

               <p>I Think it my Duty to inform your Majesty,
that Trade is so Decayed, as it will in a short
time Ruine your Kingdome, if not Timely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired;
for this Kingdome being an Island,
Trade is the Foundation to Uphold it, without
which Foundation it will fall to Ruine; and the
Chief Persons of and for Trading in an Island
are Merchants Adventurers, which are both
Forein and Home Traffickers. These Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
your Majesty should Assist and Defend
to the Utmost of your Power. As for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44350:62"/>
of Trade, there be Three things, the
First is Easie Taxes for Customs; the Second is,
to Secure them from Enemies at Sea; the Third
is, Not to Suffer your Neighbour-Nations to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon their Privileges, or to Take the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from them: As for the first, to Lessen your
Customs, will Lessen your Revenue, and that
ought not to be, by Reason your Revenue is not
so Great, as to admit of any Diminution, your
Charge being Extraordinary Great, but your
Majesty may Secure them at Sea by your Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and Maintain their Privileges abroad and at
home by your Power, which Actions will not
only cause your Neighbours to Fear you, but
your Subjects to Love you, the One for your
Force, the Other for your Favour. And give
me leave, <hi>Dread Soveraign,</hi> to inform you, that
the more Merchants Adventurers you have, the
more Power and Strength at Sea you have; for
Shipping increases with their Trade, in so much,
as your Merchants Adventurers will both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
your Power and Wealth; for if they be
Rich, the Kingdome cannot be Poor, and if the
Kingdome be Rich, your Majesty cannot be
Poor; besides, their Ships of Burden are an
Assistance to your Ships of Warr, both which I
beseech the Gods to increase for your Majesties,
and your Subjects Security.</p>

               <p>I Think it my Duty, being one of your Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Counsellours,
to give your Majesty Advice,
lest Sudden Dangers may Surprize you, or at
least great Disorders may give you great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
for certainly, if your Majesty take not a
speedy Course to Rectifie some Errors, you will
soon have a Civil Warr, which I pray the Gods
to Avert: The first Error is, that Justice is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
the second, that Vanity is Excessive;
the third and worst, that your Treasury is
Empty: To Rectifie Injustice, is, to suffer no
Offices to be sold, nor Bribes to be taken; To
Rectifie the Excess of Vanity, is, to see that a
Law be made, that every Degree or Quality is
to be Known or Distinguished by their Habits,
and to set a Stint or Proportion in Feasting, as
that the Greatest Feast shall not Exceed such a
Price or Charge, as your Majesty and your
Great Council shall think fit; And to Rectifie
your Empty Treasury, is, to provide that first
your Majesties Expences must not be above your
Revenue; also to take great care, that your
Officers and Receivers do not Coosen your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
for if your Expences be above your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and that your Officers and Receivers
Deceive you, your Majesty must be Necessitated
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44350:63"/>
to Tax your People, which will so much Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
your Subjects in General, as will cause
them to Murmur, and make them apt to Rebell,
and if they should Rebell, your Majesty for
want of Money, would not be able to Resist
them, or to Help your Self; also for want of
Money, your Majesties Magazins are as Empty,
as your Treasury. Wherefore, your Majesty
must be Industrious to Fill the One, and to Store
the Other, that your Majesty may have Arms
and Ammunition for your use, if need Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>

               <p>THere are some Needy, or rather Spending,
or Wasting Unthrifts, that have got from
your Majesty leave for Monopolies, not caring
what Harm they do your Majesty, so they may
Reap a Profit to Themselves; but were they as
Meritorious Subjects, as any your Majesty
hath, yet they cannot be so Deserving, as to
Displease many Thousands of your other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to Favour and Reward some Few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Persons, and for the Advancing and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
of those Persons, many Hundreds, nay
Thousands are Ruined, at least Impoverish'd;
but if your Majesty were any wayes the Better,
or receiv'd any Profit, either by Increasing and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44350:64"/>
Inriching your Treasures, or for the Service of
your Warrs, or that it were any wayes Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
for your Government, or that you did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Pleasure or Delight thereby, Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies
ought not to be Spoken against, but it is so
far from that, as it Impoverishes your Majesties
Store, by Impoverishing your Subjects, by their
Ingrossing, and then Inhansing particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and when the Generality of your
Subjects are Poor, your Majesty cannot be
Rich; for your Revenue comes or is drawn
from the Generality throughout your whole
Kingdom, and not from some Particular Persons;
for though particular Persons may make your
Majesty Poor, by receiving from your Majesty
Great Gifts, yet particular Persons cannot make
your Majesty Rich, with particular Presents or
Assessments. Thus particular Persons may
Drain your Treasury, but not Fill it. Neither
can Monopolies nor Monopolizers serve you in
your Warrs; for though Monopolies and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizers
may be the Cause of Civil Warrs, by
Discontenting the People, yet they cannot
Maintain your Warrs, nor Defend your Person,
nor Pacifie the People, unless by the Sacrifices
of their Lives, and those will not alwayes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them; for whensoever a Rebellion is
Raised, and Civil Warrs begun, it is a long
time, before there can be Peace again. Neither
can Monopolies be Beneficial to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
for the Common-wealth thrives in
Equal Distributions, whereas Incrochments, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossings,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44350:64"/>
and Hordings of several and particular
Commodities, Impoverish the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
like as when some men Hord up Corn,
it causes a Dearth, Inhansing the Price so High
as the Poorer People are not able to Buy it, or
at least not so much as daily to Feed them; the
like for Money; when Rich Miserable men
Hord up Money, it makes such a Scarcity of it,
that the Poor People, although they Labour
Painfully, yet cannot get enough to Maintain
Themselves, their Wives, and Children; for
the Scarcer Money is, the Cheaper is their
Work, in so much as Poor Labouring men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get Half the Worth of their Labour: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth your Majesty receive any Pleasure or
Delight by Granting Monopolies or Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers;
for what Pleasure can it be to hear the
Murmurs and Complaints of your Poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
what Pleasure can it be for your Majesty
to have Monopolizers, to Spend what they get
by their Monopolies, on Mistresses, Luxury, and
Vanity? they are not to Entertain your Majesty
with Masks, Playes, Shews, Sports and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes,
for you pay Dear for those Delights
without their Assistance. The truth is, that
those Monopolizers get more, than they ought to
do that way, and yet not so much as the People
loses; Like as those that Plunder a City, the
City loses more than the Souldiers get by their
Plunder, for they can make little Profit of those
Commodities, that the Citizens grew Rich by,
and the Souldiers do not only Take the Goods,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44350:65"/>
but Spoil the Trade; The like do Monopolizers;
indeed they are Devouring Worms in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
Eating out the very Bowels,
which is Trade, for without Trade a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
cannot well Subsist; for how should men
Live by one an other, but by Trading? But we
are sure, that your Gracious Majesty did not
know or think what a Mischief Monopolies are
in a Common-wealth, otherwise we your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

never have Granted or Suffered such Sores upon

when your Majesty hath got a Sufficient Power
to Oppose them, or to Command them, then
Declare your Will and Pleasure, and put your
Justice in Execution. Wherefore it is Requisite,
that your Majesty should Store your Magazins,
Man your Forts, make Garrisons, Rigg your

my Peace, nor my Rights; Neither can I call
you Good, for you are Factious, Complaining,
and full of Malice; nay, it may be a question
whether I may call you Subjects, for you Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
all Authority, Resist the Laws, and will
Obey no Command, unless you be Forced; and
though you have not Actually Rebell'd, yet you
are in the Way to it, for you Dispute my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and would if you could, take away my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
but will not quit any of your Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
which shews your Unconscionableness,
Ungratefulness, and Unkindness to me, your
<hi>Soveraign;</hi> Besides, you are so Unreasonable,
and so Evil, as you murmur at my Harmless and
Lawfull Pleasures, but will abate none of your
own Vanities, Vices, and Wickednesses. The
truth of it is. I have done like an Over-fond Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who through extreme Love and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to his Children, hath given them their
Wills and Liberties So much, as they forget
their Duties, and become Disobedient through
VVantonness; but had I used Severity instead
of Clemency, and had Rigorously kept you in
Fear, and had Exacted More from you, and had
Yielded Less to you, and had I Curbed your
Liberties, you had been more Obedient, which
would have been more Happy both for Me and
for You; for then you would have been Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
Easily, and Obey'd Willingly, by which
we should have Lived Peaceably, whereas now
we are like to Ruine each other with Civil

VVarrs, unless Heaven open your Eyes of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,

The truth of it is, Raging Men are worse

make VVarr, rather make VVarr in Forein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
than in your Own Country, and on
Strangers, rather than on your Friends; for to
make VVarr on Me, your <hi>King,</hi> and your <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,</hi>
is against the Laws of God; to make
VVarr on the Protector of your Liberties, and
Father of your Country, is Unnatural; to spill
your Friends Blood, is Ungratefull and Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
to Ruine your Native Country, is Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
by which Actions you will become worse

so possest with Fury, as no Intreaties will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess

the truth is, you seem by your Rebellious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

only you cast a Veil of Pretence over your

you were Conquered? and what Privileges

you shall get more Liberty by Rebellious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet you may be Deceiv'd, and in the end
thrust your selves in Absolute Slavery; but it
seems you had rather be Base Slaves, than Loyal

               <p>MY Beloved, and most Loving Subjects, (for

for I do not Love to be as a Stranger to my
Subjects, nor I would not have my Subjects as
Strangers to me; and if it were possible, I
would be acquainted with their Faces, Degrees,
Qualities, and Professions, and not only be their
King, but their Friend, not to Govern them in
General, but to Counsel and Advise in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
Indeed, I have Reason to give you often
Publick Visits, as also Publick Thanks for your
Loyalty and Love; for your Obedience seems
such, as you seem to Watch for my Commands,
and your Love is such, as you seem to prefer
my Safety before your Own Lives, and my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
before your Own Profits, in so much as
you seem you did Desire only to Live to Serve
me; for which I Thank the Gods for making
me so Happy to be a King of such Subjects,
whose only Strife is for my Favour, who are
Ambitious only for my Fame, and take a Pride
in my Glory, whose Valours Inlarge my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
whose Industries Inrich my Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
whose Delights are my Pleasures, whose
Love Protects my Person, and whose Prayers
are for my Health and Long Life; I can only
say, that your Loyalty, Obedience, and Love,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44350:73"/>
is not to a King, that doth not Regard it, nor to a
Tyrant, that had rather be Fear'd than Loved;
but assure your selves, my Affection to my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is such, as a Fond Fathers to his Only Son,
who had rather Die for his Sons Good, than
Live to his Own Pleasure, and that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of his Life are for his Sake, as to make
his Son Rich, Noble, and Powerfull, that he
may have Respect, Renown, and Fame amongst
Strangers; The like do I for my Subjects. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a King is the Common Father of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

Loving Friends, Noble Men,

here Death's Prisoner; yet though
I must part with my Subjects, they
shall not part with their Soveraign, for I shall
leave them a King, though I Die. I have been
your Crown'd King this Thirty Years, a Heavy
Weight, and a Long time of Trouble; But a
King hath more Title than Power, and more
Power than Pleasure: for were all his Subjects
Slaves, and all did Obey his Will, yet to Order
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44350:74"/>
and Govern them to his Will, requires Pains,
Care, and Study; but my Desire and Will was
to make my Subjects Happy, to which end I
bent all my Industry, the which I wish, my
Successor may do the like, for good Subjects
deserve a good Soveraign; Indeed, all good
Subjects have not at all times good Soveraigns,
nor all good Soveraigns good Subjects, for all
Soveraigns are not Wise, nor all Subjects Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
for though good men make good Subjects,
yet good men do not alwaies make good Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns,
as being not Piety, nor Moral Honesty,
that makes good Kings, but Industry, Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
Understanding, Judgement, Wit, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Courage, that makes Kings Wise
Rulers; also Counsels, Experience, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which makes an Old King a Better Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
than a Young King, and yet all Subjects
for the most part grow weary with their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
Age, and so consequently with their own
Happiness; but their Folly and Ingratitude is
often Punished in having their Desires. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
most of mankind through Ignorance and
Inconstancy desire their own Hurt, which when
they Feel, they are Displeased with the Gods
for Granting that they were Earnest with the
Gods to Give them, so that they are seldome
Contented: But I wish they may have good
Desires, contented Minds, and happy Lives, and
I pray the Gods, they may Flourish with my
Successors in Peace and Plenty, as they have
done with Me, to whom I leave You, and Him
to you: Farewell.</p>

to tell you what Strange Creatures there are in

what Adventures I have made, or what several
Countries there are, and which is good for Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or what Commodities there are, or what

those that are Sent thither, as by Sickness,

for though I have been at the Confines of Death,

Atheistical, but if they were, yet when
they come to Die, they would change those
Atheistical Opinions: and as Bad as they are
thought to be, yet they are not Afraid of Death;
for then they would not Venture their Lives so
Often as they do; indeed Travellers have as
Great Courage as Souldiers have, and 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved

Envy, Malice, Revenge, nor Covetousness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

all men, Travellers have most reason to Adore
and Worship God Best, for they see Most of his

my Soul, to Bear it to the Gods, when parted
from my Body, a Virgin's Soul it is, Cloth'd
with white Innocency, and so fitter for their
Company, as also for the Robe of Glory, which
the Gods will give me. As for my Body, though

it be Young, yet is it only fit for Death, as being
Due to him, for that was made of Earth, and
Death is Lord of all the Earth doth Form,
Breed, and Bring forth; but Souls being of an
other Nature, those that are Celestial, Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the Gods, do to the Gods Return;
whereas Wicked Souls, that are Damned, and
Proceed not from the Gods, but from the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

for all is Good, that doth Proceed from God,
and though the Best of Souls doth Sin, yet God
doth give them Purging Grace, that Cleanses
them from Evil, which Grace hath Purified my
Soul, and made it Fit for Heaven, where I do
wish all Souls may come. Farewell.</p>

               <p>KInd Friends, and Wanton Lovers, when I

to hear my Voice, and to Injoy my Person in
Amorous Imbraces, and all for your own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Delights, but I did Entertain such Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors
more for the Lucre of Profit, than for the
Pleasures of Love, more for your Presents, than
your Persons; the truth is, I was more Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of Wealth than Amorously Affected; not,
but that I took Pleasure in seeing my Beauty
Admired, and hearing my Wit Prais'd, and took
delight to insnare mens Affections with my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
Graces, and was Proud of the Power I
had by Nature's Favour, yet that Power I only
imploy'd to Inrich my Self, that I might Live
Bravely and Luxuriously, or to Hord up to
maintain me when I was Old. But O those
Covetous desires and Vain delights have
Ruined both my Body and Soul, in Grievous
Pains I Live, and should Despairing Die, but that
the Gods are Mercifull, and Pardon Penitent
Sinners, for if I were to Live, I would not Live
that Life I have done, not only for my Souls
sake, but for my Bodies; for had I thought of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44350:79"/>
Death, or could imagine the Pains that now I
feel, the Pocky rotting Pains that Torture my
weak Body, I should have been less Covetous
of Wealth, and more Carefull of Health, I
should not have made my Beauty, Wit, and
becoming Graces and Adornments to intice
Customers to buy Sinfull Pleasures; or had I
thought of the Joys in Heaven, I should have
Despised all worldly Delights; or had I fear'd
the Torments of Hell, I should have Spent my
time in Prayers, and not in Courtships: But
Life is almost Past with me, for Death hath
strucken me with his VVand so, that I cannot

Vanities and worldly Pleasures, as I could never
Spare so much time as to Visit a sick Friend; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was I Charitable to the Poor, as to help to
Relieve their Wants, for I spent so much on my
Braveries, as I left not any thing to give unto the
Poor; indeed, I did shun Visiting the Sick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they put thoughts of Death in my Mind,
which thoughts did disturb my Mind, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct

Death more, and had Visited the Sick oftner, I
had never Liv'd so Idlely, nor Spent my time
so Unprofitably, nor had been so Foolishly Vain,

Church, but not to Pray, but to be Pray'd to,
not as a Saint, but as a Mistress, I may say as a
Sinner; for I went not to Church for Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Beauty, than to Reform my Life, more to get
VVanton Lovers, than to get Saving Grace; I
listned not to what the Preachers taught, but

did I increase and multiply Sins under the Veil

and will Forgive me, for now I do more
Hate Vanities, than ever I did Love them, and all

indeed Death hath frighted all such thoughts
away, and Pious thoughts do take their place,
and as the Gods come neer, the VVorld shrinks
from me, as Guilty of these Sins, and millions

               </opener>
               <p>VVE are met together as Funeral Guests
to a Dead man, who died in the Flower
of his Age, and whilst he Lived, was Favoured
of Nature, Birth, Breeding, and Fortune; for he
was Handsome of Body, Understanding in Mind,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44350:82"/>
Noble of Birth, Knowing in Learning, and Rich
in Wealth. He was Generous, Valiant, and
Courtly; he had a Pleasant Speech, and a
Gracefull Behaviour; He was Beloved of the
Muses, Admired by the Sciences, and Attended
by the Arts; he was Entertained with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the World, and Feasted with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
of Pleasures; yet all could not Save him
from Death. Indeed Death appears more
Cruel to Youth than to Age, because it takes
Youth from the most Flourishing time of their
Life, although Youth Fears Death less than Age,
not that Youth hath more Courage, but Youth
doth not Think of Death so often as Age doth,
for if Youth had Death in their Mind, they
would Fear Death more than Age doth, by so
much more as they are Younger, and know the
World less; but Youth thinks Death a Long
time off from them, although to many he is so
Near, as ready to Seize on them; Wherefore if
those that are Young, did think they should Die
Soon, they would not be so Eager and Fond of
the World as they are, nor be so Vain and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
as many Young Persons be; the brave
Gallants would take little Pleasure in New
Modes, Gay Cloaths, and Fair Mistresses; a
Young Gallant would be but a Dull Courtier,
a Melancholy Lover, not Melancholy for his
Mistress disfavour, but at Death's approach, not
for Love, but for Life; neither would he take
Pleasure in Musick or Dancing, for the thoughts
of Death would make him Dance false, and put
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44350:82"/>
his Hearing out of Tune, and the Musick would
Sound to his Ears as his Passing Bell; neither
would he Eye Beauty, but if he did, the Freshest
Beauty would appear Faded; In truth all his
Senses would be as Rough and troubled VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
disturbed by the Storms of Fear, raised in
his Mind; for the most Valiant minds are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Disturbed with the thoughts of Death, by
reason the Terrors of Death are Natural to all
mankind, not so much to Feel, as to Think of,
not only for the Parting of Soul and Body, and
the dark Oblivion in Death, but for the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
condition after Death; for though Death
is not Sensible of Life, yet Life is Sensible of
Death; so that it is the Thoughts of Death that
are Fearfull, and not Death it self that is so Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
as being neither Painfull to Feel, nor
Dreadfull to Behold, because Invisible and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,
having neither Shape, Sound, Sent,
Tast, nor Touch; But this Noble Person is past
Thinking, and therefore past Fearing, also past
Wishing; for he doth not Desire to live in this
VVorld again, he Thinks not of the World, or
of any thing in the World, he is free from all
Trouble of Mind or Body; in which Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
let us lay him in the Tomb with his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
there to rest in Peace and Ease.</p>

               <p>THis Noble Person that lies here Dead, was
once our General; a Valiant man he was, a
Skilfull Souldier, a Wise Commander, and a
Generous Giver; he Loved his Souldiers more
than Spoil, and Fame more than Life, he was
full of Clemency and Mercy, he would give his
Enemies their Lives Freely, when he had Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them Valiantly, and he was so Carefull of
his Own Souldiers Lives, as he would never
Adventure or put them to the Hazard, but when
he saw great Probability of Victory; Yet this
Gallant man, this Excellent Souldier, whom his
Enemies could never Overcome, Death hath
Taken Prisoner, with whom he shall have but a
dark Lodging, and cold Entertainment. Thus
Death is the most Absolute Conquerour that is,
for no Creature is able to Resist or defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from Death, whose Uncontroling Power
makes him Dreadfull, even to the most Valiant
men, not that they fear Death's Dart, but
Death's Oblivion; for Valiant men love Life,
and fear Death more than Cowards, or else they
would not Venture their Bodies so often, were
it not out of Love to Life, and Fear of Death;
Yet is it not that Life, which Cowards are so
Fond of, nor that Death which they are so A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of, but 'tis the Life of their Fame, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44350:83"/>
Death of their Name, that Honourable and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men so much Love and Fear, insomuch,
that to gain the One, and to shun the Other, they
will Sacrifize their Bodily Life, and Imbrace
their Bodily Death, with more Delight and
Pleasure, than the Beautiful'st Woman that ever
Nature made; and they are to be Commended
for it; for it is Life, that the Gods themselves
take delight in; for the Gods are pleased to
Live in the Minds of their Creatures, and are
Angry if their Creatures Think or Speak not Of
them, as well as to Them: So all Worthy men
Desire and Indeavour to Live in the Minds of
their own Kind, and to be Praised, at least Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of; for they Desire and Indeavour to Live
both in the Thoughts and Words of men, in all
Ages, and in all Nations, and by all Men, if it
were possible; it being as Natural for Worthy
men to desire to be Remembred, as for all men
to desire to Live, and as Natural for men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to Live, as to Love themselves. But some
say, it doth a man no Good to be Remembred
when he is Dead: It may be answered, that
then it doth a man no Good, to be Remembred
whilst he Lives, for Remembrance Lives in the
Absent, and Absence is a kind of Death, but he
is as Evil a Natured man, that cares not to be
Remembered by his Friends, as those that never
Remember their Friends; also he is Unnatural
to his Kind, and it may be said, that such men
are Ungratefull Monsters, or Monstrous Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:
But this Noble Person was Remembred and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44350:84"/>
and Spoken often of by his Absent Friends, and
did Remember, and Spoke often of his Friends
in their Absence, whilst he was Living, and his
Worthy and Valiant Actions will be Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and Spoken of now he is Dead, in which
Remembrance and VVords he may Live so
long as the VVorld lasts, as being the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
this World can give to Worth and Merit,
as Piety, Moral Vertue, Valour and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
Wit and Learning; for there is no other
Reward in this World, but Remembrance and
Praise, which Remembrance and Praise all
Good men will give him as his due. Thus will
the Tongues and Minds of Living men Build
him a Monument of Fame, wherein all his
Worthy Acts will be kept in Remembrance,
though his Body be Dead, and Buried in Earth,
in which let us put it with devout Ceremony.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44350:84"/>
Retard or Delay Sutes Over-long, but in All

for he would not Judge Rashly, as to Judge Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Cruel nor Foolishly Pittifull; for as he would
not Pardon so Much nor so Many, as to Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
men to Offend or Commit Crimes, so he
would not Condemn so Much nor so Many, as
to make a kind of a Massacre of Lives; all
which made him Live with a Good Conscience,

or else Death had no Ears to Hear his Sute; but
if he Pleads as well for Himself at Gods Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
as he did for his Clients at the Barr, he will
get Judgement on his side; the truth is, Nature
as well as Education made him a Pleader; for
Naturally he had a Flowing Speech, and a Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Wit, to Turn, Wind, and Form any Cause
as he Liked best; for his VVit and Eloquence was
such, as to make a Doubtfull Cause seem Clear,
and had he not Known by Learning the Laws
so Well as he did, yet his Wit and Eloquence
would have Covered his Ignorance, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Defect of his Learning, but he was as
Good and Learned a Lawyer, as an Excellent
Pleader, and as Honest a man as Either, for he
took more Pains to Plead his Clients Cause,
than Pleasure to Take from his Clients Fees;
neither would he Prolong his Clients Sute to
Drain their Purses, nor yet make his Clients
Cause more Doubtfull than it was, to make them
more Fearfull of the Success of their Sutes, than
they had Reason to fear, and all this to get More
Fees; for Fears and Desires are Prodigal Givers,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44350:85"/>
as well as Promisers; But rather he Pleaded
<hi>Gratis</hi> for his Poor Clients, wherein he shew'd
more Charity to the Poor, than Covetousness
to the Rich. Thus he was a Good and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Lawyer, a VVitty, Ingenious, Eloquent
Pleader; the truth is, he did not only take Pains
for his Clients, but Pleasure in his Own Wit,
for he had more Delight, than Profit by his
Pleading, and yet he did not take so much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in his Own Wit and Eloquency, as Others
did which Heard him, insomuch, as more went
to Hear him Plead, than those that had Causes to
be Pleaded; he Reproached not any man, nor
used Railing Speeches, or Violent Actions in his
Pleading, as Many, nay Most Pleaders do, but
his Behaviour was Civil, his Wit Sweet, and his
Speech Gentle; for though his Wit was Quick,
Ready, and Free, yet it was neither Salt, Sour,
nor Bitter; and though his Speech was Flowing,
yet it was not Rough, for it ran in a Smooth
though Full Stream; and his Behaviour or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
was so Gracefull and Becoming, as the

Elegancy, Honesty, and Abilities, are
Living in the Memory of Living men, which
will Live by Tradition as Long as there are Men
to Remember or Speak: Wherefore let us Keep
his Living parts in our Minds, and Bury his
Dead parts, as his Body, in the Grave, there to

the Rich from Riot, and the Poor from Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and he took away Superfluities to help Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
not that he Troubled any man for
Living to their Degree and Quality, but he
would not Suffer any man to Live Above their
Degree and Quality; neither would he hinder
men from their Lawfull Pleasures and Delights,
but he would not Connive at their Disorders
and Misrules, neither would he Pardon their
Wickednesses: He Regarded not the Slanders
of his Enemies, nor was he Revengefull, for he
Suffer'd not his Enemies to be Injured, but gave
them all the Justice he could; neither was he
Unjust to his Foes, nor Ungrateful to his Friends,
he had a tender Regard to the Old, Sick, Poor,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44350:86"/>
and Shiftless; Indeed he was such a Magistrate,
as he was a Father, a Husband, a Brother, a
Friend, a Master, a Servant, a Slave for the
Common-wealth, all which adds to our Loss
and Grief, but not to his Happiness; for his
Happiness admits of no Addition, he being as
Happy as can be, in which Happiness let us leave
him, after we have Interr'd him with his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>

Dead Body of our VVorthy Brother
in Learning, to be laid in Peace into the Bed of
Earth, whose Life was so Studious, as we may
say, he was Partly Dead, whilst he Lived, for
the most of his Conversation was with Dead
Authors, and his Study was as his Grave, so that
our Learned Brother hath only Changed his
Habitation and Lanlord, as from his Study to
the Earth, from his Bodily Life to Death; I
confess, his Lanlord, Death, is Covetous, for
Death Exacts or Extorts the Flesh from the
Bones as his due, yet the Body is more Happy,
dwelling more Peaceably with Death, than
with Life; and as his Body hath made a Happy
Change, so hath his Soul, but his Soul dwells
not now with his Body, for the Soul is an Fne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Death, and Flies from it, neither can the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44350:87"/>
Soul live in the Body, when as the Body is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into Insipid Earth, for the Soul being of a
Celestial Nature, cannot Live in a Terrestrial
place, but when Separated, being Pure in it Self,
it is Light, and being Free, as having Liberty,
it is Agil, through which Propriety it Ascends
unto the Gods on High, and Lives with them
Eternally. Thus our Learned Brothers Body
Resting Peaceably, and his Soul Living Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both shall meet Gloriously, and so Let's lay
his Corps into the Grave Humbly, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously,

and Inabled him with Spiritual Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
to Inform, Reform, and Perform the

amongst men; but though his time of Life is
Expir'd, yet his true Doctrine will remain for

               <p>OUr Brother, whose Body is Dead, and is
brought to this place to be Inurned, was
the most Fearfull man that ever Nature made,
not to Die, but to be Forgotten; also he was the
most Ambitious man, not for Wealth, Title, or
Power, but for Fame; In truth, he was so Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
as his Body and Mind was Restless, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to Live, like as Nature, or the Gods
of Nature, which Live, and are partly Known
In their VVorks, and By their Works, which
are their Creatures, especially the Chief of their
Creatures, which are Mankind; for we cannot
Perceive, but that the Chief Habitations of the
Gods are in the Minds of men, with which Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
they are so Pleased and Delighted, as
they Punish those men that Neglect or Forget
them; nay, the Gods Made Men, or such kind
of Creatures, to Remember them, as to Speak of
them, Think of them, and to Admire them in
their Praises, Contemplations, and Adorations;
also to have Visible VVorship to their Invisible
Deities, as to have Altars, Priests, and Sacrifices,
to Offer Praise, Prayers, and Thanksgiving:
So that the Gods are not Satisfied to Live only
To or In Themselves, but in their Creatures;
VVherefore, those men Resemble the Gods
most, that desire Fame, which Fame is to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44350:88"/>
and Prais'd by All Men in All Ages
throughout the VVorld; whereas on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
those that Slight, Neglect, or Speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Fame, as being a Foolish Vain-Glory, in
that it doth a man No Good, to be Remembered
and Praised after the Bodily Life, are Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Ungratefull, and Unnatural: Irreligious,
not Desirous to Imitate the Gods; Ungratefull,
not Divulging. Natures Gifts; and Unnatural,
caring not for the Memory of their Own Kind,
as not caring to Live with Them, which is to
Live in their Minds: Also they are Unjust to
Themselves, not desiring their Own Good, as
their Perpetual Name, Memory, and Fame.
But this our Brother was not of that sort of
Mankind, as to be Contented to be Buried in a
Terrestrial Oblivion, but would have a Celestial
Remembrance, which the Gods Perpetuate for
a Reward to his Merit. So let us lay his Body
in the Grave, and let his Praise Ring out his
Peal.</p>

               <p>THis our Dead Brother, when he had Bodily
Life, he was a Close Student, and had a
Great Library, wherein were more VVorks
than he had Time to Learn, and they were of
more Several Languages, than he was Capable
to Understand; but he Indeavoured, and was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44350:88"/>
Advanced far in Knowledge; his Study was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and Moral Philosophy, his Library the
Universe, and his Several Books the Several
Creatures therein. As for Moral Philosophy,
he knew well how to Compose Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
and to Settle and Govern them; also
he knew well the Natures, Humours, Passions,
and Appetites amongst Mankind, as also to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
and Distinguish them, and to Order, Form,
and Reform them. As for Natural Philosophy,
he did not only Study the Outward Forms of
several Creatures, but their Inward Natures.
In truth, his Conception was so Subtil and Peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
his Observation so Dilative, his Reason so
Strong, his Wit so Agil, his Judgement so Solid,
his Understanding so Clear, and his Thoughts
so Industrious, as they went to the First Cause of
several Effects, and he did not only Converse
with the Body, but the Soul of Nature, indeed
he was Nature's Platonick Lover, and She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
him in Discovering to him her most
Hidden and Obscure Secrets, by which he begot
Great Wisdome and Everlasting Fame; for

               <p>YOu shew your Charity and Humanity, and
that they are not Bound up to Particulars,
or to your Friends, and Country-men, but that
they Extend to Strangers, in coming to see this
Stranger, who Died out of his Native Country,
Decently to be Buried in a Forein Land, I mean
Forein, as from his Native Country, although
the truth is, that all the World is Common to
Mankind, for Nature hath not assigned Men to
any Particular place, or Part of the World, but
hath given All the World freely to them, as if
she made the World and all other Creatures
only for Man's sake; for all other Creatures are
not so generally Disperst, or rather so Spreading
and Branching throughout the World as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is, by reason they Belong, Breed, Prosper
or Increase in Particular Climates, as some in
Cold, and others in Hot, and some in one Part
of the World, and some in Another, for some
Creatures will be so farr from Increasing in some
Particular Climates, as they cannot Live in
them, but in all Parts of the World that are Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable,
there be Men. 'Tis true, Different Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
may cause men to be of Different Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44350:90"/>
but what Complexions soever they
have, they are all of the same kind as Mankind,
and of the same sort of Animals; for though all
Beasts are of Beast-kind, yet a Fox and an Ass is
not one and the same sort or kind of Beast; but
there is no such different sort amongst Mankind,
for there is no difference of men in their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Shapes, Proprieties, Qualities, Abilities,
Capacities, Entities, or the like, unless some
Defects to some Particulars, which is nothing to
the Generality, for all the kind of Mandkind
is all alike both in Body and Mind, as in their
Shapes, Senses, Appetites, Speech, Frowning,
Laughing, Weeping, and the like, as also alike
in their Rational Parts, as Judging, Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
Conceiving, Remembring, Apprehending,
Considering, Imagining, Desiring, Joying, Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
Loving, Hating, Fearing, Doubting, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,

since not any man can be accounted as a Stranger
in any Part of the World, because he hath by
Nature a Right as a Natural Inheritance, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
what part or place of the World he will;
But all Mankind are as Brethren, not only by
Kind, but by Inheritance, as being General Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
and Possessors of the World, so this Dead
man ought not to be accounted as a Stranger, but
a Brother; VVherefore let us Mourn as we

in coming to this Poor, Unfortunate
man's Burial, which though he was a Poor man,
yet he was an Honest man, and therefore is much
the more Worthy to be Praised; for Poverty
and Necessity is a great Temptation to Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
as much as Riches is a Temptation to
Foolery, which is Vanity, nay, Riches is not
only Guilty of Vanity, but Vice, as Luxnry,
Pride, and Wantonness, whereas Knavery is
Cheating, Coosening, Stealing, and the like, of
all which this Poor man was Free; And as he
was an Honest man, so he was a Laborious man,
for his Profession of Life was a Post-Rider, an
Unfortunate Profession for him, for he Riding
fast upon a Stumbling Jade, fell down and Broke
his Neck. Thus we see that Misfortunes as
well as Sicknesses bring many to their Lives
ends, and many times to a Miserable end, for
Misfortunes take Life away Unawares, and
sometimes Unprepar'd to Dye; so this man did
not Think, when he got on the Horses back, he
should Ride Post to Death, for had he thought
so, he would have Chosen to Run <hi>a</hi>-Foot, a
Safer, though a Slower pace: But could his Soul
Ride Post on Death to Heaven, as his Body Rid
Post on a Horse to Death, he might Out-strip
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44350:91"/>
many a Soul that is gone before him; for though
his Soul, as all Souls are Light, and of no
Weight, yet Death is no nimble Runner, being
Cold and Numb, and nothing but Bare Bones, a
Hard Seat for a Tender Soul: Besides, the way
to Heaven is so Narrow and Steep, as Death
cannot Get up, for should he Venture, his Soul
would be in Danger to be Overthrown, and cast
into Hell, which is a Deep, Dark, Terrible, and
Dreadfull Pit, wherein is no Hope of Getting
out: The truth is, Death carries many Evil
Souls down into Hell, but Good Souls he leaves
at the Bottom of the Hill, that leads up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
from which those Souls Climb and Clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
up with great Difficulty; for whatsoever is
Excellent, is Hard to Get or Come to, whereas
that which is Bad, is Easie to be Had. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
this Poor man is Dead, and we shall see
him Buried, leaving his Soul in its Journey, and
his Body in the Grave.</p>

there is no Whoring, Gaming, Drinking, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling,

Death Banishes all Riot and Disorder out of his

all are Happy that Dwell there, for there
is no Envy, Malice, Slander, nor Treachery;
there Men are not Tempted with Beauty, nor

Free from all Tentation or Defamation, neither
are they Troubled or Tormented with Pain or
Sickness, for Death hath a Remedy for all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,

is not only Charitable to Help all Creatures out

that he sets Open his Gates for all Comers,
insomuch, as the Meanest Creatures that are,
have a Free Entrance, and the Same Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

like Meat which is Sweet in the Mouth,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44350:92"/>

Absence, Dissembling, Adultery, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
Vain Expences, Waste, Spoil, Idle Time,

Insensible. Death is only Cruel in Parting
Friends from each other, for though they are

Life all the time of her Widdow-hood, for
which not only Nature, but the Gods might be
Angry with her; for though She did not Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
with Feasting, yet She Starved her self with
Fasting, and though She did not Drink her self
Drunken, as many Women in this Age will do,
yet She did Weep her self Dry; She grew not
Fat and Lasie with overmuch Sleeping, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Lean and Sick with overmuch Watching;
She VVatch'd not to Dance and Play, but to
Mourn and Pray, nor did She waste her Wealth
in Vanities, but She did waste her Life in Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
She Sate not on the Knees of Amorous
Lovers, but Kneeled on her Knees to God; Her
Cheeks were not Red with Paint, but Pale with
Grief; She did not wear Black Patches on her
Face, but Black Mourning on her Body; She
was Adorned with no other Jewels than her
Tears; She had no Diamond Pendents in her
Ears, but Transparent Tears in her Eyes, no
Oriental Pearls about her Neck, but Drops of
Tears lay on her Breast; Thus was She Drest
in Tears. She suffered not Painters to Draw
the Picture of her Face, but her Thoughts did
Form her Husbands Figure in her Mind; She
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44350:93"/>
hung not her Chamber with Black, but her
Mind with Melancholy; She Banished all
Stately Ceremonies, and Ceremonies of State,
and set her self Humbly on the Ground; She
past not her time with Entertaining Visitors, but
Entertain'd her Self with the Remembrance of
her Husband; She did not Speak much, but
Think much. In short, She was so Intemperate
in her Grief, as her Grief Kill'd her, it may be
said she was Murdered with Grief, and no kind
or manner of Murder is Acceptable either to
Nature or the Gods, but some sorts of Murders
are Hatefull to both. Yet this Widdow, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
she Offended in her Over-much Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
She had Pardon for her Praying, and to
prove the Gods did Pardon her, they Granted
her Request, which was, to take her out of this
World without Painfull Sickness, and so they
did; for She was so free from Pains, as She
parted with Life with a Smiling Countenance,
and lay as Still as if She lay to Sleep, She brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
out her last Breath so softly, as those that
stood Close by her Bed, could not hear her Sigh,
and when She was Dead, her Beauty, that all
the time of her Mourning was Obscured in her
Sorrows, Appear'd in her Death, only the Gloss
of her Eyes were Covered with their Lids, for
Death had Shut her Eye-lids down, and Seald

               <p>VVE are met as Funeral or rather Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Guests of a Dead Widdow, who
is now Re-married to her Husband in Death,
and no question, but their Souls will Joy in the
Knowledge of each other; for though Bodies
Dye, yet Souls do not, but Live for ever, Death
having Power only over the Sensitive, not over
the Rational Life; for Knowledge Lives,
though Senses Dye; and if the Soul Lives, no
question, but all that is Inherent in the Soul
Lives, as all the Passions, Affections, Thoughts,
Memory, Understanding, Judgement, Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Speculations, Fancy, Knowledge, and the
like, which are the Parts and Ingrediences with
which the Soul is Composed, Form'd, and
Made; Thus the Soul being made of such
Thin, Fine, Pure, and Rare Matter, Death can
take no hold of it, for Death's Power is only on
Gross Corporeal Substances or Matter, not on
Celestial Bodies, but Terrestrial; but this Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
Soul was Purer than other Souls usually
are, (for there are Degrees of Purity in Souls,
as well as Degrees of Grossness in Bodies.)
The truth might easily be Perceived in her
Life, for there was as much Difference between
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44350:94"/>
her Soul and Other Souls, as between Souls and
Bodies, at least as much Difference as between
a Glorified Soul, and a Soul Imbodied; Nay,
her Soul was so Pure, as it did Purifie her Body,
for it did Resine the Appetites, which Cleared
the Senses; besides, her Soul did Instruct the
Senses, which made them More Sensible, so
that they were kept Clean, Clear, and Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
by Temperance, and made Apt, Quick, and
Ready by Reason, insomuch, as Time had but
a Little Power to Hurt them, and was not Able
to Destroy them without the Help of Death,
had she Lived Long, but Death to shew his
Power, destroyed her Body without the Help
of Time, for she Lived not to be so Old as for
Time to make a Trial; yet her Body Lived
Longer than she was willing it should have done,
desiring it might have Died when her Husband
Died, but the Gods Forbad it; for though any
Creature, especially Man, may Call Death when
he Will, and Force him to take his Bodily Life
away, yet the Gods are Angry, if any man will
not stay whilst Death comes of Himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Inforcement. Nevertheless, Death did Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
this Widdow; for though he did not take
her so Soon as she would have Died, yet he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
her not Long to Live a weary Life, for
which Favour she received Death with Joy, and
a Smiling Countenance, whereas Death for the
most part is received with Fear and Sadness; and
since she Rejoyced at her Death, we have no
Reason to Mourn now she is Dead, especially in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44350:95"/>
that she Lived and Died Vertuously, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
for which the Gods will Advance her to
Everlasting Glory; For this Glory let us Praise
the Gods, and Bury her Body in her Husbands
Tomb or Grave, that their Dust or Ashes may
lye together.</p>

               <p>VVE are the Funeral Guests to a Young
Male Child, an Infant, who Died soon
after it was Born, and though all Men are Born
to Live, and Live to Dye, yet this Child was
Born to Dye, Before it had Lived, I mean in
Comparison of the Age of men; Thus this
Child was Born, Cried, and Died, a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
for the Child, that he had Finished
what he was made for, in so Short a time, for he
could not have had less Pain, less Trouble, nor
less Desires, to have left the World, had he
Liv'd longer, for Life is Restless with Desires,
Sickly and Painfull with Diseases, Troublesome
with Cares, Laborious with Labour, Grievous
with Losses, Fearfull with Dangers, and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in all; which Misery this Child hath
Escap'd, but had he Lived, he could not have
Avoided it: besides, he is not Guilty of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
Sins, and so Deserves no Punishment, for
neither Commission nor Omission can be laid to
his Charge, having no time for Either, so that he
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44350:95"/>
is Free from Both, as also from Suffering, either
in this World, or the Next, unless there be such
a severe Decree, as the Child shall Suffer for his
Parents faults, which Faults he could neither
Hinder nor Annul, neither did he Approve, nor
Allow them, nor Assist them in Evil; But it is
not probable, he shall Suffer, being Innocent;
and Death, that is Accounted the Wages of Sin,
may rather be taken as a Gift of Mercy; also
Death might be said to be a Purifier from Sin,
as well as a Punisher of Sin; Wherefore, this
Child is past the Purgatory of Death, and is in
the Heaven of Peace, Rest, Ease, and Happiness,
in which let us leave him, after we have Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Corps with Earth.</p>

               <p>THis Old Lady was Favour'd by Nature,
Fortune, and Time, Nature in her Youth
gave her Beauty, Fortune gave her Wealth, and
Time and Nature gave her long Life; She was
Courted in her Youth for the Pleasures of her
Beauty, and Flattered in her Age for the Profit

was neither Corrupted with the One, nor Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Charitable uses; Thus what she Got by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44350:96"/>
she Gave to Heaven, indeed she Bought
Heaven with Fortune's Gifts, for none can get

no question, but they have gotten her Sute, and
her Charity will Live here on Earth, though
she be Dead, and those she Relieved will make
her their Saint; Thus she will be Sainted both
on Earth and in Heaven, which is as Great an
Honour, and a more Blessed Condition, than the
Emperours had with all their Conquefts, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

we are here met to attend him to the Grave;
it is an Human, Charitable, and Pious Service, to
see the Dead laid Decently and Ceremoniously
into the Earth, and it is an Happiness for the
Dead, to be Inurned with their Fore-fathers; for
who knows to the Contrary, but that there may
be a Natural Sympathetical Intermixing with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44350:96"/>
their Dust, and an Earthly Pleasure in their
Mixture? for certainly there is a mutual So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
In the Earth, as well as On the Earth, and
why may not the Earth have a Sympathetical
Intermixing and Conjunction as well as the
other Elements? I Perceive no Reason against
it; but whether there be an Incorporating, Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating,
and Friendship, as Dust with Dust, I
know not, surely there is a Peaceable Abiding,
having not a Sensible Feeling or Knowledge,
whereas Life, wherein Sense and Knowledge
Dwells, is Restless, full of Troubles, Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
Pains, and Sicknesses to the Body, and
Perturbations in the Mind, so that the Body is
Seldome at Ease, or the Mind at Quiet; But
Life hath tried the Patience, and Death the
Courage of our Friend, for he was neither Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
with Life, nor Fearfull of Death, he
had such Great Experience living so Long, as to
Know, there is neither Constancy, Certainty,
nor Felicity, amongst or with the Creatures in
this World, and Time had made him so Wise
a man, as he knew by Himself, that there was
no man Perfect, nor truly Happy, for Happiness
and Imperfection cannot Associate together:
yet by his Wisdome, he did Inform, Reform,
Rule and Govern himself as well, as Nature
and the VVorld would give way or leave to;
for he would never Command any, but those
that were Willing to Obey, and he did Obey
those, he Could not Command, he would never
make a fruitless Opposition, but was free from
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44350:97"/>
Faction and Sedition, Ambition and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for he knew, there is not any VVorldly
thing worth an over-earnest Desire, nor any
thing so Permanent, as could be kept Long; he
would Temperately make use of what he Had,
and what he VVanted for his Use, he did Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
Indeavour for it, and what he could not
have Easily and Freely, he was Content to be
without; Moreover, he was so Moderate in his
Desires, as he did Scarcely desire what was Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and oftentimes he would Part from his
Own Maintenance to Relieve the Distresses of
Others, believing he could Suffer want more
Patiently; indeed he had such a Power and
Command of Himself, as the Appetites of his
Body, and Passions of his Mind, were as Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to his Will, as Saints on Earth, or Angels
in Heaven are to the Gods; and this VVise
Government of Himself, made him fit for the
Company of the Gods, with whom we Leave
his Soul, and will Interr his Body as we ought.</p>

Age, being alwayes Poor from her Youth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
so Poor, as she was Forced to Beg for her

but now she is gone to Beg at Heavens Gate, both
for Food and Raiment, where, if Heavens Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Food, and Cloth'd with Celestial Glory, a great
and good Change, for here she was Fed with
nothing but Scraps, and Cloth'd with Raggs,
and much ado to Get them, not without long
Stay and earnest Intreaties; so Hard are men's
Hearts and Cold are men's Charities; the
truth is, men in Prosperity feel not the Misery
of Adversity, and being not Sensible of their
Want, are not Ready in their Relief: besides,
they think all that is given from their Vanities
and Luxuries' is a Prodigal waste, and it is to be
Observ'd, that those that are Richest, are the
most Uncharitable, whereas those that have but
Little, yet will give to those that have Nothing

And to shew the Hard Hearts of Mankind to
their own Kind, this Woman, although she had
Begg'd almost Fourscore Years, yet she got so
Little, as she had nothing to Leave, not so much
as to Bury her. But as she Lived on Cold Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

Lived, she had been Married, for so her Lover

she little thought Death should have been her
Bridegroom, and that her VVinding sheet should
be her Wedding Smock, and her Grave her
Bride-Bed, there to lye with Death, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Death was as far from her Thoughts, as her
Lover neer to her Heart: for had she Believ'd
she should have Died so soon, or but Fear'd it,
she would not have made such Preparations, as
usually Young Maids do for their Wedding
daies; indeed Young Maids have Reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to Esteem much of That day, for it is the
only Happy day of their Life, it is a day which
is wholly Consecrated to Love, Joy, Pleasure,
Bravery, Feasting, Dancing, Mirth and Musick,
on that day their Hearts are Merry, and their
Heels are Light, but after their Bridal Shoos are
off, their Dancing daies are done, I mean they
are done in respect of Happiness; for though
Married Wives keep more Company, and
Dance and Feast oftner than Maids, having more
Liberty, yet they are not so Merry at the Heart,
nor have they so Lively Countenances, nor are
so Galliard after they have been Married some
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44350:98"/>
time, as they were Before they were Married,
or as they were on their VVedding day, for
their Mirth is Forced, and their Actions more
Constrain'd, though not so much Restrain'd;
whereas Maids and Brides, their very Thoughts
as well as their Persons Dance, Sport, and Play
in their Minds: But this Young Virgin, and
Dead Bride, can neither Dance nor be Merry,
neither hath she Cause to Weep or be Sad, nor
she hath no Amorous Thoughts towards her
Bridegroom, she takes no Notice of him, his
kind Imbraces do not make her Blush, neither
doth she Hate or Fear him; she Grieves not for
the Change, nor Thinks she of her Living Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that should have been her Living Husband,
but is now her Living Mourner, whose Tears
like Raining Showers have all Bedewed her
Hearse; and though she was not led with Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids
to the Church, yet she is brought by
Virgins to the Grave, her Hearse is Crown'd,
though not her Head, and Covered with white
Satin, like as a Marriage Gown, and all her
Tomb is Strew'd with Flowers sweet, like to a

to be laid into the Bed of Earth, a Cold
Bed, but yet she will not take any Harm there,
nor we shall not fear she will Catch her Death,
for Death hath Catch'd her; the truth is, that
although all Women are Tender Creatures, yet
they Indure more than Men, and do oftner
Venture and Indanger their Lives than Men,
and their Lives are more Profitable than men's
Lives are, for they Increase Life, when Men
for the most part Destroy Life, as witness

Men Fighting and Killing each other,
and yet Men think all Women meer Cowards,
although they do not only Venture and Indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
their Lives more than they do, but indure
greater Pains with greater Patience than Men
usually do: Nay, Women do not only indure
the Extremity of Pain in Child-birth, but in
Breeding, the Child being for the most part Sick,
and seldome at Ease; Indeed, Nature seems
both Unjust and Cruel to her Femal Creatures,
especially Women, making them to indure all
the Pain and Sickness in Breeding and Bringing
forth of their Young Children, and the Males
to bear no part of their Pain or Danger; the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44350:99"/>
truth is, Nature hath made her Male Creatures,
especially Mankind, only for Pleasure, and her
Female Creatures for Misery; Men are made
for Liberty, and Women for Slavery, and not
only Slaves to Sickness, Pains, and Troubles, in
Breeding, Bearing, and Bringing up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but they are Slaves to Men's Humours,
nay, to their Vices and Wickednesses, so that
they are more Inslaved than any other Female

are most Happy that Never Marry, or Dye

Acquaintance, but not a Souldiers Friend,
though Souldiers be Death's Friends; he is no

Terrible Aspects of Death could not Affright nor
Terrifie this Souldier, nor cause him to Remove
an Inch back, for he would Venture to the very
Jaws of Death. Thus Bold, Adventurous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
do more Affright Death, than Death doth
Affright them, insomuch that Death for the

Seizes on Cowards, and daring not Assault Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant

them as it were Unawares, for he comes Behind
Valiant men, when he takes hold of them, or
else he Seizes on them by Treachery, or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
their Bodies so much by Sickness, as they

way for Death to take this Valiant Souldier but
by Sickness, for he could never take him in the
Field; But Death is of the Nature of Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men, who Indeavour to do those most. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
that have been most Bountifull to them,
and are Ready to take the Lives of those they

be; and for Hell, it is described, to be Dark as

the Damned shall be Tormented, the like for
other Torments, that Devils use as their Rods

the Devils do Curse, and the Blessed Sing and

Teacher, and seen Painted in Pictures, both the
Shapes of Devils and Angels, the Angels with
Wings, and the Devils with Horns and Cloven
feet, like Beasts; all which may be True, for any
thing we sensibly know to the Contrary, and yet
Perchance all these Relations may be False, as
the Relation of the Situation of Heaven and
Hell, and the Architecture of either, or the
Shapes of Devils or Angels, or the manner and
wayes of their Pleasures and Delights, and
their Pains and Torments; all which may not
be so, as they are Usually Described to us, but
made by men's Fancies, for no Mortal man is
come either from Heaven or Hell, to tell us
Punctually of every particular Truth. Yet a
Heaven and Hell, Good and Bad Angels, Pains
and Torments, Joys and Pleasures there are, for
both Reason and Faith informs us, also God
himself tells us in his Holy Writs, and by his
Inspired Priests and Prophets, that there is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for the Good in Heaven, and Punishment
for the Bad in Hell; but if we will give our
Imaginations leave to Work upon that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Clogg'd with a Terrestrial Grossness, which
made their Senses Weak, and their Appetites
Dull; these Glorified Bodies shall have their
Senses Fill'd, and their Appetites Satisfied in a
Spiritual manner, as thus: The Sight shall have
the most Beautifull, Splendorous, Pleasant, and
Glorious Objects, not that those Objects are
Corporally Without them, but only in their
Sight; and such Varieties of such Sights, as
they shall see each Sight Fully to Admire them,
but not to Tire them, and being Satisfied, they
shall have New, and with every New Sight a
New Admiration, and after every Admiration a
New Sight: The like for the Sense of Hearing,
which shall be Fill'd sometimes with Eloquent
Language, Witty Expressions, and Fancy, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest

Discourses, Wise Sentences, Oratory

Vocal Sounds, with such Variety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
as Art nor Nature never knew; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall Come from Without to the Ear, or
be Conveyed into it, but be Within it: And as
for the Sense of Sent, such Sweet Perfumes, and
Ravishing Sweets shall it Smell, as every Sent

nothing of these Various Sweets, or Sweet
Perfumes, shall enter from Without into the
Nostrils, but be Within them: And as for Taste,
Delitiously and with <hi>Gusto</hi> shall it Feed and
Satisfie the Stomack, not with Food, but Taste,
for Taste shall be the Food, and every Appetite
shall bring a New Taste, and every Taste a New
Appetite, and every Appetite shall be Satisfied,
yet in the Mouth shall not any Meat be: The
like for Touch, which is a kind of Taste, there
shall be a Feeling Pleasure, where every Touch
shall be a New Pleasure, and every Pleasure
shall bring a New Touch, there shall Touch
feel a Comfortable Heat from a Freezing Cold,
and a Refreshing Cold, upon great Sultry Heats,
and yet no Fire nor Frost shall Touch their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
there shall it feel a Scratching Pleasure,
to take off Itching Pain, yet nothing Hurt the
Body; there shall it feel a Soft and Downy
Touch, as from a Hard Rough Pain, yet nothing
Press the Body, and all the Body shall feel such
Ease, as if it came from Hard Labour, and such
Rest, as from a Tedious Travelling, and Infinite
of other Pleasurable and Delightfull Touches,
as are not to be Exprest. Thus every Sense shall
be Satisfied in a Spiritual way, without a Gross
Corporeal Substance, and the Blessed Souls of
these Glorified Bodies, and Spiritual Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Glorified Senses and Appetites, shall be
fill'd with all Perfection, as a Clear Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
a Perfect Knowledge, a Pure Wit, a
Sound Judgment, and a Free Will, and all the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44350:102"/>
Passions Regulated and Govern'd, as they ought
to be, into Love and Hate, as Hate to the
Wicked and Damned, and Love to the Bless'd
and Glorified; and such Delights shall they have
not only in the Pleasures of their Glorified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but in Themselves, such as God himself
Injoys; thus shall Souls and Bodies be Bless'd
and Glorified in Heaven. And after the same
manner and way, as Blessed Souls and Bodies
have Delight and Pleasure, and Fulness of Joy in
Heaven, so shall the Souls and Bodies of the
Damned have Terrour and Torments, and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Horrour in Hell; for as the Senses and
Appetitces have Variety and Satisfation of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in Heaven, so shall the Senses and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
have Variety of Terrour, Dread, and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and be Surfeited with Aversion, Loathing
and Reluctancy, and fill'd with Misery and
Evil: As for the Sense of Touch in Damned
Bodies, it is not probable they are Burnt with
Elemental Fire, as many Think, but their Sense
of Touch hath such a Burning Feeling, as is so
far beyond the Elemental Burning, as that Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is a Pleasure to it, and such Excessive Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Pains, it is probable they have, as Art
could never Invent, nor Nature make, nor Sense
Feel in this World, nor Thought of man Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine:
And for the Sense of Sent, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
there is the Smell of Brimstone and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
for that may be indured without a great
Dislike, but it is Probable and to be Believed,
that their Sense of Sent smells Varieties of

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44350:103"/>
filthy Stinks, yet not from Without them, as of
the Devils making, but Within themselves:
And as for their Sense of Hearing, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the Devils do Vocally Roar or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally
Curse, but that the Damned have in the
Sense of Hearing, Infinite, Confused, Fearfull,
and Dreadfull Noises, Reproaching, Exclaming,
and Cursing Words and Speeches: And as for
the Sense of Sight, it is not so much the Devils
Ugly and Monstrous Shapes, which they see,
but their Sense of Sight is fill'd with Infinite
Varieties of Ugly, Deformed, Monstrous, and
Terrible Sights. Thus it is probable the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
are Tormented. Also 'tis probable, that
both the Damned and Blessed are Fixt to their
Places; for the Blessed having Fulness of Joy and
a Fruition of Desire, have no Occasion or Desire
to VVander from Place to Place, for it is Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Desire, and Unsatisfied Appetite, that
Moves and Removes, seeking for that they
would Have, and cannot Get, or for Something,
they know not VVhat, for which the Damned
may desire to Remove; but as the Bless'd Saints
are Fixt with a Fulness of Joy and Admiration,
not caring to Remove therefrom, so the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
are so Strucken with Fear and Terrour, as
they Dare not Remove, if they Could; and as the
Satisfaction, Variety, Pleasure, Delight and Joy
of the Blessed, begins and continueth without
End, so the Variety of Aversion, Terrour, and
Torments, begins and continues for Ever; But
the most Probable Opinion is, that the Fulness
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44350:103"/>
of Joy is the Love of God, and the Fulness of
Pleasure the Glory of God, and the Horrour
and Torments of the Damned is the Want of
that Love and Glory.</p>

without Ground or Foundation, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sense and Reason; for what Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath Man to Imagine or Believe, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is Celestial, should be Composed of
Terrestrial Materials, as of Pure Gold, Crystal,
and Pretious Stones, and not rather Believe it to
be only the Beatifical Vision of God? and what
Sense and Reason hath man to Believe that Hell
is Hell, for Want of the Presence of God,
whereas the Omnipotent God must Necessarily
be all Fulfilling? and is it not a strange Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
Opinion or Belief, that Hell is Dark, and
yet that in Hell is Elemental Fire and Terrestrial
Brimstone? and what Sense and Reason hath
Man to believe, that Celestial Bodies have Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Shapes, whereas we may easily Perceive,
that all outward Shapes, Forms or Figures, are
according to the Degrees of the Purity or Gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Substance or Matter they are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of? Wherefore, Man hath not any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44350:104"/>
to Believe, that Angels, which are Celestial
Substances, can have Terrestrial Shapes; and
what Reason hath Man to Believe, that Angels
in Heaven have the Shapes of Men on Earth; but
if they should believe they have Terrestrial
Shapes, why should they believe them to have
Mens Shapes, and not the Shapes of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
it might be Answered, the Belief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Son of God, who did Take
upon Him the Shape of Man, but then we may
believe, that Angels are of the Shape of Doves,
because the Holy Ghost, which is Co-equal
and Co-eternal with the Son, did Take upon
Him the Shape of that Bird. Also what Reason
hath man to Believe, that the Devils Shapes are
partly of the Shape of Beasts, as to have Tails,
Horns, Claws, and Cloven feet? do they believe
that the Shape of Beasts is a more VVicked or
Cursed Shape than any other Animal Shape?
But these Opinions or Beliefs proceed from
Gross Conceptions, made by Irregular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in Gross Terrestrial Bodies, or Brains in
Mankind, who make Hell and Heaven, God,
Angels and Devils, according to their Fancies,
and not according to Truth, for Man cannot
Know what is not in his Portion of Reason and
Sense to Know, and yet man will Judge and
Believe that, which he cannot possibly Know,
which is Ridiculous even to Human Sense and
Reason. But to Conclude, <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi>
men's Thoughts are too Weak, their Brains too
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44350:104"/>
Little, their Knowledge too Obscure, and their
Understandings too Cloudy to Conceive Gods
Celestial Works or Workings, or his Will or
Decrees, Fates or Destinies; Wherefore, Pray
without Forming, Obey without Censuring,
Fear his Power, Love his Goodness, and Hope
in his Mercy, and the Blessing of God be amongst
you.</p>

               <p>YOu come here to be Instructed, but yet you
do not Amend your Lives, for you Live
Idlely and Wickedly, you make no Profit of
your Instructions or Exhortations, for it seems
by you, that the more you are Taught, the more
Ignorant you are, like those that become Blind,
or their Sight Dazled with Too much Light;
Indeed you Live as if you had not Rational
Souls, or that you thought Souls Die as Bodies
do, but you will find you have Souls that shall
Live to indure Torment, if you do not Reform
your Lives: 'Tis true, many have Strange, and
some, Atheistical Opinions concerning the Soul,
for Some have had Opinions, that Man hath no
other Soul, but such as Beasts have, and Others,
that the Souls of all Creatures Go out of one Body
into an other, and that Death doth but Change
the Souls Lodging; and Some have had an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that there is no such thing as a Soul, but
that which is called a Soul, is only Animal Life;
and Others believe there be Souls, but they Die
as Bodies do; Others, that there is but One great
Soul, which is the Soul of the World; but
the Right and Truth is, that men have Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Souls, which not any other Creature hath,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44350:106"/>
which are called Rational Souls, and shall Live
for Ever, either in Torment or Bliss, according
to their Merit; But the Best and Wisest men
make no question of the Rational Soul of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
though many Learned men Trouble their
Heads to prove What the Soul is, for some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Soul is Corporeal, others it is Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal.
Also many Trouble themselves to
know, When the Souls of Mankind Enter into
their Bodies, some think Before the Body is
Born; others hold, it enters not Untill the Body
is Born; and some think, that the Body receives
the Soul so soon as it receives Life in the
Womb; and some think Before, as when it is
newly Conceived: but those that are of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that Life and Soul enters into the Body
together, believe their Departs together by
Death; and those that think the Soul enters not
into the Body untill it be Born, believe the Soul
is but a Weakling at first, and grows Stronger as
the Body grows Older. Thus they Trouble
their Heads, and Exercise their Wits concerning
the Soul, to know What it is, and How it is, but
never take Thought as how it Will be when
they Dye, like the Dog that left the Substance to
seek for the Shaddow, so men leave the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and Dispute about the Creation: But my
Exhortation is, that you would Pray more, and
Dispute less; for what shall we need to Trouble
our Minds, whether the Soul be Corporeal or
Incorporeal? or if Corporeal, of what Matter it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44350:106"/>
is made of, so that it be Capable of Glory? nor
shall we need to Trouble our Minds, When it
Enters the Body, so it Enters Heaven. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those that are Truly Wise, and Wisely
Devout, will Indeavour with all their Power,
Faith, and Industry of their Minds, Thoughts,
and Life, to Do such Charitable Deeds, and to
Think such Pious Thoughts in Holy Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations,
and Pray with so much Zeal and Faith,
Penitence and Thanksgiving, as God may be
so well Pleased with them, as to Glorifie their
Souls in Heaven; where there is all Joy and
Happiness, which Joy and Happiness I Pray the
Gods may give you.</p>

many do not only Loosen those Bonds with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Prudently, Lovingly, and Peaceably, that they
may not Surseit their Fond and Eager Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
which Causes the Sickness of Aversion,

for that makes Jealousie, and Jealousie Hate; nor
Live Quarrelsome, for that makes Faction,
Faction Division, and Division Divorce; whereas
Temperance makes Constancy, Prudence Plenty,

to Approve it, and if they should not Agree,
None will Suffer but Themselves, either in the
Opinion of their Neighbours and Friends, or in
their Own Discontents; for their Neighbours
will Censure Both, as if She was too Amorous

and that Time will Cool the One, and Riot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

               <p>I Observe great Excess in Stately and

Costly Furnishings, Vain Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Wastefull Feasting, Idle Enter
taining, and Unprofitable Attendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the like Vanities. First for your Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you Build not only for Conveniency and
Decency, but for State and Magnificence, and
you Build not only Large and High, as if you
would Spread to the Circumference of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44350:110"/>
Earth, and Ascend to the Mansions of the Gods,
but you Indeavour to Work beyond Nature for
Curiosities in Cutting, Carving, Ingraving, and
Painting to the Life; also you Dig to the Abyfs,
as to the Centre of the Earth, for several Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
as Diverse sorts of Stones and Metalls,
and Indeavour to make your Palaces to Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
the Sun with Gold, wherein you waste so
much Gold and Silver, in Vain and Improfitable
Gilding and Interlaying, that there is not
Enough left to make Coyn for Traffick; also
your Stately Building doth not only Ruine your
Posterity, leaving them more Houses than
Land, but you Ruine the Poor, inclosing the
Land with your VValls, and filling up Lands
with Houses, whereas Corn and Fruits should
Grow; thus you Tread upon the Bellies,
Backs, and Heads of the Poor. And as for your
Rich and Costly Furniture, it Cost much and
VVears out soon, yielding no Profit, for the
Principal of so much Money is VVasted, and no
Use made thereof. Secondly, for your Feasting,
wherewith you Eat rather to be Sick, than to
Prolong Life, you Spoil more than you Eat, and
Eat more than you have Appetite; you are like
Misers in your Feeding, stuffing your Stomacks
with Meat, as they do their Trunks and Baggs
with Money, and the Superfluity of meat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
the Gluttonous Eater with Surfeits.
Thirdly, your Adorning or rather Deforming
your selves in Antick Fashions, and Toyish Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
which sheweth your Heads to be Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44350:111"/>
and sometimes your Purses to be Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
for Spending so much on your Backs, you
cannot Keep any thing in your Coffers, nor for
your Necessary use. Fourthly, your Idle Visits
and Unprofitable Discourses, wherein is more
Words than Wit, and more Time lost than
Knowledge gain'd, for you become more Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
with Talking, than Learned with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating,
for Brains are not Manured with
Foolish Discourses, but Wise Considerations.
Lastly, your Numerous Trains, which are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Servants, being maintain'd for Shew,
and not for Use, they Spending much, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little Service, is the Cause not only of great
Disorders, but the Ruine of many Noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
The Short is, you Drink to be Drunk,
Eat to be Sick, Live to be Idle, Spend to be
Poor, and Talk to be Fools: Thus you Lose
Time, Waste your Estate, Trouble your Minds,
and Shorten your Lives, Living with more
Cost than Worship, and more Worship than
Pleasure; for you are Stewards for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
Hosts for your Guests, and Slaves to your
Vain Humours.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44350:111"/>
Orator either to be so Poor of Means, as he Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Attain to such Delights and Pleasures; or
that his Senses are Imperfect, as not Capable
to Receive them, or that he is of so Evil a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as to Desire all men to be Miserable, or
that he is a Fool, as not Knowing how to Speak
or Live wisely, whereas had he Spoken against
Hurtfull and Destroying Vices, he had Spoken
as a Good man ought to do, for Vices are Vices,
no otherwise but that they are Hurtfull or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to Mankind, which makes them Vices,
for the Gods Forbid them, because of the Evil
Effects; as Drunkenness, which Disorders the
Reason, Distempers the Brain, and Obstructs
the Senses, making men Senseless, or to be as
Mad, and causes oftentimes Quarrels, Wounds,
and Death, at least Breaks Peace, and makes Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Friends; besides, Drunkenness makes
men Sick, and is apt to Shorten their Lives, all
which makes it a Vice, and so a Sin; But did
Drunkenness cause no Evil Effect, it ought not
to be Forbidden, nor could it be accounted a
Crime. The like I may say for Gluttony, for
would men Eat only to Please them, and not so
much as to Disease them, it would be no Fault
to Eat well; or to Please their Palate, but it is
the Surfeits; Sickness, and oftentimes Untimely
Death, that makes Gluttony a Vice; and for
Adultery, it would be so far from a Crime, as
it would be a Virtue in the Increase of Mankind,
were it not for the Loss of Propriety, in that no
man would Know his Own Child, nor be sure
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44350:112"/>
to Injoy his Own Wife, or that Woman he
makes Choice of. As for Theft and Murder,
they are not of that Sort to be named Vices
only, but Damnable Sins, wherein can neither
be Society, Safety, nor Security of Life, for
Thieves and Murderers indeavour an Utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
without Mercy or Remorse; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since Vices and Sins are Vices and Sins,
for their Hurt and Evil Effects, those things
that are call'd Vanities, which produce Pleasure
and Delight without Death and Destruction,
ought not to be Spoken against; for Vanities
are Profitable to the Poor, and not Hurtfull to
the Rich; But yet Moralists and Divines Plead,
Preach, and Write, Rail and Exclame against all
Honest, Harmless Delights and Pleasures, as if
they were Sins to God and Nature, as if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and the God of Nature should make Senses
and Appetites in Vain, or only to the Hurt and
Dislike of the Creature, and not for their Good
and Pleasure, as to make a Body for Pain and
Sickness, and not for Health and Ease, and to
make a Mind for Trouble and Discontent, and
not for Peace and Tranqullity, to make Desires,
but not Fruitions: Indeed Nature and the God
of Nature is more Just to Mankind; for as they
have made Eyes and Seeing, so they have made
Light, Splendour, and Beauty to be Seen; and
as they have made Ears to Hear, so they have
made Harmony to be Heard; and as they have
made Nostrils to Smell, so they have made Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
to be Smelt; and as they have made
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44350:112"/>
Taste, so they have made Relishes; and as they
have made Hunger, so they have made Food;
and as they have made Appetites, so they have
given Satisfaction or Satiety. Thus we may
perceive, that every Particular Sense is Fitted
or Matched to Particular Pleasures; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Nature hath made some Aversion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Moralists and Divines would not have men
Injoy the Pleasure in Nature, whereas the
most Rational men perceive, that Aversions
were only made to Highten and Re-double the
Pleasures and Delights both of Body and Mind;
but these Men are so Rigid in their Doctrine,
(I will not say, in their own particular Practice)
as they would have men Choose the Worst part,
and Refuse the Better, and would have all
Mankind Struggle, Strive, and Oppose all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Delights and Benefits; the truth is, they
seem to Desire a Perpetual Warr between the
Senses and the Objects, as also between the
Mind and the Body, as between the Reason and
Sense; but in my opinion, their Doctrine hath
neither Sense nor Reason, and their Authors
would have as Little, if they should Practise
what they Preach. Wherefore, <hi>Noble Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi>
my Advise is, that you Take your Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
yet so, as you may Injoy them Long, as
to Warm your Selves, not to Burn your Selves,
to View the Light, but not to Gaze out your
Sight, to Bathe your Selves, but not to Drown
your Selves, to Please your Selves, but not to
Destroy your Selves with Excess.</p>

               <p>VVE have some Citizens amongst us, that
are Rich, and yet Miserable, they Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
Much, yet Injoy but Little, for they Hord
up their Wealth, and Starve Themselves; and
if they did Starve None but Themselves, it
were no great matter, being fitter for Death
than Life, but their Hords impoverish the
Common-wealth, and so Starve the Poor; for
there cannot be a Greater Evil in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
set a-side Warr, than to have many Rich
Usurers, as Covetous Getters, and Spare Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
for their Great Wealth is like as a Great
Dunghill, which, whilst it lies on a Heap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doth no Good, but Hurt, whereas if it
were Dispersed and Spread upon the Barren
Lands, it would Inrich much Ground, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Increase and Plenty. The like should
Money or such sort of Riches be Spread equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to make a Common-wealth Live Happily;
Indeed, a Prodigal is more Beneficial, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to a Common-wealth than a Usurer, for
a Prodigal makes only Himself Poor, and the
Common-wealth Rich, whereas a Miserable
man makes only Himself Rich, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
Poor. 'Tis true, Riches is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a great Blessing, and Surely it is so, but I take
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44350:113"/>
Riches to be only a Blessing in the Use, and not
Barely in the Possession, for Riches is not what
we Have, but what we Injoy; for he that hath
Delicious Fruits, and will Eat Sour Crabs; hath
Reviving Wines, and will Drink Insipid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
hath Stately Houses, and will Live in a
Thatch'd Cottage; hath Store of Fuel, and
will Freeze with Cold; and hath great Summs
of Money, but will Spend none, those are
Poorer than they that Have but a Little, and
will Spend according to their Estate; yet these
Miserable men that Live Starvingly, Slovenly,
and Unwholesomely, are Commended by the
Moralists, and Accounted Wise men, as not
taking Pleasure in that they call Vanities, which
is to make Use of their Riches, as to Live Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully;
Pleasantly, Gloriously, and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
if they have wherewithall to Live so,
pleasing Themselves with what Good Fortune
hath given them. I for my part, I had rather
Live Rich, and Dye Poor, than Dye Rich, and
Live Poor, and leave my Wealth to those, that
will be so far from Acknowledging my Gifts
with Thanks, by Praising me for them, as it is
likely they would Rail on my Memory, so that
my Wealth would only Build me a Tomb of
Reproaches, and a Monument of Infamy, which
would be a Just Judgement for being so Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to my Self. But Miserable men believe,
they are Masters to their Wealth, because they
have it in Keeping, when as they are Slaves,
not Daring to Use it, unless it be in getting Ten
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44350:114"/>
in the Hundred: I Confess, if such men had
Children, being for the most part Childless,
there were some Excuse for them, but yet Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
should not make Themselves Miserable,
to make their Sons Prodigal, for a Rich Son of a
Miserable Father is commonly a Spend-thrist;
and as Fathers are bound by Nature to Provide
for their Children in a Wise Proportion, so they
are bound by Nature to Maintain Themselves
so Plentifully, as to Injoy a Happy Life. But to
Conclude, those that are Miserable Horders, or
Uncnscionable Usurers, are like as Weesels, or
such like Vermin; for as these Suck out the
Meat of an Egg, so they Suck out Silver and
Gold, and leave the Common-wealth like as an
Empty Egg-shell, which is a Penny-less Purse
or Treasury.</p>

               <p>I Commend your Love and Care, which you
seem to have of your Sons, as to have them
Taught and Instructed in Arts and Sciences, as
also when they are Grown up towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to send them abroad to see Forein and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Nations, for to be acquainted with their
Fashions, Manners, and Behaviours, and to
Learn their several Languages, all which is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and will make them Worthy men if
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44350:114"/>
they Profit; Yet though I Commend your
Love, I cannot Commend your Judgements,
for putting your Sons to be Instructed by Young
Pedants, and to be Guided by Young Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
which are but Boys themselves in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of Experienced, Understanding, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Wise men, that is Aged men, who have
Seen, Heard, and Learned Much, and so Know
Much, whereas Young men have not had Time
to Hear, See, and Learn Much, and so cannot
Understand, nor Know Much, but must of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be Ignorant. Wherefore, it is not to be
Wondered at, that Fathers Reap not the Profit,
or have not the Return of their Care and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
in their Sons Educations; for Youth
breeding up Youth, makes many Men to be Boys
all their Life-time, and being not Instructed as
they ought, become Wild, like Plants that want
Manuring, and Fathers mistaking the Cause
through long Custom, think it is the Incapacity
of their Sons, and not the Insufficiency of their
Tutors and Governours, if they prove not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Hopes and Expectations; But
most Fathers being Bred as Ignorantly as their
Sons, think their Sons Compleatly bred, if
they have been some time at the University, and
have made some short time of Travel, although
without Profiting either in Knowledge or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Thus it may be Thought, that one Fool
Begets an other; but the truth is, that one Fool
Breeds an other, for the Fault is not in Nature,
but in Education, at least not so Generally and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44350:115"/>
Constantly, for Nature doth not Commit so
many Errors, and make so many Defects, as
Breeding doth.</p>

Infested or Infected with this Disease, in so
much as sometimes it hath almost made a Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation;
but by Reason it is such a Deadly

Oblivious Death, and not only a Destroying
but a Murderous Disease, for it takes men Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
Unawares, and Unprepared, being in

so deadly, as to be Past Remedy, not to be Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

hinder it from such a strong Affault and Ruine,
let me Advise you, <hi>Citizens,</hi> especially the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
who have Power and Authority to
Order and Govern this City, as they shall think
Good and Expedient for it; First, to set out a
Declaration to all Housholders, upon Paying
Fine, if Neglected and not Performed, to
Cleanse their Houses, Pumps, Springs, Sinks,
Gutters, and Privy-Offices; also that Officers
in every Parish, and other Particular Person,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44350:115"/>
may be Authorized for that Imployment, to see
the Streets, Lanes, and Out-corners in and of
the City Cleansed from Dunghils, and Dung
of Men and Beast, and from Carrion, Mud, and
such like filth; also to have the Common
Sewers, Sinks, Chanels, Wells, as also the
Lakes, Ponds, and such like Places without the
City near adjoyning, well Cleansed, and all
this foul Filth Buried deep in the Earth, that no
Ill Savour or Vapour may Ascend therefrom;
for Foul, Gross, Stinking Vapours arising, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
from several places, as several Houses,
Streets, Ditches, Sewers, and the like, disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Corruption about, Infect the Air, which
Spreads far, and Enters into the very Bowels
and Inward Parts of men, nay, it doth not only
Poyson the Bodies of men, but all other Animal
Creatures, as also the Fruits of the Earth; and
so Strong it is, that it Bursts forth in Sores, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and Spots on the Bodies of Men and Beasts,
Inflaming their Spirits, and Consuming their
Lives in a Moment; Wherefore, to help to
Purifie the Air, let there be Pitch and Tar burnt
in the Open Streets, and Frankincense, Storax,
and Benzoin in the Houses, or at least Juniper;
and after the City is thus Cleansed, and the Air
Purified, you must indeavour to Cleanse and
Purifie the Bodies of the Inhabitants, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Every one to be Purged with Drugs or
Simples, and to be let Blood, or else it will be a
Vain Work, as to Cleanse their Houses from
Filth, and let their Bodies be full of Foul Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44350:116"/>
to Cleanse their Sinks and Gutters, and
let their Veins be full of Corrupted or Inflamed
Blood; Yet must the Bodies of men not be
Cleansed, until the City be Cleansed, lest the
Infected Air from Without should more easily
Get Into them and Kill them. But I hope, I
shall not need much Rhetorick to perswade you,
to take a Care of your Own Lives, for Life is
Sweet, and Death is Terrible; although I have
Observed, that Men, though they Desire to
Live, nay, are Afraid to Dye, yet are so Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
Obstinate, and Confident, as not to Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Prolong their Lives, or to Defend their
Lives from Diseases, which are Death's Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;
for although all Creatures were made to
Consume into other Forms, and Men are Born
to Dye, yet no Creature was made to Dye and
be Consumed, or Transmigrated before their
Natural time, for Nature hath given her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Defences and Remedies against the Spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Destroyers of Life, which Spoilers and
Destroyers, as also their Remedies and Defences
are not easily to be Numbred; but Men are
often their own Lives Enemies, Killing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Riot and Excess, or being Over-bold
in Adventuring or Entring into Dangers, or so
Careless as to pass by Remedies: Yet I hope
you will be Carefull, and Speedily Industrious

Health is the Greatest Pleasure, for Sensual

Physick, Purging out Vain Opinions, Idle

Nature being Just in all her VVorks, hath Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them so, as what is Curious, Excellent,

more Fools than Wise men, more Cowards than
Valiant men, more Bad men than Good men,
more Enemies than Friends, and so more Pains

Shall we refuse the Best, because we have not so

               <p>ALthough I am sure to be Hated of all the
Women in this City, and Perchance else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
yet by Reason I think it fit to Reprove
their Liberties, Vanities, and Expences, I shall
not be Silent, although I were sure to be Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
with their Railing Tongues, and to be
Exclamed in all their Femal Societies', which
Societies ought to be Dissolved, allowing no
Publick Meetings to that Sex, no not Child-bed
Gossipings, for VVomen Corrupt and Spoil
each other, Striving to Out-brave, Out-beauty,
and Out-talk each other, with their Vanities,
Paintings, and Gossipings; wherefore it were
fit, that VVomen should be Restrain'd not only
from the Company of Men, but their own Sex,
unless it be those they have neer Relations to,
and not to Suffer them to make Acquaintance
with Strangers; this would Cause Moderation,
Sobriety, and Silence amongst them; also it
would Cause them to be Huswifely in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
Obedient to their Husbands, and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of their Children, but Liberty is an Enemy
to VVomen, nay it is an Enemy to Men, not
only to Fathers, Husbands, and Sons, but even
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44350:119"/>
to Wanton Lovers, or rather Courtiers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them as Vain and Expensive as Women,
to Gain their Mistresses Favours, Knowing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
especially Amorous VVomen, are soonest
won with Gayes, Toyes, and Shews; but
VVomen are so far from being Restrain'd in
this Age, and in these Nations round about, that
they have Liberty to Spend what they will, to
Keep what Company they will, and to Use their
Husbands and Natural Friends as they please;
the truth is, Liberty makes all VVomen Wild
and Wanton, both Maids, Wives, and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
which Defames Themselves and their
Families. Thus in short, Women are the chief
Ruiners of Men in their Estates, Fortunes, and
Honours, and so I leave them.</p>

               <p>IT is not only Uncivil and Ignoble, but Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
for Men to Speak against VVomen and
their Liberties, for VVomen were made by
Nature for Men, to be Loved, Accompanied,
Assisted, and Protected; and if Men are Bound
to Love them by Nature, should they Restrain
them by Force? should they make them Slaves,
which Nature made to be their Dearest Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates,
their Beautiful'st Objects, and Sweetest
Delights? and shall Man Restrain them of their
Harmless Pleasures, Chast Societies, and Gentle

Conversations? And as it is Natural for Men to
Love Women, so it is Natural for Love to
Please what they Love, and not to Cross, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or Restrain them, but to Grant them all
their Lawfull Requests and Desires, as far as lies
in their Powers; for can Men Dispose of their
Estates more Generously than to VVomen? or
think any Fortune Better, than when they can
Serve them? or is there a greater Happiness
than to be Beloved of them? whereas they are
the Chiefest Good, that Nature hath made for
Men, and the greatest Delight, She hath given
to Men; for can there be any Sound Sweeter
than their Voices? any Object Brighter than
their Beauties, or any Society more Divine than
theirs? Yet these Celestial Creatures, a Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial

will be very Preposterous and Unnatural; In

neither to be Perfect Women nor Perfect Men,
but Corrupt and Imperfect Creatures; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let me Perswade you, since we cannot Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Nature of our Persons, not to Alter the
Course of our Lives, but to Rule our Lives
and Behaviours, as to be Acceptable and Pleasing
to God and Men, which is to be Modest, Chast,
Temperate, Humble, Patient, and Pious; also

us, that it would not only be a Reproach
and Disgrace, but Unnatural for Women in their
Actions and Behaviour to Imitate Men; we may
as well say, it will be a Reproach, Disgrace, and
Unnatural to Imitate the Gods, which Imitation
we are Commanded both by the Gods and
their Ministers, and shall we Neglect the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Men, which is more Easie and Natural
than the Imitation of the Gods? for how can
Terrestrial Creatures Imitate Celestial Deities?
yet one Terrestrial may Imitate an other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in different sorts of Creatures; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since all Terrestrial Imitations ought to
Ascend to the Better, and not to Descend to the
Worse, Women ought to Imitate Men, as
being a Degree in Nature more Perfect, than
they Themselves, and all Masculine Women
ought to be as much Praised as Effeminate Men
to be Dispraifed, for the one Advances to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the other Sinks to Imperfection, that

               <p>NOble Ladies, Honourable Gentlewomen,
and Worthy Femal Commoners, The
former Oratoress's Oration or Speech was to
Perswade us Out of our Selves, as to be That,
which Nature never Intended us to be, to wit
Masculine; but why should we Desire to be
Masculine, since our Own Sex and Condition is
far the Better? for if Men have more Courage,
they have more Danger; and if Men have more
Strength, they have more Labour than VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have; if Men are more Eloquent in
Speech, VVomen are more Harmonious in
Voice; if Men be more Active, Women are
more Gracefull; if Men have more Liberty,
Women have more Safety; for wenever Fight
Duels, nor Battels, nor do we go Long Travels
or Dangerous Voyages; we Labour not in
Building, nor Digging in Mines, Quarries, or
Pits, for Metall, Stone, or Coals; neither do
we Waste or Shorten our Lives with University
or Scholastical Studies, Questions, and Disputes;
we Burn not our Faces with Smiths Forges, or
Chymist Furnaces, and Hundreds of other
Actions, which Men are Imployed in; for they
would not only Fade the Fresh Beauty, Spoil
the Lovely Features, and Decay the Youth of
Women, causing them to appear Old, whilst
they are Young, but would Break their Small
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44350:124"/>
Limbs, and Destroy their Tender Lives.
Wherefore, Women have no Reason to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
against Nature, or the God of Nature, for
though the Gifts are not the Same they have
given to Men, yet those Gifts they have given
to Women, are much Better; for we Women
are much more Favour'd by Nature than Men,
in Giving us such Beauties, Features, Shapes,
Gracefull Derncanour, and such Infinuating and
Inticing Attractives, as Men are Forc'd to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
us, Love us, and be Desirous of us, in so
much as rather than not Have and Injoy us,
they will Deliver to our Disposals, their Power,
Persons, and Lives, Inslaving Themselves to
our Will and Pleasures; also we are their Saints,
whom they Adore and Worship, and what can
we Desire more, than to be Men's Tyrants,
Destinies, and Goddesses?</p>

I have Observed, that a Gentleman, although
of Small Fortune, if he Live Wisely, may Live
Plentifully, and Honourably, without his own
Personal Drudgery; the Wisdome is, to Look
into his Own Estate Industriously, to Know and
Understand the Value of his Lands Justly, to
Indeavour to have his Rents Paid Duely, and
not Suffer his Servants to Coosen him either

such Delights and Pleasures, as the Country is
not Capable to have, as Masks, Playes, Balls,

Transport their Thoughts beyond the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

               <p>VVE agreed to meet in this Town for
Pastime and Mirth, and not for Study
and Disputation; we came not hither to Learn
Good Husbandry, but to Spend our Money
Freely; our Intention was not to meet with
Formality and Gravity, but with Freedome and
Jollity; our Design was not to Return to our
Dwelling houses with Heavy Hearts, but Light
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44350:127"/>
Heads; Wherefore, Leave of Arguing, and
Settle to Drinking, and let our Tongues Cease,
and the Musick Play, and when we are Dead
Drunk, let the Fiddles Ring out our Knells, and
let our Coaches as our Hearses carry us to our
Home-Beds, as to our Designed Graves, where
after our Long Sleeps we may Rise, and in our
Resurrections be like either Saints or Devils;
In short, let Good Wine and Good Brains be
our Good Fortune.</p>

Wine are as great Enemies, as Poetry and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Wherefore, let the Orators Drink Water,
and Poets Wine, for VVine begets Fancy, and
VVater Drowns Reason, which is the cause
Orators Speak so Much and Long untill they
Speak Non-sense: But O Divine Wine, whose
Sprightly Vapour doth Manure the Brain to a
just Highth of VVit, it is the Serene Air of
VVit, the Quint-essence of VVit, the Sun and
Light of VVit, the Spirit and Soul of VVit;
for were it not for Wine, the Mind would be as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44350:128"/>
in a dark Hell of Ignorance, and the Brain would
be Lethargically Stupified for want of Lively
Heat; for Wine is the Food of Vital Life and

               <p>FOr we are all Fellows in Labour,
Profit, and Pleasure, though not Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in Arms, Spoils, and Danger,
and though we Live in the Fields
of Peace, and not in the Fields of
Warr, yet our Fields of Peace resemble the
Fields of Warr, for we are an Army of Clowns,
though not of Souldiers, and our Commanders
are our Landlords, who often Deceive us of the
Increase of our Labours, as the Warring Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
Deceive their Common Souldiers of
the Profit of their Spoils; also we have our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantery,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44350:129"/>
and our Cavallry, for all those that
belong to the Keeping and Breeding of Beast, as
Shepherds, Grasiers, Herdmen, Goat-herds,
Swine-herds, and Carters, are of the Cavallry,
but all they that belong to the Earth, as Sowers,
Planters, Reapers, Threshers, Hedgers, Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Diggers, Delvers, are our Infantery; also
we have Arms and Ammunition, for we are
Arm'd with our Beast Skins, and our Arms of
use are Pikes, Forks, Cutting Sickles, Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sithes, Pruning Knives, Thrashing Flails,
Plough-sherds, Shepherds Hooks, Herd-mens
Staves, and the like, and our Match, Powder,
and Bullets, are Puddings, Pease, and Porradge,
and our Granadoes are Eggs of all Sorts and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
our Carts are our Waggons, our Cottages
our Tents, and our Victuals and Country Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
our Bagg and Baggage, and the Lowing
of our Herds, and Bleating of our Sheep, are
our Drums and Trumpets, not to Alarm us to
Fight, but to Feed; also we have Enemies,
which are Unseasonable Seasons, Rotting Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
Drowning Showres and Over-flows,
Chilling Frost, Scorching Heat, and Devouring
Worms, all which we Fight against, not with
Force, but with Industry. And our Army of
Clowns is more Skilfull to Destroy our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
than an Army of Souldiers is to Destroy
their Enemies, nay, our Army is an Army
wherein is Peace and Plenty, whereas in their
Army is Warr and Want: we become Rich
with Safety, they become Poor with Danger,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44350:129"/>
we be Gentle to Beast, they be Cruel to Men,
they Thrive by Blood, we by Milk, we get
Health by our Labours, and Long Life by our
Temperance, and they get Diseases in their
Riots, and Death in their Warrs: Thus they
Live Painfully, Die Violently, and only Leave
their Bare Name to their Posterity and Beggarly
Race, we Live Healthfully, Die Peaceably, and
Leave our Goods to our Posterity, who by their

               </opener>
               <p>I Must tell you, we Live in a Happy Age,
where Peace Sows, and Plenty Reaps, for
whereas VVarrs Destroy our Increase, now
Peace Increases our Stores; also I would have
you Know, that our Profession which is Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
is one of the Noblest and Generousest
Professions, which is, to Imploy our Selves like
as the Gods and Nature; for though we cannot
Create Creatures, as Nature doth, yet we by our
Industry Increase Nature's Creatures, not only
Vegetables, that we Produce in our Fields, and
Store in our Barns, but Animals, which we
Breed in our Farms, and Feed in our Fields;
But as Nature Commits Errors and Defects in
Producing her Creatures, so we for want of
Knowledge have not the Good effect of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44350:130"/>
for though we are Bred up to Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
yet we are not all so Knowing in Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
as to Thrive and Grow Rich by our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
for as all Scholars are not Learned, that
have Lived and Spent most of their time in
Studies in Universities, but are meer Dunces;
or as Artisans, are not all Excellent VVork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
although they have been Bound to their
Trade, and have Wrought long in it, yet are but
Bunglers: So for Husbandry, all Husbandmen
are not so Knowing in their Profession as to
Thrive, but they Labour at Randome, without
Judgement or Observation, and like those that
Learn to Read by Rote, may Understand the
VVords or Letters, but not the Sense and
Meaning: So we may be brought up to Labour,
but not Understand to make a Profitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
not Knowing the Nature of the several
Soils, as what for Pasture, or Meddow, or Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage;
nor to Fore-see the Change of VVeather,
nor to Take the most Seasonable Times, nor to
Observe the Course of the Planets, all which is
very Requisite for the Breed of our Animals,
and Increase of our Vegetables. VVherefore,
in my Opinion, it were very Necessary for us,
to Choose the most Observing and Experienced
men amongst us, that Understand Husbandry
best, to be our Publick and General Teachers,
Instructers, Informers, and Reformers in our
Profession of Husbandry: For as there are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Teachers for the Souls of Men, Moral
Teachers for the Manners of Men, Human
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44350:130"/>
Teachers for the Bodies of Men, and Physicians
for the Lives of Men, so there should be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Teachers and Informers for the Profitable
Increase for Men, such as have not only Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
by Practice, and Judgement by Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but have both Learning and Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Natural Philosophy, as to Learn and
Search into the Causes and Effects of Natures
VVorks, and to Know and Observe the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Heavens on Earth, and on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and Sundry Creatures In and On the
Earth; also the Sympathies and Antipathies of
the several Creatures to Each other, as also the
Natures and Proprieties of every Kind and
Sort of Creature; so shall we know how to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our Breed of Animals, and our Stores of
Vegetables, and to find out the Minerals for
our Use; for as Learning without Practice is
of No Effect, so Practice without Knowledge is
of Small Profit; yet many will Take upon
them to Instruct Others, that want Instructions
Themselves, but such Instructers Instructions
are more in Words than for Use, as <hi>Plutarch's</hi>
Common-wealth, or <hi>Virgilius Georgics,</hi> two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Men, the One a Moral Philosopher, the
Other a Poet; the One did Form such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
as Men would nor could not Live
in it, and so not fit for Use; the Other could
better set his Wit to VVork than his Hands,
for if <hi>Virgil</hi> had left his Husbandary in Verse, to
Practise it in Prose, he had Lived Poorly, and
Died Obscurely, as having more VVit and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44350:131"/>
Fancy to VVrite of Husbandry in his <hi>Georgics,</hi>
than Knowledge or Experience to Practise it in
his Farms; Thus Poets get Fame, and Farmers
VVealth, the One by their VVit, the Other
by their Experience, the One by Imagination,
the Other by Practice, for a Clown or Peasant
Gains more Knowledge by his Practice, than a
Poet by his Contemplations; but when Practice
and VVit are joyned together, they beget Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Wealth, the One being Adorned
with Gold, the Other Inthroned with Fame,
for Emperours have Ascended from the Plough,
and Kings from the Sheep-coats, Converting
their Plough-sherds to Thrones, their Sickles
to Crowns, and their Sheep-hooks to Scepters.
Thus Clowns, Boors, or Peasants by Name, are
become Princes in Power, and Princes in Power
are become Beasts by Name and Nature, witness
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>

Beasts, and Live with Beasts, and Dye like
Beasts, but we are the Bawds and Pimps too, to
bring Beasts to Act Bestially together; also we
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44350:131"/>
are the Dungers of the Earth, to Carry and
Spread the several Excrements of several Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
thereon, which makes us not only to have
a Continual Stink in our Nostrils, but to be a

Within and Without, for all our Thoughts are
Imployed on our Labours, which Labours are
Brutish; neither have we such Fine and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Recreations as other Men, for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
is only to Whistle, Pipe, and sometimes
to Dance in a Crowd together, or rather Jump
and Leap together, being Ignorant of Dancing
Measures; and the only Pleasure we have, is,
to Rumble and Tumble our Country Lasses,
who being more Foul than Fair, more Gross
than Fine, more Noisome than Sweet, we soon
Surfeit of them, and then they become a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
instead of a Delight, a Disease instead of a
Pleasure, a Hate instead of a Love; and as they
are to Us, so no Doubt but in the End we are to
Them, a Loathing Surfeit; for we Meet Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Associate Brutishly, and Depart Rudely;
and as for our Profits, though we Labour, yet
our Landlords have the Increase. In short, we
are Slaves to Beasts, and Beasts in Comparison of

there be more Happiness than in the Repose of

we at our Own Vintage? nay, should we Desire
to Feed Highly, we may, for we are Masters of
the Beasts of the Field, and the Poultry in the
Grange, and know well how to Catch the Fouls
of the Air? can we have Warmer and Softer

They, for they Spend their time in Huswifry,

Hands, when Washed, with Coasse Cloth to
Cleanse them; and as for their Garments, they
are Plain, yet Commodious, Easie, and Decent,
they are not Ribb'd up with Whale-bones, nor
Incumbred with Heavy Silver and Gold Laces,
nor Troubled with New Fashions; they Spend
not half their time in Painting and Dressing,
and though they Patch their Cloaths sometimes
out of Good Huswifry, yet they Patch not
their Faces out of Vanity, as Ladies do; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do our Women Sweat to make their Faces
Fair, but Sweat for their Childrens Livelihood,

were All that would be Laid upon
us, there were Some Comfort, but that is not
Likely, unless our Ministers of State, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
were Less Covetous to Get, and More
Sparing to Save; for though they Get much,
they Spend much, or rather Spoil much in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44350:134"/>
Luxury, Vanity, and Bravery, which makes
them alwayes Needy, and though they Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that their Taxing is for the Service of the
Common-wealth, yet most of it is Imployed
in their Common Expences, or Horded up to
Buy Lands, and Build Stately Palaces for their
Posterity to Injoy and Live in; thus they
Build upon our Stocks, and Buy Lands with
our Labours, so that we Take Pains for Their
Pleasure; but if they Tax us Often, we shall
be so Poor, as we shall not only have Nothing to
Pay, but Nothing to Live on, which Poverty
will either Starve us, or Force us to be their
Slaves for Maintenance, for when they have
Ingross'd All the VVealth, they will become
Lords of the People, or rather their Tyrants.
Thus if we Part with our VVealth, we Part
with our Liberty, but to Keep Both, let us not
Part with our Money, untill we know How it
shall be Imployed, for if it be Imployed in the
Service of the Common-wealth, it will Return
to our Profit, which will be as Traffick to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,
and not as Robbery to Impoverish us, but
if they Robb the Common-wealth, Imploying
our Monies to their Own Use, we are Doubly
Robbed, like as Men should take our Fathers
Goods, which is our Inheritance, and also that
we have Gotten by our Own Industry; and if
it be Requisite for us to Part with our Money,
it is Requisite they should Give us an Account
of the Distribution; for as the Magistrate or
Ministers of State are the Common-wealth's

Stewards, so the People ought to be their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers,

that Spoke that Mutinous Oration, Spoke not
for the Publick Good, but his Own Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Hoping by this Oration to be a Popular
Man, Imbroiling the Common-wealth in a
Civil Warr, to Work out his Own Designs;
thus Men for Private Respects would make a
Publick Ruine, and the People through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
do never Perceive them, but rather do
Applaud and Praise them for Good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth-Men,
when they are oftentimes the
Occasion of a Common-wealths Destruction;
but if you should follow his Instructions, you
would not only Lose All your Wealth, which
is worse than to Part with Some on Necessary
Occasions, but you would Part with Lives or
Liberties, for he Advises you to Rebell against
your Magistrates and Ministers of State, by
Calling or Forcing them to give a Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the States Private Affairs: But to shew
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44350:135"/>
you how Foolishly he hath Advised you, give
me Leave to Speak to your Sense and Reason,
in Hope you are not Void of either, for in Sense
and Reason a Common-wealth cannot be Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
Ruled, and Govern'd without a Soveraign
Power, which Soveraign Power is in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and Ministers of State, they are the
Head to the Body of the Common-wealth, and
to have a Body without a Head is against Nature,
and your Reason and Sense shews you, that if
you Take off, or Divide the Head from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
both will Dye, Rot, and Consume: So if
you take a Soveraign Power from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
it Dies, Dissolves, and Consumes with
Disorder, Warr, and Ruine, and if your Sense
and Reason perceive a Common-wealth must
of Necessity have a Supreme Power, your Sense
and Reason will shew you, that you must Trust
that Supreme Power, otherwise it would not
be a Supreme or Soveraign Power, which
Power is to Command, Order, and Dispose of
all, as it shall Think fit, or as it Pleases, without
Giving any Account, for Giving an Account
makes it of no Force or Effect; for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
cannot be Govern'd without Subtility
and Secrecy, which is called Policy, which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
if Divulged, is no Policy, wherefore a
Publick Account ought not to be given of that,
which is not fit Publickly to be made Known;
And give me Leave to tell you, that Policy is
Chargeable, not only that it Costs much Study
and Labour of the Brain, but it Requires much
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44350:135"/>
Money, or Monies worth, to Execute the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
for though it be the Chief Design of
Policy to be a Gainer in the End, yet is is but a
Contriver in the Beginning, a Worker in the
Continuance or Execution, and a Possessor in
the End, and whilst it Works, it must have
Something to Work with, for the Old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
say, out of Nothing, Nothing can be
Made; neither is it Fit, they should Give an
Account of the Receits or Expences they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or Distribute of the Common-wealth,
for much Monies must be Imployed to have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
from Forein Parts and Nations, for
Fear of Surprisals, and Perchance great Summs
of Monies are Required to Corrupt some Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Betray the Rest, and so to Prevent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if not Ruine, besides many other wayes,
Abroad and at Home, which Expences are not
fit to be made Known, or an Account given for;
for Wise Ministers of State make Use of all
Passions, Appetites, Vices and Vanities of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as well as of their Vertues, Courages, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosities,
Ingenuities, Abilities, and the like;
for that which would be Base, Foolish, Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and VVicked, for Private and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Families, Persons, or Acts, is Honourable,
Justifiable, and VVise in the Publick-weal.
VVherefore, let me Perswade you, to Pay the
Taxes VVillingly and Readily, for Money is
the Materials to Repair, Strengthen, Inlarge,
Inrich, and Adorn a Common-wealth, that you
may Live Safely, Magnificently, Plentifully,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44350:136"/>
and Pleasantly, which otherwise you will not
do, but Ruine your selves, at least make your
Lives Unhappy through Covetousness; which
to avoid, part with Some of your Wealth or
Profit Contentedly, that you may Injoy the rest
Quietly, Peaceably, and Freely, and follow
not the Advice of the former Orator, whose
Speech, although it was Plausible to you, yet
you might easily perceive his Design was Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
not only to the Magistrates which are
your Fathers, but to the whole State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Indeavouring with his Speech to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil
the whole State in a Civil Warr, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
you to be the first Risers, Stirrers, and
Disturbers. Thus through Private, Particular,
and Self-respects, Men oft times make General
Warrs, but I hope you will Live in Peace, and
so Ile Leave you.</p>

the Rulers in the Discharges of Necessary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44350:136"/>
which Thefts they Secretly Hord up,
so that in the End, if they be Suffered, there
will be such a Scarcity of Money, as there will
be None to Pay, nor None to Receive, and like
as those that Hord up Corn, make a Dearth, so
those that Hord up Money, make a Mutiny,
so that Money-Horders Cause Civil Warrs, as
Corn-Horders Cause Famine; for when there
is but Little Money Stirring in the Kingdome,
they, that have Any, are so Loath to Part with
it, as they will rather Part with their Lives,
and those that have None, are so Greedy to have
Some, as they will Venture their Lives to Get
it; and if the Common Treasure be Empty,
and the People be Poor, we cannot Live in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
if we have no Means to Provide for our
Safety, the Kingdome will Lye open to the
Enemy, for Money or Monies worth is a Ward
that Locks up a Kingdome in Safety, and is a
Key to Unlock the Gates of our Enemies, and
Sets them Open for our Entrance, and Money
or Monies worth is so Subtil and Insinuating, as
it Enters into the most Privy Counsels of our
Enemies, brings us Intelligence of all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
or makes them Advise Treacherously, and
give Counsel even against Themselves, such
Power hath Riches ! it Buyes out Honesty,
Corrupts Justice, Betrayes Lives, nay, even
Souls, for men will Venture Damnation for the

that the Common Treasure should be well
Stor'd, Good Common-wealth-men should be

not only Industrious to Inrich the Common
Treasure, but Sparing in Spending the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Treasure, and Severely Punish those that
Indeavour to Coosen and Rob the Common
Treasure, and none should be Suffer'd to Hord
up Riches but in the Common Treasure, which
is to be Spent Generally for the Good of all the
whole Kingdome, in time of Necessity, as in the
times of Plagues, Famines, and Warrs, as also
for the Strength and Power of the Kingdome,
for the Reward of Merit, Advancing of Trade,
and such like wayes of Expences, not in Gay
Shews, and Idle Pastimes, nor in Vain or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable

Suffer the People to be Impoverish'd by these
Cheating, Coosening Purloiners, we shall never
fill the Common Coffers, for to Coofen and

Common Treasure, which is the General Store

Them, to be Profitably Laid out For Them.</p>

more than you are now Required to Pay: But
give me Leave to tell you, that you are both
Unreasonable and Unjust, for you will Live in
the Common wealth, and yet not Help to
Maintain or Uphold it; also you are Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as not to Return a Small Gratuity to the

you have Receiv'd therefrom; Indeed, in

your Country, as Children who should Suffer

Rebell against your King and Noble Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Indeavouring to Alter the Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this Flourishing Kingdome, that
hath Continued in and under the Reign and
Rule of Kings these many Hundred years, which
time hath Confirm'd so strongly in the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
Power, as you Cannot easily make a
Change; yet if you Could, the Action would
be very Unjust, Unnatural, Wicked, and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
Unjust, to Force away the Rights of
your King; Unnatural, as not to Live under
the Same Government your Fore-fathers did;
Wicked, to Spill the Blood of your Nobles;
and Damnable, to Spill the Blood of your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
Thus it will be Evil and Dangerous, for
you cannot Think they will Part Peaceably
from that Power their Ancestors Left them, they
will not become your Slaves, if they can Help
it, nay, they will sooner Part with their Lives
than their Honours, and you are not sure of
Victory, for all Honest men will be of Their
Party; yet put the Case, you should have Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
you will sooner make a Confusion than
Settle the Kingdome into a Republick, for the
Nature and Constitution is not for it, as having
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44350:138"/>
been Bred up a Long time to Monarchy, so that
you may sooner Change the Nature of Man
into a Beast, than the Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
into a Republick; and could you make it
a Republick, you would not be so Happy as you
are Now, for now you are Govern'd Easily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Troubling your Selves, but then you would
be Troubled, not Knowing how to Govern your
Selves, as also the Common-wealth, for you
must be Forc'd to set up Some to Govern you;
and is it not Better to be Govern'd by your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
than your Equals? which Equals
would Rule you by Corrupting Flattery, or
Terrifie you with Reports of Dangers, and so
Rule you by Fear. Thus by Insinuations or
Terrors, you would be more Inslaved than you
are now, and Poorer than you are now; for
though you Commons have not Power to Rule
as a King, yet you have Wealth to Spend on
what you Please, witness your Luxuries and
Vanities, which if you were Poor, you could
not Exceed in Plenty as you Do, insomuch as
you can hardly Afford God some Fasting Daies.
Besides, those Sycophants and Cheats, which
perswade you to this Change, would not only
Spend your Wealth, but Waste your Lives,
for they would Perswade you to make Warrs
Abroad, to Keep you in Subjection, for in
VVarrs they Command You, and in Time of
Peace they are Afraid you will Command
Them, and rather than you should Live in Peace,
they would Corrupt your Neighbours with
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44350:139"/>
Bribes, or Provoke them with Injuries, to make
Warr with you. Thus you would be Inslaved
by being Out-witted by Those, that have more
Brain than your Selves. O Foolish People, that
will quit your Present Happiness for a Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Slavery ! and as for a Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which you seem to be Weary of, it
is the most Ancient and Divinest, as being an
Imitation of God and his Angels in Heaven,
wherein are Degrees, as Higher and Lower,
from, and to his Throne; But as God had Evil
Angels, so our King hath Evil Subjects, which
ought to be Cast out of the Kingdome like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
as they are.</p>

Frowning Countenance, which doth Fore-shew
a Storm, and by your Accusations and Factions
your Hearts seem full of Malice, and your
Heads full of Design, as if you did Intend each
others Ruine, and so the Kingdom's Destruction
by a Civil Warr, not Considering that a Civil
Warr is far worse than a Forein VVarr, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Forein Enemy the whole Strength of a
Kingdome is United to Defend it Self, but in a
Civil Warr the Strength is Divided to Destroy
the whole Kingdome, and so much Difference
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44350:139"/>
there is Between each Warr, that a Forein Warr
is but like an Outward Sore on the Body, but a
Civil VVarr is as an Inward Disease even in the
Vital Parts, which Causes a Consumption;
Indeed, I may Similizing say, that in a
Civil Warr the Kingdome doth, as if it did
Spit up its Lungs, for Civil Warrs oftentimes
cause Famine and Plagues, which is to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as a Hectick Leanness, Heat and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a Man's Body, which causes Death and
Destruction. But, <hi>Dear Country-men,</hi> what
can you Propound to your Selves in a Civil
Warr? can any Man be Happy when Injustice
Reigns, and Force Rules? or can any Man hope
to Inrich himself when Fury and Malice makes
a Spoil of all? or can any Man think to Advance
himself, when as every Particular Desires and
Indeavours to be Superiour? for though Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
may be Pull'd down, yet where no Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Authority is Suffer'd by the Power of Many,
no Particular person can be Advanced, they must
All continue Equal, or be all Destroyed to One
Man, and That Man will only be Superiour in
his Single Person and Life, but not have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or Power over Other Men; for if there be
None to be Govern'd, it cannot be said, he Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
and when there is None to Obey, there is
None to Command; but should Several Parties
Choose Chiefs, yet if one Party should get the
Better of the other Parties, 'tis probable the
Chief of that Party could not Rule Long, for
there would be alwayes Divisions between the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44350:140"/>
Head and the Body of that Party, and every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Party of that Body would be the Head;
So that in Effect there would neither be Head
nor Body, but in the End the whole would be
Destroyed: and as for Spoils, if any be Gotten
in Civil VVarrs, the Possessors have not Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to Injoy them, for Spoils in Civil Warrs
are Toss'd from Man to Man, where Every one
Striving to Have them, not any One can Keep
them: and as for Lands, though they cannot be
Removed, yet Several Claimers will move to
them, and Every one Strive to Posses them.
Thus Civil VVarrs do Level Power and
VVealth, and in the end Destroy them; and
since Men can neither have Rest, Safety, Plenty,
Honour, or Authority in Civil VVarrs, it were
a Madness to make such VVarrs, wherein they
are sure to be Losers, at least no Gainers; nay,
were there any thing Left to be Injoyed, those
that never Ventured in the VVarrs, would go
away with the Spoils; for the Ruins of a Civil
Warr are left to Succeeding Ages, the Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Fighters being for the most part De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
in the Warr. In truth, there is Nothing
so Miserable, Hatefull, Cruel, and Irreligious as
Civil Warr, for it is an Enemy against Law,
Nature, and God, it Pulls down the Seats of
Justice, Throws down the Altars of Religion,
Diggs up the Urns of their Parents, Disperses
the Dust and Bones of their Dead Ancestors,
Spills the Blood of their Fathers, Sons, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Friends, and Country-men, and makes a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44350:140"/>
Total Destruction and Dissolution, or at least
their Country so Weak, as it becomes a Prey to
Forein Enemies, and the Remainders of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
become Slaves; so that Civil Warr begins
with Liberty, but ends in Slavery. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
those Turbulent Spirits, that will not Live
in Peace, but Indeavour to make Civil Varr,
ought to be Hang'd to Prevent it, so shall the
Peaceable and Innocent Live in Safety, which
otherwise will be Devoured and Destroyed by
the Merciless men in Arms.</p>

your Sudden Fear and Sudden Obedience to
those you Rebell'd against, Obeying whatsoever
they Command, Delivering up your Purses and
Arms in Hope to get Pardon for your Lives;
for your Fear was Such, as you no sooner saw an
Army come Towards your City as an Enemy,
but you presently Drew up your Bridges, Shut
fast your Gates, Chain'd up your Streets, and
Run to your Prayers for Heavens Help; I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
you had great Reason to Fear, when as a
Sharking Needy Army was at your Gates,
which would have Fought more Valiantly to
Get into the City to Plunder, than you to Keep
them out from Plundering; besides, there is a
Castle or Fort, that is Built so Near your City,
and Stands so Advantagious, as the Canons pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thereon can easily Beat down your City
over your Heads; but these Things at the first
you did or would not Consider, Resolving
madly to Rebell, having at that Time neither
Fear nor Wit, for before such time as you Saw
the Army, believing it was Far off from you, a
Stranger had he Seen and Heard your Boasts,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44350:142"/>
Braggs, and Bravadoes, your Arming, Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and Trumpetting, might have Believed,
at least Thoughts, you had both Valour and
Power Equal with the Old <hi>Romans,</hi> that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
all the World, but you Appear'd more
Terrible than your Were, for your Deeds were
not Answerable to your Words and Behaviour,
and your Countenances did Change with your
Fear; the truth is, your Courage was a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Courage, and your Fear seems as a Loyal
Fear, for before your Enemies did Appear, you
did Boast like Souldiers, but now you ask Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
you Flatter like Courtiers, yet for all your
Flattery you must Pay for your Disorders, and
Buy your Peace with a Huge Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
and if I should Ask you why you did put
your Selves into a Warring Posture without
Leave or Command from your King or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of State, you will Answer me, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of some of your Privileges, so that for the
Sake of Some you Indanger'd All, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
way and Surest means to Lose your Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
was to Rebell against your Soveraign, all
which shews your Ignorance, Folly, and great
Simplicity; Wherefore, by this Rebellious
stirr, you have not only Lost your Privileges,
but you are Forc'd to Pay more than your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
are Worth, might you Injoy them, so
that you must Lose the One, and Pay the Other;
and all this Loss and Charge is Caused through
your Factious Humours, and Restless Natures,
being Unprofitably Busie. Indeed, you are like
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44350:142"/>
Troubled Waters, Muddy and Foul, yet it is
Likely, at least Hoped, that the Fine that is set
upon you, will draw you Clean, making you
Clear and Smooth, which is, to be Loyal and
Peaceable, only the Chief misery is, that in the
Loss of your Privileges, and Payments of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Good Men (for All were not Traitors,
though Most were) must Suffer with the Bad,
the Fine being Generally laid upon the Whole
City, wherein every Particular must Pay his
Share, and the Loss of the Privileges falls upon
All, by which we may Observe, that Peaceable
Men Suffer with Troublers, and Honest Men
with Traitors, and it cannot easily be Avoided,
not only that the Few that are Good, are Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and Hid amongst the Many that are Bad, and
so cannot be easily Cull'd out, but in Cases of
Taxes and Privileges, it would make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
in Levies and Partments; Thus neither
Good nor Wise Men can suddenly avoid those
Misfortunes that Fools and Knaves many times
bring upon them; but Wise Men did see at
your first Rising, Arming and Souldiering, that
you would sooner Yield to your Opposers, than
Fight them, and rather Pay for your Follies,
than Dispute for your Privileges; for you were
all Body, and no Head, and so consequently no
Brains; But that I Wonder at most, is, that so
Great a Body as you were, should not only be
Headless, but also Heartless, as having neither
Wit nor Courage. Wherefore, to Conclude,
let me Perswade you, having never a Head of

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44350:143"/>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44350:143"/>
Woods, Pull down Houses, set Open Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
Live Idlely upon the Fundamental Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Common-wealth, not Labouring to
Manure the Land; But if you take not Care of
Two Things, your Ruine will be Sooner than
you Imagine; these Two Necessary Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Actions, are Trade and Shipping; As
for Trade, you give your Neighbours leave to
take Part of it away from you, and that you
Trade your Selves in, is so Ill Managed, as it
brings but Small Profit or Advantage to this
Kingdome; for you Trade rather like as Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
than Great Merchants; besides, you Send
out of the Kingdome the most Profitable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
as those that are call'd Staple Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and Bring in the most Unprofitable
Commodities, such as are only for Vanities, and
not such as are for Necessary Use; Also, you
Raise your Customs to so High a Rate, as the
Custom is Beyond the Profit of Trade; but
could Merchants Gain, yet, if the Gain of their
far-fetched Commodities be Uncertain, and the
Customs for those brought home Commodities
Certain, few would Venture or be Merchants,
so that Trade upon Necessity must Fall, and then
the Kingdome cannot be Rich; And as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
cannot be Rich without Forein Trade,
so it cannot be Safe without Home Shipping,
which is the other Necessary Consideration and
Action; but you do not Consider enough of it,
as being Blinded with Covetousness, Regarding
your Particular Profits more than the General
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44350:144"/>
Safety, Cutting down and making a Spoil of all
such VVoods, as should Repair and Increase
Shipping, which Wood is Oak, whereof this
Island had the Best in the World; Indeed, there
is no such Oak in any Part of the VVorld, but
in this Kingdome, which is the Reason, there are
no such Ships in the VVorld as do belong to
this Island, for one of our Ships is Able to Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
two or more Ships of other Nations, by
Reason our Oak is not apt to Cleft or Splinter,
being Smooth, Sound, and Strong, besides,
Close, not Porous or Spongy; but we for the
Covetousness or Present Gain, Cut down this
Excellent full-Grown Timber to be Burnt into
Coals for Iron Forges, whereas our Ancestors
were so Carefull, as they would not Cut more
than was for Necessity, although there was great
Store of it; for, by Reason this Sort of Wood
requires above a Hundred years Growth, to be
Tall, Firm, Strong, Close, and Free from Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
they would not Cut it before the Age
made it fit for Use, nay, our Ancestors did
oftner Plant Young, than Cut down the Old,
and all for the Sake and Safety of their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
But we do not Consider Posterity, for if
we did, we should not Do as we Do; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what with a Standing Army, no Trade, and
daily Spoils, the Kingdome will be Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
and of Necessity fall to Ruine.</p>

Get them Money and Provision; But were
they as Obedient as Insolent, yet it were fit, that
most of them should be Disbanded, otherwise
they will Impoverish the Common-wealth; for
there is no greater Expence and Charge, than to
Maintain an Idle Army, that Feeds upon others
Labours, and is Cloath'd upon others Cost;
besides, they are not only Unprofitable through
their Idleness, and Chargeable to be Maintain'd,
but they are great Destroyers with the Spoils
they daily make; for their Idleness makes them
Mischievous, so as they are Insolent and Proud,
as we, their Masters dare not Speak roughly to
them; but when they are Disarm'd, they will
be Humble, and the Common Souldiers will
follow their former Trades, and several Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations:
Thus the Charge and Expence of
Maintainting the Army will not only be Taken

               <p>NOw we are Absolute Masters of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
having cast out the Gown men out
of their Power and Authority, the question will
be What Kind of Government we shall Settle
this Kingdome in, as in a Celestial, Aereal, or
Terrestrial; The Celestial is Monarchy, the
Aereal is Aristocraty, the Terrestrial is Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty;
The First is to be Govern'd by One, the
Second by Few, the Third by Many; The
First is to be Govern'd by a King, the Second by
Nobles, the Third by Commons; But one of
these Governments we must Settle in, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all the Kingdome will be in a Confusion;
for if there be no Order and Method, there
will be no Rule nor Government, since Every
one will do what he List, and then None will
take Care of any thing, so that there will be
neither Tillage nor Trade, and if there be no
Tillage nor Trade, there will be neither Food
nor Money, for where there is no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there can be no Assurance, and who will
take Pains for that they are not Sure to Keep,
or rather I may say, they are Sure to Lose?
VVherefore, some Government we must
Choose, and all Kinds of Governments are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into these three I have mentioned; as for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44350:147"/>
Democraty, I like that the Worst, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people is not only Insolent, when they
have Power, Commanding Imperiously, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deming
Unjustly, Advancing Unworthily, but
they are so Inconstant, as there is no Assurance
in them, and so Foolish, as they Know not what
to Choose, only like little Children, they will
be Perswaded with a Flattering Tongue, sometimes
to Reason, but oftner against Reason, and
sometimes against all Reason and Sense; the
truth is, though they seem to Govern, yet they
are Rul'd by some Particulars, as first by One,
and then an Other, as those that can Flatter Best,
or rather Most, by which they become Slaves
to an Insinuating Tongue; Wherefore, it is no
fit Government for Us, for we are Souldiers and
not Pleaders, we are Fighters and not Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
the truth is, that a Pure Democraty is all
Body and no Head, and an Absolute Monarchy
is all Head and no Body, whereas Aristocraty is
both Head and Body, it is a Select and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
Number for a Good Government,
which Number being United, Represents and
Acts as One Man, for like as Many Mens Voices
Agreeing and Consenting make it as One Mans
Decree, so a Proportionable Number makes it
as One Mans Ruling or Governing: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
this is the Best Kind of Government for
Us, for so all the Chief Commanders in our
Army, being United together, may be this
whole Person in this Aristocratical Government,
in which the whole Power of the Kingdome
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44350:147"/>
will be in Us, and so we may Govern as we shall
Think good.</p>

that we shall never agree in that Government,
for though we should be Fellow States-men, as
we be <hi>Fellow Souldiers,</hi> yet if we be Fellow

but a Government that shall be Mixt of
the two Former, as neither to have it Perfect
Monarchy, nor Perfect Aristocraty, but mixt of
both; for as the Nobles are as the Head, to
Guide, Direct, Rule, and Govern the Common
People, which are as the Body; so a King, or a
Chief Governour, is as the Brain to that Head,
for without a Brain the Head would be but as
an Empty Scul, and without a Head and Brain
the Body would be but as a Senseless Block;
Wherefore, a King or Chief Ruler, Joyn'd to a

of Some, and a Republick of Most, or

Experience, that this Kingdome hath been
Toss'd from One Sort of Government to an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is now so Exhausted, as to be almost
Expir'd: It was at first Monarchical, where in a
Long Peace Flattery, Vanity, and Prodigality,
got into the Monarchical Court, all which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Poverty, and so Injustice, (for Poverty and
Necessity is all times a Page to Prodigality,)
which Caused the Selling of all Offices and
Places of Judicature, for those that Buy Dear,
are forced to Sell Dear, and this Caused Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
and Extorsions, besides, Bribes given
and Bribes taken, insomuch, that no Justice was
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44350:150"/>
done for Justice Sake, but Bribes Sake, and they,
who gave the greatest Bribes, had their Sute or
Cause Judged of their side, whether Right or
Wrong; Nay, many Judges and Officers were
so Ignorant, as they Knew not how to Judge
Rightly, or Execute any Publick Affairs, as they
should have done, had they a Will to do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly;
but how should they do either Wisely,
Knowingly, or Honestly, being not Chosen for
Parts, Abilities, Understanding, or Merit, but
by Paying so much Money? this Fault in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was a great Grievance; Also Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers
Ingross'd several and almost all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
in the Kingdome, hightning their
Price as they pleased, which hindred the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Trade and Traffick, and this was an other
great Grievance; Also there were great Taxes
laid upon the People and Kingdome, which was
an other Grievance; Moreover, needy Poor
Courtiers would Beg that which ought not to be
Granted, or Accuse some Rich men to Get some
of their Estates, at least to get a Bribe to be
Freed; all which begot such Dislike and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
that the whole Kingdome Rebell'd with
such a Fury, as they Pull'd down Monarchy,
and after much Blood was Spilt in the VVarr,
they Set up a Repulick, in which Government
the Commons Chose the Magistrate and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of State, for which the Commons were
grossly Flattered by the Nobler Sort, which
Vice of Flattery became a Studied and Practised
Art, by which the Chief men became most Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44350:150"/>
and Eloquent Orators, every Man striving
to Out-Speak each other; but this Practice and
Strife begat Ambition and Envy in the Better
Sort, and Pride in the Commons, which Pride
was hightned by their Power, to make Peace
or Warr, to Choose Magistrates and Officers,
to Pull down or Advance, to give Life or Death,
to Banish or Recall, to Condemn or Reprieve;
and all this Power lay in their Voices. O
Powerfull Voice of a Headless Monster! this
Power caused the Brainless People to be so
Proud, and withall so Envious, as also Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to those Men that had Merit and Worth,
having None Themselves, as they would often
Banish, if not Put to Death their Generous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Valiant Commanders, and Wise Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
as also those that were more Rich than
their Neighbours; besides, they would Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Mean and Worthiless men, such as were
of their own Degree and Quality, to Places and
Offices of Dignity, which Discontented the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and that Discontent bred a Faction betwixt
the Commons and Nobles, which Faction being
Increas'd by the Friends of the Banished or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Persons, brought forth a Civil Warr,
long was the Strife, but at last the Nobles got
the Better, and then the State or Government
became Aristocraty, in which Government for
some time they Liv'd Agreeable, and Govern'd
Justly and Orderly, but by Reason Aristocraty
is a Government of Some of the Nobles, and
not of One, they could not Long agree, Every
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44350:151"/>
one Striving to be Chief and most Powerfull,
insomuch that through Envy and Ambition
they would Cross and Oppose each other; for
some would keep Peace with their Neighbours,
others would make Warr, and some would
have such or such Laws made, others would
not, some would have some Old Laws Abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or Dissolved, others would Oppose them;
neither was Justice Executed as it ought, for
some would Punish those, that others would
Save, some would Reward those, that others
would Disgrace: Thus every one was Striving
for Supreme Power, although they did hinder
One an Other, and by the means of Doing and
Undoing, Decreeing and Opposing, the People
could not Tell whom to Address their Sutes,
Causes, and Grievances to, for what one Spake
For, an other would Speak Against, till at last by
their Pulling several wayes the Aristocratical
Government broke in Pieces, and then those
Nobles set up each One for Himself, and so there
became another Civil Warr, Long was that
Warr, for some times one had the Better, and
then an Other, and some times two or three
Sides would Joyn against the Rest, and then most
against One, but now at last they being weary
with Warr, yet know not how to Agree in a
Peace, insomuch, as we have neither Warr, nor
yet Peace, nor any Setled Government; the
truth is, the Kingdome is like as the Chaos and
Confused Substance, and there is no way to bring
it to an Orderly Form, but to have a Native

King, to bring Light out of Darkness, that we
may See our own Errors, and Reform our Faults

I may say Mankind, are so Restless, as never to
be Contented with what we Have, were it the
Best; for should the Gods Reign and Rule Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly

apt to Murmur, if not Rebell against them;
Wherefore I Fear, we shall never Continue

Keep us in Order; for if Mankind desire to be

to Dye Voluntarily, to Dwell in the Grave
Peaceably, a Cruel Perswasion, and a Wicked
One, for Death is the Punishment of Sin, and
shall we Imbrace our Punishment without
Hopes of Redemption? shall we Dye before a

Believes after this Life there is none Other, but
that is more than he Knows or can Prove, for I

               <p>I Have Required your Assembly at this time,
to Perswade you to Practise both Riding and
Fencing, when you have Spare time from
Fighting; for it is impossible you should At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
any Brave or Extraordinary Actions by
your Single Persons in the day of Battel, unless
you be Excellent and Skilfull in the Manage of
your Horses, and in the Use of your Swords,
for your Horses well Managed and well Rid,
shall not only Overthrow your Opposites as
Man and Horse, that are Ignorant in the Art,
but any One of you will be able to Disorder an
Enemies Troop; 'Tis true, an Ignorant Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Commander
hath less Assurance than a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Commander,
besides it is a Double Labour, and
Requires a Double Art, as to Manage a Horse
and to Use a Sword Skilfully at one time, but
then he hath a Double Advantage, if he can
Ride well, and hath a good Managed Horse, that
Obeyes well the Hand and the Heel, that can
tell how to Turn, or to stop on the Hanches, or
to go Forward, or Side-wayes, and the like:
The truth is, a good Horse-man, although not
so well Skill'd in the Use of the Sword, shall
have Advantage of an Ignorant Horse-man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
well Skill'd in the Use of the Sword;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44350:153"/>
but to Know both Arts is best for a good Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Souldier.
As for Foot Commanders, they must
Chiefly, if not only, Practise the Use of the
Sword, for it is the Sword that makes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Execution; for though neither Horse nor
Sword is either Defensive or Offensive against
Canon Bullets, yet they are both Usefull against
Bodies of men; for all sorts of Bullets, either
from Canons, Muskets, or Pistols, will Miss ten
times for Hitting once, whereas an Army when
Joyning so Close as to Fight Hand to Hand, the
Sword is the Chief and Prime Executor, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that a Sword Skilfully or Artificially
Used, hath the Advantage over the Strength of
Clowns or their Clubs, or the But-ends of their
Muskets. Wherefore, a Compleat Souldier
should be as Knowing and well Practised in the
Use of the Sword and the Management of his
Horse, as in Drawing up a Body of Men, and
Setting or Pitching an Army in Battel Aray;
for by the fore-mentioned Arts you will make a
great Slaughter, and a Quicker Dispatch to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and Gain a great Renown or Fame to each
Particular Person, that are so well Bred or
Taught to be Horse-men and Sword-men.</p>

               <p>WHo Study to Think, and Think to
Dream; As there are three Sorts of
Worlds, so there are three Kinds or
Sorts of Life, viz. the Material,
Poetical, and Drowsie World, and
the Dreaming, Contemplating, and Active Life;
but of all these three Worlds and three Lives,
the Drowsie World and Dreaming Life is most
Wonderfull, for it is as a Life in Death, and a
Death in Life; and this Drowsie World and
Dreaming Life is a Type of an Unknown
World, and an Unknown Life, for Sleep is a
Type of Death, and Dreaming is a Type of the
Rewards and Punishments in the other World;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44350:154"/>
Good Dreams are like as the Rewards for the
Blessed, and Bad Dreams are like as Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the Wicked, the One Receives Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Joy, the Other Fear and Torments,
and these Joys, Pleasures, Fears, and Torments,
are as Sensible to the Senses, and as Apparent to
the Understanding and Knowledge, as when A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake;
also Memory and Remembrance, and the
same Appetites and Satisfactions are as Perfect
in Dreams as when Awake, the Passions of the
Mind as Forcible; the Dispositions and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the Nature as Various, the Will as
Obstinate, the Judgement as Deep, the VVit as
Quick, the Observation as Serious, Reason as
Rational, Conception as Subtil, Courage as
Daring, Justice as Upright, Prudence as VVary,
Temperance as Sparing, Anger as Violent, Love
as Kind, Fear as Great, Hopes and Doubts as
Many, Joys as Full, Hate as Deadly, Faith as
Strong, Charity as Pitifull, and Devotion as
Zealous in Perfect Dreams as Awake: also
they are as Uncharitable, VVicked, Foolish,
Cowardly, Base, Deboist, Furious, and the like
in Perfect Dreams as Awake; but Dreams in
Sleeping Senses are Shorter, than the Actions
of VVaking Senses, and not so Permanent, for
they Suddenly Fade, and their Sudden Fading
Oftentimes makes a Confusion and more Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than in the VVaking and Active Life; But
to Speak of the Sleeping Senses Generally and
Particularly, have we not the same Appetites,
and Satisfactions? are not we Sensible of Dying,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44350:155"/>
Living, Suffering, Injoying, Mourning, Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Rejoycing, Laughing? are we not as Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of Pain and Ease? of Accidents, Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
Dangers, and Escapes in Dreams, as in
Active Life? for if we Dream of Thieves and
Murderers, are not we Sensible of the Loss of
our Goods, and of our Bonds, and Wounds?
do we not See our Loss, Feel our Bonds, and the
Smarts and Pains of our Wounds as much as if
we Saw and Suffered Awake? and do not we
Indeavour to Help our Selves? and do not we
Beg for Life, Call for Help, and Strive with
Resistance as much in Dreams as Awake?
though not Vocally, Verbally, Locally, nor
Materially, yet Spiritually, for it is the Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Spirits and not the Senses Gross Bodies or
Parts that Travel into Forein Countries, and
Unknown Lands, and make Voyages by Sea in
Dreams; do not we Hear and See in Dreams
Lightning, Thunder, Wind, Storms, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
Seas, Billows, Waves, Ships, Ship-wracks?
and are not we Drown'd in Dreams? and do
not we see Huge Precipices, Barren Deserts,
Wide Forests, and VVild Beasts and Serpents,
and other hurtfull Creatures, and Indeavour
to Escape and Avoid the Danger? do not we
feel Stinging Serpents and Flies, Striking, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Clawing, Biting Beasts, as Sensibly in
Dreams as Awake? do not we see Flowry
Meddows, Low Vallies, High Hills, Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,
Green Meddows, Grazing Pastures and
Beasts, Clear Springs, Fruitfull Orchards, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:44350:155"/>
Small Villages, Labouring Husbandmen, Great
Cities and Many People? do not we see Light,
Colours, Sun, Moon, Stars, Clouds, Rain, Frost,
Snow, Hail, Shade, Dawning Mornings, and
Closing Evenings, in Dreams, as Awake? do not
we see Fish Swim, Birds Fly, Beasts Run,
VVorms Creep, in Dreams, as Awake? do not
we see our Friends Living, and our Friends Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and those that be Dead, in Dreams, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake?
do not we feel Drought, VVetness,
Heat, Cold, Itching, Scratching, Smarting, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
Biting, Sickness, in Dreams, as Awake?
do not we hear all Warring Sounds, and see all
Warring Actions, and feel all Warring Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
do not we see Courts, Balls, Masks, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Playes, and Pastimes? do not we see Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Instruments, and hear Harmonious Musick,
and Several Tunes, Notes, Airs, Words, Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
distinctly? do not we see Feasts and Bankets,
and do not we Taste the several Meats di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
not only Fish, Flesh, and Fowls, but
distinctly every Sort and Particular Taste of
every Part, also the Ingrediences of the Sauces
and their Particulars in them? and do not we
Taste Bitter, Salt, Sour, Sharp, and Sweet, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
in Dreams, and the several Sorts of
them? and do not we Smell the several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
that are by Art and Nature made, as also
the several Stinks, in Dreams, as Awake? And
for Desires and Ambitions, would we have our
Dead Friends Living, have we not them in
Dreams? or can we See and Converse with
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44350:156"/>
Them, or they to Us, as if they were Alive, but
in Dreams? nay, in Dreams we may Rejoyce
with Them, Feast with Them, Sport and Play
with Them, Ask their Advice, or Give them
Advice, and the like; would we have a Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Mistress, or many several Mistresses of
different Beauties, Behaviours, Births, Fortunes,
Wits, and Humours, have not we them in
Dreams? would we Injoy a Mistress, do not we
so in Dreams? would we be Rich, Noble, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
Valiant, are not we so in Dreams?
would we see the Ruine of our Enemies, do not
we so in Dreams? would we have our Enemies
Dye or be Kill'd, do not they Dye or are Slain in
Dreams? would we have Stately Palaces, have
not we so in Dreams? would we Feed Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
do not we so in Dreams? would we Live
Riotously, do not we so in Dreams? would we
View our Selves, as to see our Faces and Bodies,
do not we so in Dreams? would we Ride, Race,
Hunt, Hawk, and have the like Pastimes and
Exercises, do not we so in Dreams? would we
Win at Carts, do not we so in Dreams? would
we Fight Duells and Battels, and have Victory,
have not we Victory in Dreams? would we
Conquer all the VVorld, do not we so in Dreams?
would we be Emperour to Rule and Govern all
the World, do not we so in Dreams? But as
I said, that there are Pleasing and Delightfull
Dreams, so there are Displeasing and Fearfull
Dreams, and there is as much Trouble, Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Opposition in the Sleepy or Drowsie
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44350:156"/>
World, and as much Discontent, Faction, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
Defamation, Troubles, and the like, in
this Dreaming Life, as there is Method, Order,
Agreement, Praise, Trust, and the like, therein;
yet for all that, this Drowsie World and Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Life is the Best of the three; for can
there be greater Pleasure in the Material World
and Active Life, than Rest to the VVeary
Limbs, and Sleep to the Tired Senses, which
have been Over-power'd with Gross Objects,
which have Laid Heavy Burthens on them? or
can we Injoy any thing so Easily, Freely, Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
without Actual Trouble, as we do in
Dreams? or can we be Quit of all Sorts and
Kinds of Trouble and Labour, but by Sleep?
Wherefore, if Dreams were but more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and of Longer Continuance, and that we
should alwayes Dream Pleasing Dreams, the
Greatest Happiness, Next to the Blessed Life in
Heaven, were to Sleep and Dream, for it would
be much more Pleasant than the Elyfian Fields.
The Next VVorld and Life that were to be
Preferr'd, were the Poetical World, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
Life, but all the Senses are not Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in the Contemplative Life, whereas all the
Senses are as Sensible in the Dreaming Life, as
Awake; the truth is, the Poetical VVorld, and
Contemplative Life, is rather a VVorld for the
Thoughts, and a Life for the Mind, than the
Senses, yet if the Senses were as Sensible in
Contemplation as in Dreams, it would be the
Best Life of all, because it might make the Life
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44350:157"/>
what it Would, and the Pleasures of that Life
to Continue as Long, and to Vary as Oft as it
Thought Good, and for the Poetical World or
rather Worlds, they would be a Delight to
View as well as to Live in.</p>

Sleep to Study, nor Dream so much as to be

Poets Live altogether in their Own Poetical
World, and Contemplative Life; neither are

Faded before an Oration is half Spoken, or else
the Subject of their Oration will be Lost in the

Pleaders at the Barr, nor Preachers in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,

neither can there be a Setled Government in

Piece of a Dream, or instead of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

can there be Wise Counsellours, or
Grave States-men, for their Gray Faces and
Gray Beards may be Chang'd into Monkies
Faces and Goats-Beards, and the Wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours
in the midst of their Serious Advices
may on a sudden Sing a Wanton Song, or else
there may Suddenly appear a Tumultuous
Monster, or a Monstrous Tumult, where in a
great Fright they will Run from their Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bord
or Senate-House; and as for School Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Disputations, they are quite Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and for Lovers, a Hundred to One, that
when a Dreaming Lover is Imbracing a Young
Fair Lady, she Suddenly turns into an Old Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured
VVitch, or for a Plump, Smooth,
Smiling Venetian Courtisan, he Chances to
Imbrace Grim Death's Bare Ratling Bones,
which will Fright a Lover more than a Fair
Mistress can Delight him: And as for Dancing
Balls, and French Fiddles, when the Gallants in
Dreams are Dancing in Smooth Measures, and
with Fair Ladies, and the Musick keeping
Tune to the Dancing Time, on a Sudden the
Courtly Dancers or Dancing Courtiers turn
Topsie Turvy, Dancing with their Heads
Downward, and Heels Upward, a very Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Posture for Fair-faced Ladies; and as
for the Musick, that is quite out of Tune, and
the Fiddle-strings Broken, and the Musicians as
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44350:158"/>
Mad as March-hares, and many other such like
Disorders, Confusions, and Extravagancies, as
Asses Heads or Bulls Horns set on Mens Bodies,
or a Wood-cocks Head to an Asses Tail, as also
Men turn'd to Beasts, Birds, and Fish; also
walking Woods and Trees; but set aside the
Extravagancies, Deformities, and Monstrosities
in Dreams, yet there are more Bad Dreams than
Good, more Fearfull than Delightfull, more
Troublesome than Quiet, more Painfull than
Easie; Wherefore, the Dreaming Life is a
worse Life than any, and the Drowsie or Sleepy
World is only good for Dull, Lasie, Unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Creatures; and as the Dreaming Life is
the Worst, so the Contemplating Life is the
Best, and the Poetical World the Pleasant'st,
for all Wise, Witty, Learn'd, Ingenious, Good,
and Pious men dwell all in the Contemplative
Life, and for the most do Lovers of all Sorts,
especially Amorous Lovers, for they take more
Pleasure to Think of their Mistresses, than to
Speak with their Mistresses, for they can Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Idea of their Mistresses a Long time
with great Delight, whereas they grow Soon
weary of their Real Persons. Thus the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
Life is Best, for true Pleasure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is not in the Senses, but in the Mind, for
Delights and Pleasures are but Passengers
through the Senses, and Inhabitors in the Mind;
besides, whatsoever the Senses have Injoy'd,
Lives in the Mind after their Injoyment, and
though the like is for Pains and Surfeits, yet the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:44350:158"/>
Mind may Fling them out, or if it Fling them
not out, yet it may Fling them aside from Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
it, and though the Mind cannot Satisfie
the Gross Appetites of the Senses, yet those
Satisfactions Live in the Mind, when as the
Senses, though they would, cannot longer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
them; the truth is, that the Senses are
but as Hired Labourers, not Owners, they are
Actors, not Possessors, for the Mind is the Lord
of all, and not only Possessor and Lord of all
the Satisfactions of the Appetites, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and Subjects of the Senses, but it is Lord
of that which the Senses cannot know, being
beyond their Capacity, having a Power of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
Composing, Altering, Changing, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
Continuing, Prolonging, Keeping, Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away, or Destroying whatsoever it Pleases:
All which makes the Contemplative Life the
Best, being Happiest and Pleasant'st; and as for
the Poetical World, it is the most Splendorous
World that is, for it is Composed of all Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities,
Excellencies, Varieties, Numbers, and
Unities: In short, it is a World that is Extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of Infinite Wit, Ingeniosity, Judgement,

whether a Part taken from a Whole, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
a Part after the Dividing or Separating, or
becomes a VVhole of it Self, when it is Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
Some are of the Opinion, that after a Part
is Divided from the Whole, it is no longer a
Part of such a Whole, either of Figure or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but is a Whole of it Self; but if it be as we
believe, that the Bodies of Men shall have a
Resurrection, then it Proves that the several
Divided, Separated, and Dispersed Parts, with
their Joyning and Consistent Motions and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Powers, shall Meet and Joyn to make the
Whole Body; which Proves, that although
Parts be Separated, yet they are Parts of such,
or such a Whole Body or Figure; also they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
distinctly in Nature, as Parts to such a
Body, otherwise they could not Return at the
Resurrection so Readily, to Compose the
VVhole by the Joyning and Uniting of every
Part into One Whole Body. But to Conclude,
as all Creatures are Parts of Infinite Matter, so
the Divided Parts of every Creature are Parts
the Whole Figur, or Body of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>THe Former Student Indeavours to Prove
that Parts pertain to their Wholes, and I
may Indeavour to Prove that Wholes pertain
to Parts, as much as Parts pertain to Wholes,
for there can be no Whole without Parts, nor
no Part without a Whole; but howsoever, all
Parts and Wholes of every Creature were
from all Eternity, and so Consequently shall be
to all Eternity, for as they were, so they will
be; for if such Matter, Motions, Powers,
Creatures, Parts, and Figures, had not been
formerly in Nature, they would, nor could not
have been in Nature's Power at this time to
Produce them: but some might Question what
Nature is? I might Answer, that Nature is Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Motion, and Figure: Then some might
Question, what Power Nature hath? It might
be Answered, Nature hath Power to Create,
and Uncreate: Again, others might Ask, who
gave Nature that Power? It might be Answer'd,
that Natures Power proceeds from Infinite and
Eternity, and that it is not a Gift: and some
may Question, how Infinite and Eternity came
but that is such an Infinite question, as not to
be Answered: for whatsoever is Infinite and
Eternal, is God, which is something that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Described or Conceived, nor Prescribed,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:44350:160"/>
or Bound, for it hath neither Beginning nor
Ending.</p>

the Soul be a Thing or Nothing, a

as not to be a Substance, but, as they call it, an
Incorporeal Thing, because it Alters or Forms
every Thing to its own Likeness, or as it Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for say they, whatsoever the Senses bring
Corporeal, the Soul makes Incorporeal; but it
may be Answered, that Fire makes all Things
or at least most Things or Substances like it Self,
so long as it Works on Combustible Matter;
and shall we say, or can we believe, that Fire is
an Incorporeal Thing, because it Transforms
most Things into its own Likeness? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
my Opinion is, that the Soul is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

and Purest Substance in Nature, which makes
it so apt to Ascend, as to make the Brain the
Residing place; it is the Celestial Part of Man,

               <p>THe Former Student Speaks against Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Disputing, and so in Effect against
Study and Learning; but to what Purpose
should we Study or Learn, if we did not Inform
each other of our Conceptions, or at least our
Opinions, which are Bred or Learned by our
Studies? also what Advantage should VVise,
or Subtil, or Eloquent Orators, or great School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have, if they had not Studious Disciples
to Follow them, Admire, Praise, and Imitate
them? But as it is Honourable to be Learn'd, so
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:44350:161"/>
it is Wise to Learn, for Knowledge is gotten by
Information, and the best Informers are Wise
Books, which Books must first be Read and
Studied, before they can be Understood; also
Arguing and Disputing is a great Increase of
Knowledge, for it Distinguishes Truth from
Falshood, Clears the Understanding, Quickens
the Wit, and Refines the Language; it Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
the Memory, makes the Tongue Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,

not for Study, Learning, and Practice, there
would neither be Religion, Law, nor Justice,
neither would there be Preachers, Pleaders, nor

and Arguments Rejected, men would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Degenerate their Kind from being Men to

Divine, as to Resemble God and Nature, in

a great Confusion, not only in the Schools, but
in the Minds of Men, and not only in the

Religions, than the Son of God, as he was Man,

               <p>OUr Former Fellow in Learning, perswades
us to an Impossibility, as that All Men
should Agree in One Opinion or Belief, but how
can that be? Since by, and in Nature, all Men,
especially Scholars, are so Opinative, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
of their own Wit and Judgement, as that
Every Man thinks himself as VVise as his
Neighbour, and that his Opinion may be as
Probable, and his Belief as well Grounded as
an other Mans; and they have Reason, for,
why may not I think I am as Wise as an Other,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:44350:162"/>
and why may not an Other think himself as
Wise as I, and yet be Both of Different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
and though our Opinions be Different,
yet our Degrees of Judgement may be Equal;
for I do not Perceive, that Nature hath made
any One Man to Transcend all Other men in
VVisdome, for Natures Gifts are General, and
not Particular, and if any One Man should say,
he is Inspired from Heaven, how can we Believe
him, when as we cannot Tell, whether he be so
or not? also it is as Difficult, to find out an other
man to Judge of his Inspiration, as to know
whether he be Inspired. Wherefore, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
all Mankind will never Agree of One
Teacher or Judge, and so not of One Opinion or
Belief.</p>

Indeavour to make or at least to Perswade us to
Believe, that our Rational Souls are Nothing, a

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:44350:162"/>
the Substance of a Body, which is as Impossible,
as to be a Body, and no Body; also they Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make the Matter of the Universe to be
