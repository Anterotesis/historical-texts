         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have been for some time no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
Spectator of those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
Heats, and darling Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which, to the loss of the Common
Cause of Christianity, have long since
spread themselves over the Western
World; and being quite tir'd out
with contemplating the deformity of
this black and melancholly Scene,
I was willing to give my Thoughts
some Diversion, by applying 'em to
such worthy and important Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as might afford some little
ease and serenity even in sullen and
dark times; and make the short life
and leisure I enjoy, to pass away with
some tolerable satisfaction. Riches
and Honour, or the Respect of men,
are pretty popular Beatitudes; and
<pb facs="tcp:95302:5"/>
all sensual complacencies in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, are very sweet and
alluring; but consider'd in their final
issue and event, they do rather amuse
than satisfy the mind, and more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
than caress the Understanding;
so that upon a full and impartial pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of things, unless we can find
out some more solid Principle or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of Security, the condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
will appear sufficiently sad, and
uncomfortable in this World.</p>
                  <p>For man is become a forlorn and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Creature; and tho' he thinks
himself Lord of this Lower World,
yet he's born a poor helpless indigent
Slave; full of wants, of fears, and
disappointments: He fancies indeed,
that he is some God-like Being,
and complements himself with
Divine Epithets, and Titles of
Renown; but they serve only to add
Solemnity to his shame, and advance
the sport and Triumph of his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
Imaginary Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
devour his Spirits, and insult over
<pb facs="tcp:95302:5"/>
his blessings; nay, he is often imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that evil upon himself by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
anticipation, which can but
once befall him in this life. He su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously
trembles at the evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the Stars above; and dreads
every little Meteor of the Night: he
sinks under the apprehension of Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Comets, and ill Aspects of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
while he carries the causes of
his Misery within himself. Could he
but look within, and take a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his own deprav'd Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he would soon discern, That his
Affections and Lusts are the only
false Lights, that misguide and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him; that Pride, Self-Love,
Ambition and Discontent, are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bad Omens, and amazing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies.</p>
                  <p>Neither are his hopes any better
founded, or more proportionate than
his fears; they are not directed by
the inherent worth or quality of the
Object, nor ballanc't by any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
measures; but hurry him vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to precipices and dangers, to
<pb facs="tcp:95302:6"/>
vain Transports and Fantastical Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions.</p>
                  <p>He meets with nothing that can
terminate his desires, or allay the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his restless inclinations: He
proposes indeed strange possessions to
himselef; his thoughts are still busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with imaginary draughts of Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ium,
and Golden Provinces; and
if he could but compass the design
in hand, he could fancy himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall'd
in Paradise again: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
He knows not the vanity of the
thing he admires, 'till the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it has undeceived his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and rectified his notions: And
then he soon finds the disappointment
as certain, as the desire; and he is
now more tormented with the dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and loss, than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with the Expestation.</p>
                  <p>Thus (as <hi>David</hi> phraseth it) Man
walks in a vain Shadow, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieteth
himself in vain: He falls
in Love, enjoys, and abhors; he
chooses and hates the same thing:
'Tis true, his reason commands him
<pb facs="tcp:95302:6"/>
to be contented, happy, and composed
in every condition of Life; and yet
he finds by experience, he cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e so
in any; but, as if he were still ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rast
with some Malignant Distemper,
he lies changing and tossing from side
to side, between undue Objects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Desires. One while perhaps,
through the unhappy Instinct of his
Original Pride, he effects the great
and venerable name of Philosopher,
of Lord and Master over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
World: He considers with
himself that a Philosophical Life, and
insight into Nature, is one of the Nob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
Badges of true Honour, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Perfection and most useful Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n adorn a Rational
Creature: But finding at length, that
this Lamp within him, serves only to
discover those Errors and mistakes,
that before lay hidden and unobserv'd;
perceiving also, that the more he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands,
the more he sees his own
Errors, and the greatest knowledge he
has hitherto acquir'd, serves only to
make him sensible that he wants it;
<pb facs="tcp:95302:7"/>
his discontent begins proportionably to
increase with his acquisitions, and his
Hopes are driven to downright des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</p>
                  <p>Besides, he observes that all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is attended with great Toil and
Vexation; with ungrateful relishes,
and many painful Impressions; That
each single Science will cost him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Pang in the Performance; and
that much Study is a weariness to the
Flesh. He feels his Soul extended, as
it were, upon a Rack, and all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
suffering a Convulsion; and
as if he had adopted the Womans Curse
also, and Contracted the whole Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
within himself; he Travails with
Pain, and brings forth with sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Being thus tir'd out with his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
drudgery, in the next place per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
he betakes himself to Morality
and Religion; he has often been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
at the sight of some brave and
Virtuous Exploits; and resolves to
make such delightful Scenes, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
subject and entertainment of his
Thoughts. He has heard of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95302:7"/>
and other celebrated Worthies, that
illustrated and Adorned the Heathen
Martyrology; he loves and even huggs
the remembrance of 'em, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
'em good and happy among Men.
But alas! How vanishing are such Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Raptures, such Religious Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
How sweet and perswasive are
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se Baits and Temptations, that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the Sinner another way? How
frail is Nature? How encroaching
is Error? How weak is resolution?
How strong is Passion and Lust? How
soon does the Man that had form'd such
fine and curious Ideas of Religion and
Virtue begin to falter and languish
in his Duty, when he is brought forth
to action, or engaged in a passive vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the Truth? How is his Soul
put into an uproar, at the least touch
or appearance of Evil, while his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Senses dispute the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Cause, and his Rational
Faculty stands by and unconcern'd?
The Man confesses, that his obligation
indeed is very great, but yet it is
cruel too: 'Tis good, but yet not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
<pb facs="tcp:95302:8"/>
'tis just, but yet indiscreet;
and therefore tho' he can sometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to a single Act of Piety, yet
to gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

goodness, is a talk and torture
not to be endur'd.</p>
                  <p>And now he begins to reflect a little
upon the common Genius and Fashion
of the World; and accutely observes
that the general Bent and Vote of
Mankind is directed another way:
And why should he aspire to a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
of knowledge beyond his Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
or pretend to be a wiser, or a better
Man than they? Nay he has more
nicely observ'd, that a down-right
simplicity, regularity and decorum of
words and Actions, do's but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the good Man to the title of
a Fool, and expose him to Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
beggery and contempt: That
dissimulation and baseness are the
nearest steps and ascent to dignity,

Subject, this devout and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
Employment; he thinks it
high time to bid farewell to the World,
as it was fashion'd and design'd by God;
and to go into the same, as 'tis new
modell'd and tranform'd by the pride
and artifice of Man: His Affections
have hitherto been confin'd, as it were,
to the Cell and Cloyster; and yet he
found it hard to keep 'em chaste and
unspotted of the World: but now,
like <hi>Dinah,</hi> they must go abroad to
see and visit the Daughters of the
Land: His Thoughts are now let
loose to all the tempting varieties,
all the charms and attractives of
the sensitive World: He studies
all the meritorious Arts of Flattery
and Persuasion, and rallies together
all the force and vigour of his soul
and body to greet the opportunities
of secular Greatness: He courts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
no longer as a Mistress, and out
of Love; but makes use of her as a
Hand-maid, to serve his turn and
advantage: sometimes we find him
<pb facs="tcp:95302:9"/>
in the House of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> and
sometimes in the Temple; one while
he seems to worship God, and yet when
a good occasion doe's invite, he can
readily bow the knee to <hi>Baal:</hi> And
at another time, he holds it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the design in hand, to hover
in a dark Neutrality between both.</p>

give a more full and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive

contracted within the compass of
one Man; I mean the puissant and
Heroical Author of the late <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of DENMARK;</hi> who, while
he pretends to new Lights and
Discoveries, and more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Refinements; is himself as great
an instance, as I know, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
of of Humane Nature.
He seems to carry at once an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Chair, and a High Court of
Justice within the narrow circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of his Brain; fancies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be wiser than the Clergy,
both Universities, the King and
Parliament to boot; and there is
nothing extraordinary, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or sacred, but what he has
perverted by a knackish and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Construction: And all this
he has done under the specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the All-attoning Freedom
of the Subject, and masque of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Liberty; such a Liberty I
suppose, and 'twill appear by the
sequel, as happen'd heretofore,
when <hi>there was no King in</hi> Israel,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95302:10"/>
                     <hi>and every Man did that which was
right in his own Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in order to carry on this
<hi>Antimonarchical Project,</hi> and that
Affairs may go on in true <hi>Fanatical
Decorum,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis first necessary, That the
Clergy should be defam'd, and
blacken'd with invidious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
These are the main support,
and known Pillars of the Throne:
And therefore that the one may be
more advantagiously pull'd down,
it is held convenient by the <hi>choice
and secret ones,</hi> to run a Tilt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction against the other.
This was the exact method of the
Saints in the days of Civil Broils
and Desolation; when they were
carrying on the luscious Work
and blessed Trade of Sacriledge and
Plunder: Every Loyal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Minister was render'd as
Antichristian, and vile a piece of
Formality, as a Dancing-Master
was at <hi>Geneva,</hi> at the beginning
of the Reformation; and he that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95302:11"/>
was blest with a comfortable and
plump Benifice, was in as Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Danger as the <hi>Fat-man</hi> in
<hi>London-Derry.</hi> These things are
too universally known, and infam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to be any longer insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Let us see how near our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer's</hi>
Copy approaches the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> The Ecclesiasticks of most
Religions, who are allowed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

                  </p>
                  <p>As some of the <hi>well affected</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
blended Popery and Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
together, that they might the
better destroy both under one
Denomination; so here the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
and conforming Clergy are
involv'd in the same condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and none seem excepted but
the new Mechanical Priest-hood.
'Twould have been much more
Civil and ingenious, had he cry'd

out in a Language of a Modern
Poet, <hi>That Priests of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's

                  </p>
                  <p>This is a very black and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
charge; and only lets us
understand that Travellers may
talk by Authority: I do inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
own, that I know not
one Quality more unbecoming a
Man, that aspires to true Christian
Wisdom and Philosophy, than an
immoderate thirst after Wealth
and Dignity; and may he be
branded with the Name of <hi>Judas</hi>
(for me) that sets too high a value
upon this glittering insignificant
Lumber of the World, and dare's
grasp at more than an Honourable
Maintainance, which the Scripture
allows, but our <hi>Prefacer</hi> seems to
deny. 'Twas one main scope of
the Evangelical Writings, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
in us an inordinate Love
of all Earthly Things; and so long
as the Primitive Fervours did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
all such unchaste and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Desires were restrain'd and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95302:12"/>
mortified: But when the love of
the World began to be advanc't to
an undue pitch, the love of God
was proportionably abated, and
the mystery of Godliness was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chang'd into the Mammon of
Iniquity. When the Episcopal
Office, which was at first account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a degree of Martyrdom, was
baited with Honours and Wealthy
Accommodations, it became the
more dangerous thereby; and tho
some good Men foresaw the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and declin'd the Charge,
yet others, we find, could not be
so perfectly consecrated as to
apprehend it. And as Riches en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
so did Mens Affections too;
till (as <hi>Platina</hi> himself tells us) The
Church was defac't with riotous
Pomp, and sordid Luxury; it lookt
more like a dissolute Wanton than
the holy Spouse of Christ: Nay,
to so prodigious a height was the
Ecclesiastical Grandeur advanc't
towards the latter end of the 4<hi>th.</hi>
Century, that it gave occasion to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95302:12"/>
this Sarcastical Saying of a heathen
Consul, <hi>Make me but Bishop of</hi> Rome,
<hi>and I will strait turn Christian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the days of darkness
were at hand, when the Roman
Clergy, however illiterate (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the mode and genius of the
Times) wanted not subtilty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their secular Designs: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
gainful Articles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
Canons were forg'd, and
Donations pretended, to promote
the Royal Splendor of the Church,
and abett the Pope's unlimited
Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>But do our English Clergy hold
any meer pecuniary Doctrines,
honorary Articles, or chargeable
Propositions? If our Author will
be so hardy to assert this, and so
acute to prove his Assertion, I do
solemnly promise, That (by way
of Pennance and Mortification for
my Mistake,) I will get all Mr.
P—<hi>n's</hi> and Mr. <hi>B—r's</hi> Books by
heart; a task not to be perform'd
standing upon one leg, and when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95302:13"/>
'tis done, cannot much improve
the Christian or the Schollar.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whatever degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of this kind may be found among
some few (which ought not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to reflect upon the whole
Order) must be ascrib'd to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
particularity of Temper, to
the weaknesses of Old Age, or
some other such like Infirmity;
when the Intellectual Fire begins
to grow weak and languishing, and
the Divine Particle is almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd.
For (to speak in the stile
of the Learned <hi>Annotator</hi> upon <hi>Lux
Orient.</hi>) <q>The Constitution of
Youth, in those that have not an
unhappy Nativity, is far more
Heavenly and Angelical, than that
of more grown Age, in which the
Spirit of the world is more usually
awaken'd; men then begin to be
wholly intent to get Wealth and
Riches, to enlarge their Interests
by the friendship of great Persons,
and to hunt after Dignities and
Preferments, Honours and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95302:13"/>
in Church and State:
And so those more heavenly and
divine Sentiments through dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use,
and the presence of more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Impressions are laid asleep,
and their Spirits thicken'd and
clouded with the gross Fumes and
Steams that arise from the desire
of earthly things; and it may
so fall out, if there be not speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
care taken, that this mud
which they have drawn in by
their coarse Desires, may come to
that opaque hardness and incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
that their Terrestrial
Body may prove a real Dungeon,
and cast 'em into an utter oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their chiefest concerns in
another State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If that sacred Character, which
adorns and distinguishes the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Clergy, weigh little
with our Prefacer; yet, methinks,
that Knowledge which (as will
appear anon) doe's a little distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
'em from the generality of
Canting Travellers, should awe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95302:14"/>
him into some degree of deference
and respect: If he were actually
as deep a Padder in Politicks as he
would seem, he would fear to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
an Order of Men, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of which could give him just
occasion to hang down the head,
to blush, and to look sillily. But we
find by daily experience, that as
there is a Superiority of Education
and Wit, as well as of Authority;
so 'tis as natural to sordid and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Wretches to run a-tilt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Betters in Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as 'tis to others to despise Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and speak evil of Dignities.</p>
                  <p>Here let the generous Reader
give me leave to make a stand a
while, and complain a little of the
hard Fate of Learning in this Age:
Suppose a Man has entertain'd and
polisht his Mind and rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
with the Works of those
Ancients, that rescu'd and preserv'd
their natural Reason and Religion,
amidst all the wildnesses of Pagan
Darkness and Coufusion (such as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95302:14"/>
                     <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Euripides, AEschylus,

and Perfective Discourses of

and Philosophers; let him add to
all these the Pious and Seraphical
Discourses of the Fathers; be able
to recite and confute all Heresies
from <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>

                  <p>This Passage, if consider'd in
it's just and proper connexion and
dependance, seems only to relate
to the ill management of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical
Priesthood: But I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
persuaded by Reasons obvious
enough, that he designs here to
stab the Canonical Priest-hood in
general; and that he would be
thus understood by common and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95302:15"/>
injudicious Readers. 'Tis hard and
ill fencing with an Enemy that
looks a-squint; and such a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
is truly applicable to a great
part of this rambling Preface. This
sort of doubtful or double meaning
has done far worse execution than
the double Sword of the Bishops,
which this tender Gentleman seems
so much afraid of; and while some
white ey'd Jugglers have been rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making faces against Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
and the Man of Sin; The
Church of <hi>England</hi> has fall'n a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
as well as unlamented Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
And here I shall observe,
That our Prefacer is not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly
Vain and Romantick in
his Projections, but commits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Blunders in the management
of 'em too: The two choice things
which he chiefly seems to adore,
and exalt above the King and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that is sacred, are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
and Old Philosophers; yet
the former, even of these, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
upon the Stage, acting like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95302:16"/>
Madmen out of a Principle of
punctilious Baseness: and to render
'em the more contemptible and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
he shuffles them and the
Clergy into one foolish and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
Plot, A Plot! to undoe
themselves and their Posterity.
Account, <hi>pag.</hi> 49. 50. The latter,
while he pretends to celebrate
their Vertues, he represents as a
vile Rout of Libertines and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists;
<hi>For,</hi> says he, speaking of
the Philosophers,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> Sometimes they made use
of pious Cheats, as Elizian Fields,
and an assurance of future Happiness,
if they dyed in the cause of their
Country; and even deceiv'd their

                  <p>Here again the Poet seems more
ingenuous, and a better <hi>Religioso</hi>
of the Two: For</p>

                  <p>Such pretty and quaint Sayings
are neither better nor worse than
a dull insipid Reflection upon the

for the better regulation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95302:17"/>
of human Life; adding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
That if the people industrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adher'd to 'em, they should pass
out of this into the other invisible
World, in which they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
all manner of intellectual Joy
and Satisfaction. This has ever
been the Vote of Nations, and the
common bent of the rational Frame
of Man; and we need not fly to
<hi>Confutius,</hi> and the polish't Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
of <hi>China</hi> for discovery of
that, of which the Historys of
<hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> of the most
rude and unciviliz'd Nations may
sufficiently inform us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis surely ominous, in a more
than ordinary sense, to play with
Names and Persons that are sacred;
The Heathen could observe, That
they, who can do such things,
intimate, if it were in their power,
they would pull <hi>Jupiter</hi> out of his
Throne: And 'tis eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
that to vilify the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,

but a lesser kind of Profaneness, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95302:17"/>
a suspicious Fore-runner of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Blasphemy and Atheism.</p>
                  <p>Indeed 'tis a matter of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Observation, that the mind
of every Sinner at first is very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
soft, and impressive; and
consequently sin must sit very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom
and uneasy upon him, in
that he contradicts his natural <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi>
and the distinguishing taste
of good and evil, which he brought
with him into the World: 'Tis
no pleasant Harmony to hear the
loud voice of Infamy and Reproach
resounding and hallowing in his
Ears; 'tis no easy thing to suppress
the clamours of a guilty Conscience,
which are a constant Herald pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
an avenging God unto
his Soul: In this desperate Junct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
some method must be found
out, either to mince the Evil, or
to mitigate the pain some other
way; for he cannot live at ease
upon this Rack, he cannot lye down
with this Vulture at his Bosom:
The modish Entertainments of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95302:18"/>
Musick and Jovial Airs, are no
everlasting Diversions; he must
sometimes converse with Darkness
and lonely Shades; and then a
sharp and severe recollection is the
sad Entertainment of his solitude
and retirement: To tell him of
Repentance and a penetrating sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for sin past, were but to
wound him more; this austere
Remedy of Evangelical Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is more unsupportable to
him than the Disease: Having
therefore resolv'd to gratify the
belov'd <hi>Herodias</hi> of his Breast, some
Charm or Stratagem must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to bring the sinner to a
reconcilement with himself: And
having heard of a certain Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
that can stifle the Murmurs
and Complaints of Conscience with
wonderful Reasons and infallible
Demonstrations; I say, having his
mind thus tinctur'd with this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
conceit, he swallows down
readily the <hi>Arcanums</hi> and <hi>Nostrums</hi>
of this profound Oracle, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95302:18"/>
at once both his Proselyte
and his Slave.</p>
                  <p>And now he is arriv'd with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
satisfaction at the School of
Atheism, where he looks back
with contempt upon the former

he has shook hands with his Bible

And what is Heaven, but a meer

To what end was it made, since
we shall all be as tho we had

the pravity of his Disposition. This
is the true Account of his most
exalted Faith, and a Summary of
his Political Creed.</p>
                  <p>So desperate is the Case of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Reason, when Pride has
crept into the Chair, or Affections
sway the Scepter; when a Man
devotes himself to the Service of
the World, no inbred Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances
of Conscience can affect,
no Schools of Piety or Learning
can reclaim him: he takes not up
his Profession, upon any wise or
good consideration, but upon some
Principle of Interest, or false
Punctilio of Honour, and so turns
his Oratory into a Court or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95302:19"/>
His Religion is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
an Act of his Soul, but the
Exercise of his Body, the meer

and Humour; while Conscience
perhaps, like some goodly Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
is plac't as superintendent
over all the Turnings and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Fancy: And when
Interest is back't with this sacred

Vogue and Authority: It
can say to this man, Go, and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
to another, Come, and he

Do this, and he doth it. He that
considers things round about him,
and observes a little these contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Enormities of the Christian
State, will be apt to compassionate
the blind Devotions of those delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

To talk of the Honour, Duty, and

                  <p>But since the Example and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Philosophers is own'd
to be so Canonical and Sacred, I
could heartily wish our <hi>Politician</hi>

a little <hi>their</hi> Noble Sentiments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the danger of Ambitious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,
and Vanity of secular
Greatness: This wou'd help,
perhaps, to lay some restraint upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95302:21"/>
the busy and mercurial Tempers
of the Age, and check the pert Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
or impetus of their Blood and
Spirits: Now, a consideration or
prospect of the mutability and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of secular Grandeur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
the Philosophers to be grave
and sententious, as well as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
to be satyrical, upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
They lookt upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
business of the World, as too
coarse and material for the abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Purity of their Thoughts, and
likewise repugnant to that true se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
of Mind, wherein the height
of Felicity doe's consist; and tho
some of 'em were willing to
accept of the Goods of Fortune, if
they chanc't to fall in their way,
yet they would not creep and fawn,
or <hi>Adorare Vulgus, &amp; projicere oscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
(as <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes of <hi>Salvius
Otho</hi>) in order to their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
They thought necessity
might subject a man to these lower
Offices of life, but never esteem'd
'em as matter of choice, or any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95302:21"/>
anxious pursuit. Accordingly we
find 'em insisting copiously upon
the dispraise of those little and fine
things, which the world calls great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and some of the <hi>Platonists</hi>
thought the whole Corporeal or
visible World, by reason of its poor
and diminutive Entity, beneath
the search of elevated Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>There are many that account a
glittering Title little less than an
<hi>Apotheosis,</hi> and a long Train of Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
a kind of Glorification:
And on the other side, there are
those who think, that all this pomp
and noise is but a glorious clog and
burden to the Mind; that a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Servants are rather Spies
than Attendants, and not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Guards as Executioners; I
think the latter is at least the more
plausible Folly of the two; methinks
there's a pleasant and delightful
Harmony, beyond all the charming

                  <p>For suppose a man exalted and
fixt in a shining Orb, and, as he
sancies himself, giving Light to
others with his borrow'd Glory;
Behold the Man surrounded with
all the State and Grandeur, which
his hopes could propound or his
ambition could desire: May we
now salute him by the Name of
Fortunate, call him Happy, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
him great? No: The
more he commands the more he is
a Slave; he is a fetter'd Vassel to
the Tyranny of his Lusts, and he
is to be look't upon as a Malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
bound in Chains: He feels a
pain amidst all his gaudy Diversions,
and wants that quiet and repose of
Mind, which may be found in a
shady and obscure Retirement;
and that generous Poverty, those
magnificent Rags, wherein true

Honour and Honesty are enthron'd,
can supply the possessor with more

and loss of time which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this Station, his fears of futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

some sharp allay; he has doubtless
heard of the sad instability of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
Affairs, of their various Turns,
and hasty Revolutions: Every
slight proverbial Talk about the
Inconstancy of Fortune, puts him
into an Agony, and makes him
tremble with foreboding Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:

all Donations and Favours of this

were only a glorious Transcript of
this Original.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prefacer</hi> seems to have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous'd
the Doctrine of the <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>

Christ's Kingdom in this world,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95302:26"/>
represents that Notion as a design
or artifice of the Roman Clergy, to
support their secular Greatness:
But how Christ's Kingdom upon
Earth should be a Popish Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to advance ambitious Ends,
when this Doctrine was first
preached by our Saviour himself,
afterwards by his immediate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and propagated by succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Apostolical Men in the Ages
of Persecution; is a mysterious
Riddle which I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
But this State of Affliction
was not to be perpetual and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable;
for when Kings should
become Nursing Fathers of the
Church, the Evangelical Priesthood
was to make a more Glorious Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in the World: St. <hi>Peter</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
a Royal Priesthood; and
this is so far from carrying a new

the Cloud and Veil, to distinguish
nicely betwixt the Prosperous and
Brave, the Bad and the Unfortunate,
was thought a task that requir'd a
great and unwearied industry, a
penetrating Judgment, a sublime
Learning, an impartial Reason, and
other extraordinary Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Undertaker. But now
each Youthful or Grey-headed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
aspires to the Historical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
'tis but rambling a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Globe, casting his eyes
around, and travelling till he is
tired; and then he shall lye down,
fall into Dreams and Visions, and
rise up an illuminated Historian in
a moment: and not contented to
take the Office out of the Rightful
Hands, he fancies it to be his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Province to expose the Sacred
Office to contempt, and ridicule
the Priesthood; like the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that perpetually haunts him;
he seeks, but can find no rest: And

that worm of impertinence that is

Step towards the carrying on an

a senseless pother and noise about

was heretofore the Logick of the

me here, in this Grand Point, out
of a Formal and affected Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty:

been almost as applicable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
in this Case. All which I
mention, because we are told in
<hi>Pref. Every one ought to know how
great the Rights of the People were
very lately in the Elective King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95302:39"/>
of</hi> Sweden <hi>and</hi> Danmark. As
if, in order to carry on the Grand
Intrigue, the lowest of the People
amongst us ought to assume the
same Rights: But he goes on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> The Estates of the Realm
being convened to that intent, were to

                  <p>This looks like a Lucid Interval
in our Author; &amp; I would trust him
alone, if I knew he could stop here:
But I find that good humour is as
short and vanishing with him, as
Phrenzy is with more Sweet and
happy Complexions. Nay he's
grown more furious and implacable
than he was before; as if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to rally with the greater
force; for see how he raves and
hectors on a sudden.</p>
                  <p>If after such a choice they found
themselves mistaken, and that they
had advanc't, a cruel, vitious, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
Covetous, or wastful Person;
they frequently deposed him, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
banished, sometimes destroy'd

Legally contended with, they dispatch't
him without any more Ceremony, the

                  <p>Now add to his the precedent
Remark, <hi>viz. Every one ought to
know</hi> &amp;c. And the whole carries
with it a pretty stabbing Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;
a brave Heroical Suggestion,
becoming the Dignity &amp; Grandeur
of a Free-born Subject, that owes
small manners and Allegiance to his
Prince.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certainly a very bitter ill
natur'd cur, that growls while he

                     <hi>Pref.</hi> The Books that are left us of
the Antients are full of Doctrines,
Sentences, and Examples, exhorting
to the conservation or recovery of the

                  <p>Here he would fain shelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
again under the authority of
the Antients; who (as I have
shewn before) have already turn'd
him out of their Society, for his
Insufficiency and false Accusations.
The Antients ne're dream't of such
a Liberty as he would inculcate;
since't was the main design of their
Phylosophy, to curb all irregular
sallies of our Nature, and bound
our Appetites with a prudential
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95302:40"/>
restraint. <hi>Publick Liberty</hi> in the
mouth of a Flaming Enthusiastick
<hi>Zealot,</hi> is, like a naked Sword in

dangerous and destructive; and
the one should no more be trusted
alone without a limitation, than
the other without a Scabbard. 'Tis
a Licence to Kick, Bite, Swear,
and play the Libertine thro' all
the various Scenes of carnality and
lust; to be Covetous, and (what's
worse) to Rebel for Conscience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake,
Write Treason <hi>Directly</hi> or
<hi>Indirectly,</hi> and cheat our neighbour
with a zealous twinkling of the
Eye, or in saying of a Prayer.
He that is <hi>Free-born,</hi> is likewise
born in a State of Subjection to
Laws; and though by his Birth-Right
he's Entitled to certain
Priviledges and Civil Rights, yet
he is also Entitled to some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
measures of obedience, as he's
a Subject: And whosoever talks
so loftily of the one, and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
conceals the other; doe's but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95302:41"/>
abuse the Multitude into danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sentiments, with a nonsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
jingle of Words; and is so far
from being a <hi>True</hi> English Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
that he's a down-right shuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Impostor.</p>
                  <p>Again, tho the <hi>Conservation</hi> of
<hi>Publick Liberty</hi> (which he so feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
talks of) may admit a soft
and easy Interpretation; yet to talk
of the <hi>Recovery</hi> of it <hi>at this time</hi> (as
if it were totally lost) seems to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with it an ill-natur'd <hi>Republican

much good to the publick: But
then (as he is cunning enough to

Usurpation) has made use of this
instance to grace his Insolent Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs;
yet <hi>R. F.</hi> (no great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to Modesty, or Assertor of
Kingly Government) has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
enough to make the least
Apology for the Fact, but exposes
<hi>Cicero</hi> for his Justification of the
Villany: Adding withal, <hi>Had we
nothing but the Sentiments of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
to conduct us in our Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
no Prince could be secure.</hi> Of
Moral Vertue and Grace, <hi>p.</hi> 229.</p>
                  <p>I must freely own, That I could
never contemplate the Fate of
<hi>Caesar,</hi> without a mixture of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
horror and detestation; I
consider, that Men of the most
bright and eminent Station and
Character, have their Faults and
Deviations; and then 'tis custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
with mean and obnoxious
persons, to make their invidious
Remarks and Observations: If
the lesser Lights digress, the world
is little concern'd; but should the
Sun make a false step, the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95302:44"/>
of Mankind would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
fear a bad Omen and Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
But whatever faults lay
mingled with <hi>Caesar's</hi> Vertues,
<hi>Brutus</hi> must still be his equal; If
<hi>Caesar</hi> was ambitious, <hi>Brutus</hi> was
too aspiring: If <hi>Caesar</hi> was Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
<hi>Brutus</hi> was ungrateful; and
therefore we have in him an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment
of all Iniquity. This
celebrated Action was not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Piety to his Country (the
everlasting pretence of Villains in
such cases) but of a wretched Pride,
Popularity, and Affectation: In
the Death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> at least, we
may behold all the Lineaments of
a Gallant and Brave Soul, while in
the Action of <hi>Brutus</hi> we see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but cowardly Insult, and all
the lamentable Marks of a grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and abject Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Now, there is nothing gives a
more deadly wound to a great and
ingenuous Mind, than Desertion
in time of Extremity, and a secret
treacherous Blow, from the Party
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95302:45"/>
whom we love. They that have
courted Danger in all its Images
and Forms, and have been glad
to meet an open generous Enemy
in the Field; have grown pale, and
trembled at the sight of a sneaking
Adversary, under the false Colours
of a Friend: This was the Case
of <hi>Caesar</hi> at his last hour; when
surrounded with Assassines of
meaner Note, he struggled with
'em like a Lyon in the Toyle, and
look't Great, as when he Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in the Field: But when
<hi>Brutus</hi> at length, his unkind <hi>Brutus,</hi>
joyn'd with the Conspirators;
when that Arm which ought to
have been weilded in his Defence,
was stretch'd forth against his life;
The Great Man grew tame and
feeble in a moment, &amp; Ingratitude
piere't deeper than all the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Death.</p>
                  <p>But no wonder that he should
espouse this Villanous Cause, who
can sport himself with the names
of Christian Kings, and trample
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95302:45"/>
upon the Ashes of our own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Monarchs: For he tells
us, <hi>'Tis a true, though but a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
reflection, that our late Kings
half undid us, and bred us up as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Spirited as they could</hi>—&amp;c.
Which piece of disingenious cant,
sounds like the Famous <hi>Raree
Show,</hi> in which, one King is charg'd
with,
<q>
                        <l>Fleecing England's Flocks,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor do I wonder that a man
of his stern temper and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should make so bold with the
dead, since 'tis his Talent and
Principle to bid defiance to living
Princes, <hi>to despise their smiles and
frowns, nay reproach and death it
self, if they stand between him and
what he shall call his Duty.</hi> All
which is precisely <hi>Almanzor</hi> the
Second part; for thus that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
and Tempestuous Bravo
Vaunts it to a King's face:
<q>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95302:46"/>
                        <l>No man has more contempt than I of breath,</l>
                        <l>But whence hast thou the pow'r to give me Death?</l>
                        <l>Obey'd as Soveraign by thy Subjects be,</l>
                        <l>But know that I alone am King of me.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is certainly some Civil
deference and submission due to
Crown'd Heads, though Kings
should look angry and frown with
a cause: 'Tis thought an excess
even of Poetical Licence in <hi>Homer,</hi>
that he represents <hi>Achilles</hi> sawcy
to his Superior, and <hi>dispising the
Smiles and Frowns</hi> of <hi>Agamemnon.</hi>
The world must needs be grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a fine pass, when a man,
that's made up of Burlesque, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
Gallimaufry and Raree
Show, shall set up for a Critick
and Tutor to a whole Nation.
As for my part, I am so far from
thinking him fit or capable to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95302:46"/>
Read Lectures of Policy for the
improvement of the Community,
that I cannot find he has made
any tolierable Improvement of
himself. I will as soon believe,
that the whole Corporeal World
in a <hi>wise Animal</hi> (as some of the
Antients conceiv'd) as think him
qualified to be <hi>Governour</hi> to a
Prince. I see nothing in him like
clear <hi>Intellectual preception; Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
is the Noblest and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
faculty about him; his <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
is the meer effect of distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and his <hi>Solidity</hi> lies no deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than his Scull. His <hi>Heroical</hi>
flights are nothing but the Spleen;
and the <hi>Height</hi> of his <hi>Puissance,</hi>
like the <hi>courage of a Rat,</hi> consists
in a deprav'd and irregular fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Blood and Spirits;
and I dare be bold to prophecy,
if his <hi>Maxims</hi> succeed, that we
must shortly make enquiry into
<hi>New-gate</hi> and <hi>Bride-well</hi> for <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Spirited
Gentlemen,</hi> and ransack
<hi>Bedlam</hi> for <hi>Hero's.</hi>

which his Majesty has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
us by his accession to the Crown,
that we now make a greater figure
in the World than formerly.</p>
                  <p>This look like a Wonderful
change indeed; a conversion in an
Instant: Yet all that I can gather
from it is this, That <hi>Judas</hi> can still
Kiss, dispisers of Magistracy can still
<hi>Address,</hi> the Jesuit can Fawn, and
Whores and Pick-Pockets <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.</hi>
'Tis plain from what we
have already said, that all this
is Pageantry and Scorn, and not
spoken out of a Loyal intention
to his Majesty, but meer service
to himself: For can he be a
Friend to his present Majesty,
that insists so studiously (and scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
at this time) upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Prerogative of dispatching
Kings; and tells us Emphatically
we ought to take notice of it?
Can he be a Friend to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Majesty, that by aspersing
the Memories of wise and good
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95302:47"/>
natur'd Princes, libells even Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy
it self? Can he be a good
Subject, or Friend to Monarchy,
that gilds o're the memory of <hi>A.
Sydney (that rare Arcadian Hero)</hi> that
Died a Martyr for the <hi>Good Old
Cause,</hi> by his own Dying confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and urg'd a Fanatical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in i'ts Defence? No: the
Antimonarchical ears peep thro'
the borrow'd Skin; such a cloak
as this is too trite and thin to hide
the <hi>Republican Brother.</hi> So long as
such loose Diabolical Principles are
asserted with a magisterial air and
haughtiness, and prest with stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
hints and innuendo's; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixtures,
of a softer and finer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect
and phrase, will appear but
Insignificant and Artificial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
like <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> in the
days of Sequestration; and are no
more to be valued than some <hi>treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous
Addresses</hi> to the <hi>late King,</hi>
which were as truly base and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
(if possible) as the Antient
vote of <hi>non Addresses</hi> to his Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:95302:48"/>And here I might justly enough
take occasion to lament the <hi>Fate,</hi>
as well as admire the Glory of puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

These are the dangerous

and therefore 'tis held convenient,

When the Sweating Teachers, after

                  <p>Here is a plain Transcript of
the <hi>Old Reforming Humour;</hi> but
without the reason, genius, and
abilities of the <hi>more Learned Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator:</hi>
For the Author of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen</hi>
did not meerly find fault,
censure and talk magisterially;
but, with a seeming modesty (a
Quality unknown to our <hi>new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulator,</hi>)
he confesses 'tis far more
easie to demolish, than to erect a
complete Structure; especially for
a single person of a mean Talent:
And after he had offer'd some plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95302:50"/>
Expedients for a rectification
of Logick, Metaphysicks, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
Mathematicks and Natural
Philophy; he owns himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to many Errors; and
hopes that better and more Able
Pens will help to supply his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Prefacer's</hi> Talent lies
wholly in <hi>Spanish</hi> downright <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo;</hi>
and if he can but cast a mist
before Vulgar Eyes, he takes no
care to understand what he affirms,
nor can he move his Pen the breadth
of one Letter towards the Proof of
what he asserts.</p>
                  <p>I heartily wish (for a perfect cure
of his Distemper'd Imagination,) he
would once take heart, and visit
our Universities, at some time of
publick Festivity; when Juglers,
Mountebanks, Jack-puddings, and
Punchianello, divert the whole
Town with their wonders; and
try what a stately Figure he could
make.</p>

whose Curiosity led him to visit

little less than <hi>Divine Honours</hi> for
his <hi>out-side</hi> Qualifications; he went
pompously attended, was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dress't and garnish't, and
took especial care to bow in the
right place; least by ducking the
head a little immethodically, and
moving the hand or leg maladroit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he should seem to spoil the
Honour of his Family. But he
was soon convinc't of his genteel

Remarks of the ingenious <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists;</hi>
who, though they were well
skill'd in all the <hi>Arts</hi> of Behaviour
and Conversation, yet never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
these <hi>Inferior Morals</hi> to
empty Noise and Formality; but
made use of 'em to adorn and set
off <hi>Essential</hi> Goodness: They
thought a decent simplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to be the best and purest gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility;
and a generous bent and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95302:51"/>
inclination to do good, the truest
Grandeur and Magnificence.</p>
                  <p>I am almost persuaded, That
our <hi>New Regulator</hi> would meet with
the same Fate, at least the same
means of <hi>Conversion,</hi> if he would
but deseend to Travel, and shew
himself amongst our Academical
Sages. What a woful and sorry
wight must he appear (with his
new Models, Foreign Experiments,
and Idea's of Government, with
other Chimerical Bawbles) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
a Learn'd and Venerable
Assembly? Nay, how would each
<hi>Junior</hi> Sophister (lately dismiss't

sneak, beg Pardon, and Repent, in
the strength of <hi>Hesiod</hi> and <hi>Homer?</hi>

<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Acumen,</hi> that he may,
even now, be read with singular
Advantage, by those that apply
themselves to Politicks, and Moral
Philosophy. The latter (as <hi>Rapin</hi>
thinks) had the vastest, sublimest,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95302:52"/>
and most universal Genius that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was: 'Twas by his Poems
that all the Worthies of Antiquity
were form'd: From hence the
Lawgivers took the first Plat-form
of the Laws they gave to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
The Founders of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
and Common-Wealths from
hence took the Model of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
Hence the Philosophers
found the first Principles of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which they have taught the
People: Hence King's and Princes
have learn't the Art to govern, and
Captains to form a Battel, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp

to fight and to gain Victories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have read of one <hi>Argentine,</hi> a
Schollar of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who about <hi>A.D.</hi>
1407. had the confidence to go to
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> upon no other Errand,
but to challenge the whole Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to Dispute; and he is justly
branded with the Character of
impudence to succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
And yet, as blustering and
impudent as he was, he was tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-fronted
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95302:52"/>
and bashful in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for we have now met with
one, that has the face and assurance
to defy both Universities; nay,
condemn 'em too without a Tryal
or Dispute. I have no tickling
itch or desire, to make the <hi>defence</hi>
of our <hi>English Academies</hi> my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
nor is it highly necessary,
to expose the folly of this <hi>uncivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd

transparent at first view to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet

which others are afraid, even
cautiously, to attempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> We receive the Directions
of our Studies there, from Statutes
made by those, who understood nothing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95302:53"/>
of the matter, who had a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
notion and taste of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from what the World has at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>The Compilers of those <hi>Statutes,</hi>
which he ignorantly explodes,
knew very well what they did;
and tho they had a different taste
or notion of Learning from what
he entertains, yet it follows not, but
they may have been in the right.
As they could not then understand
(as he over-wisely intimates) the
present state of Learning in the
World; so they never design'd,
that <hi>Students</hi> should be limited
and tied all their Lives to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
System, when the Empire
of Knowledge or Philosophy should
be enlarg'd. I know no greater
<hi>Assertors</hi> of Philosophical Liberty,
than the Gentlemen that have had
their Education in our Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
And if some are particularly
(tho' not exclusively) directed to
study <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and his Works,
'tis no more than what's proper,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95302:53"/>
just, nay necessary, upon the account
of extrinsical Motives and Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For the Peripatetick
Terms, and Modes of Expression,
are new interwoven, throughout
a great part of the <hi>Roman-Catholick
Theology,</hi> which is better defended
by Arguments drawn from a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical</hi>
System, than by Reasons,
Texts, and Deductions from Holy
Writ; and if we cannot confront
our Enemies with their own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons;
and define, divide, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
artificially, unravel cryptical
Syllogisms, and subtil Arguments,
with equal facility and readiness,
we may betray the Cause which
we would willingly maintain, and
give them occasion to Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
the <hi>Pagans, Jews,</hi> and
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> with such Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Weapons, as the necessity of
those Times requir'd; and it may
look at this time like a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
a betraying the <hi>Protestant
Cause,</hi> to slight the Logical and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95302:54"/>
Metaphysical Learning taught in
the Universities: But this is no
part of the <hi>Prefacer's</hi> main care, nor
do's it (I believe) in the least concern
his Conscience. No: a <hi>King or no
King,</hi> is now the <hi>Grand Question,</hi>
and important Controversie among
us; and a few <hi>generous</hi> Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
<hi>Notions about Liberty,</hi> out-weigh
with him, all the Learning and
Divinity of Europe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> 'Twas not to learn Foreign
Languages, that the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Youths went for so long together
to the Academies and Lectures of their
Philosophers. 'Twas not then, as now
with us, when the Character of a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
is to be skill'd in words; when one
who is well versed in the dark Terms
and Subtilties of the Schools, passes
for a profound Philosopher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What profound <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
our <hi>Prefacer</hi> has found out, for
the Instruction of Mankind, I am
not worthy to know; for I am no
<hi>Interpreter</hi> of <hi>Dreams.</hi> He may
value, for ought I know, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95302:54"/>
of <hi>Gypsies</hi> above <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Hebrew:</hi> He may extol, if he
pleases, the <hi>Inspection</hi> of <hi>Urine</hi> above
all parts of Physical Knowledge:
He may fancy, perhaps, that the
Dissection of a <hi>Flea,</hi> or the Tail of
a <hi>Fish,</hi> or such like curious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is a most admirable and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
part of Natural Philosophy:
That <hi>calculating the Nativity of a
Common-Wealth,</hi> and the fall of a
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> is an excellent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
part of Modern Astrology:
This he may call <hi>speaking pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and acting like a Man;</hi> and the
extinguishing all remorse, compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and good nature, may pass for
a <hi>subduing the Passions</hi> in his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I find, the Author of</hi> Acad. Examen,
<hi>was</hi> a great Admirer <hi>of the</hi> Feats <hi>of</hi>
Physiognomy, <hi>which he calls a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and profitable Science:</hi> And
this <hi>(says he)</hi> so necessary a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
both in the Genus and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of it, is altogether omitted by the
Schools. They teach nothing of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95302:55"/>
subcaelestial Physiognomy, whether E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary,
Met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orological or Minera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical,
but are utterly ignorant in all
these, contenting themselves with a
few frivolous, false, and formal Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
and Notions, <hi>Exam. p. 76.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I know no reason why these
Notions and Definitions, or dark
Terms and Subtilties (as the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer</hi>
calls 'em) should give place
to such Fooleries, and Fascinations
of a decrepit Fancy; or be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
banish't, because men of weak
and creeping Intellectuals, are not
able to comprehend the use of 'em.
The Church and Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may subsist well enough, tho
Mechanicks, Travellers, and Men
of ordinary Talents should not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the heights and depths,
and usefulness of School-Divinity;
nor is it material or requisite, that
men, whose proper business should
be to learn, and practice Obedience,
should be qualified to set up for
<hi>Moderators</hi> in the Schools: If they
complain that <hi>School-Terms</hi> are too
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95302:55"/>
dark and mysterious, there are some
that will answer, That the fault
lies not in the obscurity of the
Terms, but in the incapacity of
the Noddle: And no Man ought
to be offended at the Sun's Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Lustre, tho blind men cannot
discern it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, in some few cases the
<hi>School-men</hi> appear too definitive
and nice, in determining the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
where the <hi>Scripture</hi> is silent, or
only asserts the <hi>Thing:</hi> But, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
speaking, they are of excellent
use in the managery of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies;
They teach us to avoid Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities,
help at once both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and confute the Errors of our
<hi>Adversaries,</hi> and conduct our minds
into an exact notion, and true
apprehension of things, by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical
Brevity, and regular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations.</p>
                  <p>One great reason, I suppose, that
induc't the <hi>Prefacer</hi> to undervalue
the <hi>Old Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Aristotelian
Doctrines,</hi> is this: <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95302:56"/>
seems, both in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,</hi>
affirms in plain terms, that
of all <hi>Forms</hi> of Government the
<hi>Monarchial</hi> is the <hi>best:</hi> He Asserts,
That <hi>Wise Men</hi> are fitted by nature
to command, and that others of
strong Bodies but weak Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
are chiefly design'd for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and Obedience; than which
nothing can be more grating and
disobliging to Men of a Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Temper and Inclination. 'Tis
likewise to be remember'd, That
his constant Friend and <hi>Tutor</hi> Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> (in several Chapters of his
famous <hi>Leviathan</hi>) complains of
the <hi>barbarous Terms, and obscure stile
of the School-men; their insignificant
Language, and frivolous Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
That</hi> Aristotle's <hi>Metaphysicks
are absur'd, his Politicks repugnant
to Government, his AEthicks igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
his Natural Philosophy a Dream.</hi>
Yet after all, I find, that Men of
the <hi>brightest Wit,</hi> and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<hi>Genius</hi> speak reverently of his
Name. <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Casaubon</hi> count
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95302:56"/>
him the great Incomparable Hero of
the Intellectual World; and esteem
those people to be no better than
<hi>Batts, Owls,</hi> and <hi>Dunces,</hi> that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantickly
talk against him: <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
admires him, <hi>Zanchy</hi> applauds
him, and <hi>Melancthon</hi> adds, <hi>That 'tis
necessary he should be Studied and Read
in the Universities, since without him
no exact Learning or Method can
be attain'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed the <hi>Old Philosophy</hi> (as we
vulgarly call it) as well as <hi>School-Divinity,</hi>
has its Imperfections;
and I know none among all my
Philosophical Acquaintance, that
are zealous Sticklers for the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerability
and Incorruptibility of
the <hi>Celestial Bodies,</hi> the Existence
of <hi>solid Orbs,</hi> or the Element of
Fire under the suppos'd <hi>sphere</hi> of
the <hi>Moon:</hi> And 'tis ignorantly
or malitiously done by the <hi>Prefacer,</hi>
when he endeavours to extol the
<hi>Graecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Education of
Youth, above that of the present
Age; since we retain what is good
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95302:57"/>
of the Ancient Learning, and have
the advantage of Modern Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I consider, that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
properly speaking, is neither
<hi>Pythaegorean,</hi> nor <hi>Socratical,</hi> nor <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetical,</hi>
nor <hi>Epicurean,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a comprehension of those
Truths and Dictates, which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Understanding, freed from
the mixtures of Partiality and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessions,
and assisted by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
application of Thought, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
and long Observation,
can clearly discern, or make out
by necessary consequence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.
'Tis not a little System
of Doctrines, or the Opinions of
a Sect, but whatsoever among all
Parties is fit to be approv'd. There
is something sure, besides <hi>Dark
Terms and Subtilties,</hi> in <hi>Aristotle's
Rhetorick, Ethicks,</hi> and History of
<hi>Animals.</hi> I will, when he thinks
fit to call me to an Account, tell
him somewhat of the <hi>Diviner Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
of <hi>Plato,</hi> of <hi>Leucippus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi>
and <hi>Epicurus</hi> too (as 'tis
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95302:57"/>
illustrated and refin'd by <hi>Petrus
Gassendus</hi>) which may be learn't
in the Universities. I will give
him some Account of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the sublime <hi>Science of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotechny,</hi>
and its various State, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
and Refinements from
the Times of <hi>Hermes, Geber</hi> and
<hi>Lullius,</hi> down to <hi>Valentinus, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus,</hi>
and the acute <hi>Helmont.</hi> I
will acquaint him, if he please, with
the condition and state of <hi>Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Learning,</hi> from the Times of
<hi>Herophilus, Galen,</hi> and the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian

                  </q>
                  <p>I will also tell him some of the
wonderful Feats of <hi>Polygraphy</hi> and
<hi>Steganography,</hi> so much talk't of by

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95302:58"/>
and <hi>Frier Bacon;</hi> and for fear of
hurting his Head with <hi>dark Terms
and Subtilties</hi> and <hi>Old Philosophical
Quirks,</hi> which <hi>breed Stiffness,</hi> and
<hi>Positiveness in Opinion,</hi> we'll talk <hi>of
the stupendious effects</hi> of the <hi>Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Philosophy,</hi> improv'd by <hi>Cabaeus,
Athanasius Kercherus,</hi> and the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Gilbertus;</hi> as also of the great
importance of <hi>Emblems, Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,</hi>
and the <hi>Universal Character</hi>
of great Vogue and Repute (if we
may believe the Author of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen,</hi>)
in some of the Oriental
Nations. I could here tell some of
the strange Performances of the
<hi>Thermometer, Barometer</hi> (or <hi>Aero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,</hi>
as some call it,) the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of the <hi>Telescope;</hi> and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of the <hi>Torricellian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi>
or <hi>Air-pump,</hi> undertake
to prove even a <hi>coacervate Vacuity</hi>
in Nature: And, because he is
offended with the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin
Tongues;</hi> I think I could oblige his
squeamish and diseased Fancy with
a luscius and wonderful Secret,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95302:58"/>
(approv'd of by his <hi>Old Friend</hi>
the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Examen,</hi> as well
as by the divinely inspir'd <hi>Teutonick,</hi>
and <hi>Rosicrusian</hi> Fraternity) call'd

Paradisical Language of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown
Word, which <hi>Adam</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
while he was in the state of
Innocence. This is that Angelical
Language, which speaks and
breaths forth those Central My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
that lay hid in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Magick, and wrapp'd up in
the Bosom of the eternal Essence,
wherein were hidden and involv'd
all the Treasury of those Ideal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures,
which were brought to

the true Signatures of the divine

like so many Harmoniacal and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95302:59"/>
Symphoniacal Voices, sounding
forth in an heav'nly Consort, the
Wisdom, Power, Glory, and Might
of the transcendent central Abyss
of Unity, from whence they did
arise; and all speaking one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
expressing in that mystical
Idiom, the hidden Vertues, Nature
and Properties of those various
Sounds, which tho' one in the
Center, become infinitely nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in the Existence and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
<hi>Exam. p.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prefacer,</hi> if he please, may
consider gravely of this, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it at his leisure: At present
I shall only beg of him (and 'tis a
very reasonable request,) that he
would be so civil and good natur'd
for the future, as to give God leave
to Govern the Kingdoms of the
Earth in his own way; that he
would acknowledge all power is
from God, that by him Kings
Reign, and Princes decree Justice.
That he would have so just and
favourable Opinion of the Wisdom
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95302:59"/>
of the Parliament, as to think 'em
sufficiently qualified (without his
help) to contrive good and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Laws for the benefit of the
Publick: That he would know,
to despise and vilify the Clergy, is
to dishonour that Being that <hi>sent</hi>
'em to instruct him: That, if he
cannot curb his busy &amp; impetuous
fancy, he would at least direct and
bend it some other way; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself either to Microscopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Curiosities, the solving of
Problems, or catching of Flies (as
<hi>Dometian</hi> us'd to do) and dissect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em, if he will, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Knowledge; or, if
that be too <hi>minute</hi> and <hi>fine</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
that he would, with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
Anatomize <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi>
for the improvement of himself.
That instead of too curiously med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the Body Politick, he
would with <hi>Democtitus,</hi> enquire
into the Nature and Scituation of
that <hi>Thing,</hi> which has given us this
disturbance: That, instead of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95302:60"/>
employing his talent and thoughts
about the Mysteries of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he would look into the
<hi>Wonders</hi> of the <hi>little World;</hi> and
lastly, that instead of bewildring
his fancy in the Doctrines of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>
and <hi>Hobbs,</hi> he would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
read, and endeavour to
understand the <hi>Creed, Lord's
Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> in
the <hi>Vulgar Tongue, and be further
instructed in the Church Catechism,
set forth for that purpose.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another bold stride to
push on the <hi>Republican Plot,</hi> is to
amuse the Multitude with much
Talk about a <hi>Contract</hi> betwixt
King and People and drawing wild
Inferences from it: <hi>If the King
fail in his Promise, the People are
exempt from their Obedience; The
Contract is made void, and the Right
of Obligation is of no force.</hi> Vindic.
Cont. Tyran. This is the Old
Stile, and heretofore did great
Execution; God send us a good
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95302:60"/>
Deliverance. For the <hi>Prefacer</hi>
rally's upon us with this Engine
too, and makes it a part of the
<hi>Duty we owe to our Country, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our Constitution upon it's true
and natural Basis, the Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
All other Foundations being
false, nonsensical, and rotten, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to the present Government,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He triumphs and shews his mettle
in talking proudly of the <hi>Rights of
the People,</hi> and the <hi>Duty we owe to our
Country;</hi> all this he can shrewdly
<hi>inculcate</hi> twice in one page: But
instead of meeting with the Rights
of Sovereignty, and Allegiance due
to their Majesties, we hear nothing
but the rough and blustring Sounds
of the <hi>Plague of Tyranny,</hi> and
<hi>dispatching Kings without Ceremony.</hi>
This I take to be a strong Symtom
of an Antimonarchical Distemper
in him. Nay, he do's in effect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the <hi>Present Government,</hi>
by making it depend upon an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Basis, or Foundation that
can no where be found, but in such
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95302:61"/>
Heads as are stuff'd with Dreams
and Visions, and perfect airy Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
                  <p>The most Learned in the Law,
with whom it has been my good-Fortune
to converse, know nothing
of this Original Contract; and tho
some have made as much decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and as horrible din about
it, as others do about Original Sin;
yet I challenge the <hi>Prefacer</hi> to
afford me half so plain and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
proof of the one, as he has
given of the other. Let him not
think to trifle, or put us off with
fanciful Conjectures, random Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
<hi>ipse dixit's,</hi> and wild con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
from fantastical Premises
(which I value no more than a
Jest of <hi>Poor Robin's,</hi> or a Prophecy
of <hi>B—y's</hi>) the Grand Enquiry is
about a <hi>Contract upon Record,</hi> at
the first Erection of the English
Monarchy: If he knows where
to find it, let him place it in open
view, <hi>&amp; erit mihi Magnus Apollo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:95302:61"/>But methinks I see him stand
like a man enchanted, and fumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about the matter: The <hi>man
of Confidence</hi> becomes meal-mouth'd
and bashful on a sudden; the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettled
Hero</hi> will not jog on this
way: No, 'tis too choice a <hi>Nost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
to be publickly expos'd; 'tis
too pretious a commodity to be
laid upon the Stall; profane and
unsanctified eyes must not behold
it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (which is the
great Record of our Liberties) the
People's Rights and Priviledges are
fetch'd purely from the Kings
Grants and Donations, <hi>viz. Of our
free and meer Will, we have given
and granted to our Bishops, and to all
free men of our Realm, these Liberties
following:</hi> And the higher we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
in the Scale of Monarchy, we
find the King's more unlimited and
free; There were no restrictions or
reserves under the <hi>first</hi> and most
<hi>Antient Governments;</hi> no Laws, but
what lay in the Prince's Bosom; as

any <hi>Beardless Boy,</hi> that has read
<hi>Justin</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> can sufficiently
inform him.</p>

to his <hi>Cause,</hi> if I tell him, that the
first notorious Encroachment upon
the Rights of Majesty in <hi>England,</hi>
were made by Popish Aggressors:
This was first attempted in the
time of King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First,</hi>
whom we commonly (tho' perhaps
not properly) call the <hi>Conqueror:</hi>
But he was too wise and puissant
to admit the least diminution of
his Regality, and tho' he was very
generous and candid in his Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
yet he dismiss't the Pope's
Legate with an <hi>Alterum non Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misi.</hi>
In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Second, Monarchical Power was
at a low ebb indeed, when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
and barbarous Monks of
those times dealt with their Prince,
as some rude Heathens do by their
Gods, <hi>viz.</hi> chastise and whip 'em,
if they do not answer their insolent
Expectations. The Case of King
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95302:62"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> is too derogatory, and sad,
for a <hi>true</hi> Loyal English-man to
think on, or to repeat: And the
Condition of <hi>Poor England</hi> in the
time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> is a fair
indication of what pernicious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
it may prove to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
when Princes shall admit a
Superior, and controlling Power,
even in the softest acceptation of
the Word.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> tells of an ingenious
<hi>Spaniard</hi> he met at <hi>Brussels,</hi> who
would needs have it, That the
History of <hi>Don Quixot</hi> had ruined
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy; for when
all the Love and Valour of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
was turn'd into Ridicule,
they began by degrees to grow
asham'd of both, and to laugh at
<hi>Fighting</hi> and <hi>Loving:</hi> What ill
influence and impression, this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous</hi>
and <hi>Romantick Account,</hi> may
leave behind it, by representing
persons and things sacred in a
Ridiculous Garb and Colours, I
cannot yet determine: However,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95302:63"/>
'tis good to make Provision against
the worst; and since an Apologue
has had its good as well as evil
effects, I shall here confront one
Fable with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It happen'd, that a great sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was in</hi> Rome, <hi>and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people were so incensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Senate, Nobles, and
Rich Men, that all things seem'd
now to be a running into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
Whereupon the Senate
sent one</hi> Menenius Agrippa, <hi>an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and wise person, to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
to persuade 'em: Who
being admitted amongst 'em, and
finding 'em all in a hurry, is said,
to have Address'd himself to 'em
after this manner:</hi> Upon a time
there arose a great Sedition among
the Members of the Body against the
Belly; the eyes, ears, hands, and feet
said, That they all of 'em perform'd
their several Offices to the Body; but
the Belly doing nothing at all, as a lazy
King, enjoy'd their Labours, and idly
consumed all those things which were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95302:63"/>
purchased with the sweat of the rest.
<hi>The Belly replyed,</hi> That indeed
these things were true, and therefore,
if it pleas'd them, from henceforth
they should allow it nothing; <hi>The
Members all agreed,</hi> That nothing
should be given to it for the time to
come: But when this had been observ'd
for some little time, the Hands and Feet
lost their strength, and all other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
began to fail; so that at length they
perceived, That the Food which was
given to the Belly, was also advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to all the rest, and upon this
consideration they return'd to their
Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Upon the hearing of this <hi>Fable,</hi>
the People understood, That the
Wealth which was in the hands
of Great Men, was also in some
sort beneficial to themselves: And
upon some kind promises of the
Senate, they were reconciled to
their Superiours.</p>
                  <p>It has not been my main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of late, nor is it worth a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95302:64"/>
thinking man's while, to read
o're the Licentious Histories that
peep abroad, or the Popular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of things: I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the inside of the <hi>Account</hi>
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> till the <hi>Third Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
appeared upon the Stage; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which time I was desir'd
to make some <hi>Remarks</hi> upon it,
and give it a just Answer and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation:
Had I had more time
and leisure for the performance, I
should, perhaps, have been more
copious in my Animadversions; but
I hope I have said enough to tame
a little the impertinence of that
<hi>Man,</hi> who had insulted over the
Nobility, Clergy, and both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
and made the <hi>Names</hi> of
Princes his Sport. I have bound
him to some method, and I hope
to better Behaviour for the future;
and tho' I find little of Argument
throughout the whole, yet I have
proceeded fairly and argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
against him. I have plainly
shewn, That all the choice means
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95302:64"/>
and expedients used heretofore, to
destroy the Monarchy and Church,
are exactly transscrib'd by him,
and crowded into a Preface: And
certainly, That man has a greater
share of kind Nature, than good
Apprehension, that can think he
has singled out the same Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Methods, without the
same black Intention and Design.</p>
                  <p>I know his Admirers have one
Infallible way of answering all
opposers, and that is by Ill Names:
They have not Wit enough to
discern the Reason of things;
nor know they when to laugh,
or be severe in the Right place:
If the <hi>Prefacer,</hi> without Reason,
roul in hard words and Names
(such as <hi>Ide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, Ass, Tyrant, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical
Blunders, and the like</hi>) it
passes with 'em for the <hi>Mettle</hi> of
a <hi>Pree-orn</hi> Subject: But if we
upon just provocation, prove the
same upon them, O 'tis sad scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility
and <hi>Railing:</hi> They are
meek, lowly, and poor in Spirit,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95302:65"/>
while they are sawcy to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
and despise Dominion:
But 'tis pride, and crying presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in us, if we offer to correct
a little snarling Republican: If
they trample upon Bishops and
Blaspheme Kings; They are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Zealous and concern'd for God
and his Glory: but if we expose
the Scismatical Licentiousness of
the disobedient Brother-hood, O
'tis rank Malice, and a degree of
persecution. The World has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been full of such pretious
Judges and Arbitrators as these:
And we know the Pharisees were
even (this way) with the Saviour
of the World, for telling 'em in
plain Words, They were of their
Father the Devil.</p>
                  <p>If Children will be perpetually
playing in the dirt, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
corrected for it: And if
men will be always sporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with foul and unclean In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
against their Betters; they
ought not to take it amiss, if they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95302:65"/>
are sometimes snub'd for their Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciness
and ill Manners. This is
the true State of the matter here
before us. If any man can shew,
that I have transgress't the limits
of Justice or true <hi>Decorum;</hi> none
can be more forward to make a
generous Recantation, than my
self: In the mean time, I submit
what I have written, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Censure and Correction of
my Superiors, in the <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <head>THE
Consolations of the CROSS:
OR THE
Two Grand PILLARS
OF
MAN'S SECURITY
In this WORLD, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THE Reader will easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
from what has been
said, that some Men who enjoy
the Benefit of the Sun, as well as
those that are pent up in <hi>Dark
Rooms,</hi> can Fancy themselves to
be as great as Popes and Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95302:68"/>
And I can further assure
him, that this unhappy <hi>Brother</hi>
and <hi>Traveller</hi> here before us, who
seems to swell, and <hi>look big</hi> among
the living, has been a long time
<hi>Dead</hi> in a <hi>True Philosophical</hi> Sense,
although he may still make a
mighty Figure in the <hi>Mundus Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bejorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now 'twas eagerly maintain'd
by some of the Philosophical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
heretofore, That the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life, which is still drawing
down the Soul to unlovely Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
did more properly deserve
the Name and Character of Death;
which seems to be the result of wise
deliberation, as well as fine thought
and Fancy: For certainly Life,
in a moral acceptation, do's not
consist in breathing common Air,
and having a flowing plenty of
worldly Accomodations; but in
knowledge and contemplation, in
Divine and Rational exercises
'Tis certainly a great Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Dignity of Humane
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95302:68"/>
Nature (which is fram'd so near
a kin to the Angelical) to place the
<hi>Essence</hi> of Life in the Enjoyment
of <hi>Outward</hi> Things; and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
resulting from it is rather a
Lethargy, than true Tranquility
of Mind: He that has vital pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and faculties, is potentially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live;
but he alone is actually so
who do's Nobly and agreeably
exert 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> Health and Liberty are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dispute, the greatest natural Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
Mankind is capable of enjoying.</p>
                  <p>The Health of the <hi>Rational Frame</hi>
consists in acting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> conformably to
the Dictates of right Reason:
This the Philosophers called the
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Harmony, <hi>Health</hi> and good
<hi>disposition</hi> of the <hi>Soul of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Liberty of Man consists
principally, in his being Free from
Perturbations, or the Dominion of
irregular and tumultuary Passions,
and vitious Habits, that usurp the
place of right Reason: In which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95302:69"/>
sense of Liberty, <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who are Lords and Masters,
and live well and pleasantly</hi> (as he
notes, <hi>Account</hi> pag. 241.) are no
better than Vassals: And some of
<hi>their Conquered Slaves</hi> (as he calls
'em) do at present enjoy a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
degree of Liberty. And
the <hi>Popish Religion is not the only
one, of all the Christian Sects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to introduce and establish Slavery
in a Nation,</hi> as he tells us, <hi>Account,</hi>
pag. 235.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman, under my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
care and inspection, talks, as
if the condition of Men here below,
were a kind of <hi>Epicurean State</hi> of
Carnal Ease and Complacency:
Christianity with its dark Train
of <hi>Passive Doctrines,</hi> is a slavish
and unintelligible Thing in his
Esteem. Never was any fond man
so blind an Admirer of his Mist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress's
Charms and Perfections, as
he <hi>is a lover of his Countrey's Legal
Liberties,</hi> without any regard to
the safety of Religion: Never did
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95302:69"/>
good St. <hi>Augustin</hi> declaim with more
vehemence against the salvability
of the Heathens; than he has done
against these <hi>Slavish Opinions suckt
in at the Schools; and which some have
been so unfortunate, to carry to their
Graves; and</hi> (he might have added)
<hi>to Heav'n.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He would fain make the wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
World believe, That <hi>Passive
Obedience</hi> and <hi>Legal Liberties,</hi> are
inconsistent things; and that one
is fatally destructive of the other:
But that is his want of Judgment,
and sound Understanding. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> (who was undoubtedly as
great an Assertor of <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
as ever was in the World)
pleaded such Liberties as these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Nero,</hi> and before the Magist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of <hi>Philippi:</hi> But he likewise
knew, that Civil Rights can have
only a Civil Defence; and if that
fail, there is no higher Appeal, or
Remedy to be expected, but the
Divine Protection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:95302:70"/>My business at present shall be
to shew, That these <hi>Passive Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
(which he in an insulting and
histrionical manner calls <hi>Slavish</hi>
and <hi>Unintelligible</hi>) are a very <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Service;</hi> and this I shall
make out,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> With respect to God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
or Dominion over us:
And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> With respect to the
pure Essential Goodness of his
Nature, as it particularly exerts
it self in our Afflictions. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> With respect to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</p>
                  <p>Now by God's Soveraignty, or
Dominion over us, the Learned
usually understand a Fundamental
Right to dispose of all his Creatures,
so far as 'tis consistent with the
Rules of Justice, Goodness and
Truth; for 'tis <hi>He that hath made
us, and not we our selves;</hi> and in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95302:70"/>
                     <hi>Him we live, move, and have our
Being.</hi> His over-ruling Providence
was awake from all Eternity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World began, he neither
slumber'd nor slept: But by his
incomparable Wisdom, he contriv'd
the <hi>Ranks</hi> and Order of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and had before him the exact
Idea, and Lineaments of all his
Creatures: And when they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
commenc't in time by virtue
of his Pow'r; he gave them their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
and agreeable Stations; he
adorn'd them with Usefulness, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
and due Proportion, and
saw they were very good: Indeed
the whole World was but one <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Temple,</hi> till Man by his Sin
and Sacriledge profan'd it: 'Twas
founded by God's own immediate
Arm, dedicated to his Great Name,
are rais'd to his Glory; and tho a
ridiculous Affectation hath tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some to derive the management,
as well as <hi>Original</hi> of it, from no
higher Principle than that of
<hi>Chance;</hi> yet God saw, in the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95302:71"/>
Circuits of his Wisdom, That
even in the proper Functions of its
Nature, it was dependent on him,
and therefore he resolv'd to preside
over it; to supply it with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
Concurrence of his Might,
and render his <hi>Name</hi> more <hi>venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>glorious</hi> in the conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and guidance of it. Hence he
assumes the <hi>Character</hi> of the Great
King, by the Mouth of his Holy
Prophet; and illustrates his own
Greatness to <hi>Job</hi> in the wonderful
and astonishing <hi>Prospect</hi> of his
Creatures. Hence <hi>Abraham</hi> calls
him the <hi>Judge</hi> of all the <hi>Earth;</hi>
and <hi>David</hi> summons the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> nay the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to sing his Praises: Nay, the
<hi>very Heathens</hi> themselves had such
an awful Impression of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
upon their hearts, that they
durst scarce approach him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>trembling Veneration;</hi> they
acknowledged him to be the
<hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lord and Governour</hi> of all the
World, and accosted him with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95302:71"/>
all the <hi>high-strain'd Epithites</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, tho' <hi>Christianity</hi>
has enrich't our Natures with
many Noble Priviledges, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cancel the Obligation of a
Creature: Tho' it has entitled
us to a <hi>brighter</hi> participation of
the <hi>Divine Image,</hi> yet it has not
brought us to a looser dependance
on him; and tho 'twas design'd
to draw us nearer to God, yet it
doe's not invite us to so bold
an intimacy and freedom with
him, as to dispute his <hi>Authority,</hi>
or the Wisdom of his Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The very Angels above are
subject to his Will, tho' with this
glorious Advantage, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Disobey: And 'tis a Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
in the constitution of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Beings, that, since they are
capable of Moral Government, they
should be govern'd by one that is
infinitely more wise and pow'rful
than themselves: But who can
challenge this great Prerogative,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95302:72"/>
but the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of
Lords?</hi> 'Tis he that is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<hi>Donor</hi> of our Beings; the great
<hi>Proprietor</hi> of Heav'n and Earth,
and all <hi>Right</hi> is fundamentally
vested in himself: <hi>In his Hand
is the Soul of every living thing, and
the Breath of all Mankind: He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointeth
the devices of the Crafty,
so that their Hands cannot perform
their Enterprize: He leadeth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
away spoil'd, and maketh the
Judges fools. He leadeth Princes
away spoiled, and overthroweth the
mighty.</hi> When <hi>Alexander</hi> is design'd
to be God's <hi>Vicegerent</hi> over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth, <hi>Darius</hi> shall not
be <hi>saved by the multitude of an Host,
nor delivered by his strength:</hi> And
when <hi>Caesar</hi> is appointed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
by God, to be <hi>Lord and
Master</hi> of the <hi>Roman World,</hi> the
Gallant <hi>Pompey,</hi> that never shrank
at the sight of Danger before, shall
soon falter and tremble at the <hi>Head</hi>
of his <hi>Army,</hi> and at length steal
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95302:72"/>
away in a poor disguise, like a
mean and infamous Coward.</p>
                  <p>What is the just Latitude or
Extent of God's Dominion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to mankind, has been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
asserted by Men of bold
and Speculative Inclinations; and
some have been so officiously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
as to fly to the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
determinations of Heaven, to
make out this Mystery and amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Riddle: But what <hi>proud Dust
and Ashes</hi> are we, that we should
thus grasp at Mysteries beyond
our reach, and pry into those
things, which none can see but
he who is Invisible, which none
can comprehend but he who is
Incomprehensible? When we soar
aloft into these Regions that are
above us, we are bewildred and
lost amidst Clouds and Darkness;
we exceed the just bounds and
Limits of our Creation, and gain
nothing else but the Reproach of
our own Folly: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Industriously wave this kind
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95302:73"/>
of procedure, and confine my self
to those clearer Dispensations
mention'd in Holy Writ; and
which chiefly concern the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this present Life.</p>
                  <p>Now that God do's not Limit
his Beneficence and Rewards to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Personal Performances, but
sometimes Blesseth one <hi>Relative</hi> for
another's sake, is abundantly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
from the <hi>Benefits</hi> which
he confered upon <hi>Abraham's Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,</hi>
as also from his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to save <hi>Sinful Sodom</hi> for the
sake of Ten Righteous Persons:
And by equality of Reason he may
punish one Relative upon the
account of another's failance, the
one being as consistent with the
<hi>Rights of his Dominion,</hi> as the other
with his <hi>Goodness.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi>'s
Sin in numbering <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi>
(or, as some would have it, in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
to pay the <hi>Shekel</hi>) was
severely punish't by <hi>three Days
Pestilence,</hi> upon the chosen Men of
<hi>Israel;</hi> and the Iniquity of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:95302:73"/>
tho pardon'd in himself, was to
be punish't in his Children, as
God himself pronounces to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
in these words; <hi>Seest thou how</hi>
Ahab <hi>humbleth himself before me?
Because he humbleth himself before
me, I will not bring the Evil in his
days, but in his Sons days will I bring
the Evil upon his House.</hi> Now in
such singular Incidencies, God doe's
not so directly visit as a Judge,
but makes use of his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> to
advance the unquestionable Designs
of his <hi>good Providence;</hi> and we are
bound to be chearfully <hi>Passive</hi> and
<hi>Resign'd,</hi> whether he is pleas'd to
take away our Lives by <hi>Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
Famine,</hi> the <hi>Iron-hands</hi> of a
<hi>Tyrant,</hi> or <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Destroying
Angel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence I might proceed to
make out the Justice of that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Visitation,</hi> that defac'd and
sullied the whole Scene of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and over-whelm'd all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
with Anxiety and Sadness.
God made <hi>Man happy and upright</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:95302:74"/>
at first, and endow'd his Nature
with all agreeable perfection;
but he by his <hi>Non-attendance</hi> and
Disobedience, did soon plunge
himself in an <hi>Estate of Sin and
Misery;</hi> and thus proud <hi>Man</hi> who
was so <hi>Nobly Descended</hi> fell at
Odds with his Maker, dis-rob'd
himself of all his <hi>Original Glories,</hi>
and shook the whole Universe
by his <hi>Fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We read</hi> that the <hi>Wise-Men</hi> of
the <hi>Eastern World</hi> were sadly
concern'd at this unaccountable
State of Things: You may hear
the <hi>Platonist</hi> pouring out his Soul
in Complaints and mournful
strains; and telling strange Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of some sins committed in a
<hi>Former State.</hi> to make out the
<hi>Mysterious Vanity</hi> of this Life:
You may see <hi>Aristotle</hi> sitting down
and weeping by the <hi>Water of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripus</hi>
lamenting the shortness of
his Intellectual Sight, the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and dimness of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
Nay, <hi>Solomon</hi> himself
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95302:74"/>
the very <hi>Boast of Nature</hi> and
Great <hi>Secretary of Heav'n</hi>) after
he had seen and enjoy'd all the
satisfactions of this life, in the little
narrow compass of himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
at length with this <hi>pathetical</hi>
Exclamation, <hi>All is Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is now the condition of
our Natures; this is our present
Case: The Body has lost its
<hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Gloss,</hi> and the <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those Lineaments,</hi> which were
at first drawn by the finger of
God; the <hi>Soul</hi> is driven out of
her former <hi>Paradise</hi> into a <hi>Region</hi>
of Diseases, of Tempests and <hi>thick
Darkness,</hi> and expos'd a Prey to
all the wretched Calamities of a
Mortal Life: And yet, far be it
from <hi>Faln Man,</hi> to renew the <hi>Old
Apostacy,</hi> and Quarrel with those
<hi>Alotments</hi> which are plainly consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with the mildest <hi>Justice:</hi>
God might have made <hi>Man</hi> the
subject of many Temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
without respect to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
<hi>Fall,</hi> and recompenc't all
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95302:75"/>
this with the <hi>blessed Assurances</hi> of
a <hi>Future State;</hi> and certainly, the
Light of Nature may inform us,
That since we are wholly subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to another, we ought also
to be accountable for every trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
accordingly as our <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi>
shall determine or think fit;
who because he is <hi>holy, just, and
good,</hi> neither can nor will inflict
more upon us than what our Sins
and Iniquities shall exact.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Practice of
these <hi>Passive Doctrines</hi> is a very
reasonable Service, will yet more
eminently appear, if we consider
'em with respect to the <hi>Divine
Goodness,</hi> as it particularly exerts
it's self in our <hi>Afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here we meet with some,
that have form'd very <hi>dark</hi> and
<hi>dangerous Notions</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> which
they adore; and, as if they meant
to <hi>cut-vye</hi> even <hi>Lucifer</hi> himself,
have accus'd their Maker of Pride
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95302:75"/>
and Moroseness, and an evil Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
towards his Creatures.
What Satan only suggested out
of design, men have solemnly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow'd,
and ratified for sound
Doctrine: And this was the first
Engine which the Devil plaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Happiness of Mankind:
'T was the Argument he used to
our <hi>first Parents,</hi> to make 'em for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
their Estate of Primitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
He endeavour'd to tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
their Minds with an Opinion,
that God was of an envious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely
Disposition, and that which
was no where to be found but in
himself, he fasten'd upon that
<hi>Being,</hi> from whom all Goodness
in the World is deriv'd: <hi>For God
doe's know</hi> (says he) <hi>that in the day
you eat thereof, ye shall be as Gods,
knowing Good and Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this <hi>fatal Entercourse</hi> and
<hi>subsequent Fall,</hi> there were many
Heathens (who had some Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Scripture communicated
to 'em, or else understood some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95302:76"/>
of the matter by the less
faithful conveyance of <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)
that began to entertain ill
Notions of God, thinking he had
forbid 'em the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> out of
Pure malignity or ill intention:
Hence they proceeded to tell very
sad and ominous Tales of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Temper of the Deity above
them; his industrious care to dash
all Prosperity with some sharp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
and overwhelm all Greatness
with a swift Destruction. And
indeed, it had been happy for the
Christian World, if such <hi>barbarous Notions</hi> had kept their due distance
on the other-side the <hi>Partition Wall,</hi>
if they had been confin'd for ever
to the <hi>Outer-Court</hi> of <hi>Gentilism.</hi>
Men have been so forward to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
God's Soveraignty above his
other Attributes, to oppose his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
to his Design, and make
his <hi>Revealed Will</hi> such a <hi>Mystery</hi>
to his Creatures, that they seem
solemnly to imply, That all the
Divine Expostulations and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95302:76"/>
tho seconded with full Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Attestation, are intended
only to promote the Credit of the
Imposture, and advance the ends
of Tyranny and Deceit: An Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
so Romantick, and big with
Absurdity! that it represents the
Almighty a <hi>Bugbear</hi> in a worse
sense, than the Atheist ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
and looks as if 'twere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to justify the <hi>Rebellion</hi> even
of <hi>Lucifer</hi> himself; and proclaim
to the World, that he fell in <hi>a good
Old Cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short, Love is the Gospel-Definition
of the Divine Essence;
and 'tis very plain, without any
affected Jingle, or Ambiguity;
and infallible true as any demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
If we take away his
pow'r, he would be but a kind of
<hi>Epicurean Deity;</hi> but take away
his Goodness, and he would be no
Deity at all: The Apostate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
may partake of his Pow'r, but
they cannot of his Goodness; and
if it were lawful to reduce our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95302:77"/>
Conceptions of the <hi>Divine Essence</hi>
to Figures and Proportions; we
may justly presume (by a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the <hi>Philosopher's Notion</hi>)
that he would assume <hi>Light</hi> for
his <hi>Vehicle,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> for his very
Soul. Every Act of God is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of his Beneficence; his
most rigorous Justice is nothing
else but a certain disposition, a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
mode</hi> of his goodness; he
corrects us only out of Love; he
doe's not willingly afflict the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Men.</p>
                  <p>Now that Afflictions are a <hi>sign</hi>
and Character of <hi>Adoption,</hi> will
readily and evidently appear; if
we do but consider, that this has
been the constant Portion of the
greatest <hi>Favourites of Heav'n:</hi>
The Holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> spent all their
days in sorrow, and in <hi>Travel;</hi>
the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> were so
many <hi>Seminaries</hi> of Affliction:
And it hath pleased God, by an
uncontrollable <hi>display</hi> throughout
all Periods and Ages, to render
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95302:77"/>
the Sufferings of our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
more illustrious than his
Miracles, or all the <hi>Monuments</hi> of
his Pow'r: The <hi>Crusified Jesus</hi>
has been prefigur'd by a longer <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue</hi>
of <hi>Worthies,</hi> than the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Redeemer; and he has
had more <hi>Types</hi> of his Passion than
of his Glory. The Greatness of
man was too imaginary and frail
to represent the <hi>Majesty</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and our degeneracy had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
our Miseries so justly real,
as to be weak and imperfect Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of his Sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it seem'd a necessary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
that some <hi>unfortunate</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
should rise up to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
as near as Humanity could
aspire, to reconcile his Tribulation
to his Integrity, and recommend
his Person to the acceptance of the
World; and yet, alas! so great
was the darkness of benighted
Mankind at the <hi>Brightness</hi> of his
rising, that they shut their Eyes
against this Sun of Glory; among
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95302:78"/>
all the Prophesies which he punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
fullfill'd; this one was too
soon, and too fatally verified, <hi>He
is despised and rejected of Men, a
Man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Birth-day</hi> was observ'd with
no other Solemnity, than that of a
<hi>Massacre;</hi> and his coming into the
world was congratulated with a
Conspiracy; and tho' <hi>Abrabam afar
off rejoyced to see his day,</hi> yet his
degenerate Off-spring did even
scorn and deride it. Never was
<hi>Majesty</hi> so rudely treated, nor <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
exercised with such contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
disgraces; his unspotted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
did not so much endear, as
exasperate the World against him;
his Poverty of Spirit was improv'd
into Ambition; and his Miracles
courted their Incredulity in vain:
And after all the base and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affronts that were levelled
against his person; after he had
run through all the afflicting Stages
of Poverty, Sorrow and Disgrace;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95302:78"/>
He stoop't to the dreadful <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of a <hi>Tryal,</hi> expected the fatal
pleasure of his Enemies, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
at length to the most <hi>Illegal
Sentence</hi> that ever came from the
<hi>mouth</hi> of Blasphemy.</p>
                  <p>And next behold him hanging
upon a <hi>Cross;</hi> behold a <hi>dying</hi> and
a <hi>bleeding Saviour</hi> embalming cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
with the effusions of his
dearest Blood! Behold the <hi>brightest
Order</hi> &amp; Immortality Prefac't with
the wrack of <hi>Universal Nature,</hi> the
<hi>Crucifixion</hi> of the Whole World!
Those <hi>glorious Bodies</hi> whom <hi>David</hi>
calls upon to praise the Lord, did
then <hi>sympathize with his Agony and
Passion.</hi> The Heaven's were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd,
the Earth gave up <hi>her Dead,</hi>
and all things see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d shuffled into
another Chaos to prepare the way
for a <hi>new Creation.</hi> Thus did Christ
suffer, and <hi>leave us an Example, that
we should follow his steps:</hi> Thus did
he adorn the Cross with his own
Practice, and bequeath it to us as
the distinguishing Character of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95302:79"/>
a <hi>True</hi> Disciple. This was his lot,
and 'tis our Predestinated portion,
for <hi>hereunto are we called;</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will list himself a true fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of him, must resolve to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of that <hi>bitter Cup,</hi> whensoever
Providence shall give him an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.</p>
                  <p>And that this is no slavish or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Doctrin, will yet more
abundantly appear, if we consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Natural Pow'r
and Influence of Affliction upon
the Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Health, Liberty, Prosperity and
much Ease,</hi> are dangerous and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
things; and tho' they
are lent us as a gentle Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
anxiety and care, yet through
our own ill management they
often become a <hi>Charm,</hi> and the
Antidote it self turns to a Disease:
For since the <hi>World</hi> cannot so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fubdue us by Threats and Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
by Assaults, and open Force,
it immediately flies to all the Arts
of Policy, to Stratagem and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95302:79"/>
like a subtil <hi>Magitian,</hi> it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
turns its <hi>Rod</hi> into a <hi>Serpent;</hi>
it dazzles our Senses with a delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
prospect of its Counterfeit
Glories, and so leads us in <hi>Golden
Fetters</hi> to Destruction: For the
<hi>World,</hi> like the <hi>Old Enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
doe's first <hi>deceive</hi> the <hi>Female
Parties</hi> within us; it caresses each
Lust and tender Passion with fair
and specious Allurements, and when
these have embraced &amp; swallow'd
the <hi>Golden Delusion,</hi> our Masculine
Faculties are too soft and flexible
to resist the pleasing Temptation,
and proselyted Reason begins to
hearken to the Dictates of our
Senses.</p>
                  <p>And thus having at length en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slav'd
our Understandings, it begins
to play the Tyrant over us, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
our Time, our Thoughts, and
all our Actions. If we chance to
be in a religious or thoughtful
mood, the <hi>World</hi> soon turns it
into Hippocrisy and Disguise; if
we enter into Discourse about sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95302:80"/>
Mysteries, it soon perverts it
into Burlesque and wanton Talk;
and when we would draw forth
our honest intentions by the Rules
of strict Morality, it brings 'em out
in the Dialect of Friends, in Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and bitter Calumny; when
we are busy and employ'd about
our necessary Callings, it instructs
us in the quaint, and artificial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Knavery and Deceit; and
when we retire from them for a
sober Indulgence and Refreshment
of our Natures, the <hi>World</hi> is ready
at hand to overwhelm us with
Luxury and Excess: Nay, if we
enter into our Closets for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of our Devotion, the World
do's there likewise pursue us; it
imprints its Image upon our very
Hearts and Minds, challenges all
our Thoughts and Attention, and
so turns our lawful Prayers into
Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Dangers</hi> of <hi>Prosperity</hi> have
struck such an awe upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of <hi>Great Men</hi> in former Ages,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95302:80"/>
that they never consider'd 'em
without trembling and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hence 'tis Recorded of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Antient Hero's,</hi> that after some
Signal Victories and Atchievments,
they have grown pensive and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
and chang'd their <hi>August</hi>
and <hi>sprightly</hi> Countenances, into
a sad dejection and captivity of
Spirit: And tho' some late <hi>Vertuosi</hi>
have ascrib'd these effects to the
<hi>Effluviums</hi> and <hi>Darts</hi> of some <hi>envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Eyes</hi> about 'em, yet I question
not, but this will ever pass, among
the thinking part of Mankind, for
a very derogatory and ungrounded
Fancy. It was not the <hi>Envy</hi> or
the <hi>Frowns</hi> of Men, but fear of the
just Anger of the Gods that made
the Renowned <hi>Cato</hi> cry out in <hi>Livy,
That the more he prosper'd, the more
he grew afraid:</hi> And for the same
reason <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> once every
year laid aside his Regalities, and
receive'd Alms with all the humble
<hi>Ceremony</hi> of a <hi>Beggar;</hi> he feared his
long uninterrupted Prosperity, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95302:81"/>
the Anger of the Over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Deity, and therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to divert his wrath by a
Voluntary Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>And if we look into the <hi>Annals</hi>
of the Christian Church, we shall
meet with some, in the <hi>hot Interval</hi>
of the Heathen Persecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
themselves that God not
yet called them to the <hi>Glories</hi> of
<hi>Tribulation,</hi> the <hi>Illustrious Toils</hi> of
Martyrdom; and after this <hi>Pagan
Storm</hi> was blown over, and the
Church of God was adorn'd with
<hi>honourable</hi> Endowments, we shall
find many wise and <hi>venerable Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
climbing very heavily into
the <hi>Episcopal Chair,</hi> and, when they
were there plac't, as sadly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Danger of their Station;
they look't upon such heights as a
Temptation rather than a Duty,
and more a Punishment than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
                  <p>And if we cast our eyes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and observe the succeeding
<hi>Centuries</hi> of the Church, we shall
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95302:81"/>
be tempted to think, that this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
suspition was no <hi>Panick Dread,</hi>
but a very just and necessary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection;
for as <hi>Tacitus</hi> has
observ'd of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> that
after its martial Humour was abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Peace and a gentle Discip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
it became dispirited by Riots
and intestine Factions; so may we
plainly discern a most deplorable
alteration in the State of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so soon as the <hi>Heathen Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was overpast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the <hi>First Christians</hi> were
treated with Severities, their Lives
were a genuine Transcript of their
Profession; they convinc't the world
with the <hi>best Argument</hi> of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conversation, insomuch that
the Heathens submitted at length
to a tame and a gentle <hi>Discipline;</hi>
and Christianity appear'd a <hi>True
Mystery of Godliness:</hi> But when,
through the favour of a <hi>milder Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
it became the Imperial
Profession; when it's Votaries were
dismist from the <hi>Lectures</hi> of the
<hi>Cross,</hi> and the Prevailing Council
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95302:82"/>
of Afflictions; they quickly clos'd
with the treacherous Sollicitations
of Flesh and Blood, and flattering
Vanities of the World.</p>
                  <p>And this was the immediate
Doom of Christianity, so soon as
the Pagan Tyranny was over-past;
for then Christians themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
all Obligations of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Humility, and turn'd the
former <hi>Glories</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> into the
<hi>Scandal of Persecution;</hi> Their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Unity</hi> became broken and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
by the Pride of <hi>Arrians,
Donatists,</hi> and <hi>Novatians;</hi> and
those latter Ages were almost as
remarkable for Ambition, Luxury,
and a Tyrannical Zeal, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
had been for an incomparable
Piety, and victorious Martyrdoms.</p>
                  <p>So natural is it for Men to turn
their <hi>Liberty</hi> into <hi>Vanity,</hi> by too
high an Admiration of it; and to
corrupt their Food by the Poyson
of their own Natures: And when
Men are become such <hi>Vassals to the
World,</hi> such <hi>Votaries</hi> of <hi>Sense and
Pleasure;</hi> they must also languish
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95302:82"/>
in their Duty towards God, and fall
off proportionably from the divine
Assistance: For how can they
listen to the <hi>call</hi> of Heav'n, amidst
all this Pomp and Secular Dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raction,
or bestow one Thought
upon Futurity and Judgment?</p>
                  <p>But when at length some signal
Calamity shall give the daring Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
an Alarm, when Afflictions,
the Welcome Harbinger of
God's Love, fall like a Dew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; This shews him the
Vanity of his Carnal Ease and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and opens a prospect into the
<hi>Land of the Living:</hi> For the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of a God, and of our
Duty to him, are so essential to our
Souls, and inseparable from our
Natures; that tho' Men may
seem to drown 'em for a while, they
lye dissolv'd in delicacy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
yet the least touch of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
will sometimes awaken us
into severe Reflections, and dash all
the Harmony of our Blood and
Spirits. 'Tis is very pious <hi>Remark</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:95302:83"/>
of that <hi>Great Philosopher,</hi> whom
<hi>wise Antiquity</hi> hath justly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Divine;</hi> That
when a Man perceives, that he is
just drawing towards his <hi>latter End,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He
is then seized with a doubtful
Trembling, and an Enquiry into
those things, which before he
would scarce vouchsafe to think
upon: And tho' he might once
laugh at the <hi>Pious and grave Cheats</hi>
of Immaterial Beings, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits; yet now the very <hi>Tales</hi>
of <hi>Ghosts and Fayries</hi> will affright
him; he will be ready to shrink
at the least Shadow of Danger,
and be terrified with the <hi>Visions</hi> of
his own <hi>Imagination.</hi> Indeed 'tis
an easy thing for a Man, in the lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Pride of his Nature, to seem
<hi>Witty</hi> and <hi>Eloquent</hi> against Heav'n,
and to out-face the Ferrors of the
<hi>Invisible World;</hi> but when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
shall cast him out of his
<hi>Beloved State</hi> of Bodily <hi>Health</hi> and
<hi>Security,</hi> into a Bed of <hi>Sickness,</hi> or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95302:83"/>
the confinements of a <hi>Prison;</hi> when
the cold Damps shall appale and
allay the gaety of his Temper, and
all his <hi>worldly Oracles</hi> stand mute,
and cannot help him; Then he
will think of his former <hi>Gallantry</hi>
with reluctance and vexation; he
will then experiment the Folly of
his own choice; and no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
the glittering Frailties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Wisdom, but <hi>Reason</hi> will be
fwallow'd up in Revelation; he
will then confess that every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is fearfully and wonderfully
made; that every little <hi>Insect</hi> is a
System of Divinity; and his eyes
will be opened to spell out a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Disposer</hi> of all Events in
the Works of his own Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Such Considerations as these will
be our <hi>Entertainment,</hi> when we lye
under the Discipline of a severer
Providence; when God in Mercy
has <hi>befriended</hi> us with <hi>Afflictions,</hi>
and <hi>covered us with</hi> Misery <hi>as with
a Garment:</hi> For the Soul of Man
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95302:84"/>
is active and restless, and must have
some Object, whereupon to fix its
Desires; and when it has nothing
from without to employ it, it will
no longer look abroad, but draw
its Activity inwards; and then
the <hi>Appeals</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> will be heard,
and the <hi>Cries</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> will not be
rejected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this <hi>Passive State</hi>
is not a State of Slavery, but of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
and Glorious Liberty, will
be further evinc't, by considering
the divine Supports and Succours
that attend it. For since God has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
promised, That we <hi>shall not be
tempted beyond what we are able to
bear,</hi> he stands engaged, when the
ordinary means of comfort do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
us, to furnish out an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Supply. And tho' this
may seem an uncouth Paradox to
the <hi>Animal Man,</hi> a very harsh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity
to Flesh and Blood; yet
it has been unquestionably made
out by the Practice of the Apostles,
and many illustrious Examples in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95302:84"/>
the Primitive Church. For there
have been some, whose minds
have been so fortified by Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> that they
could even smile in the <hi>Grim Face</hi>
of Persecution; look down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
concern upon all the <hi>frightful
Judicatories</hi> of the World, and like
the <hi>Leviathan</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> could laugh
at the shaking of a Spear: Nay,
there have been some, who when
Persecution has rode in Triumph,
have carried the Bible as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their Graves; when wall'd
about with fire, they have hugg'd
it in their Arms, while their pains
grew rapture, and their burnings
extacy: And when their Tongues
were no longer able to form faint
Sounds into <hi>Vocal Hymns,</hi> with
lifted up Eyes, they have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
their Devotion, and offer'd
<hi>Dumb Praises</hi> to the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the
World.</p>
                  <p>And certainly 'tis a Sufficient
Ground of Consolation to any
generous Believer, when he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95302:85"/>
that <hi>Afflictions</hi> are not the
<hi>Blind Product</hi> of a Random desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but founded on the Basis of
God's Decree or Permission: And
when we are once fortified with
this puissant consideration, that
must needs be best for us, that
is commissioned by the hand of
a <hi>good and Gratious</hi> God; that
he is the Sole Disposer of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
and that he do's not stand
by as an unconcern'd <hi>Spectator</hi> of
the Mournful Scene of our suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
that the miseries we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
are the <hi>reproach of Christ,</hi> and
that they are far more <hi>Honourable</hi>
before God, than they can be
ignominious <hi>before the World;</hi>
this must needs cause our Souls
to bear up bravely against all the
Scorn and Terrors of the World,
against Natural Contradictions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> if we can entertain a
strong hope and assurance, that
what we sow in sufferings we shall
reap in Glory; that a violent
Death do's but conduct us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95302:85"/>
sooner to Heav'n, that a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Martyrdom</hi> do's but Antedate
Immortality; this is ravishment
enough, to tempt us, like <hi>Cato,</hi>
to be our own Executioners, did
not God restrain us by his word,
as an <hi>Angel</hi> did the <hi>Father of the
Faithful:</hi> This is enough to make
us cling to the <hi>Cross,</hi> to take Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by a <hi>more than Ordinnry vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi>
to breath out our Souls in
Eucharistical Strains, and return a
<hi>Psalm of Thanksgiving</hi> for every
Wound.</p>
                  <p>He that can thus consider things
well about him, will be all peace
and calm within himself, when
circled around with Wars and
Destruction: A Prison or a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
will be no confinement to
him; his Soul is still free to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with his <hi>Redeemer,</hi> while a
good Conscience becomes his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity:
Tho he hear the Voice of
his Maker in the Clouds, yet he
flies not the <hi>Adam</hi> behind a Tree;
nor like the guilty Emperour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95302:86"/>
a Bed for Protection. He
torments not himself with <hi>Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
and <hi>Tears,</hi> and superstitious
forebodings of Evils to come, but
is industriously thankful for those
blessings and mercies which at
present he enjoys: He knows,
that by the assistance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit he can turn a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
into a <hi>House of Prayer;</hi> that
Christ's presence will Consecrate
the horrours of a Prison, and make
<hi>Darkness</hi> it self <hi>Glorious:</hi> And if
the <hi>Light</hi> of his <hi>Countenance</hi> do
but shine in upon him, he
shall be <hi>Happy,</hi> tho' in the midst
of a <hi>Roman Furnace,</hi> or a <hi>Scottish
Inquisition.</hi>

                     <p>THat perfect Happiness or
Assimulation with God is
the ultimate end of every <hi>Rational
Being,</hi> is a Truth so obvious, that
even the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it; and as 'tis the ultimate
end of our Beings, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Duty; so is it likewise the
insatiate desire of <hi>every Man,</hi> the
common Thirst of our Natures:
Hence it was, that the Renowned
<hi>Plato</hi> did banish all <hi>absur'd and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
Notions</hi> of the Immortal
Gods out of his famous <hi>Republick,</hi>
and admit no other Descriptions of
the Deity, but such as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
and agreeable to his nature,
which he concludes to be <hi>pure and
unalterable Goodness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now since 'tis the natural Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95302:87"/>
of every Man to rise up to
a Conformity with what he adores;
such lovely and amiable Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of God, must needs kindle
a sweetness and benignity in our
Tempers, and naturally tend to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Peace and Stability of
the World: Especially, when we
consider, that 'twas the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our <hi>Blessed Saviour's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the World, to consummate
<hi>Peace</hi> betwixt Heav'n and Earth;
to reconcile all Mankind to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
God, and by sweetning our
Tempers by the infusions of <hi>Grace,</hi>
to make us <hi>love one another</hi> The
Law indeed, like a <hi>Typical Canaan,</hi>
might seem to shadow out the
<hi>brighter Discoveries</hi> of this <hi>new Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,</hi>
but it did not enjoyn 'em
in that <hi>universality of Extent,</hi> and
<hi>eminency of Degree,</hi> which our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour has advanc't 'em: for
what more astonishing than that
dreadful frequency of cursing their
Enemies <hi>under the Law,</hi> in the most
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95302:87"/>
rigorous and solemn Forms of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration?
Whereas the Christian
Religion allows no such Precedure
against the most Capital Enemy:
If he be a <hi>Celsus,</hi> a <hi>Porphyry,</hi> or a
<hi>Julian,</hi> we must do good good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; but we seem to forget that
we are Christians, if we go about
to pray for his Destruction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bless and Curse not</hi> is the <hi>Motto</hi> of
Christianity, the great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Precept of the Gospel:
'Twas this that was the inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
Armour of a Primitive
Christian; that gave a lustre even
to Martyrdom it self; that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Veneration, and an <hi>awful
Dread</hi> in the Breast of the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Heathen: 'Twas this
that softned the rudenesses of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
that captivated <hi>Rome's fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and triumphant Eagles,</hi> and
made <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> truckle to
Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:95302:88"/>Again, this will help to guard
us against the dangerous Rocks of
Presumption and Despair; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
God's <hi>Goodness</hi> is mostly to be
<hi>feared</hi> in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Impenitency,</hi> tho
'tis the <hi>only Refuge</hi> for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and repenting Sinner. His
Wisdom (by which he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the Ideas and mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencies
of all things) if seperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from this <hi>Attribute,</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into the extreamest Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Imposture. His <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
speaks little comfort to our
Souls, for <hi>he is of purer Eyes than
to behold Iniquity.</hi> His <hi>Justice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
must needs terrify and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
us, for <hi>if he should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream</hi>
to mark <hi>what we do amiss,</hi>
there's no Man can abide it. His
<hi>Power</hi> without <hi>Goodness</hi> is the
very Emphasis of Condemnation;
for he is able to destroy both
Soul and Body in Hell: But
when we have his <hi>Love</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95302:88"/>
for us, all other Attributes,
as they partake of this, will close
in perfect <hi>Harmony</hi> for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
his <hi>Justice</hi> will reward our
mean Services and Endeavours for
the sake of Christ's Merit, and
his Soveraign Power for ever will
protect us.</p>
                     <p>This will also secure us against
all worldly Accidents and foreign
Contingencies; render us undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the midst of Dangers, steady
and immoveable, tho all the world
should be in an uproar against us:
For when we are once <hi>environ'd
with this gallant Consideration,</hi> That
<hi>that is best which now is,</hi> since it
comes from the hands of a wise
and indulgent God; our Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Desires will all be wrapt
up in the <hi>divine Will,</hi> and we shall
act with full freedom and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of Mind, whensoever the
fiercest Calamities shall assault us;
like some <hi>departed Spirits caught up
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95302:89"/>
to Paradise,</hi> we shall stand above
the <hi>reach of Fortune,</hi> and the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the World;</hi> and our Souls
will shine bright, unsullied and
unmov'd above Clouds and Storms,
like the Lamps of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I have thought fit
to Discourse, for the sake of the
<hi>Author of the Account of</hi> DEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MARK;
for I know no Man
that has more need of a <hi>Sermon</hi>
or <hi>Solemn Lecture</hi> than himself.
If I have contributed any thing
towards a better Settlement of his
<hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> I have an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Recompence. However, at
least, I hope he will not take it
unkindly at my hands, that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him not quite harden'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Conviction.</p>
                     <p>I have ever thought, and do
persevere in my Opinion, That
the <hi>Pride</hi> of the <hi>Animal Life,</hi> a too
ardent Love of Riches and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95302:89"/>
Honours (which are pretty
glittering Bawbles indeed to please
Children in Understanding) and
a want of contemplating the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of another Life, are the main
<hi>Fundamental Objection</hi> and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
against the Passive Doctrines,
maintain'd by the genuine Sons of
the <hi>Church of England:</hi> This fills
Mens Hearts with coarse and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
desires; and makes their <hi>Heads
swell</hi> with the <hi>Wind</hi> of Fantastical
Doctrines about <hi>Liberty,</hi> without
a just restriction; Till at length
the Distemper or <hi>Malignancy</hi> breaks
out into a vain <hi>Out-cry</hi> against <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
and <hi>Slavish</hi> Opinions. This
makes Men play pragmatically
with the Names of <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>great Personages;</hi> and think it a
fine thing to find out, and correct
the <hi>Errors</hi> of their <hi>Superiors:</hi> 'Tis
this has occasion'd the Heats and
<hi>darling</hi> Contentions of the Age;
which have almost chang'd the
<hi>state</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> into a <hi>state of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95302:90"/>
War,</hi> and turn'd the World into
a dreadful Theatre of Blood-shed
and Confusion.</p>
                     <p>And now, since I have just men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
is so much Carpt and Rail'd at, I
will add thus much, that 'tis the
<hi>purest Church</hi> throughout the whole
Compass of <hi>Christendom,</hi> that I
know of; That she maintains the
nearest resemblance and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to true Primitive Christianity;
and notwithstanding all the <hi>little
Braveries,</hi> and vain contradictions of
her <hi>despairing Enemies,</hi> does still
retain her <hi>Antient Motto,</hi> I mean,
Her <hi>unshaken Allegiance</hi> to her
Prince: And therefore if God, out
of a just and anger and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for our Offences, should suffer
his <hi>Beloved</hi> to be <hi>carried into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi>
or laid waste by a <hi>Foreign</hi>
or <hi>Domestick</hi> Power; Yet this
shall be her <hi>Triumph</hi> in the midst
of her Tribulations, That She was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95302:90"/>
never guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
Sacriledge or Rebellion;</hi> and
that nothing else but those cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Abominations, which her
Principles disclaim, have ruin'd
and destroy'd Her. I desire to
embrace her with an <hi>Apostolical</hi>
warmth, and a <hi>Primitive</hi> Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and may say unto Her, as
our <hi>Saviour</hi> does to his <hi>Beloved</hi>
in the <hi>Canticles, O my Dove
that art in the Clefts of the
Rock, in the secret places of
the Stairs, let me see thy
Countenance; let me hear thy
Voice, for sweet is thy Voice,
and thy Countenance Comly. <hi>O
thou</hi> Lilly among Thorns!
<hi>O</hi> Fairest among the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!</hi>
Let me enjoy thee Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
and when Death shall
come, may I dye in thy
Embraces, and breath out
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95302:91"/>
my Soul in Amorous fits of
Devotion: That <hi>Phaenix-like,</hi>
being resin'd by Corruption,
and kindling anew in the
very Act of Extinction, I
may mount aloft into the
<hi>Bridegrooms Palace,</hi> and fly
out of thy <hi>Arms</hi> into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Bosom.</p>
