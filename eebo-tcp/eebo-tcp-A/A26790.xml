            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>—And so shall we ever be with the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Words are a Consolation,
brought by the Apostle from the
<hi>tbird Heaven,</hi> where he was by
extraordinary Priviledg rais'd, and
saw and understood how great a
Happiness it is to be with Christ. And they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest
to Believers, to moderate and allay their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
for the Death of those Saints, who by their
Conjunction in Blood or Friendship were most
dear to them. Thus he speaks in the 13 Verse,
<hi>I would not have you be ignorant, Brethren, concerning
them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not as others, which
have no hope.</hi> The Heathens, that were Strangers
to a future State, and thought that after a short
Course through the World, Mankind would be
lost for ever in the Dead Sea, might with some
pretence abandon themselves to the Extremity of
their Passions. But Christians, to <hi>whom Life
and Immortality are reveal'd by the Gospel; who
believe, that as</hi> JESUS <hi>died and rose again; So all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43454:3"/>
that sleep in JESUS, that persevere</hi> in Faith and
Holiness to the end, <hi>GOD will bring with Him,</hi>
are forbid, upon the most weighty Reasons, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their Grief in excess. The Union between
Christ and Believers is inviolable; and from thence
it follows, they shall be Partakers with him in his
Glory. The Soul immediately after Death <hi>shall be
with Christ:</hi> vvhiles the Body reposes in the Grave,
'tis in his Presence who is Life and Light, and has
a vital joyful Rest in Communion with him. And
in the appointed Time the Bodies of the Saints,
those happy Spoils, shall be rescued from the dark
Prison of the Grave, and be Sharers with their
Souls in immortal Glory.</p>
            <p>This consummate Happiness of the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Apostle assures from the highest Authority,
<hi>the Word of the Lord;</hi> and describes his glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
so as to make the strongest Impression
on our Minds. <hi>For the Lord himself shall descend
from Heaven, with a Shout, with the Voice of an Arch-Angel,
and with the Trump of God; and the Dead in
Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
shall be caught up together with them in the Clouds,
to meet the Lord in the Air; and so shall we ever be with
the Lord.</hi> Then Death, the last Enemy, so fearful and
feared by Men, shall be destroyed. And the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Prince of the World, with all the powers of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43454:3"/>
darkness, and all other rebellious Sinners that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
joyn'd vvith him, shall be brought in
Chains before his dreadful Tribunal: and after the
great Act of the Universal Judgment shall be
compleated, then shall the Saints make their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Entry with the Captain of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
into his Kingdom, and <hi>shall ever be with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The general Proposition from the Words is
this;</hi> The Saints after the Resurrection shall be
Compleatly and Eternally happy in the Presence of
Christ.</p>
            <p>To make this supernatural Blessedness more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and intelligible to us, the Scripture describes it
by sensible Representations. For while the Soul is
cloath'd with flesh, Fancy has such a dominion, that
we can conceive of nothing but by Comparisons
and Images taken from material things. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
set forth by a <hi>Feast,</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Joy and Glory of that State. But to prevent
all gross conceits; it tells us that the Bodies of the
Saints shall be spiritual, not capable of hunger and
thirst, nor consequently of any refreshment that
is caused by the satisfaction of those appetites. The
objects of the most noble senses, Seeing and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the pleasure of which is mix'd with Reason,
and not common to the Brutes, are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made use of to reconcile that glorious State to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43454:4"/>
the proportion of our minds. Thus sometimes the
Blessed are represented plac'd <hi>on Thrones with Crowns
on their heads;</hi> sometimes <hi>cloathed in White, with Palms
in their hands;</hi> sometimes singing Songs of triumph
<hi>to Him that sits on the Throne,</hi> and to their Saviour.
But the reality of this Blessedness infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
all those faint Metaphors. Heaven is lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Comparisons from earthly things. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
who was dignifi'd with the revelation of the
successes that shall happen to the Church till Time
shall be no more, tells us, <hi>it does not appear what we
shall be in Eternity. The things that God has prepar'd
for those that love him,</hi> are far more above the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ascent of our thoughts, than the Marriage-Feast
of a great Prince exceeds in splendor and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
the imagination of one that has alwayes
liv'd in an obscure Village, and never saw any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of State, nor tasted Wine in his Life.
We can think of those things but according to
the poverty of our Understandings. But so
much we know that is able to sweeten all the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness,
and render insipid all the sweetness of this
World.</p>
            <p>This will appear by considering that whatever
is requisite to constitute the perfect Blessedness of
Man, is fully enjoy'd in the Divine Presence.</p>
            <p>1. An exemption from all evils, is the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43454:4"/>
of perfect Blessedness. The sentence
of wise <hi>Solon</hi> is true in another sense than he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<q>
                  <l>—Dicique beatus</l>
                  <l>Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet.</l>
               </q>
No Man can be named happy whilst in this valley
of Tears. But upon the entrance into Heaven,
all those evils that by their number, variety, or
weight disquiet and oppress us, are at an end.</p>
            <p>Sin, of all evils the most hateful, shall be abolisht.
And all Temptations that surround us, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
our innocence, shall cease. Here the best Men
lament the weakness of the flesh, and sometimes
the violent assaults of spiritual enemies. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himself breaks forth into a mournful Complaint,
<hi>O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver me from this
body of Death?</hi> And when harrass'd with the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets
of Satan, renews his most earnest addresses to
God to be freed from them. Here our Purity is
not absolute, we must be always cleansing our
selves from the reliques of that deep defilement
that cleaves to our nature.</p>
            <p>Here our peace is preserv'd with the Sword in
our hand, by a continual Warfare against Satan
and the World. But in Heaven no ignorance dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
the Mind, no passions rebel against the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43454:5"/>
Will, no inherent pollution remains. The
Church is <hi>without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.</hi>
And all Temptations <hi>that war against the Soul,</hi> shall
then cease. The Tempter was cast out of Heaven,
and none of his poison'd Arrows can reach that
Purified Company. <hi>Glorious Liberty!</hi> here ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
desir'd, but fully enjoy'd by the Sons of
God above.</p>
            <p>And as Sin, so all the penal consequences of it
are quite taken away. The present Life is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
disease, and sometimes attended with that
sharp sense that Death is desir'd as a remedy, and
accepted as a benefit. And though the Saints have
reviving Cordials, yet their joys are mixt with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
nay, caused by sorrows. The tears of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are their sweetest refreshment. Here the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
stones</hi> are cut and wounded, and made fit by
Sufferings for a Temple unto God in the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
But as in the building of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the noise of a hammer was not heard, for all
the parts were fram'd before with that exact design
and correspondence, that they firmly combin'd
together. They were hew'n in another place, and
nothing remain'd but the putting them one upon
another in the Temple; and then, as sacred, they
were inviolable. So God, <hi>the wise Architect,</hi> having
prepar'd the Saints here by many cutting Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43454:5"/>
places them in the <hi>Eternal Building,</hi> where no
voice of Sorrow is heard. Of the innumerable
Company above, is there any Eye that weeps, any
Breast that sighs, any Tongue that complains, or
appearance of Grief? The Heavenly State is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Life,</hi> as only worthy of that title. There is
no infirmity of Body, no Poverty, no Disgrace, no
Treachery of Friends, no Persecution of Enemies.
<hi>There is no more Death, nor Sorrow, nor Crying, nor shall
there be any more Pain:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 4.</note> 
               <hi>for former things are past away.</hi>
God <hi>will wipe away all tears from the eyes of his People.</hi>
Their Salvation is compleat in all degrees. Pure
Joy is the Priviledg of Heaven, unmixed Sorrows
the punishment of Hell.</p>
            <p>A concurrence of all positive Excellencies is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to Blessedness. And these are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
with respect to the entire Man.</p>
            <p>1. The Body shal be awak'd out of its dead sleep,
and quickned into a glorious immortal Life. The
Soul and Body are the essential parts of Man; and
though the inequality be great in their operations
that respect Holiness, yet their concourse is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
Good Actions are design'd by the Counsel
and Resolution of the Spirit, but perform'd by the
Ministry of the Flesh. Every Grace expresses it self
in visible actions by the Body. In the sorrows
of Repentance it supplies tears, in Fastings its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43454:6"/>
are restrain'd, in Thanksgivings the tongue
breaks forth into the joyful praises of God. All
the victories over sensible pleasure and pain are
obtain'd by the Soul in conjunction with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Now 'tis most becoming the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
not to deal so differently, that the Soul should
be everlastingly happy, and the Body lost in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness;
the one glorified in Heaven, the other
remain in the dust. From their first setting out
in the World to the Grave they ran the same Race,
and shall enjoy the same Reward. Here the Body
is the Consort of the Soul in obedience and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
hereafter in fruition. When the Crown of
Purity, or Palm of Martyrdom shall be given by
the great Judg in the view of all, they shall both
partake in the honour. Of this we have an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in the Resurrection of Christ in his true Body,
who <hi>is the first fruits of them that sleep.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>He shall change
our vile Bodies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that they may be fashioned like to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Body, according to the working of his Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is able to subdue all things to himself.</hi> A substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
unfading Glory will shine in them infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the perishing Pride of this World, that is but
in appearance, like the false colours painted on the
feathers of a Dove by the reflection of the Light,
which presently vanish, when it changeth its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
or the Light is withdrawn. Indeed what can
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43454:6"/>
be more glorious than to be conform'd to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
of Christ, the seat of all Beauty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
This Conformity shall be the work of
his own hands. And when Omnipotence inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
nothing is difficult. The raising the Body to
an unchangeable state of Glory, is as easy to the
Divine Power, as the forming it at the first in the
womb. As the Sun labours no more in the Mines
in the forming Gold and Silver, the most precious
and durable Metals, than in the production of a
poor short-liv'd Flower.</p>
            <p>II. The Soul shall be made perfect in all its
faculties.</p>
            <p>1. The Uuderstanding shall clearly see the
most excellent Objects.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Now we know but in part.</hi>
The naked beauty of Divine Things is vail'd, and
of impossible discovery. And the weakness of the
mind is not proportionable to their dazling bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But when that which is perfect is come, <hi>then
that which is in part shall be done away.</hi> In that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
state, the glorious manifestation of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
shall as much exceed the clearest revealing of
them here, as the Sun in its full lustre, one beam of
Light strain'd through a crevice in the Wall. And
the Understanding shall be prepar'd to take a full
view of them Therefore the Apostle compares
the several Periods of the Church in respect of the

degrees of Knowledg, to the several Ages of this
Life. <hi>When I was a Child, I spake as a Child, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as a Child, I thought as a Child: but when I became
a Man, I put away childish things.</hi> In Children the
organs, either from an excess of moisture, or their
smalness, are indisposed for the vigorous exercise
of the Mind: some strictures of Reason appear, a
presaging sign what will be, but mixt with much
obscurity. But when the organs are come to their
just proportion and temperament, the Soul displays
its strength and activity.</p>
            <p>All things of a supernatural order shall then be
clearly discovered. The contrivance of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the wayes of conducting us to Blessedness,
which are objects of a sublime nature, will afford
an exquisite pleasure to the Understanding. All
the secrets of our Redemption shall be unsealed.
<hi>The great Mystery of Godliness,</hi> the Incarnation
of the Eternal Son, and his according Justice
with Mercy, shall then be apparent. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Counsels in governing the World, are now
only visible in their wonderful effects either of
Mercy or of Justice, and those most dreadful; but
the Reasons of them are past finding out. But
what our Saviour said to <hi>Peter, What I do, thou
knowest not now, but shalt know hereafter,</hi> is applicable
to these impenetrable dispensations. All the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43454:7"/>
Fountains of Wisdom, as clear as deep, shall
then be opened. We shall then see the beauty of
Providence in disposing temporal things in order
to our eternal felicity. We now see as it were
the rough part, and Knots of that curious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery:
but then the whole Work shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded,
the sweetness of the Colours, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Figures appear. There we shall be
able to expound the perplexing Riddle, <hi>How out of
the Eater came meat, and out of the Strong came sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
For we shall know as we are known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We shall see God.</hi> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>This
is Life Eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> The beginning and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of our Happiness consists in this knowledg.
The Deity is spiritual and invisible to the Eye of
the Body, infinite and incomprehensible to the
Soul. But we shall then so clearly understand the
<hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> that our present knowledg com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to that, is but as the seeing a dark resemblance
in a Glass, to the clear view of a Person in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
beauty of his Face. God is most gloriously
present in Heaven. For according to the degrees of
excellence in the Work, such are the impressions and
discoveries of the Vertues of the Cause. Now all
sensible things in the low order of Nature, are but
weak resultances from his Perfections, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43454:8"/>
of their illustrious Effects in the Divine
World. The Glories of the Place, and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
the Angels and Saints, clearly express his
Majesty, Goodness and Power. But in a transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
manner he exhibits himself in the glorified
Mediator. He is stiled <hi>the brightness of the Father's
Glory, and the express image of his Person;</hi> not only
for his equal Perfections in respect of the unity of
their Nature, but to signifie that God in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the incarnate Mediator is so fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us, that by the sight of him we see God
himself in his unchangeable Excellencies. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the following words, that <hi>having purged
us from our sins, he sate down on the right-hand of the
Majesty on high,</hi> for they respect the Son of God
as united to the humane Nature, in which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the Office of the Priesthood, and took pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his glorious Kingdom. During his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
state, the Divine vertues, Wisdom, Goodness,
Holiness, Power, were so visible in his Person,
Life, Revelations, and miraculous Works, that when
<hi>Philip</hi> so long'd for the sight of the Father as the
only consummate Blessedness, <hi>Shew us the Father,
and it suffices;</hi> He told him, <hi>he that has seen me, has
seen the Father also.</hi> But how brightly do they appear
in his triumphant Exaltation. 'Twas his Prayer on
Earth; <hi>Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43454:8"/>
me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory.</hi>
Inestimable Felicity! whether we consider him in
the respect of an Object, that incomparably tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
all the created Glory of Heaven, or in the
relation of our Head, on a double account; partly
because he was debased into the form of a Servant,
and suffered all Indignities and Cruelties of Sinners
for us, has received the Recompence of his Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sufferings, the triumph of his Victory, <hi>being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with the Father with the Glory he had before the World
was;</hi> and partly because every Member shall be
conformed to him in his Glory; <hi>We shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is.</hi> And all Felicity and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is compriz'd in that Promise. The sight of the
Face of <hi>Moses</hi> when radiant, had no transforming
efficacy; for the light of it was not in him as its
source, but by derivation. But God is Light <hi>essentially,</hi>
and the sight of his Perfections will be productive
of his <hi>Likeness</hi> in us, so far as it may be in a restrained
subject. When our Saviour was upon the <hi>holy Mount,</hi>
and one vanishing Beam of Glory appear'd in his
<hi>Transfiguration, Peter</hi> was so transported at the sight,
that he forgot the World and himself. How ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then will the sight of him be in his triumphant
Majesty, when we shall be transfigured our selves?</p>
            <p>2. As they shall behold God's Face, know his
most amiable Excellencies; so they shall love him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43454:9"/>
as perfectly as they know him. To the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Mind, there are correspondent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on the Heart. In the present state our
Love is imperfect, and as Fire out of its sphere,
dies away, by our neglect to feed it with proper
materials, enamouring considerations of God. But
'tis not so in Heaven: there the Divine Sun attracts
every Eye with the light of its beauty, and inflames
every Heart with the heat of his Love. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Presence of God is in different respects the
Cause and Effect of our Love to him. For there
is no more powerful Attractive to love him, than
to see him; And Love keeps the thoughts undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from him. <hi>God is Love,</hi> and will kindle in
us a pure Affection that Eternity shall never lessen.</p>
            <p>Our Affections that are now scattered on many
things, wherein some small Reflections of his
Goodness appear, shall joyn in one full Current in
Heaven, where <hi>God is all in all.</hi> We shall then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the riches of his Love, that God who is
infinitely happy in himself, should make Man for
such a Glory, and such a Glory for Man. And that
when for his Rebellion he was justly expell'd from
Paradise, and under a sentence of Eternal Death,
God should please to restore him to his Favour,
and give him a better state than was forfeited. We
shall then understand our infinite Obligations to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43454:9"/>
the Son of God, who descended from the Heaven
of Heavens to our Earth; and which is more,
from the Majesty wherein he there reign'd, from
the Glory wherein he was visible to the Angelical
Minds, and became Man for Men, Redemption
for the Lost, to purchase Immortal Life for those
who were dead to that blessed Life. In short, then
God will express his Love to us in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
that a finite Creature is capable to receive
from Love it self, and we shall love him with all
the strength of our glorified powers.</p>
            <p>3. Compleat satisfaction flows from union with
God by Knowledg and Love. <hi>In his Presence is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Joy, at his Right-hand are Pleasures for ever.</hi>
The Causes and Excellencies of the Heavenly
Life are in those words exprest. The Causes are
the influxive Presence of God, the revelation of his
attractive Perfections, the beholding his Face, the
declaration of his peculiar Favour. This our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lord himself had a respect to, as the compleat
Reward of his Sufferings: <hi>Thou shalt make me full of
Joy with thy Countenance.</hi> And his <hi>Right-Hand,</hi> his
Bounty, that dispenses, and Power that secures that
Felicity. The Excellencies of this state are fulness
of Joy, and that without diminution, or end.</p>
            <p>When the Soul opens its eyes to the clear disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of the first Truth, and its breast to the dear
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43454:10"/>
and intimate imbraces of the Supream Good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which nothing remains to be known, nothing
to be enjoy'd, what a deluge of the purest Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
will overflow it? We cannot ascend in our
thoughts so high, as to conceive the excess of Joy
that attends those operations of the glorified Soul
upon its proper object. But something we may
conjecture.</p>
            <p>Those who are possest with a noble Passion for
Knowledg, how do they despise all lower Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in comparison of it? How do they forget
themselves, neglect the Body, and retire into the
Mind, the highest part of Man, and nearest to
God? The bare apprehension of such things that
by their internal nature have no attractive influence
upon the Affections, is pleasant to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
As the appearance of Light, though not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with any other visible beauties, refreshes the
Eye after long darkness: so the clear discovery
of Truths, how abstract so ever, that were before
unknown, is grateful to the intellective faculty.
Thus some have been strangely transported with
the pleasure of a Mathematical Demonstration,
when the evidence, not the importance of the thing
was so ravishing; for what is more dry and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
of delight than the speculation of Figures and
Numbers? <hi>Solon</hi> when near his end, and some of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43454:10"/>
his Friends that visited him were speaking softly
of a Point of Philosophy, by a sound of Wisdom
was awaken'd from the sleep of Death that was
just seizing on him, and opening his eyes, and
raising his head to give attention; being ask'd the
reason of it? answered, <hi>That when</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vt cu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>I understand
what you are discoursing of, I may die.</hi> Such was his
delight in Knowledg, that a little of it made his
Agony insensible. But here are many imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that lessen this intellectual Pleasure, which
shall cease in Heaven. Here the acquisition of
Knowledge is often with the expence of Health:
the flower of the Spirits, necessary for Natural O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
is wasted by intense thoughts. How
often are the Learned sickly? As the Flint when
'tis struck, gives not a spark without consuming it
self; So Knowledge is obtain'd by Studies that
waste our faint sensitive faculties. But then our
Knowledge shall be a free emanation from the
spring of Truth, without our labour and pains.
Here we learn by circuit, and discern by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
things; our Ignorance is dispell'd by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
succession of Light: But then Universal
Knowledg shall be infused in a moment. Here
after all our labour and toyl, how little Knowledg
do we gain? Every Question is a Labyrinth out
of which the nimblest and most searching Minds
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43454:11"/>
cannot extricate themselves. How many specious
Errors impose upon our understandings? We look
on things by false Lights, through deceiving Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles:
But then our Knowledge shall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and compleat. There is no forbidden Tree in
the Celestial Paradise, as no inordinate Affection.
But suppose that all things in the compass of the
World were known yet still there would be empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and anguish in the Mind: for the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
knowledg of things that are insufficient
to make us happy, cannot afford true Satisfaction.
But then we shall see God in all his Excellencies,
the supream Object and End, the only Felicity of
the Soul. How will the sight of his Glory person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
shining in our Redeemer, in the first moment
quench our extream thirst, and fill us with joy and
admiration? 'Tis not as the naked conception of
Treasures, that only makes rich in <hi>ideas,</hi> but that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
sight gives a real Interest in him. The Angels
are so ravish'd with the Beauties and Wonders of
his Face, that they never divert a moment from the
contemplation of it.</p>
            <p>2. The pure Love of the Saints to God is then
fully satisfied. Love considered as an affection of
Friendship is always attended with two desires; to
be assured of Reciprocal Love, and to enjoy the
Conversation of the Person beloved, the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43454:11"/>
of his esteem and good-will. This kind of
<note n="‖" place="margin">Aristot.</note> affection seems to be inconsistent with that infinite
distance that is between God and the Creature.
But though 'tis disproportionable to the Divine
Majesty, 'tis proportionable to his Goodness. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
our Saviour promises, <hi>He that loves me,
shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest my self unto him.</hi> And to confirm our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of this astonishing Condescention, repeats it,
<hi>If a Man love me, my Father will love him, and we will
come to him, and make our abode with him.</hi> In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state, the signs of God's special Favour are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to his Friends. Now he bestows on them
the Honour of being his Sons, the Graces and
Comforts of his Spirit, the precious Earnests of his
Love, <hi>and Seal of their Redemption.</hi> But in eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of degrees, the effects of his Love are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more glorious in Heaven. Here the Saints
are adopted, there crown'd. There he opens all
the bright Treasures of his Wisdom, the Riches of
his Goodness, the Beauties of his Holiness, the
Glories of his Power, and by the intimate appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his Presence makes his Love most sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them. O the mutual delights between God
and glorified Souls! God looks on them with an
engaged Eye, as his own by many dear titles, and
is well pleased in his own Goodness to them, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43454:12"/>
ravish'd with the reflex of his own Excellencies
shining in them. <hi>As the Bridegroom rejoyces over the
Bride,</hi> ('tis the language of Divine Love) <hi>so their
God rejoyces over them.</hi> And what a blessed Rest do
they find in the compleat fruition of their Beloved?
All their desires quietly expire in his Bosom. What
triumphs of Joy follow? Can we frame a fuller
Conception of Happiness than to be perfectly
loved by infinite Goodness, and perfectly to love
him?</p>
            <p>3. The most perfect Joy of the Saints is for the
Felicity and Glory of God himself. For as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Soul feels no more powerful motive to love
God, than because he is most worthy of it, as he is
God, a Being of infinite Excellencies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be loved above the dearest Persons and
Things, even it self; so the highest Joy it partakes
of is from this consideration, that God is infinitely
blessed &amp; glorious. For in this the supream desire of
love is accomplish'd, that the most beloved Object
is perfectly honour'd and pleased. In Heaven the
Love of the Saints to God is in its highest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and they see his Glory in the most perfect
manner, which causes a transcendent Joy to them.
And this is one reason why the Saints though shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with unequal degrees of Glory, are equally
content. For their most ardent Love being set on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43454:12"/>
               <hi>God,</hi> that he is pleas'd to glorify himself by such
various communications of his Goodness, is full
satisfaction to their desires. Besides, in those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees of Glory, every one is so content with
his own,<note n="†" place="margin">Sic it<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>at ne velit amplius. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> that there is no possible desire of being
but what he is.</p>
            <p>4. The full joy of Heaven shall continue without
diminution, or end. The number of Possessours
cannot lessen it. The Divine Presence is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wasted
Spring of Pleasure, equally full and open
to all, and abundantly sufficient to satisfy the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity
of their desires. Envy reigns in this World,
because earthly things are so imperfect in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and so peculiar in their possession, that they
cannot suffice, nor be enjoyed by all. But in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
none is touch'd with that low base passion: for
God contains all that is precious and desirable in
the highest degrees of Perfection, and all partake
of the influence of his universal Goodness without
intercepting one another. In the Kingdom above
there is no cause for the elder Brother to repine at
the Father's Bounty to the younger, nor for the
younger to supplant the elder, to obtain the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
The Heirs of God are all rais'd to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Glory. Every one enjoys him as entirely
and fully, as if solely his felicity. God is a <hi>Good</hi>
as <hi>indivisible</hi> as <hi>infinite,</hi> and not diminish'd by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43454:13"/>
most liberal communications of Himself. We may
illustriate this by comparing the Price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and the Reward. The Death of Christ
is a universal benefit to all the Saints, yet 'tis so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to every Believer for his perfect Redemption,
as if our Saviour in all his Agonies and Sufferings
had no other in his Eye and Heart; as if all his
Prayers, his Tears, his Blood were offer'd up to his
Father only for that Person. The common respect
of it the Apostle declares in those admirable words,
that signify such an excess of God's Love to us, <hi>He
that spared not his own Son, but deliver'd him up for us
all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</hi>

Apostle tells us, <hi>The Life which I now live in the flesh,
I live by the Faith of the Son of God; who loved me, and
gave himself for me:</hi> as if he were the sole Object
of Christ's Love, the End and Reward of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
And this appropriating of it to himself, is
no prejudice to the rights of all others. St. <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
himself by that truly glorious Title, <hi>The
Disciple whom Jesus loved.</hi> Could he speak this of
himself without the injury and indignation of the
other Disciples? Certainly he might. For if we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43454:13"/>
consider that incomprehensible Love of Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
to them all at his last Supper, after <hi>Judas</hi> was
gone forth; <hi>As the Father hath loved me, so I have
loved you.</hi> We may easily understand, that every
one of them might justly believe that he was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
beloved of Christ. They were all received
in the Heart, though (with <hi>John</hi>) they did not all
lean on the Breast of their Divine Master. Thus
in Heaven God is the universal Treasure of all the
Saints,<note place="margin">Si audia multitudo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> and the peculiar Portion of every one. As
by his Essence he equally fills the whole World,
and every part of it; and by his Providence equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regards all and every particular Creature; so
in Heaven he dispenses the Riches of his Love to
all, that they cannot desire more, if every one of
them, were (if I may so express it) the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of <hi>the only begotten himself,</hi> the sole Heir of all
the Merits of his Son. Every Saint may with the
inflamed Spouse break forth in that Triumph of
Love; <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> Nay,
the great number of the glorifi'd Saints is so far
from lessening their Joy, that it unspeakably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
it. <hi>The innumerable Company of Angels, and the
General Assembly of the Church of the First-born,</hi> next
to the happiness of enjoying God, are a chief part
of Heaven. An unfeigned ardent Affection unites
that pure society. Our Love is now kindled either
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43454:14"/>
from a relation in Nature, or some visible Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
that render a Person worthy of our choice
and friendship: but in Heaven the Reasons are
greater, and the degrees of Love incomparably
more fervent. All Carnal Alliances and Respects
cease in that supernatural state. The Apostle tells
us, <hi>If I have known Christ after the flesh, I know him so
no more.</hi> By the Resurrection and Ascension of
Christ he was transported into another World, and
had communion with him as an Heavenly King,
without low regards to the temporal Priviledge of
conversing with him on Earth. The Spiritual rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is more near and permanent than the strictest
band of Nature. The Saints have all relation to
the same Heavenly Father, and to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the
Prince of Peace, and Head of that happy Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The principal motive of Love here is for the
inherent Excellencies of a Person. Wisdom, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
Goodness, Fidelity are mighty Attractives,
and produce a more worthy Affection, a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Confederacy of Souls than propinquity in
Nature. <hi>David</hi> declares that <hi>all his delight was in the
Excellent.</hi> But there are allays of this Noble Love
here. For,</p>
            <p>1. There are reliques of Frailty in the best Men
on Earth, some Blemishes that render them less
amiable when discovered. Here their Graces are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43454:14"/>
mixt Infirmities, and but ascending to Glory.
Accordingly our Love to them must be regular,
and serene; not clouded with Error, mistaking
defects for amiable qualities. But in Heaven, the
Image of God is compleat, by the union of all the
glorious Vertues requisite to its perfection. Every
Saint there exactly agrees with the first Exemplar,
is transformed according to the primitive beauty
of Holiness. No <hi>spot or wrinkle remains,</hi> nor any
such thing, that may cast the least aspect of defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
upon them.</p>
            <p>2. In the present state the least part of the Saints
worth is visible. As the Earth is fruitful in Plants
and Flowers, but its riches are in the Mines of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Metals, the veins of Marble hidden in its
bosom. True Grace appears in sensible Actions,
<hi>but its Glory is within.</hi> The sincerity of Aims, the
purity of Affections, the impresses of the Spirit on
the Heart, the interiour beauties of Holiness, are
only seen by God. Besides, such is the humility of
eminent Saints, that the more they abound in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
treasures, the less they show. As the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bodies when in nearest conjunction with the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and fullest of light, make the least appearance
to our sight. But all their Excellencies shall then be
in view. <hi>The Glory of God shall be revealed in them.</hi>
And how attractive is the Divine Likeness to an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43454:15"/>
holy Eye? How will it ravish the Saints to behold
an immortal Loveliness shining in one another?
Their Love is mutual and reflexive, proportionable
to the cause of it. An equal constant Flame is
preserv'd by pure Materials. Every one is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amiable, and perfectly enamour'd with all.
Now can we frame a fuller conception of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than such a State of Love, wherein whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is pleasant in Friendship is in perfection, and
whatever is distastful by Mens folly and weakness
is abolish'd? The Psalmist breaks out in a Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Behold <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ow good and pleasant it is for Brethren to
dwell together in Unity!</hi> Love is the Beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
Strength of Societies, the Pleasure of Life. How
excellent is the Joy of the Blessed, when the Prayer
of Christ shall be accomplish'd, that they all may
be <hi>one; as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that
they also may be one in us.</hi> God is absolutely One
in his glorious Nature and Will, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably
happy; And their inviolable Union in
Love, is a Ray of the Essential Unity between the
sacred Persons. There are no Divisions of Heart
and Tongues, as in this <hi>Babel;</hi> but the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and sweetest Concord, an Eternal Agreement
in Tempers and Inclinations. There are no envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Comparisons, for Love that affectively trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
one into another, causes the Glory of every
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43454:15"/>
Saint to redound to the Joy of all. Every one takes
his share in the Felicity of all, and adds to it. Such
is the power of that Celestial Fire wherein they all
burn, that it melts and mixes Souls in such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Union, that by Complacence and an intimate
Joy, the Blessedness of all is, as it were, proper to
every one; as if every one were plac'd in the
Hearts of all, and all in the Heart of every one.
If in the Church of the first born Christians in the
earthly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Band of Charity was so strict
that 'tis said, the <hi>Multitude of Believers were of one
Heart, and one Soul;</hi> How much more intimate and
inseparable is the Union of the Saints in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
above, where every one loves another as himself?
'Tis recorded of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that entring with <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phestion</hi>
his Favourite, into the Pavilion of <hi>Darius</hi>

Favourite, as having a greater appearance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,

whom the generous King replied,<note place="margin">

This is a Copy of the holy Love of the Blessed;
but with the same difference, as between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43454:16"/>
of a Star with a Coal, and its Beauty in its
proper Aspect. And where all is Love, all is Delight.
O how do they enjoy and triumph in the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of one another? With what an unimaginable
tenderness do they embrace? What Reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Endearments are between them? O their
ravishing Conversation, and sweet Entercourse!
for their Presence together in Heaven is not a silent
Show. In the Transfiguration, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
talk't with Christ. With what excellent discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
do they entertain one another? If <hi>David</hi> felt
such inward pleasure from the sence of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
that he could not restrain the expression of
it, but invites the Saints, <hi>Come and hear, all ye that
fear the Lord, and I will tell you what he has done for my
Soul.</hi> Certainly in Heaven, the blessed with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
affections recount the Divine Benefits, the
admirable Methods, whereby the Life of Grace
was begun, preserv'd and carried on in the midst
of Temptations; the continual Succession of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the time of their Hopes, and the Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of all in the time of their Enjoyment. How
joyfully do they concur in their thanksgivings to
God for the goodness of Creation, in making them
reasonable Creatures, capable to know, love and
enjoy Him, when they might have been of the
lowest Order in the whole sphere of Beings; for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43454:16"/>
his compassionate care and providence over them
in this World. But especially for his sovereign
Mercy in electing them to be vessels of honour;
for his powerful Grace, in rescuing them from the
cruel and ignominious bondage of Sin; for his
most free Love, that justified them from all their
guilt by the Death of his only Son, and glorified
them with himself. They are never weary in this
delightful exercise, but continually bless him for
his Mercy that endures for ever. We may
judge by the Saints here, when they are in a
fit disposition to praise God, what fervours they
feel in their united Praises of him in Heaven. The
<hi>Psalmist</hi> in an Extasie calls to all the parts of the
World to joyn with him; <hi>The Lord reigns, let the
Heavens rejoyce, and the Earth be glad; let the Sea
roar, let the Fields be joyful, and all that dwell therein.</hi> He
desires that Nature should be elevated above it self,
that the dead parts be inspir'd with Life, the insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
feel Motions of Joy, and those that want a
Voice break forth in praises, to adorn the Divine
Triumph. With what Life and Alacrity will the
Saints in their blessed Communion celebrate the
Object of their Love and Praises? The <hi>Seraphims</hi>
about the Throne <hi>cryed to one another,</hi> to express
their Zeal and Joy, in celebrating his Eternal
Purity and Power, and the Glory of his Goodness.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43454:17"/>
O the unspeakable Pleasure of this Concert! when
every Soul is harmonious, and contributes his part
to the full Musick of Heaven. O could we hear
but some <hi>Eccho</hi> of those Songs wherewith the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Heavens resounds, some remaines of those
Voices wherewith the Saints above <hi>triumph in the
Praises,</hi> in the solemn Adoration of the King of
Spirits, how would it inflame our desires to be
joyn'd with them? <hi>Blessed are those that are in thy
House, they always praise thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The fulness of Joy in Heaven is undecaying;
for the causes of it are always equal. And those
are the Beatifick Object reveal'd, and the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
Contemplation of it. Whilest we are
here below, the Sun of Righteousness, as to our
perception and sence, has ascensions and declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
accesses and recesses. And our Earth is not so
purified, but some Vapours arise that intercept his
chearful refreshing Light. From hence there are
alternate successions of Spiritual Comforts and
Sorrows, of Doubts and filial Confidence in the
Saints. 'Tis a rare favour of Heaven, when an
humble Believer in his whole course is so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
as not to provoke God to appear displeased
against him: When a Christian (as those tutelar
Angels spoken of in the Gospel) always beholds
the face of his Heavenly Father, and converses with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43454:17"/>
him with an holy Liberty. And what a torment the
<hi>hiding of God's Face</hi> is to a deserted Soul, only they
know who feel it. External troubles are many
times attended with more Consolations to the
Spirit, than Afflictions to Sense; but to love God
with a transcendent Affection, and to fear he is our
Enemy, no Punishment exceeds, or is equal to it.
As his Loving-kindness in their esteem is better
than Life, so his Displeasure is worse than Death.
How do they wrestle with God by Prayers and
Tears, and offer, as it were, a holy Violence to the
King of Heaven, to recover their first serenity of
Mind, the lost Peace of Heart? How passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do they cry out, with <hi>Job,</hi> in the Book of his
Patience,<note place="margin">Job 29. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>O that I were as in months past, as in the days
when God preserved me: when his Candle shin'd upon my
head, and when by his Light I walk'd through darkness:
As I was in the days of my youth, when the Secret of God
was upon my Tabernacle.</hi> And sometimes God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
the revealing himself even to his dearest Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
not that he does not see their Necessities,
and hears their Prayers, or is so hard that till
their Extremities he is not moved with Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but for wise and holy Reasons; Either <hi>that
they may not return to folly,</hi> if by any presumptuous
Sin they forfeited their Peace; or if they have been
careful to please him, yet he may deprive them of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43454:18"/>
Spiritual Comforts for a time, to keep them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that with an obedient resignation to his
Sovereign Pleasure they may wait for his reviving
Presence. And then Joy returns greater than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For thus God usually renders with interest
what he suspended only for tryal. But the Saints
above are for ever enlightned with the vital splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and dear regards of his Countenance, always
enjoy his beamy smiles. A continual effusion of
Glory illustrates Heaven and all its blessed Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
            <p>And their Contemplation of God is fixed. If the
Object, though extraordinary glorious, were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient,
or the Eye so weak that it could only see it
but by glances, the heighth of Joy would not be
perpetual. But the mind is prepar'd with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
vigour, to see the brightness of God's face,
and by the most attentive application always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
with that blessed Object, so that the Joy of
Heaven is never intermitted for a moment. They
always see, and love, and rejoyce, and praise him.</p>
            <p>'Tis possible a carnal suspition may arise
in some, as if the uniform perpetual vision
of the same Glory might lose its perfect delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
For those who seek for happiness in
the vanity of the Creatures, are always desirous of
change, and have their Judgments so corrupted,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43454:18"/>
that while they languish with a secret desire after
an unchangeable Good, yet they conceive no good
as desirable, that is not changed.</p>
            <p>But to correct this gross errour of Fancy, let us
a little enquire into the causes of Dissatisfaction,
that make the constant fruition of the same thing
here to be tedious.</p>
            <p>Sensible things are of such a limited Goodness,
that not any of them can supply all our <hi>present</hi>
wants, so that 'tis necessary to leave one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And the most of them are Remedies of our
diseased Appetites, and if not temperately used are
destructive Evils. Eating and Drinking are to
extinguish Hunger and Thirst, but continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
just measure become nauseous. Besides, the
Insufficiency of their Objects, the Senses themselves
cannot be satisfied all at once. The Ear cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to delightful Sounds, and the Eye be intent
on beautiful Colours at the same time: the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of one Sense defeats another of enjoying
its proper good; therefore the same Object is not
constantly pleasant, but the Heart is distemper'd
from as many Causes, as there are desires unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd.
Add further, all things under the Sun af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
onely a superficial delight, and miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Expectations raised of them: and many
times there is a mixture of some evil in them, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43454:19"/>
is more offensive, than the good is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The Honey is attended with a Sting, so that
often those very things we sigh after through vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
desire, when they are obtain'd, we sigh for
grief. Now all these Causes of dissatisfaction
cease in Heaven; for<note n="*" place="margin">Vitae nos <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

infinitely happy, to whom no Good was ever new.
'Tis indeed the sauce that gives a delicious taste
to inferiour things. For Men relish only what is
eminent; and the good things of this World are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43454:19"/>
so truly mean, that they are feign to borrow a shew
of Greatness by comparison with a worse estate
preceding. But an infinite Good produces always
the same pure equal compleat Joy, because it arises
from its intrinsick perfection, that wants no Foil to
commend it. The Psalmist breaks forth, <hi>Whom have
I in Heaven but Thee?</hi> This is no vanishing Rapture,
but a constant joyful height of Affection. God,
the essential happiness of the Saints, is always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
lovely and delightful to them.</p>
            <p>3. The glorified Saints in every period of their
happy state, have as lively a perception of it as in
the beginning. To make this evident, we must
consider that the pleasure of Novelty springs from
a quick sense of the opposite terms, between our
condition in the want of some desired Good, and
after our obtaining it. Now the Mind is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
on the advantage, and more strongly affected
at first. One newly freed from the torments of
a sharp disease, feels a greater pleasure than from
a constant tenour of health. Those who are rais'd
from a low state to eminent Dignity, are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with their first change, but in tract of time
the remembrance of their mean condition is so
weakned and spent, that 'tis like the shadow of a
Dream, and proportionably their Joy is lessened.
Honours like Perfumes, by custom are less sensible
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43454:20"/>
to those that carry them. But the Saints above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
consider and feel the excellent difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their suffering and triumphant state. They
never lose that ravishing part of felicity, the vivid
sence of past evils. Their reflections are always
as strong on the Misery from whence they were
rais'd to the pitch of Happiness, as in their first
glorious Translation. In what an Extasy of
wonder and pleasure will they be, from the fresh
memory of what they were, and the joyful sence
of what they are? <hi>I was</hi> (says the admiring Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
<hi>poor, blind, and naked;</hi> but O miraculous and happy
Alteration! I am full of Light, enrich'd with the
Treasures of Heaven, adorn'd with Divine Glory.
I was under the tyrannous power of Satan, <hi>but he
is bruised under my feet.</hi> I was sentenc'd to an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
separation from the Presence of God, my
only Life and Joy; but now am possest of my
supream Good. 'O how transporting is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of these wide and contrary extreams? How
beautiful and pleasant is the Day of Eternity, after
such a dark tempestuous Night? How does the
remembrance of such Evils produce a more lively
and feeling fruition of such happiness? How
strangely and mightily does <hi>Salvation with Eternal
Glory affect the Soul?</hi> This gives a spritely accent to
their everlasting <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> This preserves an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43454:20"/>
heat in their Thanksgivings to their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
Deliverer. And thus their happiness is
always the same, and always new. Their pleasure
is continued in its perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly;</hi> The Blessedness of the Saints is without
end. This makes Heaven to be it self. There is
no satiety of the present, no sollicitude for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Were there a possibility, or the least suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of losing that happy state, it would cast an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersion
of bitterness upon all their delights: they
could not enjoy one moments repose; but the more
excellent their Happiness is, the more stinging
would their fear be of parting with it. <hi>But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
reserved in Heaven, is immortal, undefiled, and
fades not away.</hi> And the tenure of their Possession
is infinitely firm by the Divine Power, the true
Support of their everlasting Duration. <hi>With God
is the Fountain of Life.</hi> They enjoy a better Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
than the Tree of Life could have preserved
in <hi>Adam.</hi> The Revolutions of the Heavens, and
Ages, are under their Feet, and cannot in the least
alter or determine their Happiness. After the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of millions of Years, still an entire Eternity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of their enjoying God. O most desirable
State! where Blessedness and Eternity are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
united. O joyful Harmony! when the full
<hi>Chorus</hi> of Heaven shall sing, <hi>This God is our God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43454:21"/>
for ever and ever</hi> This adds an infinite weight to
their Glory. This redoubles their unspeakable
Joys with infinite sweetness and security. They
repose themselves in the compleat Fruition of their
Happiness. God reigns in the Saints, and they
live in him for ever.</p>
            <p>From what has been discoursed we should,</p>
            <p>I. Consider the woful Folly of Men in refusing
such a Happiness, that by the admirable favour of
God is offer'd to their choice. Can there be an
Expectation, or Desire, or Capacity in Man, of
enjoying a Happiness beyond what is Infinite and
Eternal? O blind and wretched World! so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of everlasting felicity. Who can behold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compassion and indignation, Men vainly seek
for happiness where 'tis not to be found, and after
innumerable disappointments fly at an Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and neglect their sovereign and final Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Astonishing Madness! that God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
should be despised in comparison of painted
Trifles. This adds the greatest Contumely to their
Impiety. What powerful Charm obstructs their
true judging of things? What Spirit of Errour
possesses them? Alas, <hi>Eternal Things are unseen,</hi>
not of conspicuous moment, and therefore in the
carnal Ballance are esteemed light, against tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things present to the Sense. <hi>It does not appear
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43454:21"/>
what we shall be:</hi> The Vail of the visible Heavens
covers the Sanctuary, where JESUS our High-Priest
is entred, and stops the enquiring Eye.</p>
            <p>But have we not assurance by the most infallible
Principles of Faith, that the Son of God came
down from Heaven to live with us, and dye for us,
and that he rose again to confirm our Belief <hi>in his
exceeding great and precious Promises</hi> concerning this
happiness in the future state? And do not the most
evident Principles of Reason and Universal Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
prove, that this World cannot afford true
Happiness to us? How wretchedly do we forfeit
the Prerogative of the Reasonable Nature by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
our last and blessed End? If the Mind be
darkned, that it does not see the amiable Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, and the Will so depraved that it does
not feel their ravishing power; the Man ceases to
be a Man, and becomes like the Beasts that perish.
As a blind Eye is no longer an Eye, being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
useless to that end for which it was made.
And though in this present state Men are stupid
and unconcern'd, yet hereafter their Misery will
awaken them, to discover what is that Supream
Good wherein their Perfection and Felicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.
When their folly shall be exposed before
God, Angels, and Saints, in what extream confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
will they appear before that glorious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43454:22"/>
Theatre? Our Saviour told the unbelieving
<hi>Jews, There shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth,
when ye shall see</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and
all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your
selves turn'd out.</hi> They shall be tortur'd with the
desire of Happiness without possible satisfaction.
'Tis most just that those who err without excuse,
should repent without remedy.</p>
            <p>2. Let us be excited seriously to apply our
selves in the use of effectual means for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Happiness. Indeed the original cause of it,
is the pure rich Mercy of God; the meritorious, is
the most precious obedience of our Saviour, by
whom we obtain <hi>plenteous Redemption.</hi> His Abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the cause of our Exaltation. The Wounds
he received in his Body, the characters of Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and footsteps of Death, are the Fountains of
our Glory. <hi>Eternal Life is the gift of God through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</hi> But the Gospel declares, <hi>that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Holiness no Man shall see God.</hi> An holy change
of our Natures, and perseverance in the course of
universal obedience, are indispensibly requisite in
order to our obtaining Heaven. <hi>Those who by patient
continuance in well-doing, seek for Glory, Honour, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
shall partake of Eternal Life.</hi> Now were
there no other reason of this Constitution, but the
sovereign Will of God, it were sufficient. But
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43454:22"/>
the Foundation of it is laid in the nature of the
Things themselves. Therefore our Saviour does
not simply declare, that an unregenerate Person
shal not <hi>see the Kingdom of God,</hi> but with the greatest
emphasis <hi>cannot,</hi> to signify an absolute impossibility
of it. Besides the Legal Bar that excludes unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
Persons from the beatifick vision of God,
there is a moral incapacity. Suppose that Justice
should allow Omnipotence to translate such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to Heaven, would the Place make him happy?
Can two incongruous Natures delight in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
The happiness of Sense is by an impression
of Pleasure from a suitable Object: The happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of intellectual Beings arises from an entire
conformity of dispositions. So that unless God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from his Holiness, which is absolutely impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
or Man be purified, and changed into his
likeness, there can be no sweet Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. Our Saviour assigns this Reason of
the necessity of Regeneration in order to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
into Heaven: <hi>That which is born of the flesh,
is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit, is spirit.</hi>
According to the quality of the Principle, such is
what proceeds from it. The Flesh is a corrupt
Principle, and accordingly the Natural Man is
wholly carnal in his propensions, operations, and
end. The Disease is turn'd into his Constitution.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43454:23"/>
He is dead to the Spiritual Life, to the actions and
enjoyments that are proper to it: Nay, there is in
him a surviving Principle of Enmity to that Life:
not only a mortal coldness to God, but a stiff a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
from him, a perpetual resistance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of the Divine Presence, that would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
his voluptuous enjoyments. The Exercises
of Heaven would be as the Torments of Hell to
him, while in the midst of those pure Joys his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
inclinations vehemently run into the lowest
Lees of Sensuality. And therefore till this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
so deep and predominant in an unholy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
be removed, 'tis utterly impossible he should
enjoy God with satisfaction. Holiness alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
Men for the possession of Celestial Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that is against the corruption, and above the
perfection of meer Nature. <hi>Let us then having
such a Joy set before us, lay aside every weight, and the
Sin which doth so easily beset us, and run with patience
the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the Author
and finisher of our Faith.</hi> Methinks the sight of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men, so active and vigilant to prosecute their
low designs, should quicken us to seek with the
greater diligence and alacrity the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the Righteousness thereof.</hi> A carnal Wretch
urged by the sting of a brutish desire, with what
impatience does he pursue <hi>the pleasure of Sin, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43454:23"/>
is but for a season?</hi> An Ambitious Person, with
what an intemperate heighth of Passion does he
chase a Feather? A Covetous Man, how greedily
does he prosecute the Advantages of the <hi>present World
that passes away,</hi> and the Lusts thereof? Ah! how do
they upbraid our indifferent desires, our dull delays,
and cold endeavours, when <hi>such an high Prize</hi> is
set before us? Who is able to conceive the excesse
of Pleasure the Soul feels when it first enters
through the beautiful Gate of Paradise, and sees
before it that incomprehensible Glory, and hears a
Voice from Him that sits upon the Throne, <hi>Enter
into thy Masters Joy,</hi> for ever be happy with him?
The serious belief of this will draw forth all our
active powers in the service of God. The feeding
by lively thoughts on this supernatural food, will
add new vigor and lustre to our Graces, and make
our Victory easy over the World. If we believe
indeed that our Bodies shall be spiritual, and our
Souls divine in their perfections, it will make us
resolute to subdue the Rebel Flesh, and rescue the
captiv'd Spirit from all Intanglements of Iniquity.
<hi>Having the promise of such an excellent Reward, let us
always abound in the work of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The lively hope of this Blessedness is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to support us under the greatest Troubles can
befal us in this our mortal condition. Here we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43454:24"/>
are tost upon the alternate waves of Time, but
hereafter we shall arrive at the Port, the blessed
Bosom of our Saviour, and enjoy a peaceful calm:
<hi>and so we shall ever be with the Lord.</hi> Words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
sweetness! This is the Song of our Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Charm of our Adversity: <hi>We shall ever
be with the Lord.</hi> Well might the Apostle add im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after, <hi>therefore comfort one another with
these words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly, They are a Lenitive to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
our Sorrows upon the Departure of our
dearest Friends, who dye in the Lord: for they
ascend from this valley of Tears, to the happy
Land of the Living. What Father is so deserted
of Reason, as to bear impatiently the parting with
his Son, that goes over a narrow part of the Sea,
to a rich and pleasant Country, and receive the
investiture and peaceable possession of a Kingdom?
Nay, by how much the Stronger his Love is, so
much the more transporting is his Joy: especially
if he expects shortly to be with him, to see him on
the Throne, in the state of a King, and to partake
of his happiness. If then it be impossible to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be grieved, at the felicity of one that is
loved; according to what principle of Nature or
Faith do Believers so uncomfortably lament the
Death of Friends, of whom they have assurance
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43454:24"/>
that after their leaving our Earth, they enter into
an everlasting Kingdom, to receive a Crown of
Glory from Christ himself? Our Saviour tells the
Disciples, <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, because I
said I go to my Father;</hi> to sit down at his right-hand
in Majesty. A pure Affection directly terminates
in the happiness and exaltation of the Person that
is loved. I am not speaking against the exercise of
tender Affections on the loss of our dear Friends;
and a pensive feeling of God's hand in it; which
is an natural and necessary duty. There is a great
difference between <hi>Stupidity</hi> and <hi>Patience:</hi> but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Passion, or unremitting Sorrow is most unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the <hi>blessed Hope</hi> assur'd to us in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Chrysostom <hi>treating of this Argument, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon the custom of those Times, wherein
at Funeral Solemnities a train of Mourning Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
attended the Corps, tearing their Hair and
Face, and crying out with all the expressions of
desperate Sorrow, breaks forth,</hi> Ah Christian Faith
and Religion! that was triumphant over thine Enemies in
so many Battels and Victories by the Blood and Death of
the Martyrs, how art thou contradicted by the practice of
these who profess thee in words? Is this not to be sorrowful
as those that have no hope? Are these the affections, the
expressions, of one that believes the blessedness of Immortal
Life? What will the Heathens say, how will they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43454:25"/>
to believe the Promises of <hi>Christ</hi> to his Servants of
a glorious Kingdom, when those who are so in title, behave
themselves as if they had no stedfast faith in them?</p>
            <p>4. The hopes of this blessed state, is able to free us
from the fear of Death. This last Enemy gives an
hot Alarm to Mankind, both as it deprives them of
all that is pleasant here, and for the terrible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
that attend it. To the eye of Sense, a dead
Body is a spectacle of fearful appearance. He
that a little before heard and discours'd, and with
a chearful Air convers'd and enjoy'd the World,
now is dead, and all his senses in him: the Eyes
are dead to light, and the Ears to sounds, the
Tongue to words, and the Heart to feel any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and the Countenance to discover them:
nothing remains but silence, horrour, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Besides, <hi>after Death comes Judgment,</hi> and
a state of unrelenting Torments to the Wicked.
But a true Believer that has been obedient to his
Saviour, sees things by another light than that of
sense, and has living hopes in his dying Agonies.
He knows that Death to the Saints is but a sleep:
and while the Body rests in the Grave, the Soul is
as it were all Act, continually exercising its most
noble faculties on the best Objects. Does the Soul
sleep in that all-enlightned World, that sees with
open face, the infinite Beauty of God? that hears
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43454:25"/>
and bears a part in the <hi>hymns</hi> of the Angels &amp; Saints
encircling his Throne? that drinks of the Rivers
of Pleasure that flow from his Presence? that freely
and joyfully converses with all the Celestial Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
the Princes of that Kingdom, the Favourites
of God? Then it truly lives. This reconciles
Death to a Christian, who has nothing more in his
wishes than to be with Christ; and knows that
diseases and pains, the forerunners of it, are but as
the breaking down the Walls of this earthly dark
Prison, that the Soul may take its flight to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Region, and for ever enjoy the Liberty of the
Sons of God. And for his Body, that shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
to the Soul in Glory. Methinks God speaks
to a dying Believer, as he did to <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was
to descend to <hi>Egypt, Fear not to go down into the Grave,
I will go down with thee, and I will bring thee up again.</hi>
The same Almighty Voice that gave being to the
World, shall <hi>awake those who sleep in the dust,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them according to the Example of Christ's
glorified Body. O how should we long for that
triumphant day! and with most ardent Aspirings
pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come in its full power and glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Shall now come to speak of the Mournful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Cause of my Appearing here at this
time, the Deceased, Reverend and Excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43454:26"/>
Dr. <hi>Thomas Manton:</hi> A Name worthy of
precious and eternal Memory. And I shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, both in the quality of his Office, as he
was an <hi>Embassadour of Christ,</hi> declaring his Mind,
and representing his Authority, and in the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Person, shewing forth the Graces and
Vertues of his Divine Master.</p>
            <p>God had furnish'd him with a rare union of
those parts that are requisite to form a Minister of
his Word. A clear Judgment, rich Fancy, strong
Memory, and happy Elocution met in him, and
were excellently improved by his diligent study.</p>
            <p>The Preaching of the Word is the principal part
of the Minister's duty, most essential to his Calling,
and most necessary to the Church. For this end
chiefly, the several<note n="‖" place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> Orders in the Ministerial Office
were instituted, and upon our Saviour's trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
ascent and reception into Heaven, an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
effusion of the Spirit in Graces and Abilities
descended upon Men. Now in the performing
this Work, he was of that conspicuous Eminence,
that none could detract from him, but from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or envy.</p>
            <p>He was endowed with extraordinary knowledg
in the Scriptures, those holy Oracles from whence
all Spiritual Light is derived: And in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gave such a perspicuous account of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43454:26"/>
and dependance of Divine Truths; and with
that felicity applied the Scriptures to confirm them,
that every Subject by his management was culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
and improved. His Discourses were so clear
and convincing, that none without offering volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
violence to Conscience could resist their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And from hence they were effectual not
only to inspire a sudden Flame, and raise a short
Commotion in the Affections, but to make a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Change in the Life. For in the humane Soul
such is the composition of its faculties, that till the
Understanding be rectified in its Apprehensions
and Estimations, the Will is never induc'd to make
an entire firm choice of what is necessary for the
obtaining perfect Happiness. A sincere persevering
Conversion is effected by weighty Reasons that
sink and settle in the Heart.</p>
            <p>His Doctrine was uncorrupt and pure, <hi>the Truth
according to Godliness.</hi> He was far from a guilty vile
intention, to prostitute that sacred Ordinance for
the acquiring any private secular advantage. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he entertain his Hearers with impertinent
Subtilties, empty Notions, intricate Disputes, dry
and barren without productive Vertue: But as
one that always had before his Eyes the great End
of the Ministry, the Glory of God, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, his Sermons were directed to open
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43454:27"/>
their eyes, that they might see their wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as Sinners, to hasten their <hi>flight from the Wrath
to come,</hi> to make them humbly, thankfully and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<hi>receive Christ,</hi> as their <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>all-sufficient
Saviour.</hi> And to build up the converted <hi>in their most
holy Faith,</hi> and more excellent Love, that is the <hi>fulfilling
of the Law.</hi> In short, to make true Christians emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in Knowledg and universal Obedience.</p>
            <p>As the matter of his Sermons was designed for
the good of Souls; so his way of expression was
proper to that end. Words are the vehicle of the
heavenly Light. As the Divine Wisdom was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
to reveal the Eternal Counsels of God to
the World; so Spiritual Wisdom in the mind, must
be clothed with words, to make it sensible to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And in this he had a singular Talent. His
Stile was not exquisitely studied, not consisting of
harmonious Periods, but far distant from vulgar
meanness. His Expression was natural and free,
clear and strong, quick and powerful, without any
spice of folly, and always suitable to the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Majesty of Divine Truths. His Sermons
afforded substantial food with delight, so that a
fastidious mind could not disrelish them. He ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
a vain ostentation of Wit, in handling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
things; so venerable and grave, and of eternal
consequence. Indeed, what is more unbecoming
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43454:27"/>
a Minister of Christ, than to waste the spirits of
his Brain, as a Spider does his bowels, to spin a web
only to catch Flyes? to get vain applause by fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
pleasing the ignorant. And what cruelty is it
to the Souls of Men?<note place="margin">Suet.</note> 'Tis recorded as an instance
of <hi>Nero</hi>'s savage temper, that in a general Famine,
when many perish'd by hunger, he ordered a Ship
should come from <hi>Egypt</hi> (the Granary of <hi>Italy</hi>) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Sand for the use of Wrestlers. In such
extremity to provide only for delight, that there
might be spectacles on the Theatre, when the City
of <hi>Rome</hi> was a spectacle of such misery, as to melt
the heart of any but of <hi>Nero,</hi> was most barbarous
Cruelty. But 'tis Cruelty of an heavier imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a Minister to prepare his Sermons to please
the foolish curiosity of Fancy with flashy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits;
nay, such light Vanities, that would scarce be
endured in a Scene, whiles hungry Souls languish
for want of solid nourishment.</p>
            <p>His fervour and earnestness in Preaching was
such, as might soften and make pliant the most
stubborn obdurate spirits. I am not speaking of
one whose talent was only in voice, that labours
in the Pulpit as if the end of Preaching were for
the exercise of the Body,<note place="margin">Si sudare<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

broke forth, as were capable to procure attention
and consent in his Hearers. He spake as one that
had a living Faith within him of Divine Truths.
From this union of Zeal with his Knowledg, he
was excellently qualified to convince and convert
Souls. The sound of words only strikes the Ear,
but the Mind reasons with the Mind, and the
Heart speaks to the Heart.</p>
            <p>His unparallel'd Assiduity in Preaching, declar'd
him very sensible of those dear and strong Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that lie upon Ministers, to be very diligent in
that blessed Work. What a powerful Motive our
Saviour urged upon <hi>St. Peter?</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 21.</note> 
               <hi>As thou lovest me,
feed my Sheep, feed my Lambs.</hi> And can any feed too
much, when none can love enough? Can any
Pains be sufficient for the salvation of Souls, for
which the Son of God did not esteem his Blood too
costly a price? Is not incessant unwearied industry
requisite to advance the work of Grace in them to
perfection? In this the work of a Minister has its
peculiar disadvantage, that whereas an Artificer
how curious and difficult soever his work be, yet
has this encouragement, that what is begun with
Art and Care, he finds in the same state wherein
'twas left: A Painter that designs an exact Piece,
draws many Lines, often touches it with his Pencil
to give it life and beauty; and though unfinish'd,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43454:28"/>
'tis not spoild by his intermission. A Sculptor that
carves a Statue, though his labour be hard from
the resistance of the matter, yet his work remains
firm and durable. But the Heart of Man is of a
strange temper, hard as Marble, not easily recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of heavenly impressions, yet fluid as Water,
those impressions are easily defac'd in it; 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to so many temptations that induce an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion
of eternal things, that without frequent exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to quicken and confirm its holy purposes,
it grows careless, and all the labour is lost that was
spent on it. This faithful Minister <hi>abounded in
the Work of the Lord;</hi> and which is truly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
though so frequent in Preaching, yet was
alwas superiour to others, and equal to himself.
In his last time when declining to Death, yet he
would not leave his beloved Work; the vigour of
his Mind supporting the weakness of his Body. I
remember when opprest with an obstinate hoars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a Friend desiring him to spare himself; he
rejected the advice with indignation.</p>
            <p>He was no fomenter of Faction, but studious of
the Publick Tranquillity. He knew what a blessing
Peace is, and wisely foresaw the pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
that attend Divisions. By Peace, the
bond of mutual harmony, the weakest things are
preserved and prosper; but where Discord reigns,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43454:29"/>
the strongest are near to ruine. The heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in the primitive Church, was a principal cause
of its miraculous encrease and flourishing; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Dissentions prevail'd amongst Christians, that
was destroyed in a short time, which was built by
the Divine Union and Heroic Patience of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians. And the glorious Beginnings
that promis'd the Reformation of all <hi>Europe,</hi> were
more obstructed by the dissentions of some em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in that blessed work, than by all the power
and subtilty, the Arms and Artifices of <hi>Rome</hi> it self.
How afflictive is the consideration of our divided
Church? Sweet Peace, whither art thou fled?
Blessed Saviour, who didst by thy precious Blood
reconcile Heaven and Earth, send down thy Spirit
to inspire us with that Wisdom that is pure and
peaceable, that those who agree in the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Faith, in the same substantial parts of
Worship, in asserting the same indispensible necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Holiness, may receive one another in love. I
am affectionatly engaged in a matter that so nearly
touches all those that value the <hi>Protestant</hi> Interest.</p>
            <p>Briefly; Consider him as a <hi>Christian,</hi> his Life
was answerable to his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>'Tis applicable to some Ministers, what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of the Carbuncle; by its colour, lustre, and
fiery sparklings it seems to be actually a Fire, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43454:29"/>
it has only the name and appearance of it. Thus
some in the Pulpit seem to be all on fire with zeal,
yet their hearts are as cold as a stone, without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affections, and their lives are unworthy their
Divine Ministration. But this Servant of God was
like a fruitful Tree, that produces in its branches
what it contains in the root; his inward Grace was
made visible in a Conversation becoming the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Christ.</p>
            <p>His resolute Contempt of the World secur'd him
from being wrought on by those motives, that
tempt low spirits from their duty. He would not
rashly throw himself into troubles, nor <hi>spretâ Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiâ</hi>
avoid them. His generous Constancy of
Mind in resisting the current of Popular humour,
declar'd his Loyalty to his Divine Master. His
Charity was eminent in procuring Supplies for
others, when in mean Circumstances himself. But
he had great experience of God's fatherly Provision,
to which his filial Confidence was correspondent.</p>
            <p>His Conversation in his Family was holy and
exemplary, every day instructing them from the
Scriptures in their duty.</p>
            <p>I shall finish my Character of him, with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
his Humility. He was deeply affected <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
the sence of his Frailties and Unworthiness. He
considered the infinite Purity of God, the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43454:30"/>
of his Law the Rule of our Duty, and by
that humbling Light discover'd his manifold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
He exprest his thoughts to me a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Death; <hi>If the holy Prophets were under strong
impressions of fear, upon the extraordinary discovery of the
Divine Presence, how shall we poor creatures appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Holy and Dread Majesty? Isaiah,</hi> after his
glorious vision of God, reflecting upon himself;
as not retir'd from the commerce and corruption
of the World, breaks forth, <hi>Wo is me, for I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
because I am a Man of unclean lips, and I dwell
in the midst of a People of unclean lips; for mine eyes have
seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.</hi> 'Tis infinitely ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to appear <hi>before God the Judge of all,</hi> without
the protection of <hi>the Blood of sprinkling, that speaks
better things than the blood of Abel.</hi> This alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
him, and supported his hopes. Though his
Labours were abundant, yet he knew that the
Work of God, passing through our hands, is so
blemish'd, that without an appeal to pardoning
Mercy and Grace, we cannot stand in Judgment.
This was the subject of his last publick Sermon.</p>
            <p>He languish'd many months, but presuming he
should be too strong for his Infirmity, neglected it,
till at last it became insuperable and mortal. Many
pathetical aggravations heighten our great and dear
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43454:30"/>
Loss, that such a faithful Minister of Christ should
be taken away, whose Preaching was so powerful
to repair the woful Ruines of Godliness and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in a degenerate Age: Whose prudent pacifick
Spirit rendred him so useful in these <hi>Divided Times,</hi>
when Professors of the same Religion are aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from one another, as if they had been baptized
with the Waters of Strife: That before our Tears
were dried up for the loss of other worthy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
the Fountain of Sorrow should be opened
again by this afflicting stroke. But it becomes us
to receive the dispensations of Heaven with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and quiet submission; to reflect upon our sins
with an holy grief, that provoke God to remove
such an excellent Instrument of his Glory from us.
<hi>Let us pray to the Lord of the Harvest, that he will send
forth faithful Labourers into it.</hi> O that surviving Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
might be animated with a Zeal more pure
and fervent in their Divine Work: And that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would be wise, while a price is put into their
hands, to improve it for their eternal advantage.
The neglected Gospel will at the last be a terrible
Witness against the Disobedient, to justify and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
their Condemnation.</p>
