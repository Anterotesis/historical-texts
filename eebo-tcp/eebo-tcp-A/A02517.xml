            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In euery bargaine there is <hi>merx,</hi> and <hi>mercatura;</hi> the commoditie, and the match; The commoditie to bee bought is the Truth; the match made for this commoditie, is <hi>Buying, Buy the Truth.</hi> An ill Iudge may put a good Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; yet it was a question too good for the mouth of a Pilate, <hi>What is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19612:4"/>
Truth?</hi> The schooles haue wearied themselues in the solution; To what purpose should I reade a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicall Lecture to Courtiers? Truth is as Time, one in all; yet, as Time, though but one, is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into past, present, future, and euery thing hath a Time of it owne; so is Truth variously distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, according to the subiects wherein it is; This is <hi>Anselmes,</hi> cited by <hi>Aquinas;</hi> I had rather say, Truth is as light: (<hi>Send forth thy Truth, and thy light,</hi> saith the Psalmist) which (though but one in all) yet there is one light of the Sunne, another of the Moone, another of the Starres, another of this lower ayre: There is an essentiall, and causall Truth in the Diuine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which the schooles call
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19612:5"/>
               <hi>Primo-primam</hi>; This will not bee sold, cannot be bought; God will not part with it, the world is not worth it; This Truth is as the Light in the body of the Sunne. There is an intrinsecall or formall truth in things truly existing; For, <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>True</hi> are conuertible; and Saint <hi>Austen</hi> rightly defines <hi>Verum est illud quod est</hi>; All this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Truth in things, is deriued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily, and causally, from that increated Truth of God; this the schooles call <hi>Secundo-primam</hi>; and it is as the light of the Sun-beames, cast vpon the Moone, and Starres. There is an extrinsecall, or secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary truth of propositions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon, and conformable to the truth of the things expressed: thus, <hi>Verum</hi> is no other than <hi>Esse
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19612:5"/>
declaratiuum,</hi> as <hi>Hilarie</hi>; And this Truth, being in the thing it selfe subiectiuely, in words expressiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the minde of man termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, presupposeth a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie or adequation; Both of the vnderstanding to the matter conceiued; and of the words to the vnderstanding; so as Truth is when we speake as we thinke, and thinke as it is; And this Truth is as the light diffused from those heauenly bodies, to the Region of this lower ayre; This is the Truth we are called to <hi>Buy</hi>: But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuatiue and relatiue Truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the minde, or in the mouth, hath much multiplicitie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter either concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or vttered; There is a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall Truth, there is a naturall,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19612:6"/>
there is a morall, there is a ciuill; All these must bee deare bought; but the best at the highest rate, which is Theologicall, or diuine; whether in the principles, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary conclusions; The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of diuine Truth are <hi>Scriptura veritatis, Dan.</hi> 10. The Law of Truth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. The word of Truth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. The necessary conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are they, which vpon irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable inferences are deduced from those holy grounds: Shortly then, euery parcell of Diuine Truth, whether laid downe in Scripture, or drawne necessarily from Scripture, is this <hi>Mercimonium sacrum,</hi> which wee are bidden to <hi>Buy; Buy the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the commoditie; The match is, <hi>Buy;</hi> that is, Beat the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19612:6"/>
price, and pay it. Buy it; Of whom? For what? Of whom, but of the owner, of the Maker?</p>
            <p>The owner; It is <hi>Veritas Domini,</hi> Gods Truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 117. His stile is, the <hi>Lord God of Truth, Psal.</hi> 31. The Maker; <hi>The workes of his hand are truth, and iudgement, Psal.</hi> 111. And if any vsurping spirit of error shall haue made a free-bootie of Truth, and shall with-hold it in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, we must redeeme it out of his hands with the highest ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
            <p>What is the price? That is the maine thing in buying; For, Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is no other than <hi>pactio pretij</hi>: Else-where God proclaimes; <hi>Hoe, euery one that thirsteth, come, buy wine and milke without money, and without price, Esa.</hi> 55. This is a Donation,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19612:7"/>
in forme of sale: But, here must be a price in the hand; God will giue mercy, and not sell it; He will sell Truth, and not giue it: For what will he sell it? First, for Labour; The Heathen Poet could say, his gods sold learning for sweat; The originall word here vsed is (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>Compara; Get it any way,</hi> either <hi>labore,</hi> or <hi>precio;</hi> yea <hi>labore, vt precio.</hi> This great foreman of Gods shop tells vs we cannot haue it, vnder. <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.4. We must seeke for her as siluer, and search for her, as for hid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; The veine of Truth lies low, it must be digged, and delued for to the very center. If Truth could bee bought with ease and pleasure, many a lazie Christian would bid faire for it, who now resolue rather vpon want, than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19612:7"/>
toile. The slothfull worldling will rather take vp a falshood for Truth, than beat his braine to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Truth from falshood; an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of free-cost is better than an high-rated Veritie; Labour for Truth is turn'd ouer for the taske of Church-men; no life sauours to these flegmaticke Spirits, but that of the Lillies, <hi>Neque laborant, neque nent;</hi> They neither labour nor spin; This dull resolution is vnworthy of a Christian, yea of a reasonable soule; and if we should take vp no other for the body, we should be fed with hunger, and cloathed with nakednesse, the earth should bee our fether-bed, and the sky our Canopy, wee should abound with want, liue sauagely, and die miserably. It
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19612:8"/>
was the iust Canon of the Apostle, <hi>He that labours not, let him not eat</hi>; Certainly, he can neuer eat of the heauenly Manna of Truth, that will not step forth to gather it: Heare this yee delicate Courtiers, that would heare a Sermon if yee could rise out of your beds; that would lend God an houre, if yee could spare it from your pleasures; the God of heauen scornes to haue his precious Truth so basely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualued; if yee bid God lesse than labour for Truth, I can giue you no comfort, but that yee may goe to hell with ease.</p>
            <p>The markets of Truth as of all other commodities varie: It is the rule of Casuists, <hi>Iustitia pretij non consistit in indiuiduo</hi>; The Iustice of the Price doth not pitch euer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19612:8"/>
vpon a point; Sometimes the price of Truth hath risen, it would not be bought but for danger, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, not vnder losse, not vnder disgrace, not vnder imprisonment, not vnder exile, sometimes yet dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, not vnder paine, yea sometimes it hath not gone for lesse than bloud. It did cost <hi>Elias</hi> danger, <hi>Michaiah</hi> disgrace, <hi>Ieremie</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, the Disciples losse, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi> exile, the holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors paine, the holy Martyrs death; Euen the highest of these is <hi>pretium legitimum,</hi> if God call for it, how euer nature may taxe it as rigorous, yea such as the franke hearts of faithfull Christians haue bidden at the first word for Truth; <hi>What doe yee weeping, and breaking my heart; For I am ready not to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19612:9"/>
bound only, but to die for the name of the Lord Iesus,</hi> saith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> Act. 21. <hi>Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will he giue for his life,</hi> saith Satan; but skin, &amp; life, &amp; all must a man giue for Truth, &amp; not thinke it an hard penny-worth; <hi>Neither count I my life deare vnto me that I may finish my course with ioy,</hi> saith the chosen vessel, to his Ephesians. Oh the heroicall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our blessed fore-fathers, that stucke not to giue their dearest heart-bloud for but some corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of sacred Truth; whose bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning zeale to Truth consumed them before those fires of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, and sent vp their pure and glorious soules, like <hi>Manoah's</hi> Angell, to heauen, in the flame. Blessed be God; Blessed be his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19612:9"/>
Anointed, vnder whose gracious Scepter we haue inioyed dayes as much more happy than theirs, as their hearts were more feruent than ours: Wee may now buy Truth at a better hand; stake but our labour, wee carry it with thanks; I feare there want not those that would be glad to marre the market; It can be only knowne to heauen what treacheries the malice of hell may be a brewing. Had but that powder once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nothing had beene abated of the highest price of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors; We had paid for euery dram of Truth, as many ounces of bloud, as euer it cost the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest Martyr; should the Deuill haue beene suffered to doe his worst, we might not haue grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19612:10"/>
at this price of Truth, <hi>Non est delicata in Deum, &amp; secura con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio; qui in me credit, debet suum sanguinem fundere,</hi> saith <hi>Ierome.</hi> Christian profession is no secure or delicate matter, he that beleeues must be no niggard of his bloud. But why thus deare? Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good reason: Monopolies vse to enhaunce the price: Yee can buy Truth at no shop but one, <hi>In coelo praeparata est Veritas tua,</hi> Psal. 89.2. Thy truth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in heauen. And it is a iust Rule of Law, <hi>Quisque in rebus suis est moderator, &amp; arbiter:</hi> Euery man may rate his owne: Neither is this only the sole commoditie of God, but besides, deare to the owner. <hi>Dilexisti veritatem</hi>; Thou hast loued Truth, saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19612:10"/>
And it is a true rule in the Cases of Commerce, <hi>Affectus aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari potest,</hi> Our loue may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued in the price. Yea, O God, thy loue to Truth cannot be valued; It is thy selfe, Thou that art Truth it selfe hast said so, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life</hi>; wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore know how much thou louest thy Truth, because as thy selfe is infinite, so is thy loue to thy selfe: What should we hunt for comparisons? If all the earth were gold, what were it? when euen very heauen it selfe is trash to thee in respect of Truth: No maruell if thou set it at an high rate; It is not more precious to thee, than beneficiall to vs. It frees vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.32. It renues vs, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.18. It confirmes vs, <hi>Prov.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:19612:11"/>
12.19. It sanctifies vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17. It defends vs, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.4. Shortly, it doth all for vs that God doth, for God works by his Almighty word, and his <hi>word is Truth, Ioh.</hi> 17. Therefore <hi>buy the Truth.</hi> And if Truth be thus precious, thus beneficiall; how comes it to passe that it is neglected, contemned? Some passe by it, and doe not so much as cheapen it; Others chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, but bid nothing; Others bid something, but vnder foot; Others bid well, but stake it not; Others lastly stake downe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke it. The first that passe by and cheapen it not, are carelesse vnbeleeuers; The next that chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, and bid nothing, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Christians; The third that bid something but not enough,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19612:11"/>
are worldly semi-Christians; The fourth that bid well and stake it nor, are glorious hypocrites; The last that stake downe and reuoke it, are damnable Apostats. Take all these out of the society of men; and how many customers hath God that care to buy the Truth? If Truth were some rich chattell, it would be bought; If Truth were some goodly Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or the reuersion of some good Office, it would be bought; If Truth were some Benefice; or spirituall promotion (Oh times!) it would be bought; Yea, how deare are we content to pay for our filthy lusts; wee will needs purchase them (too oft) with shame, beggery, disease, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Only the sauing Truth of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19612:12"/>
God will not off hand. What is the reason of this? First of all; It is but bare, simple, plaine, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, homely Truth, without welt, without guard; It will abide none but natiue colours, it scorneth to wooe fauour with farding, and licking, and counterfaisance; it hates either bought, or borrowed beauty; and therefore, like some natiue face among the painted, lookes course, and rusty. There are two shops that get away all the custome from Truth, The shop of Vanitie, the shop of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; The one sels knacks and gew-gawes, the other false wares, and adulterate; both of their commodities are so gilded, and gaudy, and glittering, that all fooles throng thither, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19612:12"/>
to want elbow-roome, and striue who shall be first seru'd; whereas the secret worke of art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and vnpolisht Truth can winne no eye to view it, no tongue to aske so much, as, <hi>What will it cost mee? Oh yee sonnes of men, how long will yee loue vanitie, and seeke after lies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, though Truth in it selfe be alwaies excellent, yet the issue of it is not seldome distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; <hi>Veritas odium:</hi> There is one <hi>Michaiah</hi> whom I hate: <hi>Am I become your enemie, because I tell you the truth?</hi> And this is the cause that Frier <hi>Menot</hi> alledges, why Truth in this Time was so vnwelcome to the Court. But if Truth be the mother of Hatred, shee is the daughter of Time, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19612:13"/>
Truth hath learn't this of Time, to deuoure her owne brood; So that, in Time, Truth shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume hatred; and at the last, a galling Truth shall haue more thanks, than a smoothing suppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risitation. In the meane time, <hi>Veritas nihil erubescit praeterquam abscondi</hi>; Truth blusheth at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but secrecie, as <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How euer then fond, or false hearts value the Truth, let vs, that should be wise Christians, esteeme it as the pearle hid in the field, which the man sold all that euer he had to purchase. Would it not set any heart on fire with an holy anger, to see what the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Truth bid, and giue for falshood, for faction? Their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, their country, the life of their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19612:13"/>
Soueraigne, the eternall state of their soules hath not seemed too deare to cast away vpon an ill bargaine of mis-religion; and shall not wee bid so much as our zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous well-wishes, our effectuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, our carefull obseruances for the vndoubted Truth of our Maker and Redeemer? What shall I say to the miserable and stupid carelesnesse of these thriftlesse and godlesse times; wherein euery thing is apprised, euery thing is bought, saue that which is most precious, most beneficiall, Truth. Yee great ones are made for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents to the inferior world; your example is able to bring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or euill into fashion; For Gods sake, for your soules sake, what euer transactions ye make
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19612:14"/>
for the world, lay your plots for the blessed purchase of Truth; Oh let not your fickle honors, your vnsatisfying pleasures, your worthlesse profits, yea your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie liues seeme deare to you in comparison of heauenly Truth. It is no shame in other parts for great Peeres to bee Merchants; <hi>Mercatores tui erant principes,</hi> saith the Angell concerning <hi>Babylon, Reuel.</hi> 18. <hi>Thy Merchants were the Princes of the earth</hi>; And why should not yee great ones bee the Merchants of Truth? <hi>Blessed bee the God of Truth, yee are so.</hi> It is no proud word to say, That no Court vnder heauen hath so rich a stocke of Truth, as this of <hi>Great Britaine;</hi> yet let mee tell you, the very Angels knew not so much,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19612:14"/>
but they desired to know more, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.10. And if yee had alreadie that vespertine knowledge of the Saints, which yee shall once haue in heauen, yet know that this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine stands not more in the iudgement, than in the affections: What euer our speculations may be, if our hearts be not set vpon Truth, we may be Brokers, wee are not Merchants; Brokers for others, not Merchants for our selues. As our Sauiour then, when hee bids vs sell all, forsake all, holds it done, when in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minde wee are ready to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate all for his name, though we doe it not; so doth God hold vs to buy Truth, when wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow our best thoughts, our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest well-wishes vpon it, though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19612:15"/>
we haue it alreadie. Oh stirre vp your languishing zeale, yee noble Courtiers, rouze vp your drouping loue to diuine Truth; Giue your hearts to it, yee cannot but giue all for it; And if yee doe not finde the sweet gaine of this bargaine, in this lower Region of error; and confusion, yee shall once finde it in those eternall, and empireall habitations of Truth, where the God of Truth shall make vp the Truth of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, with the euerlasting truth of his glorious performances; where Mercy, and Truth shall so meet, and embrace one another, that both of them shall embrace the faithfull soule, for euer and euer.</p>
            <p>This for the Bargaine of Truth; The forbidden sale followeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19612:15"/>
               <hi>sell it not.</hi> Commonly what wee buy, we may sell. <hi>Alexander,</hi> not the Great, but the Good, sold Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Keyes, Altars; the verse giues the reason; <hi>Emerat ille prius,</hi> Hee bought them. So Saint <hi>Austen</hi> of <hi>Simon Magus, Volebat emere spiritum Sanctum, quia vendere volebat spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Sanctum;</hi> Hee would buy the Holy Ghost, because he meant to sell it. Giue me a man that buyes a Seat of Iudicature; I dare not trust him for not selling of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; he that sits in the chaire of Symonie, will not giue Orders; will not sticke to sell soules. Some things we may buy to sell, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did the <hi>Egyptian</hi> corne; some things we must sell, if we buy, as an <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Inheritance, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25. But here we are charged to buy what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19612:16"/>
it is a sinne to sell; <hi>Buy the Truth, and sell it not</hi>; There is many a good thing ill sold; <hi>Esau</hi> sels his birth-right for pottage; <hi>Hanun</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> sell their Country for loue; <hi>Dalilah</hi> sels her louer for a bribe; The Patriarchs sell their Brother for twentie siluer rings; <hi>Haman</hi> sels the <hi>Iewes</hi> for nought. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> sell the Iewish girles for wine, <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.3. <hi>Israel</hi> sels the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous for siluer, and the poore for shooes, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.6. Their Iudges sell sinnes or innocence for rewards, <hi>Esa.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Abab</hi> sels himselfe to wickednesse; <hi>Iudas</hi> sels his master; <hi>Demas</hi> sels the Truth; All these make an ill market; And in all it is a surerule, the better the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie is, the more pernicious is the sale. The indefinitenesse of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19612:16"/>
charge implies a generalitie. Buy it at any price; At no price sell it. It is the sauour of God that it may be bought for any rate; It is the Iustice of God, that vpon any rate it should not bee sold: As buying and selling are opposites in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So that for which we must not sell Truth is opposite to that for which we may buy it. Wee must buy it with labour, therefore wee may not sell it for ease; If need be wee must buy it with losse, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not sell it for gaine; we must buy it with disgrace, we may not sell it for honour; wee must buy it with exile or imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we may not sell it for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; we must buy it with paine, we may not sell it for pleasure; We must buy it with death, we may
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19612:17"/>
not sell it for life; Not for any, not for all of these may we sell Truth; this were <hi>damnosa mercatio,</hi> as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome:</hi> In euery bargaine and sale there must be a proportion; now ease, gaine, honour, libertie, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, life, yea worlds of all these are no way counteruaileable to Truth; <hi>For what shall it profit a man to win the whole world, and leese his owne soule?</hi> And hee cannot sell Truth, but his soule is lost: And if any thing in the world may seeme a due price of Truth, it is Peace. Oh sweet and deare name of Peace, the good newes of Angels, the ioy of good men! who can but affect thee, who can but mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thee? The God of heauen before whom I stand, from whom I speake, knowes how oft, how
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19612:17"/>
deeply I haue mourned for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions of his Church, how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly I haue set my hand on work vpon such poore thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, as my meannesse could reach; But when all is done, I still found we may not offer to sell Truth for Peace. It is true that there bee some Scholasticall and immateriall Truths (the infinite subdiuisions whereof haue rather troubled than informed Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) which for the purchase of peace might be kept in, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into such safe generalities as minds not vnreasonable might rest in; but sold out they may not be; If some Truths may be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into a narrower roome, none may be contracted for; <hi>Qui diuinis innutriti sunt eloquijs,</hi> as that Father
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19612:18"/>
said; Those that are trained vp in diuine Truths may not change a syllable for a world. <hi>Tene quod habes,</hi> Hold that thou hast, is a good rule in all things; which if in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties it were well obserued, we should not haue so many gallants squander away their inheritances to liue Cameleon-like vpon the ayre of fauour; But how euer this be too wel obserued in these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things by frugall hands, which take as if they were quicke, hold as if they were dead, yet in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces it can neuer be obserued enough; Wee get Truth, we buy it as <hi>Iacob</hi> did his birth-right, to keepe, to inioy, not to sell againe: If therefore the world, if Satan shall offer to grease vs in the fist for Truth, let vs answer him as <hi>Simon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19612:18"/>
Peter</hi> did <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought the Truth of God may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall we say then to those pedling petty-chapmen which we meet withall in euery market, that will be bartring away the Truth of God for trifles? Surely the forme of our spirituall market is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the ciuill; In our ciuill mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets there are more buyers than sellers; there would be but poore takings, if many did not buy of one; but in the spirituall, there are more Sellers of Truth, than Buyers.</p>
            <p>Many a one sels that hee neuer had, that he should haue had, the Truth of God; Here one chops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Truth for Feare or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; There another lets it goe for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19612:19"/>
the old shooes of a <hi>Gebeonitish</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Antiquitie; Heere one parts with it for a painted, gilded hobby-horse of an outwardly pompous magnificence of the Church; there another for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of childish superstition; One for the fancies of hope, another for the breath of a colloguing Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor; Amongst them all, <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutae sunt veritates à filijs hominum, Psal.</hi> 12. Truth is failed from the children of men: Yea as <hi>Esay</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in his time, <hi>Corruit in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea veritas, Esa.</hi> 59.14. Truth is fallen in the streets. What a shame it is to see, that in this cleere and glorious Sunne-shine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, vnder the pious gouernment of the True Defender of the Faith, there should not want some soules
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19612:19"/>
that should trucke for the Truth of God, as if it were some Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, or some Smithfield-Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. <hi>Commutauerunt veritatem Dei</hi>; They haue changed the Truth of God into a lie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. And all their care is, that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued good cheap.</p>
            <p>Whose heart cannot bleed to see so many well-rigg'd and hopefull Barkes of our young Gentry, laden with the most precious Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dises of Nature and Grace, hall'd in euery day to these deceitfull Ports of Error, the owners partly cheated, partly robbed of Truth, despoiled of their rich fraight, and at last turn'd ouer-boord into a sea of Desperation. <hi>Oh foolish Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey, that yee should not hold

fast the Truth;</hi> Where shall I lay the fault of this mis-carriage? Mee thinkes I could aske the Disciples question, <hi>Nunquid ego Domine,</hi> Is it wee Lord? Are there of vs that preach our selues and not Christ? Are there that preach Christ, and liue him not? Woe to the world because of offences. It must needs be that offences should come, but woe to the man by whom the offence commeth: God forbid that we should be so bad that the seuen-hils should not iustifie vs; But what euer we be, the Truth is still, and euer it selfe, neither the better for our innocence, nor worse for our guilt. If men bee faultie, what hath Truth offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Except the sacred word of the euer-liuing God can mis-guide
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19612:20"/>
you, we haue set you right. We are but Dust and Ashes, yet, O God, giue vs thine humble vassals leaue in an awfull confidence so farre to contest with thee, the Lord of heauen and earth, as to say, <hi>If we be deceiued, thou hast deceiued vs.</hi> It is thou that hast spoken by vs to thy people; Let God bee True, and euery man a Lier; Whither should we goe from thee, thou hast the words of eternall life. Deare Christians, our fore-fathers trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to vs the intire inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ, repurchased by the bloud of their martyrdome; Oh let not our ill husbandry impaire it; Let not posteritie once say, they might haue bin happy, but for the vnthriftines of vs their progenitors;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19612:21"/>
Let it not bee said, that the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vs the teachers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Truth hath dealt with Religion as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did with his shields, which hee found of Gold, but left of Brasse. If Truth had no friends, we should plead for it, but now that we haue before our eies so powerfull an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, that with his very pen hath so laid error vpon the backe, that all the world cannot raise it, what a shame were it to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him, to Truth, to our selues?</p>
            <p>But perhaps now, I know some of your thoughts; you would buy Truth (ye thinke) you would hold it, if yee could be sure to know it; There are many slips amongst the true coyne; Either of the mothers

pleaded the liuing childe to be hers, with equall protestations, oathes, teares. True; Yet a <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> sword can diuide Truth from falshood; and there is a test, and fire that can discerne true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals from adulterate; In spight of all counterfeiting there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine infallible marks, to know Truth from Error; Take but a few of many; whether in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, in the natures, in the ends of both. In the first, Truth is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, Error is humane; what is grounded vpon the diuine word must needs be irrefragably true; that which vpon humane Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either must, or may be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous. In the second, Truth is one, conforme euer to it selfe, <gap reason="foreign">

In the third, Truth, as it came from God, so is referd to him; neither hath any other end, than the glory of the God of Truth; Error hath euer some self-respects; either <gap reason="foreign">

that you should not see the Truth; and, if yee care not for your soules, when yee see it, sell it: Let no false tongue perswade you there is no danger in this sale: How charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly so euer wee thinke of poore blinded soules, that liue in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and inuincible darknesse of error, certainly Apostasie is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; How euer those speed that are robbed of Truth, you cannot sell Truth, and be saued. Haue mercy therefore on your owne soules, for their sakes, for the sake of him that bought them, with the deare ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of his precious bloud; And as God hath blessed you with the inualuable treasure of Truth; so hoard it vp in your hearts, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it in your liues; Oh let vs be <hi>Gens iusta custodiens veritate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> Es. 26.
