         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſince the report of our late differences about Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, one with another, remaining under one common Name and Deſignation of <hi>Quakers,</hi> is ſpread far and near, not only through theſe Three Nations, but other Places abroad, as is apparent by the late GENERAL HISTORY of the <hi>QUAKERS,</hi> Written by <hi>Gerard Croeſe</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> writ Originally in <hi>Latin,</hi> and lately Publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh</hi> here at <hi>London.</hi> And that the Report of the late Meeting and Conference held at <hi>Turners-Hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>11</hi>th of the Month called <hi>June,</hi> is much gone abroad through both City and Country, chiefly with reſpect to the ſubject matter there diſcourſed, and my undertaking againſt them of the oppoſite Party, to prove certain Perſons of greateſt Note among them, guilty of denying and oppoſing theſe great Fundamentals particularly ſpecified in the following Narrative out of their Printed Books, it may be judged that both the love of Chriſtian Verity, and the ſenſe of Chriſtian Duty, will oblige and induce you to read the ſaid Narrative, if it fall into your hands, and others to enquire after it that the truth of the matter may be ſearched into, whether theſe whom I have undertaken, to prove guilty of denying and oppoſing theſe great Fundamental Truths, be really ſo or I be guilty in accuſing them.

               </gap>t, a Profeſſion of Religion towards God, and Light in Men, excluding Chriſt God Man and the Faith of him, as he dyed for us and roſe again, and is ſat down in the Kingdom of the Father, and as he is to come again to judge the Quick and the Dead in the true intire glorified Nature of Man, having the true Soul and Body of Man, the ſame he had on Earth. The denyal of theſe great Fundamental Truths of the Chriſtian Religion, with ſome others neceſſarily related to them, and joyned with them inſeparably, I have undertaken to prove my Opponents guilty of; and not only I, but many Judicious Perſons that were preſent at that Meeting at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> the <hi>11</hi>th of the Month called <hi>June</hi> of this inſtant <hi>1696,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95822:5"/>
of the ſeveral Profeſſions of Proteſtants in this great City, did judge that I have effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done it. But if I have not done it, and cannot make it justly to appear that theſe particular Perſons are guilty of the things charged by me on them, I ſhall freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I deſerve great blame, and therefore I greatly deſire (if it were the Will of God) that I might have yet <hi>a more Publick Opportunity to be heard,</hi> as concerning theſe things, were it to be called before the greateſt Perſons of Authority in the Nation, either to make good my Charges againſt them, and if they be found guilty the blame to lye on them; or if I be found guilty, that I may have the blame laid on me. But let them be found ever ſo guilty, as I am moſt ſure they are, (let them cover and cloak as much as ever they can) I would not in the least have them perſecuted, or any Sufferings, either in Perſon or Eſtate, to come upon them My deſign in this undertaking is, that they may be ſhamed out of their groſs Errors if poſſible; or if they continue ſhameleſs in them, yet that all others who are not as yet tainted with them, may be preſerved from them, and cautioned and warned againſt them; for this Gangrene of their vile and groſs Errour and Hereſie, that is a complex of the worſt ſort of Errors and Hereſies that ever infeſted the Chriſtian Profeſſion, hath to my certain knowledge overſpread many parts and many perſons in theſe Three Nations, as well as elſewhere. Though I charge them not either upon the generality, far leſs the univerſality of all them called <hi>Quakers.</hi> But if they really diſown theſe groſs and vile Errors, which I have proved them guilty of in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Narrative, and be cordial in the belief and acknowledgment of the great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths oppoſite to thoſe Errors, then it will be that which the ſincere Profeſſors of Chriſtianity in theſe Three Nations will expect from them, and may juſtly require of them, as publickly to retract and renounce theſe Errors, as they have publickly aſſerted them in their Printed Books in the face of the Chriſtian World, otherwiſe no ſincere Chriſtians will believe them to be in good earneſt, but that they reſemble many old Hereticks, and particularly the crafty <hi>Arrians,</hi> that pretended and made great Proteſtations that they owned the true Faith, according to all contained in the Scriptures, when they did nothing leſs. And whereas ſome have Objected to me, that ſince I have acknowledged divers paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in my own Books need correction, and have promiſed to do it, I ought to have done that in the firſt place, before I had charged Errors upon others, otherwiſe it would look like the Hyprocrites ſeeking to pull cut the Mote out of his Neighbours Eye, when the Beam is in his own Eye. I Anſwer, The things that <hi>need Correction</hi> in my Books, compared with the vile Errors in theirs, are but as my Motes to their Beams, which I had ſo far already pulled out of my own Eye, that I have freely acknowledged them to many <hi>viva voce,</hi> and have them in readineſs to Publiſh in Print with the firſt conveniency. Nor are they ſuch things as oppoſe any Chriſtian Principles of Faith, but of an inferiour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And it muſt be one of theſe two things that are their greateſt hinderances to publiſh any ſuch Corrections; that is, either that they are ſtill entangled in thoſe Errors, but are not willing it be known, fearing leſt the preſent publick avouching of them may bring ſome Perſecution on them, or great Infamy and Reproach; or if they be in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences convinced of thoſe Errors, and ſo are come to a better underſtanding of Chriſtian Doctrines and Principles, yet their Pride and high Authority that they have gained over their too credulous followers will not ſuffer them to make any ſuch free acknowledgment, but eſpecially becauſe any ſuch free acknowledgment, by their own argument and way of reaſoning againſt all other Miniſters in all Chriſtian Profeſſions, would as much unmini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter them, as others they have unminiſtred on that account; <hi>viz</hi> want of Infallibility, or being ſubject and lyable to Errors and Miſtakes in Articles of Chriſtian Faith. And this will alſo not a little ſtick in the way, to be ſo humbled that they muſt acknowledge <hi>G. Keith</hi> has not falſly accuſed them, (as they have ſeverely charged him to have done) if they confeſs their former Errors: But how much better were a ſincere Confeſſion in the
<pb facs="tcp:95822:5"/>
caſe, taking ſhame as due to them, and humbling themſelves under the power and victory of Truth, than a haughty and arrogant ſtanding out to juſtifie themſelves, in theſe things that neither God nor good Men will ever juſtifie them in. And if they continue ſo bold, as to hold ſuch palpable Contradictions as are diſcovered in their former and latter Books, and ſometimes in the ſame Books, all ingenuous Perſons that know their Contradictions, will conclude them not only ſtill guilty of thoſe Errors, but great Hypocrites; for n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I do freely leave it to all Impartial Judges, whether they or I be guilty of this ſevere Charge; and let the Tree be judged by the Fruits.</p>
            <p>Their pretended Excuſes for not meeting me, as deſired, at the Place and Time mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Printed Advertiſement, are ſo frivolous and weak that they are ſcarce worth noticing: But however the chiefeſt of them I Anſwered on the Place, as the following Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative will certifie. Their pretence of their not meeting me, <hi>for the ſake of Religion, the Liberty granted us, and the Civil Peace, is an empty ſhift, and poor evaſion.</hi> Is it contrary to their Religion to diſpute their Adverſary, <hi>viva voce?</hi> Why then did they diſpute with the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and mightily provoked them thereunto, and that <hi>viva voc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi> And not only with them but with many others, both at <hi>London,</hi> and in many other Places in the Nation, and that before promiſcuous and mixt Auditories, as they commonly call the World, (excepting their own Party, whom they call, <hi>The Elect People of God</hi>). And why did <hi>W. Penn</hi> give ſuch a daring Challenge to <hi>Thomas Hicks, Reaſon againſt Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> p. <hi>184.</hi> and complain againſt him in theſe words? <hi>I muſt needs tell the World, the baſe Cowardice of this Adverſary in hand; for we have offered him a free Meeting, with his Books in our hands proffering to refute them,</hi> viva voce, <hi>before the World; but inſtead thereof, or any other way, (as ſeveral have been tendered) he diſingenuouſly ſlinks away, and puts us off by meer Shifts and Evaſions.</hi> And let the Reader judge if <hi>W. Penn</hi> has not ſhown great Cowardice, and his Party charged by not appearing at all; whereas <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> at leaſt, once appeared. But why ſhould ſuch a Diſpute <hi>viva voce</hi> be conſtrued to be againſt the <hi>Liberty</hi> granted us, and the <hi>Civil Peace,</hi> more now than then; when at that time thoſe in Civil Authority were more ſevere, whereas now they are very propitious? And why ſhould Diſputes <hi>viva voce</hi> be more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to Civil Peace than Diſputes in Print? I believe they can give no Reaſon. And it is altogether incredible, that my undertaking the Vindication of the Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Chriſtian Faith, profeſſed by the preſent Authority, againſt ſuch manifeſt Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it as I have proved my Opponents to be, can be conſtrued by the Authority to be any breach of the Civil Peace, eſpecially when I had procured the Leave of the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> for ſuch an undertaking, whereof my Opponents were not ignorant. Their upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with vain ſpeculations, not telling what thoſe are, ſhoweth their great impertinency: But ſuch who are but a little acquainted with the Religious Differences betwixt them and me, may eaſily gueſs what they mean by my vain ſpeculations, even the Fundamental Truths
<pb facs="tcp:95822:6"/>
of the Chriſtian Faith, and other ſolid and ſound Articles of Doctrine thereunto belonging: And if theſe be not they, I dare them to name what my vain Speculations are, whereof they accuſe me. But to be ſure, the plain and manifeſt Proofs I have brought out of their Books againſt the greateſt Truths of Chriſtianity, demonſtrate their Speculations not only to be Vain, but Pernicious and Peſtiferous. Their Hypocriſie is manifeſt, in making what they call my Paſſionate and Abuſive Behaviour, an Excuſe for not meeting me, when deſired. For if they thought that I would ſhow any ſuch Behaviour, it would be ſuch an advantage to them, that it would rather be an Argument to invite them to meet me, that I may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my ſelf, than to diſſwade them. But bleſſed be God, that preſerved me at that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I had great Provocation given me by ſome of their Party, in ſuch a Temper and Moderation of Spirit (as hundreds are ready to witneſs) as became a ſober Chriſtian, when ſome of them that appeared againſt me, ſhewed themſelves very outragious. And as inſignificant is their Excuſe of declining to meet, becauſe it was not an agreed Meeting on both ſides: As if guilty Perſons are not to be tryed without their conſent and agreement. Was it not more Fair, Juſt and Equal in me, and my Friends, to give them a fair Tryal, with open and free acceſs of all ſober Perſons, as many as the Place could contain without Croud, and leave it to the Conſciences of the Auditors how to judge, and intimate my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n at a convenient time beforehand, than for them to condemn me in a clandeſtine Place without all Tryal, fair or unfair, and not to let me have acceſs to them, but when and how little time they pleaſed, and to ſuffer none of my Friends to be preſent to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of their unfair proceedings againſt me. Their upbraiding me by inſinuating my aſſuming a Spiritual Juriſdiction over them, and ſummoning them to appear before me, is idle and vain.</p>
            <p>The Injurer is Debtor to the Injured, and accountable to him: But let them tell what Spiritual Juriſdiction they had over me, to call me ſeveral times to them at their Yearly Meetings <hi>1694,</hi> more than I had over them to call them to our Meeting at <hi>Turners-Hall, 1696,</hi> unleſs they will fly to their common Pretence, common to them with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their <hi>Infallibility</hi>; the contrary of which they have manifestly ſhowed; and never any Society of People profeſſing Chriſtianity hath given greater Inſtances of not only their Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, but their being miſerably deceived, than theſe Men have done. And as idle is that other Excuſe of theirs, that they will not diſpute with me, <hi>viva voce,</hi> becauſe I am gone off from them (but they did thruſt me from them by their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt Excommunication, when I would have ſtayed among them ſo long as I could have any hope to have reclaimed them from their Errors); but if my going off be a ſufficient Reaſon why they will not Anſwer me <hi>viva voce,</hi> it is as ſufficient a Reſon why they ſhould not Anſwer me in Print, which yet they boast they will do: For if I be not worthy nor fit to be Anſwered by Word, nor am I to be Anſwered by Writ: But all this ſheweth their confuſion and inconſiſtency. They think ſuch a Meeting at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> is but in a corner, and not in the face of the Nation; but they are like to find it hath been ſo much in the face of the Nation, that many in the Nation will notice it, poſſibly more than they would either wiſh or expect, and more than any thing that hath happened to them for many Years paſt, to give the Nation a diſcovery of them and of their vile Errors and irregular Practices.</p>
            <p>If my Adverſaries happen to put out an Anſwer to this <hi>Narrative,</hi> filled (as their manner is) with the Falſhoods and Perverſions, and vain Shifts and Evaſions, I purpoſe, with Leave of the Civil Authority, which I hope to obtain as well as formerly, God willing to Print <hi>a New Advertiſement of a Méeting, and to give them timely No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice before-hand, to detect their Errors and Abuſes yet further, and to renew the like Practice, as oft as they abuſe the World and me with their Prints.</hi> For their unfair way of Diſputing in Print, is much eaſier diſcovered <hi>viva voce,</hi> than by Anſwering in Print, and is more acceptable to all Free and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial People, who in that way are more capable to judge.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> WHereas <hi>William Penn</hi> hath accuſed me <hi>George Keith,</hi> in a Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> of my being an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> and Impoſtor, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to pluck up the Teſtimony of Truth by the Roots; and that he hath not either then or ſince, after many months, proved his Charge to be true, tho' he promiſed to anſwer me (before many Witneſſes) when I told him, I thought to put him to prove his Charge in the Face of the Nation: And I being conſcious to my ſelf, that I am not guilty of his Charge, I charge him to be guilty of Falſe Accuſation, and Defamation, and offer to prove him to be ſo; as alſo I offer to prove him guilty out of his Printed Books, (which it doth not appear that he hath Retracted or Corrected) of moſt Erroneous and hurtful Principles, contrary to the Fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion delivered to us in the Holy Scriptures: And alſo that he is guilty of groſs Contradiction to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas <hi>Thomas Elwood</hi> hath Printed ſundry Defamatory Books againſt me, I charge him to be guilty of Falſe Accuſations, Perverſions, and Forgeries, contained in his ſaid books, as alſo of moſt Erroneous and Hurtful Principles, to the great ſhame of his Profeſſion, and Scandal of Chriſtian Religion, and I offer to prove him to be ſo.</p>

               <head>And here I think fit to give a true Account of the Juſt Cauſe I have to intimate ſuch a Meeting.</head>
               <p>IN my book called, <hi>A Seasonable Information and Caveat,</hi> againſt a ſcandalous book of <hi>Th. Elwood,</hi> I made a profer to <hi>Th. Elwood,</hi> to meet him at any Place and Time that he would appoint, to prove him guilty of groſs Forgery in matters of Fact, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo of falſe Doctrine: But he did no wiſe aſſent to any ſuch proffer, nor gave any rational Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for his Rufuſal (pretending, <hi>he would not give</hi> G K. <hi>an Opportunity to gratifie the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and diſgrace his Profeſſion he yet made of Truth, by ſo publick a diſcovery of his ungoverned Paſſions</hi>). [What is this but great hypocriſie? And no doubt, if he or his Party thought to get any advantage againſt me, ſuch a Publick Appearance, either in regard of the Cauſe, or of what he and they call my <hi>ungoverned Paſſions,</hi> they would greedily embrace it: But the reality of the matter is, they are not willing their great injuſtice, as well as their inſolent carriage, and moſt unruly Paſſions in clandeſtine places, ſhould be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhutting the doors upon all but themſelves, that none that were equal and impartial Hearers and Obſervers might be preſent, to be a check to their rude and inſolent carriage againſt me, many ſpeaking to me at once, which ſome among themſelves reproved at the firſt Yearly Meeting, I appeared among them. Thus they ſeek to murther the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Innocent in ſecret places.] And inſtead of aſſenting to my juſt proffer, he prints another book againſt me, filled with more than double (to what was in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer book) of Forgeries, Perverſions, Falſe Accuſations and Miſrepreſentations. And I having neither time, nor ability of outward Eſtate, to print Anſwers to him and others, that heap book upon book againſt me, with no charge to them, (they having got a way without any charge or coſt to them, to Print what they pleaſe). And things being thus,</p>
               <p>I appeal to all moderate perſons, whether this my intimation of ſuch a Meeting, in the defence of the Fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity, as the neceſſity of Faith in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95822:7"/>
Chriſt, as he outwardly ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to our Salvation, Juſtification and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fication, by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed, the Reſurrection of the Body that dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth, and Chriſts coming without us, in his Glorified Body, even the ſame that formerly ſuffered Death for our ſins, to Judge the Quick and the Dead: All which I offer to prove have been oppoſed and contradicted by ſome of them, being the common Faith general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in common profeſſed by Chriſtians in all profeſſions, and for the defence of which, all ſincere Chriſtians are jointly concerned, and alſo in my juſt vindication, both as a man and a Chriſtian, be not juſtifiable and commendable, it being the beſt way I have at preſent to clear the Truth and my Innocency, and diſcover their great injuſtice towards me, and to Anſwer the proud and inſulting boaſtings of my Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>And whereas in my late Book, called, <hi>A ſhort Liſt of ſome of the vile and groſs Errors of</hi> Geo. Whitehead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I propoſed a juſt demand to <hi>William Penn,</hi> to give me an Opportunity for him to make good his Charge againſt me at any publick Meeting of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in or about <hi>London</hi>; inſtead of his aſſenting to my juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, there comes forth a Third Book of <hi>Tho. Elwood,</hi> multiplying his groſs Forgeries, Defamations, and Miſrepreſentations againſt me, and alſo containing moſt falſe and Antichriſtian Doctrine, to the great diſhonour of the bleſſed Name of Chriſt, and the Chriſtian Religion. And as if <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> were not alive, or not able to Anſwer for themſelves, he will needs Anſwer for them; and the ſaid <hi>Tho. Elwood</hi> puts a moſt impudent and notorious perverſion upon my plain words, in my Propoſition to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> ſaying of me, as he has worded his Demand, he ſeems to have beſpoke a Publick Meeting that he might have done it himſelf; ſee <hi>page</hi> 159. and <hi>page</hi> 160. of his <hi>Truth defended. As if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he wanted ſuch an Opportunity to prove himſelf an Apoſtate.</hi> Let the Reader but read my words in my own Book, and at the firſt ſight he will ſee the Cheat and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. Obſerve Reader my words, <hi>p.</hi> 32. <hi>And let him ſignifie to me the time and place where he will make it to appear.</hi> (I ſay not <hi>when I will</hi>) that his Charge againſt me is true.</p>
               <p>May I not well ſay, that ever ſuch a groſs and impudent Forgerer, Wreſter and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter of a Mans words, ſhould be allowed or permitted to be an Agent, Patron, or Champion for what they call the Body of the People named <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Miniſtry, is a ſign that they are at a low Ebb, when they make uſe of ſuch Tools as <hi>T. E.</hi> is, whom I can, and do offer to prove not only to be guilty of groſs Forgeries and Perverſions, and Antichriſtian Principles, but groſly ignorant (in that which he pretends to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) —of Humane Learning; and who is guilty of Pedantick trifling and quibbling, from meer Errors of the Preſs, not ſo duly corrected, yet obvious to any intelligent Reader.</p>
               <p>And to my demanding the like Juſtice to be done me, as ſome Years ago we demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> againſt <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> he anſwereth in his laſt book, falſly called, <hi>Truth defended,</hi> pag. 158. <hi>That betwixt that and this of mine, there is in parallel: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in that there was a people concerned on each ſide,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whereas</hi> W. P<hi>'s calling</hi> G. K. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, affects no body that I know of</hi> (ſaith <hi>T. E.) but himſelf and himſelf, but juſtly: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is</hi> G. K. <hi>of any People now, ſo far as I can underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Reader conſider (and judge by this Taſte in the End of his Cask, what ſort of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor fills the whole), W. P<hi>'s calling</hi> G. K. <hi>Apoſtate, affects no body that he knows of but himſelf.</hi> If this were true, as it is moſt falſe, is it not moſt unjuſt Reaſoning? <hi>G. K.</hi> is but one, and the charge of Apoſtate affects no body but himſelf; therefore he muſt not have Right done to him, nor muſt his complaint be heard of his being wronged. Hath not every ſingle perſon as real and true Right to Juſtice, as a great number? Otherwiſe he muſt Juſtify all the Perſecutions and Murthers that have been acted upon ſingle perſons, who have had none perhaps to own them but God alone. But <hi>T. E.</hi> knoweth that <hi>G. K.</hi> has Wife and Children that are affected with this unjuſt charge of <hi>W. P.</hi> tending to the expoſing of them to ruin and want. If ſo be either <hi>W. P.</hi> or <hi>T. E.</hi> could beget an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal perſwaſion in people, that his Charge is true, but that <hi>T. E.</hi> ſaith, the Charge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects me juſtly, is his begging the Queſtion, which neither he, nor any elſe can prove; for they cannot prove that I am declined in the leaſt, from any Principles or Practices of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95822:8"/>
Chriſtianity that I formerly profeſſed: But that without any change of Principles, from what I formerly profeſſed, ever ſince I was owned by the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand better ſome places of Scripture; and that God has been pleaſed of late Years fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enlighten me, and enable me more clearly to conceive, and more diſtinctly and ſafely to hold forth the ſame Principles of my Faith formerly received by me, is no ſign of my Apoſtacy, but of my growth in the Truth, and in the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is one thing they mightily aggravate againſt me, and think they have catch'd me in a great Contradiction, that ſome time ago I had an Opinion of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and ſome others, as being men of ſound Principles, and of late I have charged them to the contrary. But to this I Anſwer, This is no contradiction in Principle, or matter of Doctrine; the moſt it argueth, is, that I have been miſtaken in theſe men: but I never heard that a miſtake only in mens perſons; was ever made a Badge or Character of Apoſtacy. But they have no advantage againſt me in reſpect of the change of my Opinion of theſe men, but I have the ſame advantage againſt them; for they have as much changed their Opinion of me as I have of them. And what change of Opinion: I have had of them, is occaſioned by themſelves, in their late cloaking and excuſing vile Errors, which at laſt, by a more diligent ſearch into their books (than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I made) I found them guilty of. But whereas <hi>T. E.</hi> ſaith, <hi>G. K. is of no people now,</hi> ſo far as <hi>he can underſtand</hi>; I value not what he underſtands in the caſe; I was then, and now am a Member of Chriſts body, which is his Church, that is not limited to this or that particular Society; nor was I ever ſo ſtrait in my Charity, to think none the people of God but them called <hi>Quakers.</hi> And notwithſtanding their Bull of Excommunication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, from a prevailing Party or Faction in the laſt Yearly Meeting, I have been ſince well owned, and my Teſtimony well received at a conſiderable number of Meetings within not many miles from <hi>London,</hi> and many of them owned to be Friends and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame body, whereof he profeſſeth himſelf a member. And if it were neceſſary, I could eaſily bring a proof, that ſome, owned as his fellow-members, do own me more than they own him. And it is well known, that theſe Abuſes I have met with from <hi>T. E.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> and the prevailing Faction in the laſt Yearly Meeting, have affected many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Conſcientious People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in divers places, and have been a great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and offence to them.</p>
               <p>However, to take away all pretence of Excuſe from <hi>T. E.</hi> and ſtop his mouth in the Caſe, he may ſee where a Meeting of People have publickly owned me, and my Chriſtian Teſtimony, in their printed Treatiſe, called, <hi>A Seaſonable Teſtimony</hi>; (and theſe did own me then as now) and have diſowned the unchriſtian and falſe Excommunication given forth againſt me by that called; <hi>The Yearly Meeting,</hi> 1695. that gave themſelves no particular deſignation of people, nor mentioned any particular <hi>Meeting-Place</hi> where they met, only Signed by a Raw Young Man, that ſerveth for his Salary, and dared not but Sign what they enjoyned him, for fear of loſing his hire.</p>

K.</hi> ſtood up to make ſome Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory Speech to give an Account of the Occaſion of the Meeting, <hi>Henry Goldney,</hi> with ſome other <hi>Quakers</hi> of <hi>W. Pens</hi> Party, came with a Printed Paper, giving ſome Reaſons why <hi>W. Pen</hi> and <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> did not appear, which he deſired might be read.</p>
            <p>It was readily granted; and the Reaſons why <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> did not appear, were read by <hi>G. Keith.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>Now if ye think it has not been well read, let another read it, if you think fit; And I offer to Anſwer to every one of the Reaſons, if you deſire it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Auditory.</speaker>
               <p>No, it is needleſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>This is their deſign, to divert us in our Buſineſs. The Reaſons are ſo ſlender, that I hope every Judicious Perſon here can anſwer them. If I am ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry perſon as they repreſent me, I ſhall lay my ſelf the more open, and they ſhall have the greater Advantage. You know well enough that they would be glad of any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt me. And then for any Offence to Authority, as they ſuggeſt, I have the Lord Mayors leave; and he has ſent his Marſhal to preſerve the Peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be nothing in that. Their Paper rather reflects upon Authority, the Authority of the Worthy Mayor of this Famous City; to whom I went, as I thought it was my Duty, to deſire leave for this Meeting; which he thought fit to conſent to, and has ſent his Marſhal to keep the Peace.</p>
               <p>And I would have you to take Notice now, that they, <hi>viz. W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> own thoſe Books of <hi>Thomas Elwoods, &amp;c.</hi> that are out againſt me, that I knew not before. I went to <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and desired to know whether he owned a former Book of <hi>Thomas Elwood</hi> writ againſt me: He ſaid, he would neither own it, nor diſown it. And this is enough at preſent to Anſwer this Paper.</p>
               <p>I hope in God, the Lord ſhall preſerve me, which has been my Prayer on my Knees this Morning, and many other times, that I might give no occaſion of Reproach to his Name or Truth, and that Religion may not be ſcandalized by any thing I ſhall ſpeak or act; and I hope my Prayers ſhall be anſwered.</p>
               <p>They ſay, I did not exhibit to them a Copy of my Charge againſt them, (an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they call it, they would repreſent me as a Man ſetting up a Spiritual Court) but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95822:9"/>
my Printed Paper ſayes, W. Penn, <hi>and</hi> G. Whitehead, <hi>are juſtly deſired to be preſent.</hi> This is no Indictment nor Summons, as they falſly call it: And for the particulars I intend to prove againſt them, they were expreſly mentioned in my Printed Paper, called <hi>An Advertiſement,</hi> containing Four Fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity by them oppoſed. I deſired <hi>W. Penn</hi> to make good his Charge againſt me, in a former Printed Paper, which was, <hi>That I was an Apoſtate and Impoſtour, endeavouring to pluck up the Teſtimony of Truth by the roots.</hi> This he ſaid at a Meeting at <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> above Fourteen Months ago, and while I was peaceably ſpeaking in that Meeting he interrupts me, and like a Clap of Thunder falls on me in the midſt of my Teſtimony, calls me, <hi>Apoſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> &amp;c. I deſired him alſo at the Yearly Meeting of the <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>London</hi> held 1695. to make good his Charge, and I told him, <hi>If he refuſed, I would put him to prove it in the face of the Nation.</hi> He juſtified his calling me <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He was in no Paſſion, but he was ſo tranſported by the Glorious Power of God, that he knew not whether he was Standing, Sitting or Kneeling.</hi> And ſince I have in Print deſired him to prove his Charge, and now at this Meeting; but he declines to appear. Ye know the ſaying, <hi>Affirmanti incumbit probatio,</hi> He ought to prove what he has affirmed.</p>

               <p>It is a ſtrange thing that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y cannot print a Paper, but muſt have ſo many Falſities in it. They call my Paper, <hi>a Summons and an Indictment,</hi> but I meant it not ſo. But to leave that, and come to our buſineſs</p>
               <p>The four things which I charge them to be guilty of, are theſe; and I appeal to all moderate perſons, whether my intimation of ſuch a Meeting can be blamed, when it is to defend ſuch Points as theſe: <hi>Faith in Chriſt as he outwardly ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to our Salvation.</hi> That is the Firſt. <hi>Juſtification and Sanctification by the Blood of Chriſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhed.</hi> That is the Second. <hi>The Reſurrection of the Body that dyeth.</hi> The Third. <hi>And Chriſts coming without us in his glorified Body, to judge the Quick and Dead.</hi> That is the Fourth. All which have been contradicted by ſome of them, as <hi>W. Penn, G. Whitehead, &amp;c.</hi> though theſe are Fundamental Principles belonging to the common Faith, and are generally owned by Chriſtians of all Profeſſions.</p>
               <p>Now, if you pleaſe, I ſhall proceed to my Proofs Moſt of my buſineſs, whether they be here or not, is to read my Proofs out of their Books, that they are guilty of every one of theſe Four Errors oppoſing thereby Four Fundamental Truths.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>The neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt, as he outwardly ſuffered for us at</hi> Jeruſalem. This is the firſt. But that this is oppoſed by them, I prove thus: The O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ject of Faith is oppoſed by them, and therefore the Faith it ſelf muſt needs be oppoſed. I hope the conſequence is clear enough, it needs no Proof.</p>
               <p>The Object of Chriſtian Faith is Chriſt, both God and Man, and yet but one Chriſt. But ſo it is that I offer to prove, that <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> by approving of <hi>G. Whiteheads</hi> Books, has denyed Chriſt both to be God and Man. This is the thing, which if I make out, I make out my firſt Point.</p>
               <p>And firſt I offer to prove that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in a Book of his has denyed Chriſt to be God, and <hi>W. Penn</hi> has owned this Book: The Book is called, <hi>Light and Life,</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>William Penn</hi> in his <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing,</hi> p. 186. in Anſwer to <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preacher, Printed, 1668. <hi>P.</hi> 47. Here he firſt brings in the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> words. Says the <hi>Baptiſt, Now as he was God, he was Co-Creator with the Father, and ſo was before</hi> Abraham; <hi>and had Glory with God, before the World was, and in this ſenſe came down from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95822:9"/>Now here is <hi>G. Whiteheads</hi> reply, <hi>What Nonſenſe and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural Language is this? To tell of God being Co-Creator wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall read the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> words again, and ſee if there be any thing in them offenſive to Chriſtian Ears. I hope there are not many here but underſtand what <hi>Co</hi> ſignifieth, it is <hi>with.</hi> Now ſee if the words of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> are offenſive to Chriſtian Ears; <hi>As he was God, he was Co-Creator with the Father.</hi> Ye know <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, John</hi> 1.1, 2.

               <p>If I might, I deſire to have liberty to ſpeak, when was the date of the Book?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Pray hear me. The Reaſon why I askt him the date of the Book, is becauſe I believe it was a book antiently written; and <hi>G. Keith</hi> did write in Vindication of our Principles, and now for him to appear in oppoſition to our Principles, it appears that he has apoſtatized from our Principles.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Now let me Anſwer him I do ſay, if it were my laſt words, I know not that I ever read a line of this book till I came laſt to <hi>England,</hi> which is about Two Years. And if <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> be wiſer ſince, it is very well: But then he ſhould have retracted this. For this book, and ſome other books of his, has leavened the minds of many in <hi>America</hi>; as well as here, with Poyſonous Errors.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stranger A Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>Then <hi>George Keith</hi> ought to make a candid and full Retractation of what he has ſaid contrary to Truth, before he appeared againſt them.</p>

               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>I own I have been miſtaken in theſe Men: But I hope this Auditory are ſufficient Judges of that, that if they cannot prove me to hold any Doctrine contrary to my former Principles, nor any Unchriſtian Principle, and that they have nothing againſt me Conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>If you prove me not to have changed in any Fundamental Principle, ye ought not to charge me to be an Apoſtate. I know not any Fundamental Principle, nor indeed any one Principle of the Chriſtian Faith, that I have varied from to this day, ever ſince I came among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which is about Thirty Three Years ago; therefore I ought to be cleared of that Imputation.</p>

               <p>There is another paſſage in <hi>G.

In his <hi>pag.</hi> 24. <hi>Light and Life,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>To tell of the word God Co Creator with the Father, is all one as to tell of God being Co-Creator with God, if the Father be God, and this is to make two Gods, two Creators,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For God Co-Creator with the Father, implyes two.</hi> Ye ſee this is poſitive; and he puts this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> words, <hi>Thus Nonſenſe, Confuſion and Blaſphemy is heapt up againſt the Light within.</hi>

               <p>Then that paſſage in <hi>G. Whiteheads</hi> book was read again.</p>
               <p>See here the Son of God, his Eternal Generation is denyed. <hi>If he had a Father, then there are two Gods.</hi> And here is as plain a denying Chriſt to be God, as any <hi>Socinian</hi> can be guilty of.</p>

               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>I have proved to you already he diſowns Chriſt to be God. Now I will prove he has denyed him to be Man: And then there is that great Article of our Faith loſt, and the Object of the Chriſtian Faith denyed. Here is <hi>G. Whiteheads</hi> Anſwer to <hi>T. Danſons Synopſis of Quakeriſm,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>p.</hi> 18. This is in the book called, <hi>The Divinity of Chriſt aſſerted,</hi> (recommended by <hi>W. Penn, Reaſon againſt Railing,</hi> p. 185.)</p>
               <p>See how <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> takes him up, and how he banters him: <hi>If the Body and Soul of the Son of God were both created, doth not this render him a Fourth Perſon,</hi> &amp;c. But the ſtreſs I lay is in the words following; <hi>But herein whether doth not his and their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the only begotten of the Father plainly appear: Where doth the Scripture ſay, that his Soul was created? For was not he the brightneſs of the Fathers glory, and the expreſs Image of his Divine Subſtance? But ſuppoſing the Soul of Chriſt was (with the Body) crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time,</hi> &amp;c. Here ye ſee, he will not own that Chriſt had a Created Soul. <hi>Th. Danſon,</hi> being a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter did plead, <hi>That Chriſt as Man had a created Soul.</hi> This <hi>G. W.</hi> makes an inconſiſtency, as if he could not be God alſo. This was the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Chriſt was without a Humane Soul, for he was the expreſs Image of his Father. But ſuppoſing the Soul of Chriſt were created with the Body,</hi> &amp;c. That which I would have you take notice of, is this, <hi>Where does the Scripture ſay his Soul was created?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>Well, it was his way of Diſputing, as is ordinary to him, and many others. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch way of Queſtioning plainly imperteth a Denyal.</p>
               <p>Next I prove, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>He has not the Body of a Man.</hi> And then I hope I ſhall have performed what I promiſed. See his <hi>Nature of Chriſtianity,</hi> p. 29, 41. Here I undertake to prove, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> denies that Chriſt in Heaven has any Bodily Exiſtence without us. It he has ſaid otherwiſe in any of his late Printed Books, I am glad of it. But let him retract theſe, for theſe have done much miſchief. Now when I ſaid he was Orthodox, I mean not as he was Heterodox: For there is a <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Orthodox, and a <hi>G.

I do not ſay there are two perſons in <hi>George Whitehead</hi>; he is but one and the ſame perſon, (in this and ſome other things) Orthodox and not Orthodox, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> contradicting <hi>George Whitehead</hi>; he is accountable for theſe Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and not I. I own it, that I have cited divers paſſages out of his later books that are Orthodox to prove him ſound; but I did not then know, when I ſo cited him, that he was guilty of ſuch groſs Errors, as ſince I have found by a further ſearch into his books. Let him retract his Errors, and well enjoy his Orthodoxy. Ye know contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Propoſitions cannot be both true.</p>

               <p>Now <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s way of writing, is to queſtion his Adverſaries, which is the Socratical way of diſputing and arguing againſt his Adverſary.</p>

Newman</hi> in all he owns, but ſo far as he holds the Truth: And if a Papiſt ſay the Truth againſt a Jew, I am ingaged to defend him in it)
<q>This manner of excluding God's right Hand and Chriſt to a Limitation out of his People in a <hi>perſonal Being,</hi> which are no Scripture-terms, ſtill implies him to be a perſonal God or Chriſt, like the Anthropomorphites and Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonians Conceits of him. And again, <hi>pag.</hi> 69. he ſaith: And theſe Words, <hi>Chriſt in Perſon remote in his Body of Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and not in any Man,</hi> are not Scripture, but added.

                  </q>
By theſe Words of <hi>G. W.</hi> all Papiſts, Church of <hi>England-</hi>men, Presbyterians, Independents, Baptiſts, who believe that the Man Chriſt has any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Exiſtence in Heaven, as he thinks, are Anthropomorphites and Muggletonians.

               <p>But mark the Words of <hi>John Newman</hi> above-mentioned, which are ſound; and I ſay, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever under a Chriſtian Profeſſion deny Chriſt to have any perſonal or bodily Exiſtence without us in Heaven, whatever Notion they may have of Chriſt within, it is but a feigned Chriſt within; but who have the true Knowledg and Faith of Chriſt within, to wit, of his Spirit, Light and Grace within, that leads them to own and confeſs to the Man Chriſt without, as well as to his Spirit within. There is no Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-man, Presbyterian or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that holds that Notion, that the Godhead has the Shape of a Man; but the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt has the true Nature of Man.

               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>Thou knoweſt thou art not ſo qualified to ſpeak in this Auditory. Let me go on with my Proofs. I prove further, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> writing againſt one <hi>Jo. Horn,</hi> reflects on him ſcornfully, he calls his Book <hi>the He-goats Horn broken.</hi> Now ſee whether <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> has not broken his own Horn rather. It is a Shame, the Reflections they have made on Men ſounder than themſelves. Let me read the Words; <hi>The He-goats Horn broken, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in anſwer to two Books againſt the Quakers,</hi> Printed, <hi>London,</hi> 1660. Now if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing of true Divinity or Theology, the Paſſage this Man or Men (for there are two of them) lays down here, is a ſound Paſſage, which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> contradicts. Now here is the Paſſage, and do you judg of it. <hi>And where we lay down this as</hi> Tho. Moor's <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> That their Nature is reſtored in Chriſt, and that their Nature is a filthy Nature. This they ſay is falſly expreſſed and perverted, and yet <hi>J. H.</hi> and <hi>T. M.</hi> a little after ſay thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Nature, Kind or Being, as in us, not in Chriſt, is corrupt and filthy in it ſelf; yet Chriſt took upon him our Nature, not as it is filthy in us by Sin in it. And they ſay, That we might as well have taxed the Apoſtle of Confuſion, for ſaying, <hi>Men by Nature do the things contained in the Law</hi>; p. 11, 12. Now here is <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Anſwer,
<q>We may juſtly tax theſe Men for Confuſion indeed, but not the Apoſtle; for here they cannot diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſinful Nature and the pure Nature, for the Nature of Chriſt is pure; ſo that it's not their Nature, for their Nature is filthy, and therefore it is not in Chriſt.</q>
Obſerve, Chriſt did not take upon him <hi>Jo. Horn</hi>'s Nature. No, ſays he. As I have oft told <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> that he and <hi>W. Penn</hi> will needs imbrace falſe Notions in Philoſophy, they will needs ſeem to be Philoſophers by Divine Inſpiration, as well as Miniſters and Preachers by it. But it is a ſad thing, that their falſe Philoſophy ſhould deſtroy their Faith. Now here is a falſe Notion, that Chriſt could not take on him Man's Nature, except he took on him the Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. As if the Pollution of Sin were an eſſential Attribute of Man's Nature. Now Sin, if it be like Scarlet, is no more eſſential to the Nature of Man, than Filth to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for a Garment is the ſame Garment ſtill, whether it be filthy or clean. Therefore I ſay, our bleſſed Lord might well take on him our Nature, and the Nature in us be ſinful, and in him pure and holy. And <hi>Jo. Horn</hi> diſtinguiſhes ſo. Now judg ye whether <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> has broken <hi>Jo. Horn</hi>'s Horn, yea or no; or rather whether has he not broken his own Horn?</p>
               <p>Thus I have done as to the Object of Faith, at preſent at leaſt. Now I come to the Act of Faith, or the Vertue of Faith. See for the Proofs, <hi>William Penn</hi> his <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> a new Nick-name for old Chriſtianity, <hi>p.</hi> 12. Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1672. This Book is without the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Name, and moſt of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Books are without it, tho they perſecuted <hi>William Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for printing ſome of my Books without putting his Name. Here is the Point, <hi>Jo. Faldo</hi> makes this Charge againſt the Quakers, <hi>p.</hi> 12. Chriſtianity was introduced by preaching the promiſed Meſſiah, and pointing at his humane Perſon, but Quakeriſm by preaching a Light within. Now if I had this to anſwer, I would have ſaid, Any Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm I know of, that I learned, was introduced into my Heart both by believing in Chriſt without, and in Chriſt within, (at once, and by one Faith) but inſtead of that he anſwers thus:
<q>I anſwer, That this is nothing injurious to the Quakers at all, but highly on their ſide, for had they preach'd a Chriſt now coming in the Fleſh, they had dented his true and only great viſible Appearance at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which all true Quak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t is not to be again:</q>
And that the whole Chriſtian World beſides have ſo long a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Regeneration is a ſlight thing in compariſon of the Knowledg of Chriſt after the Fleſh. This Doctrine brings not Men to Chriſt in them the Hope of Glory, but inticeth them into the vain Hope of the Hypocriſy which periſheth: the Hiſtory is made the greateſt Myſtery; and to believe the one, matter of greater Difficulty than to experience the other.—'Tis ſtrange that ſhould be reputed moſt myſterious which was the Introduction to the Myſtery, and thoſe Tranſactions counted moſt difficult that were by the Divine Wiſdom of God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained as ſo many facile Repreſentations of what was to be accompliſhed in Man.</q>

               <p>We had wont to ſay, All other Profeſſions denied Chriſt within but here <hi>J. Faldo</hi> owns Chriſt to be in the Gentiles rightly underſtood. But to me Chriſt crucified, in whom the Fulneſs dwell th, is a greater Myſtery, and a greater Matter to be believed. I can ſhew many of the Philoſophers that owned the Light within, under the Denomination of the Word, Light, Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it was ſo hard for them to believe that a Man that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified as a Malefactor ſhould die for their Sins.

"Behold your Expoſitor! I dare warrant this Man's Comment will never trouble the next "Collection of Criticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A rare way to refute him, to banter him at this rate. Now I will give you my Senſe. I do not reckon <hi>J. Faldo</hi> was ſo ignorant a Man, that he believed a Man could be a Chriſtian only with a traditional Knowledg or Faith of Chriſt without him. But tho Regeneration is no ſlight thing, yet I ſay, comparing Chriſt's Incarnation, that is a Complex of Myſteries, (a certain Writer <note n="‖" place="margin">

Therefore this of <hi>W. Penn</hi> is but a mere Banter. There is none of all the Church-of-<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>-men, or Independents, or Presbyterians, ſay the mere hiſtorical, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral, traditional Faith of Chriſt will ſave any. But the Matter is, there is a ſaving Faith of Chriſt without us; and Chriſt without us as he is both God and Man, the Emanuel, as well as his inward Appearance in us, is the Object of ſaving Faith; but theſe Men would not own it. I deſire you well to mark and conſider the ſeveral Paſſages in this whole Paragraph of <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Rejoinder, what groſs and abſurd things it contains. He ſaith, This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine brings not Men to Chriſt in them the Hope of Glory, but inticeth them into the vain Hope of the Hypocrite which periſheth. Yea ſee how he makes it the vain Hope of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite to believe that Chriſt without is a greater Myſtery than Chriſt within; that's Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is Myſtery, according to him.</p>
               <p>Now I have ſome other principal Proofs yet remaining about this groſs Error of <hi>W. Penn.</hi> I ſhall read to you in his <hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> a Paſſage, <hi>p</hi> 97, 98. printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1674. but the Printer's Name is not to it.
<q>To conclude, as <hi>Abraham</hi> outward and natural, was the great Father of the Jews, whoſe Seed God promiſed to bleſs with Earthly Bleſſings, as <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. and that they were figurative of the one Seed Chriſt, and ſuch as he ſhould beget unto a lively Hope through the Power of his Spiritual Reſurrection; it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently follow, that this Seed muſt be inward and ſpiritual, ſince one outward thing cannot be the proper Figure or Repreſentation of another, nor is it the way of holy Scripture ſo to teach us. The outward Lamb ſhews forth the inward Lamb; the Jew outward, the Jew inward. As God attended the one with many ſingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have theſe two ſhort Arguments to prove what I believe and aſſert as to the Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the true Seed, and a clearer Overthrow it is to the Opinion of our Adverſaries to the true Chriſt.</q>

Now becauſe the Nature, or Image begotten in the Hearts of true Believers, is ſpiritual, it will follow, if the Seed which ſo begets, and brings forth that Birth, muſt be the ſame in nature with that which is begotten, therefore ſpiritual; then Chriſt's Body, or what he had from the Virgin, ſtrictly conſidered as ſuch, was not the Seed.</q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is clear from hence, the Serpent is a Spirit: Now nothing can bruiſe the Head of the Serpent, but ſomething that is ſo internal and ſpiritual as the Serpent is. But if that Body of Chriſt were the Seed, then could he not bruiſe the Serpent's Head in all, becauſe the Body of Chriſt is not ſo much as in any one, and conſequently the Seed of the Promiſe is an holy and ſpiritual Principle of Light, Life and Power, that being received into the Heart, bruiſeth the Serpent's Head: And becauſe the Seed, which cannot be that Body, is Chriſt, as teſtify the Scriptures,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.</note> the Seed is one, and that Seed Chriſt, and Chriſt God over all, bleſſed for ever.

                  <q>So the Paſchal Lamb was no Figure of Chriſt without. And when <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God!</hi> it was meant of Chriſt within us, not of Chriſt without us, for our Paſſover is ſlain for us.</q>
You ſee, according to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> that Paſſover that was ſlain for us, was ſlain in us, not without us: And ſo they throw away our Arguments againſt the Jews: the Jews may plead the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is not yet come. [The Light within is owned by the Jews, and their Rabbies ſpeak highly of it, yea, they call it a Ray or Beam of the Heavenly <hi>Adam</hi>; and by way of Allegory, his Fleſh and Blood, as I can plainly prove out of their Writings. And if the Types and Prophecies of the Old Teſtament mean only the Light within, by the one Seed that was promiſed, and held forth under theſe Types, how ſhall we convince them that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come? and that becauſe he is come, theſe Types, Figures and Shadows of the Law are aboliſhed.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Then Chriſt's Body he had from the Virgin, ſtrictly conſidered as ſuch, was not the Seed.</hi> This is rare Logick. Here is a Fallacy, but I believe it proceeds not from any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but from his Weakneſs in Logick. You know there ſhould be no Term nor Thing of Importance in the Concluſion of any Syllogiſm or Argument, but what ſhould be in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; but <hi>ſtrictly conſidered</hi> is not in the Premiſes, therefore it ſhould not be in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. No Man ſays, the Body of Chriſt ſtrictly conſidered without the Soul of Chriſt is Chriſt, or that either the Soul and Body of Chriſt ſtrictly conſidered, without the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is the Chriſt. Therefore he fights againſt a Man of Straw. But the Senſe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, that his B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dy was no Part of him. The one Seed cannot be an outward thing, this ye ſee is univerſal and excluſive of any outward thing; for ſays <hi>W. Penn,</hi> one outward Thing cannot be the proper Figure or Repreſentation of another.—Again, Nothing (ſaith he) can bruiſe the Head of the Serpent but ſomething that is alſo internal and ſpiritual,<note n="‖" place="margin">But is not the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or Devil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Men as well as within many Men?</note> as the Serpent is. And whereas <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſaith, The Body of Chriſt is not ſo much as in any one; this contradicts his Brother <hi>John Whitehead,</hi> that ſays, He denieth that Chriſt hath a Body out of every Man on Earth. Here is their Contradiction, and yet they both pretend to be infallible.</p>
               <p>But ſee what a Sorites is here, ſaith <hi>W. Penn:</hi> The Seed is one, and that Seed Chriſt, and Chriſt God over all, bleſſed for ever. We do conclude, and that moſt truly, that Chriſt was and is the divine Word of Light and Life that was in the Beginning with God, and was and is God over all, bleſſed for ever. Thus you ſee he makes the promiſed Seed to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an inward Principle, God over all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I think it is not true, to ſay, The Seed of God in Men is God; I judg it is unſound Doctrine, and contradicts <hi>R. B.</hi> who calleth that inward Seed, <hi>Vehiculum Dei,</hi> the Vehicle of God. But to ſay, Chriſt is only God, and not Man without us, as <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing imports, is moſt falſe Doctrine, and is as great and dangerous an Extream as to ſay, Chriſt is only Man and not God. But the true Chriſtian Doctrine is, that Chriſt is both God and Man, and yet one Chriſt. I have done at preſent with my firſt Head.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bts, as we forgive our Debtors.</hi> Says <hi>W. Penn,</hi>
                  <q>Where nothing can be more obvious, than that which is forgiven, is not paid; and if it is our Duty to forgive without a Satisfaction received, and that God is to forgive us, as we forgive them, then is a Satisfaction <hi>Totally excluded.</hi>
                  </q>
I confeſs I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with this word, <hi>Totally excluded.</hi> Satisfaction is not the ſtrict Solution of a Debt in all Reſpects and Circumſtance. When we conſider the Dignity of our Lord, that was both God and Man; his Sufferings, (ſuppoſe they were not the Thouſand Part of what the Damned ſuffer) yet it was a true Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: Therefore I was ſcandalized with theſe words. An Hundred Years ago the Church of <hi>England</hi> has very well anſwered this fallacious Argument of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s, that is, the ſame with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in her Homily on Salvation, the Firſt Part.</p>
               <p>And here he gives Nine Arguments to prove that the Notion of Chriſt's Satisfaction for Sin brings with it Nine irrational Conſequences and Irreligious: But they are ſo weak and inſignificant, that it were but loſs of time, to mention them here, or anſwer them. Only give me leave to add, Theſe very Perſons, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> after they have thruſt out of Doors by their falſe Logick, Chriſt's Satisfaction without us; they own that Chriſt in us <note n="(a)" place="margin">See <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, <hi>pag. 284.</hi> And <hi>G. W.</hi> Light and Life, <hi>p. 44.</hi>
                  </note> offereth up himſelf a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to appeaſe the wrath of God. Now, if free forgiveneſs exclude the Satisfaction of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, by <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Argument, by the ſame it does as much exclude his Satisfaction within us; pray mark that.</p>
               <p>Now you have heard a Proof from <hi>W. Penn,</hi> let me come to <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> again. You ſhall have here a rare Diſh of Divinity, not that I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke any to Lightneſs. But I have read many Books in my time, but I never read ſuch a Book (except the Ranters) in my Life; Popery is Orthodoxy to it. No Popiſh Prieſt will Argue as he has done, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Light and Life,</hi> pag. 8. He blames here <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> for ſaying, The Blood ſhed upon the Croſs ſprinkles the Conſcience, Sanctifies, Juſtifies, Redeems us. Now here is <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Cenſure of him.
<q>Obſerve here a two-fold ſtreſs is laid upon that Blood; 1. Merit, to Salvation; 2. Work, to Sanctification: And ſo he hath ſet it up above God, for God could not ſave, he ſaith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerv. <hi>To ſay, That Chriſt's Blood merits Salvation, is to ſet it up above God; for God could not ſave, he ſaith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, he wrongs <hi>W. Burnet</hi>: I know not the Man, his words are theſe, which ſome where or other I have noted. <hi>W. Burnet</hi> ſays, Chriſt as God, without being Man, he could not ſave. <note n="(b)" place="margin">See his Book, <hi>pag. 35.</hi> called, The Capital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> But I wholly wave that Diſpute; I think it is above man's Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, whether Antecedently to God's purpoſe, he could have ſaved us without the Death of his own dear Son. But God having ſo ordained it, conſequentially to his purpoſe, it may be as ſafely and truly ſaid, as when the Scripture ſaith, God cannot lye. Is it any Reflection to ſay, God cannot lye, and that he cannot contradict his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? And the Scripture ſays, God has not appointed us to wrath, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; I hope then he cannot ſave us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Man Chriſt, becauſe he has ſaid, he will not; and the Man Chriſt is a Joynt-Saviour with God the Father. Again, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. <hi>G. W.</hi> brings the words of <hi>W. Burnet</hi> thus.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Now the Quakers would be ſo far from directing Men to go to the Material Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they make it but a vain thing to look to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95822:15"/>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the Antitype of that Temple, <hi>viz.</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, as he was there crucified; or to that Blood, that was there ſhed for Juſtification, <hi>p.</hi> 24.</q>
Now ſee the Anſwer,
<q>The Quakers ſee no need of directing Men to the Type for the Antitype, neither to the outward Temple, nor yet to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> either to Jeſus Chriſt, or his Blood, knowing that neither the Righteouſneſs of Faith, nor the word of it doth ſo direct, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And is it the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts Doctrine to direct Men to the Material Temple, and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Type for the Antitype? What <note n="(c)" place="bottom">It is no more Nonſenſe than many good Chriſtian Teachers have uſed, to expound and open the Types of the Old Teſtament, and to ſhew how they directed to Chriſt, the Antitype; yea, divers Quakers Preach the Types as directing to Chriſt and his Spirit within: And <hi>G. Fox</hi> uſed much to Preach upon the Types of the Old Teſtament, as the Booths they made at the Feaſt of Tabernacles, and the Lamps in the Temple, and the Snuffers, how they had a Spiritual ſignification. And ſhall any Chriſtian ſay, that none of theſe Types ſignified Chriſt without, but only Chriſt within?</note> Nonſenſe and Darkneſs is this? And where do the Scriptures ſay, the Blood was there ſhed for Juſtification, and that Men muſt be directed to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>It may be queſtioned whether there may not be ſome need to expound the Types, as directing to Chriſt, though not to pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See Verſes 6, 7.8.</p>
               <p>Now, in their Preachments they have uſed to ſtop there, and go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But read the 9th. Verſe, <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> And where was it that God raiſed Chriſt from the Dead? Was it not at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> And there he died, where he roſe. And Chriſt, when he took the Cup, ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of it, this is the New Teſtament in my Blood, ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And I believe he meant his Blood ſhed, was the outward Blood of his Body.</p>

<q>
                     <hi>W. B.</hi> (ſaith he) tells of looking to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, as he was there crucified, or to that blood that was there ſhed for Juſtification, Contradiction. That Chriſt, that reſtoreth man's loſs, is both to be ſought and found in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>in contradiction to both,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Spirit the only means, the gift of Chriſt to us, and his being revealed in us by his Spirit.</q>
Here you ſee <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> makes it a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that we muſt look to Chriſt as he died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and as he is now in Heaven. Judge ye if this be a Contradiction; but in Contradiction to both, he ſaith, it is a Contradiction to direct to Chriſt our Saviour, as he died at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>; and that Chriſt that ſaveth us, is revealed within us by his Spirit. Now the Letter, which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> does own, it is a Letter of <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> it is this:

Theſe were my Words, which thou art wreſting to thy own Deſtruction. And for the other Lye that thou chargest me withal, that I ſhould ſay, That the Blood of Christ ſhould fall to the Ground within a twelfth Month, it is falſe, and never was ſpoke by me: But I did ſay, That the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> are all of one Ground, and none of you underſtand the Blood of Jesus Christ no more than a brute Beast; therefore repent, for God will ſuddenly overthrow your Faith, and your imputative Righteouſneſs too, for the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs which he did at Jerusalem, and without the Gates, the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian, Independants</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> ſhall fare all alike, and ſhall ſit down in Sorrow, ſhort of the Eternal Rest: But the true imputative Righteouſneſs of Christ we own; but it is hid from you all, till the Lord do open an Eye within you.</p>

                  <hi>George Whitehead</hi> doth not queſtion the Letter to be true, but defends it, and as much oppoſeth Juſtification by the outward or material Blood of Chriſt, as <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> doth. Here is a weighty Paſſage, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſays in his Book, <hi>Light and Life,</hi> which <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> tranſcribes and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> repreſents <hi>G. Whitehead.</hi> And this is one of the Books, they ſay (in their printed Paper they have ſent and read at this Meeting) I have not anſwered. And this is <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in Effigie. I had charged <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> for ſaying, That Chriſt's material Blood, ſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was but a Type of the Blood we were juſtified by. <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> finds fault with me for this. And you ſhall ſee <hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s Vindication, and how far <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi> has owned or diſowned <hi>S. Eccles</hi>'s Letter.
<q>All things under the Law, (ſays
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95822:16"/>
                     <hi>VV. Burner</hi>) in the Type, was purged with Blood, and this Blood was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Blood and not myſtical; and that Blood that Chriſt ſhed in order to the effecting the Salvation of Man, muſt needs be viſible and material Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are <hi>VV. Burnet</hi>'s Words. Now <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi> ſays,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> All things under the Law, in the Type was purged with Blood, and this Blood was material Blood, and not myſtical, and that Blood that Chriſt ſhed, in order to the effecting the Salvation of Man, muſt needs be material and viſible Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  <q>Do but mark here what ſad Conſequence he has drawn, as if one ſhould Reaſon, that becauſe the Type was material, viſible, and not myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, therefore the Antitype or Subſtance muſt needs be material, and not myſtical. By this all Myſteries or Divine things are excluded from being either Spiritual, Antitype, or Subſtance; whereas it was the Heavenly things themſelves, that are in Chriſt, in which conſiſts the Subſtance and End of Types and Shadows. But to ſay, that material Blood was a Type of that which was material, this is to give the Subſtance no Preheminence above the Type (eſpecially if neither of them be myſtical nor in being) or like as if one ſhould ſay, one Type was a Type of another. Whereas both the Heavenly, and more perfect Tabernacle and Altar, with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, are all a Myſtery, and Spiritual, the Offering and Living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices are Spiritual, the Paſſover Spiritual, the Seed Spiritual, the Bread, the Fruit of the Vine Spiritual, the Oyl, the Fleſh, and the Blood, which give Life to the Soul, yea, the Water and Blood, which waſheth and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Conſcience, are all Spiritual and Myſterious, as the New Covenant it ſelf is, which they belong to, and theſe things known in. And this is the new and living way, which Chriſt ſet open, through the Veil of his Fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</q>
Let them receive this who can.</p>
               <p>Note, By <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Argument, as the New Covenant is Spiritual and inward, and not outward, ſo the Blood of the New Covenant is inward and not outward; ſo the Paſſover is inward, which is Chriſt the Mediator, and not outward; this is a plain denyal of the Man Chriſt without us to be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, our Paſſover, Offering, or his Fleſh and Blood without us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in our Salvation otherwiſe than as the Type. That Chriſt's Fleſh is called the Veil, is not to be underſtood like the Typical Veils, Figures, and Shadows, but hath a far greater and profound ſenſe and conſideration.</p>
               <p>But mark, <hi>W. Burnet</hi> does not expreſs it univerſally, but in this particular Caſe: And <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> extends it to an Univerſal; as if all the Types of the Old Teſtament ſignified nothing Internally and Spiritually. But <hi>VV. Burnet</hi> ſaith no ſuch thing, though he juſtly contends that the material Blood of the Beaſts that were offered, was a Type of the material Blood of Chriſt that was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhed; yet many of the Types ſignified the internal and ſpiritual Gifts and Graces that true Believers have by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now here I clinch the matter: <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſays, But to ſay material Blood was a Type of that which was material; this is to give the Subſtance no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above the Type (eſpecially if neither of them be myſtical, nor in being) or like as if one ſhould ſay, one Type was a Type of another. Now the Argument lies here; If the Sacriffces under the Law were Types of Chriſt's Blood then that Blood muſt not be outward Blood, but inward, to wit, the Light and Life in Men; but this is a falſe Conſequence of <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and ſheweth, that he denieth Remiſſion of Sin, and Juſtification by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed. And this whole Paſſage of <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> his Advocate
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95822:17"/>
                  <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> doth defend in his Book called <hi>Truth Defended,</hi> which is one of the two they ſay I have not anſwered.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Letter, we go on to what <hi>T. Elwood</hi> ſays. He is ſo unfair, he will have it, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> owns, that the material B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ood of Chriſt is that by which we are juſtified. But here is the Trick, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> makes a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Offering of Chriſt, and an anti-typical; the typical was the Offering of Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the anti-typical is the Offering of Chriſt within. See here then their Anſwer: It was queried, whether they owned that we are by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed, juſtified; or that the Blood that was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhed, did belong to the Sacrifice? <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> has ſince of late anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Yea, here they have ſought to blind all the World; Chriſt, as he outwardly ſuffered was a Sacrifice, but a typical Sacrifice. Therefore the next Queſtion to be put, muſt be, Whether he was the anti-typical Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fice?</p>
               <p>Now ſee what <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath ſaid to the Letter of <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> to blame or cenſure it. I can find nothing at all. He does not own that <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>'s Expreſſion was an Article of their Faith, but does he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it? Nay, a man may not own a thing to be an Article of his Faith, and yet not diſown it. If <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> had had the true Faith in Chriſt crucified, and had the true Value of Chriſt's Blood, outwardly ſhed, he would have very ſeverely and ſharply blamed and cenſured <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>'s Letter as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, but I find not that he cenſured it all. He tells you in what Sence he owns it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Blood had a peculiar Significat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on; I told him, ſo had the Blood of Beaſts a peculiar Signification, for their Blood ſignified Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin, but was no ſatisfactory Offering for Sin: And if Chriſt's Blood outwardly ſhed was a Type, as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> affirms it was, then he confirms <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>'s falſe Doctrine, and makes it no more than the Blood of the Beaſts that were offered.</p>
               <p>But ſaith <hi>T. Ellwood,</hi> He does own that the Blood of Chriſt is more than the Blood of another Saint; but what B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ood? the Blood of Chriſt within, there is the Trick. Is not this enough to cheat all the World? They have a double Meaning as <note n="(d)" place="margin">See for this in the Church-Hiſtory of <hi>Socrates Scholaſticus, lib. 2. c. 7.</hi> and <hi>c. 25.</hi>

                  <hi>Arius</hi> had.

I have ſo much Charity and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many of the Quakers, that I believe there are Thouſands will not own that Letter, though <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> does. He ſays, if <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> juſtifies that Lett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, the whole Body is underſtood to juſtifie it. Now, I ſee not one Syllable wherein <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> blames it: And he that does not teſtifie againſt a thing, when he has juſt occaſion for it, juſtifies it. But hear what <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 58. <hi>Light and Life.</hi> Now, to theſe words, <hi>viz. No more than the Blood of another Saint, his intent was,</hi> ſaith <hi>G. Whitehead, as to Papiſts and you, whoſe minds are carnal,</hi> &amp;c. This never was my Quakeriſm. For my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief all along, was, that Papiſts, and Baptiſts, and all, have a Benefit by Chriſt's Death. Now it is come to this, <hi>That the Blood of Chriſt is no more to Papiſts and Baptiſts, than the Blood of another Saint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Defence of <hi>S. Eccles</hi>'s Letter is, <hi>That it was no more ſimply as to the matter of Blood.</hi> Then they may [with Reverence be it ſpoken] as it was reported ſome have ſaid, ſay, it is no more than the Blood of a Thief, ſimply as to the matter of Blood; but it may be affirmed, that ſimply conſidered, it was more than the Blood of any Saint; for as it was never defiled with ſin, ſo his Body of Fleſh and Blood had a Miraculous Conception above all other Men, though it had the true Nature of our Fleſh and Blood, yet it had an Excellency above that of all other Men.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider theſe words of <hi>S. E.</hi> which <hi>G. W.</hi> ſaith, might ſatisfie any Spiritual or unbyaſſed Mind, <hi>I do very highly eſteem of the Blood of Chriſt, to be more Excellent,</hi> &amp;c. Here is <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>'s Fallacy, and <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Fallacy alſo.</p>
               <p>Now you know what Blood they mean, and ſee what Blood <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> means; The Blood is Spiritual and Inward, the other is a Type.
<q>It is confeſſed, ſaith <hi>G. W. Light and Life,</hi> pag. 56. That God by his own Blood pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to himſelf a Church, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.28. Now the Blood of God (ſaith he) or that Blood that relates to God, muſt needs be Spiritual, he being a Spirit; and the Covenant of God is Inward and Spiritual, and ſo is the Blood of it.</q>
So you ſee he doth not allow the Blood outwardly ſhed to relate to God, or to be the Blood of the New Covenant, or that God purchaſed his Church with that Blood outwardly ſhed on the Croſs. Is not this a plain Juſtification of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>'s Letter, <hi>That that Blood is no more than that of another Saint?</hi> judge ye, who are Intelligent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95822:18"/>Again, He judges none of them guilty of Blaſphemy therein, as he ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 58. <hi>Light and Life. viz.</hi> Neither <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> nor <hi>W. Burnet.</hi> But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in does he charge him? I find not in any thing.</p>
               <p>I cannot produce and read to you many of my Proofs for want of time, but two or three to every following Head.</p>
               <p>You have had an Account of them as to Juſtification. Now it is worth your while to ſee how theſe [pretended] Infallible Men contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>W. Penn, (Reaſon against Railing)</hi> falls in with <hi>T. Danſon,</hi> and Argues like a Chriſtian, though in Contradiction to himſelf elſewhere, That no Obedience that Man can perform to God, by the help of the Spirit is ſtrictly Meritorious, according to the Law of God. This is good Doctrine, and ſo is the Reaſon too, becauſe it is but finite; and I would make uſe of the ſame Argument. But <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in Anſwering this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, Anſwers <hi>T. Danſon</hi> thus: Whereas <hi>T. Danſon</hi> Argues, That the Obedience and Righteouſneſs, wrought in the Saints by the Spirit, is but finite, and therefore not Meritorious, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> denies this, that it is finite, and ſaith, it is infinite. So that by his Argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, our Obedience and Righteouſneſs that God works in us, is equal to God himſelf. Now I will read the Paſſage. <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Reaſon againſt Railing, <hi>Pag.</hi> 82. <hi>Rewardableneſs is a work without which God will not beſtow his Favour, and yet not the meritorious Cauſe, for that there is no proportion betwixt the work that is finite and temporary, and the Reward which is infinite and eternal, in which ſenſe both the Creature obeys the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, and does not merit, but obtain only; and God rewards the Creature, and yet ſo, that he freely gives too.</hi> A good Proteſtant Argument, and good Proteſtant Doctrine, ſo far; but that he contradicts it again, by oppoſing the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt crucified for Juſtification, and totally excluding Chriſt's Satisfaction, in order to Juſtification and Remiſſion of ſin.</p>
               <p>You ſee <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſays, the Work is finite and temporary, and therefore does not ſtrictly Merit. But hear <hi>G.

And that Blood and Water that's ſaid to cleanſe, is not of another kind, but agrees in one with the Spirit, all which is known within, and the Effects thereof.</q>

               <p>I would be loath to mention this Man, <hi>Iſ. Pennington.</hi> However this Queſtion is in his Book, and I charitably think this Paſſage dropt from him unawares: I wiſh I could have that ground of Charity to others of them. But Truth ought to be more Precious to me, than any Man. I only mention his Name as to the Subject we are on. <hi>Jo. Faldo</hi> thinks that he has made <hi>Iſ. Pennington</hi> his own. Can outward Blood waſh the Conſcience? <hi>p.</hi> 29. A plain Denial, ſays <hi>Jo. Faldo.</hi> Here is <hi>Jo. Faldo</hi>'s Commentary on <hi>Iſ. Pennington</hi>'s words. Now ſee how <hi>W. Penn</hi> explains <hi>Iſ. Pennington</hi>'s words, <hi>pag.</hi> 149. <hi>Is he ſo impiouſly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, that becauſe we do deny, that outward Blood can be brought into the Conſcience, to perform that inward work (which they themſelves dare not, nay, do not hold) therefore</hi> Iſaac Pennington <hi>denies any Efficacy to be in that outward Offering and Blood towards Juſtification, as it reſpects meer Remiſſion of former Sins and Iniquities.</hi> So in ſhort, I take it thus: <hi>W. Penn</hi> Anſwers, That <hi>Iſ. Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s words are to be underſtood with reference to Sanctification, but not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Says he, Outward Blood cannot be brought into the Conſcience to perform that work: But the way that Blood has been brought into my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is by the application of a living Faith in Chriſt, whoſe Blood it was, the Spirit of God working that Faith in me; and that Blood is not a Phyſical, but a Moral once of our cleanſing. 1 Chriſt Jeſus, by his Obedience and Suffering, procured the Pardon of my Sins, as well as he ſealed it by his Blood. And, 2. He procured the Spirit to Sanctifie me. Therefore I agree with all true Chriſtians herein.</p>
               <p>I find none ſay, there muſt be a material application of that Blood, but a Spiritual and Moral; and we can give Inſtances that Moral Cauſes are many times more effectual Cauſes than Phyſical are: As the Money wherewithal we buy the Medicine that cures the Body, is not the Phyſical cauſe of Health, but a Moral; and the Money that we buy Bread with, is not the Phyſical cauſe of our Nouriſhment and Refreſhment, but a Moral; and yet it is ſo great a cauſe, that without Money, neither Bread nor Medicine can be readily obtained, and not at all without ſomewhat equivalent.</p>
               <p>Now I have done with the two firſt Heads, ſhall I go on to prove the other two, or ſhall we adjourn to another day?</p>

               <p>The Third Head to be prove, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, That the Body that dieth, riſeth not again. Firſt, from <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s holding the Reſurrection immediately after Death, in his Rejoynder, <hi>pag.</hi> 138. I think this will be enough for <hi>W. Penn,</hi> if I give no more. <hi>T. Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks</hi> Argues thus for the Reſurrection of the Body; That if there be no Reſurrection of the Body, the Joys of Heaven ſhould elſe be imperfect. Now here is <hi>VV. Penn</hi>'s Anſwer to it.
<q>I Anſwer, Is the Joy of the Ancients now in Glory imperfect? Or are they in Heaven but by halves? If it be ſo unequitable, that the Body which hath ſuffered, ſhould not partake of the Joys Coeleſtial, is it not in meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, that the Soul ſhould be rewarded ſo long before the Body? This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple brings to the Mortality of the Soul (held by many Baptiſts) or I am miſtaken. But why muſt the Felicity of the Soul depend upon that of the Body? Is it not to make the Soul a kind of Widow, and ſo in a ſtate of Mourning and Diſconſolateneſs, to be without its beloved Body? Which ſtate is but a better ſort of Purgatory.</q>
                  <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi> Argues the ſame way:
<q>If the deceaſed Saints in Heaven, or their Souls, have not all that they expect to all Eternity, all the Reſurrection they look for, then they muſt be in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for the time: But if the latter be not, then not the former.</q>
But this contradicts many Scriptures, that eſpecially in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi> Now, according to this Doctrine of <hi>VV. Penn,</hi> and <hi>G. VVhitehead,</hi> Chriſt's Reſurrection was later than that of many Millions.</p>
               <p>Now, if you will hear a Proof from <hi>G. VVhitehead,</hi> you may.</p>

               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>Here is the place, <hi>pag.</hi> 353. G. Whitehead<hi>'s Chriſtian Quaker.</hi> Says <hi>T. Danſon,</hi>
                  <q>The Happineſs of the Soul is not perfect without the Body, its dear and beloved Companion, the Soul having a ſtrong deſire and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a re-union to the Body, as the Schools not without ground deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. <hi>Vide</hi> Calv.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And here is <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi>'s Anſwer, <hi>pag.</hi> 353.
<q>Both <hi>Calvin, T. Danſon,</hi> the the Schools, and divers Anabaptiſts, are miſtaken in this very matter, and ſee not with the Eye of true Faith, either that the Happineſs of the Soul is not perfect without the Body, or that the Soul hath a ſtrong deſire to a re-union to the Body, while they intend the Terreſtrial Elementary Bodies, for this implies the Soul to be in a kind of Purgatory or Diſquietneſs, till the ſuppoſed reſumption of the Body.</q>
You ſee I hope here is Proof enough, that <hi>G. VV.</hi> holds, that the deceaſed Saints look for no Reſurrection of the Body.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>What other Body could it be? The Matter is, there is the ſame Argument of <hi>G. VVhitehead,</hi> and <hi>VV. Penn.</hi> A little Philoſophy I hope will not offend you; I hope if they make uſe of falſe Philoſophy to defend their falſe Faith, I may make uſe of true Philoſophy to defend the true Faith. And the Objection they make is the ſame againſt Chriſt's Body. Pray, was not Chriſt's Body Elementary? Did he not eat and drink? And was it not the ſame as we eat and drink? And if we eat and drink of what are Elementary, then his Body did receive the ſame Elements, and they were converted into his Body. And <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi> owns in his later Writings, that Chriſt's Body
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95822:19"/>
that roſe, is the ſame with his Body that ſuffered; but his Pride will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to own his former Error, either in that, or in other things. And ſeeing <hi>VV. Penn</hi> thinks it abſurd that a Body can be transformed from an Earthly and Animal Body to an Heavenly Body, as he Argueth, <hi>Reaſ. againſt Rail.</hi> p. 134. He makes it not only as groſs as Tranſubſtantiation, but worſe. But this is his groſs Ignorance in true Philoſophy, and his falſe Philoſophy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys his Faith. It is not Tranſubſtantiation, if I ſay, a Saint's Body is the ſame at the Reſurrection for ſubſtance, as it was when it went into the Grave, leaving the Faeces, or droſſy part of it behind. But if he ſay, Chriſt hath not the ſame ſubſtance of Body that he had on the Earth, this is plain Tranſubſtantiation. For have not many that Underſtanding, that a groſs body of Herbs, or other Subſtance, can by Chymical Operation be made ſo Subtil, Volatile, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual (without any Tranſubſtantiation, or change of the Subſtance) that a Glaſs can ſcarce confine it, or hold it. Now, <hi>VV. Penn</hi> holds, that groſsneſs is ſo Eſſential to a Body, that a Body muſt ceaſe to be a bodily Subſtance, if it put off Groſsneſs or Carniety, and that Carniety is Eſſential to a Carnal Body. But ſee how contrary this is to common Senſe and Underſtanding. There is no Woman that ſets a Hen to breed Chickens, but knows the contrary; you know the Subſtance of the Egg (the White and Yolk) by the force and heat of the Hen ſitting on the Egg, is changed into a Chicken <note n="(h)" place="margin">And in Egypt we hear that Chickens are bred of Eggs ſimply by heat, without the Hen.</note>. Is here any Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? So that W. <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> are guilty of the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and not we, and abuſe the World with falſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. They warn People againſt <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and his falſe Philoſophy; and I appeal to you to Judge, whether they have not abuſed the People with falſe and vain Philoſophy.</p>

               <p>If they will appoint a Meeting of Friends, to prove me guilty of Error, I will never refuſe to meet them; and here are many Perſons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion. I thank God, that has given me that humble Heart, that if they bring any Paſſage out of my Books that is not to be justified, I will own my Error and ſhortneſs. Now, if they would do the like, it would be well. But the matter is here, <hi>T. Danſon</hi> ſays, Our want of Infallibility is no Argument againſt our Miniſtry. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſays, it is; they that want Infallibility are not true Miniſters. Now, I hope I have proved they want Infallibility, and therefore by their own Doctrine, they are no true Miniſters of Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it neceſſary to have the Paſſage read. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Voice of Wiſdom, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. Says <hi>T. Danſon,</hi>
                  <q>As for our want of Infallibility, 'tis no valid Plea againſt our Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now here is the Anſwer. His fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood here appears plainly, for they that want Infallibility (ſaith <hi>G.W.</hi>) and have not the Spirit of Chriſt, they are out of the Truth, and are fallible, and their Miniſtry is not of the Spirit, ſeeing they ſpeak not from the Spirit, but from their own Hearts, which are deceitful, when they want Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</q>

Next I ſay, I hope you will reaſonably conclude, that we who knew the Circumſtances of his Life and his Temper, knew his Converſation has been ſuch that we could not own him. He ſtands not charg'd with us on the Account of his Principles. I do not know but you will find, when you have an Anſwer to what he has offered, that thoſe he charges and paraphraſes on, will agree with him in Principles; nor have we any thing againſt his Converſation among Men in the World. It was his Diſcontents with particular Perſons, becauſe he was a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome petulant Man and we could not pacifie him; and it was for that Reaſon chiefly that we did diſown him.</p>

               <p>Let me anſwer that. I ſay, Divers in the Meeting were favourable— but <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G.

And ſome others that were not free to conſent to them, did purpoſely abſent and this I told them in their year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting; that there was ſuch a perſon that had ſo ſpoke to me that day, they asked me who it was, I told them, I deſired to be excuſed, in not telling his Name, that was not convenient.</p>
               <p>After I was gone, they called over the Roll one by one; and the poor man ſeeing it coming to him, ſays, You need go no further, I am the Man; now what is this, but to ſet up ſomething like the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition?

               <p>They were Quakers.

Whereupon <hi>W.

               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>I think it not convenient, we muſt uſe a little Policy as well as you. <hi>Jo. Delawall</hi> Publiſhed a Manuſcript againſt me, wherein he charges me with Hereſy, for ſaying, <hi>The Light within was not ſufficient without ſomething elſe, and that ſomething elſe was Chriſt without us.</hi> Now they ſay there is no diference between them and me. I will cite a paſſage or two out of a Manuſcript from <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> it is a thing that will ſatisfy your Conſciences as much as any thing. I brought the Manuſcripts, they were read at the yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> 1694. and ſomething was objected to the hand; and it was asked at <hi>Samuel Jennings,</hi> my Adverſary, whether it was the hand of that man, and he ſaid, he believed it was; and you will find it is matter of Doctrine at the bottom, for which they have Excommunicated me, however they would cloak it: Let them retract their Errors, and I will forgive them my Excommunication.</p>
               <p>See the Book called, <hi>Light and Life,</hi> pag. 41. See what is here ſaid by <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> That there is not an outward coming of Chriſt to Judg the Quick and Dead. What I prove from <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> is proved from <hi>W. Penn</hi>; for <hi>W. Penn</hi> has Authorized his Book, therefore it is the proof of them both. Here is the place.
<q>
                     <hi>Moreover Chriſt ſaid, The Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father with his Angels, &amp;c.</hi> Matt. 16.27, 28. Luke 9.26, 27 Now what is that Glory of the Father, in which his coming is, is it viſible to the Carnal Eye? And when was that coming to be? Is it now to be looked for outwardly? But farther we do acknowledg the ſeveral comings of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, both that in the Fleſh, and that in the Spirit, which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in ſeveral degrees as there is a growing from Glory to Glory. But three comings of Chriſt, not only that in the Fleſh at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and that in the Spirit, but alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coming in the Fleſh, yet to be expected; we do not read of, but a ſecond coming without ſin unto Salvation, which in the Apoſtles days was looked for.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And as concerning that noted place, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. brougt by <hi>W. B.</hi> to prove Chriſts coming without us to judgment <hi>G. W.</hi> denyeth it to be meant of his Perſonal coming, and uſeth a Sophiſm to contradict it, and wrest it, to his inward coming: whereas all the ſtreſs of his Sophiſm lies in that, <hi>We, We,</hi> that remain; but the true Senſe of theſe words is, thoſe Saints, thoſe Believers, that ſhall be living at that day, ſhall not prevent them that dyed in Chriſt before. It is an <hi>enallage perſonae</hi> frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, putting we for they, live that or <hi>James, therewith bleſs we God and Curſe men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all theſe proofs he has Allegorized to Chriſt within, he has allegorized away his Birth, his Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, and coming to Judgment; and ſo we have nothing from Scripture to prove Chriſt's Death to be of any benefit to us, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95822:22"/>
we have no Argument to prove he came in the Fleſh: And ſo all the proofs againſt Jews and Philoſophers he has Allegorized away.</p>
               <p>Thus you have had a proof from <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Penn.</hi> Now if you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ the Meeting to ſome other time, or continue it a while longer, I am content. And I hope I have proved that I am not Petulant, and that I have had juſt cauſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of theſe Errors. I was preſented by a Grand jury at <hi>Philadelgpia</hi>; and the Preſentment would have been Proſecuted, if the Government had not been changed, and I had been accuſed for endeavouring to alter the Government, which is Capital by their Law; and they would have found me guilty of Death, had they not been turned out of the Government, tho I was innocent: And when I objected againſt the Jury, they would not ſuffer one of the Jury to be caſt. Now it I had been guilty of any Treſpaſs and, Offence againſt K. <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> (the King is alive, and God bleſs him) do you think that Governour <hi>Fletcher,</hi> (put into the Government by King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) that was the Governor there, if he had found me guilty of High Treaſon, he would have paſſed me; but he ordered them to let fall the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">And I was cleared by a publick Writ, ſigned by the Deputy Governor, <hi>C. Markham,</hi> and the Counſel, in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which I have to ſhow.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Company deſired <hi>G. Keith</hi> to proceed, if he had any more proofs againſt <hi>G. Whitehead.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See the Nature of Ch. pag. 29.</note>Says <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> to <hi>R. Gordon, Doſt thou look for Chriſt's coming again to appear outwardly in a bodily Exiſtence? If thou doſt thou mayeſt look until thy Eyes drop out before thou wilt ſee ſuch an Appearance of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſee how <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> has excuſed this, <note n="*" place="margin">The real Quaker. A real Proteſtant.</note> he ſays, He did not mean it of Chriſt's coming to Judgment; but he meant it thus, becauſe <hi>R. Gordon</hi> would needs have it, that Salvation was delayed till Chriſt's outward coming. I am apt to think he abuſes <hi>R. Gordon</hi> (not that I would vindicate <hi>R. Gordon</hi> in every thing, for I think he did overcharge the Quakers in ſome things at that time, but now I do not accuſe or acquit him.) But I ſay, he ſays, he only oppoſed that falſe Notion of <hi>R. Gordon,</hi> as if the Saints remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under their Pollution till the Reſurrection from the Dead. Can you think ſo? He was a Proteſtant, and no Proteſtant will ſay any ſuch thing. We ſay, we are ſaved by hope. <hi>I</hi> ſay, in a Scripture ſenſe we may expect that great Salvation then even from all charge of Sin, tho not from any ſtain of Sin. Not that the ſenſe of Pardon is not made manifeſt before that day; but that in that day, all that have Repented and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, he will clear them, before God. Angels and Men. The Devil will be ready to accuſe them in that day, but Chriſt will then clear them. <hi>It</hi> will be a great ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize, and there will be a ſolemn Acquitment to all that have ſincere Repented of their ſins, and believed in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>I craved no favour to my Paper from thee, nor them, but that word (only) which was the omiſſion of my Pen, and never intended to be put under a Buſhel, if occaſion did require. But however let Deceit and Malice have its full force and ſcope upon it, and that word (only) taken off the concluſion of my Paper, which that ſaying of our Saviour himſelf, when he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded his meaning unto them (who in theſe days had offended at his own words) will clear me of your Aſperſion, <hi>John 6.63.</hi> It is the Spirit that Quickneth the Fleſh profiteth nothing, ſo he himſelf aſcribed the Work of man's Salvation, and Sanctification, not to the Fleſh that Suffered, but to the Spirit that Quickned; not to the Blood that was Shed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but unto the Fleſh and Blood that is Spiritual, which the Saints was to feed upon, and their Robes was made white by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it doth appear, that theſe that are otherwiſe minded, do not rightly diſcern the Lord's Body.</p>

               <p>Whether do ye own ſanctification to the blood outwardly ſhed, or to the Spirit inwardly given.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay to both, to the blood of Chriſt that was outwardly ſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to the Spirit of Chriſt inwardly given, to believers.</p>
               <p>Now they ſay that I have belied them, they never knew any that ſaid they were not ſanctified by that blood. You ſee what proofs I have brought, and therefore I muſt be an Apoſtate for accuſing them of errours. Who would have thought, but that the yearly Meeting, if they had any regard to the honour of Chriſt's blood, would have ſhown greater zeal againſt theſe Men, than to excommunicate me, for oppoſing their vile errors in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and for rendring that precious blood ſhed for us as an unprofitable thing, ſo trampling it under foot: But ye ſee, they have little at all cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them, and if you will believe their Patron, (as ye have cauſe, they owning his Books) nothing at all. <hi>Th. Ellwood</hi> affirms, I am guilty of Forgery, for ſaying that the yearly Meeting paſſed any reproof on thoſe paſſages, and whereas I was accuſed for ſaying, the light within was not ſufficient to ſalvation without ſomething elſe. I have a Letter from <hi>B. Chambers,</hi> one of the principal Evidences, that were againſt me, he owns that I mean, by that, <hi>ſomething elſe,</hi> not humane Learning, not the Letter of the Scripture, not outward preaching, but I mean only the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his death and ſufferings and reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now here is a new book of <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> come out, he calls it a modeſt account of the difference in Principles between <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Adverſaries; and he would father it on me, tho it was not in my thoughts, that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> cannot be ſomething elſe than the light within. I tell you, he would father it on me, becauſe I ſay there is but one only Chriſt. Now I ſay, Chriſt without does not admit of another Chriſt within, and Chriſt within does not admit of another Chriſt without us. But Chriſt without us admits of ſomething elſe within us, and that is his Spirit and Grace: And Chriſt within us, admits of ſomething elſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and that is his man-hood. This is not another Chriſt, than what the Scripture ſpeaks of; but the Light within is one thing, the body of Chriſt is another thing. Now they of <hi>Penſilvania</hi> and <hi>Th. Elwood</hi> give out that I differ from them in Doctrine, theſe men ſay I do not: What Confuſion is here among them that ſay they are in Unity? I ſay the Light within is not ſufficient, without the Light without, Chriſt without us, yet the Sufficiency of the Light and Grace of God within, in a true ſenſe, I deny not, but own. And whereas they ſay the moſt of my Proofs I have brought, have been from Philoſophy; but it has been only, that I may, by true Philoſophy, overthrow their falſe Phyloſophy, which deſtroys their Faith. I need not bring Scripture to prove theſe Points, becauſe they now profeſs to own them; but the thing is, the Honour of Infallibility, and that they have accuſed <hi>G. Keith</hi>; that <hi>G. Keith</hi> has not charged them truly. And here are the two things, their own infallibility, and that I have unjuſtly accuſed them. Now whether I have or no, ſee by the Articles: But if they grant or yeild, that they have any Errors in any of their Books, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound paſſages, that they need retract, and correct, then they are found the falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers againſt <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and <hi>G. Keith's</hi> found Innocent. But this will be hard for them to own; Firſt, That they have Erred: And Secondly, That they have falſely accuſed G. <hi>Keith,</hi> for ſaying they did Err. I have here a Teſtimony from <hi>W. Penn,</hi> to prove that Bodily Death did not come in by Man's Sin; and then it followeth that the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body doth not come by Chriſt's Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>W. Penn's</hi> words are, in Anſwer to <hi>Muggleton</hi> and <hi>Reeve,</hi> p. 55. <hi>If the Fleſh of Beasts is capable of Dying, rotting, and going to duſt, who never ſinned, why ſhould not Man have Dyed, and gone to duſt, though he had never ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee this is almoſt expreſly in terms. And whereas <hi>J. H.</hi> calleth one of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, a Carnal Reprobation.</p>
               <p>There is nothing about Reprobation in my Articles, and the word Carnal is not in-any of the Ten.</p>

               <p>Now let him that Anſwers for <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> tell us what he ſays to them Articles. But they ſaid nothing to them good or bad, rare Defendents!</p>

               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>I happened to charge <hi>W. Penn</hi> with ſelf contradiction, will you hear that proved? It was in my Printed Paper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith</speaker>
               <p>has contradicted himſelf. How? Not as to Principles or Practices, but as to his Opinion of <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> but I diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> and <hi>VV. Penn</hi> Orthodox, and <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi> and <hi>VV. Penn</hi> Hetrodox, ſo far as I quoted them, as Orthodox, I ſtand to theſe quotations; but when in other Books and places they have contradicted them, they are accountable for their Contradictions, and not I. So not the <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi> Hetrodox, and guilty of theſe vile Errors I have commended, but the <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi> Orthodox, and the like of <hi>W. Penn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I beg your Patience for one or two Quotations more, before I have done. It is out of <hi>Tho. Elwood,</hi> to ſhew you that <hi>Tho. Elwood</hi> charges me with forgery, becauſe I ſaid the Yearly Meeting did cenſure ſome of theſe unſound Papers. Here is the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, it is but ſhort, p. 84. <hi>T. Ellwoods</hi> further Diſcovery. <hi>Here ye ſee Friends</hi> (ſaith <hi>T. Elwood) that that Paper of the Yearly Meeting is ſo far from owning them of the other ſide, as he calls them, that is the Friends in</hi> America, <hi>to be guilty of unſound and Erronious Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines (which</hi> G. K. <hi>here Expreſly ſaith, it doth) that it doth not undertake to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Offence (ſaid to be given by ſome perſons) was throuhg Erronious Doctrines, and unſound Expreſſions, or through weakneſs, frowardneſs, want of VViſdom, and right underſtanding. And yet this man hath the confidence and falſeneſs</hi> (meaning G. K.) <hi>to ſay poſitively, that paper doth own them guilty of holding unſound and erronious Doctrines.</hi> This was my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to them, that I thought they cenſured them, in ſome part or degree at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are their words in their Yearly Meeting Paper, 1694. <hi>London,</hi> from which I gathered, that they cenſured the words of thoſe in <hi>Penſilvania</hi>:
<q>And although it appears that ſome few Perſons have given offence, either through Erronious Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, unſound Expreſſions, or weakneſs, forwardneſs, want of Wiſdom, and right underſtanding, I conſtrued, <hi>or</hi> to be equivalent to <hi>and,</hi> as ſometimes it is:</q> Now ſee if I was not more charitable to the Yearly Meeting, than he is to them. Here you ſee that that Paper of the Yearly Meeting, is ſo far from owning them guilty of unſound Doctrines, which <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſays it does <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By all which it is plain, that not only <hi>Th. Elwood,</hi> but all that approve his Books, approve and juſtify all theſe Vile Errors, I have proved them in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> guilty of, and if he may be credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> 1694. is equally guilty with them.</p>

               <p>It is very well that the whole Paragraph be read, that it may give the more ſatisfaction to the Auditory: which was accordingly done. <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> ſaith, He <hi>(viz. G. K.)</hi> turns off, and ſays, I reflect not only on him, but on the late Chriſtian Teachers and Writers, who have corrected the Errors and unſound Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contain'd in the Books of them called the Greek and Latin Fathers.</p>
               <p>Now hear what he further ſays, In comparing the Books of Friends to the Books of them called Greek and Latin Fathers, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>I have made few Obſervations on the whole, one or two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the other are general. The firſt is, that he charges <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> to deſtroy the Object of Faith. Now, when he ſpeaks of ſome Doctrines, that were preached by him in 1678, and that he was reproved for ſaying it was lawful to pray to Jeſus Chriſt, he has vindicated <hi>W. Penn</hi> as to this Point, who ſaid he did ſo. —Alſo he has vindicated <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> ſaying that — He directed not to what either of them could ſay, but what Scripture ſays, and he cites them a clear paſſage, that was then believed by him, and, I believed by all Quakers. The other particular Obſervation I did note, is, that the Quakers have not uſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the whole Author they write againſt; and I appeal to you, whether <hi>G. Keith,</hi> in the oppoſition he has made, has ever repeated a whole Author. Theſe are my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Obſervations. The general is, that what has been caſually dropt, and I believe there are none concerned on this occaſion, but (I ſay) they may ſometimes be apt to drop ſome Expreſſions, that they will not ſtand by. But to urge theſe againſt the whole Party, is too hard, and is very <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>G. Keith</hi> doth not charge it on the whole, but only on the Guilty, and ſuch as cloak and excuſe them.</note> uncharitable; and therefore, I hope, you will not conclude the whole body concerned in it. And <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath been converſant among us eight and twenty years, or more, and has preached the Doctrines owned by us, and writ many Books that related to fundamental Articles of Faith; I believe him that they were owned by the People he was joyned with. And at the yearly meeting, the charge againſt him, and his expulſion, was not matter of Doctrine, but Practice, which was turbulent: And therefore he has apoſtatized from what he was before, from the meekneſs and integrity that is agreeable to the Doctrine of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>G. Keith.</hi> I ſee you are almoſt ſpent, I will anſwer for you. He ſays, it was the whole body that was againſt you; it was the worſe, that the Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be from the whole yearly Meeting, without mentioning any thing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. For a man to apoſtatize, is to apoſtatize from the whole Faith; but for a man to differ with reſpect to particular things, this is not Apoſtaſie.</p>

               <p>The words of the Excommunication run thus "I am a man of no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian "Spirit, I have diſmember'd myſelf from the Church of Chriſt.
If they had ſaid from this particular Society, it might have paſſed; but they ſay, from the Church of Chriſt. And why? Becauſe there is no Church of Chriſt on Earth, but the Quakers; and no Repreſentative of them, but the Yearly Meeting in <hi>Gracechurch-ſtreet.</hi> You ſee how weak that man's Objections are.

And I ſay I have proved that they have deſtroyed the Object of Faith; if they have at other times Owned it, let them diſown and retract their Errors; I am not to account for their Contradictions.

Ellwood</hi> being ſo converſant in, looks as if he could not be

ignorant of the adjourned Meeting, being ſix months after the Yearly Meeting, to wit, the 27<hi>th</hi> of the twelfth month, as appears in <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <hi>Reaſons and Cauſes</hi>; and that wherein the ſuppoſed Judgment of the Yearly Meeting is, is dated nine months after the Yearly Meeting.</p>

                           <hi>In the ſame Book, pag.</hi> 35. <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> alledgeth, That he no where gave that as the only, or any Reaſon, why the Meeting could not adjourn, to wit, becauſe the Book and Clark was gone. <hi>Pag.</hi> 36, &amp; 37. he adds, Let <hi>G. K.</hi> clear himſelf fairly of this if he can, till then I ſhall take it for certain, that that Monthly Meeting was ended and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, part of the Friends gone away, the Clerk gone, the Book in which the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Meeting ſhould be recorded gone, before the adjournment was made, and conſequently that Adjournment not good, but invalid. <hi>Ditto, pag.</hi> 42, &amp; 43. Whereas <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> ſhould have brought matter of Fact, to prove <hi>G.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 42. he blameth <hi>G. K.</hi> greatly, for not putting the Printer's name to ſome of his Books. But it's well known this hath been the frequent practice of the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> not to put the Printer's name to their Books, in times of ſuffering.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 91. <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> alledges, he did not underſtand that the Doctrine of the Faith of Chriſt, as he died, being neceſſary to our Chriſtianity and Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was by him reputed a Doctrine in Controverſie between <hi>G.

               <p>The Paper is read, the Queſtion was not concerning the Light indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, but whether the Light within was ſufficient to Salvation, without the Man Chriſt and his Death, <hi>&amp;c. Thomas Ellwood</hi> accuſeth me unjuſtly. That I cunningly ſlid in the word <hi>Light within</hi>; as if that were not the ſtate of the Queſtion, but Light indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehending Chriſt both Light without and within. But ye ſee how the citations they bring in their Paper clear me, and ſhew <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> his injuſtice againſt me.— You ſee there is the Light within, not the Light without, in the Citations they have brought to clear me, and to blame <hi>T. Ellwood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here is another thing they find fault with, as to <hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s wronging me, as if I had made a meer Verbal Confeſſion, a ſufficient qualification to a Member of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>See here they cite my Book, <hi>Reasons and Cauſes, p.</hi> 22. — Take notice how they notifie his Forgery, that he leaves out my words, — <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> ſays, I make a meer Verbal Confeſſion a Qualification for being a Member of the Church. But I ſay not ſo, as if a Verbal Confeſſion were enough, but as well a Converſation, ſuch as becomes the Goſpel, is neceſſary to qualifie a Member.</p>
               <p>So my Book is, Such a Converſation as becomes the Goſpel, <hi>p.</hi> 36. <hi>Reaſons and Cauſes, &amp;c.</hi> — I appeal to you, is not this more than a Verbal Confeſſion? <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> charges me to ſay, That a meer Verbal Confeſſion is enough to make a man a Member of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>p.</hi> 103 <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> accuſeth me unjuſtly (as his own Brethren do obſerve) for giving a falſe Quotation out of <hi>R. Barclay</hi>'s Book called the <hi>Anarchy, &amp;c.</hi> but they clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me, and declare it to be true, as it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> quibbles about Subſtance, finding fault with my Saying. Somewhere it agrees in Subſtance with <hi>R. B.</hi> as elſewhere in expreſs words. — Now theſe men take notice that <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> is unfair in taking that liberty to himſelf he will not allow to me: They obſerve, he admits of Subſtance of Doctrine in his own Citations, but will not allow it to me.</p>
               <p>Another thing <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> accuſes <hi>G. Keith</hi> (as they obſerve in their Cenſure) that he blames them for going too much from the <hi>outward</hi> to the <hi>inward:</hi> But theſe are not my words, nor ſence. And they cenſure <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> for making a ſtrained Conſequence on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95822:26"/>
my words; for, tho' I blamed them for not rightly preaching <hi>Chriſt withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> yet not for going to the <hi>inward</hi> Light: for if they did go rightly to God's Light and Gift in their Hearts, they would not hold ſuch groſs Errors. But he ſays, I blame them for going from the <hi>outward</hi> to the <hi>inward,</hi> which is not ſo. See <hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Again, they cenſure him in his blaming me for not naming the Day, Month, or Year wherein that Yearly meeting at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was held, which he makes the ground of his perverſion, and would excuſe it.</p>
               <p>You ſee he argues like a rare Logician. He ſays, I do not name the Year, nor Day; nor is it in <hi>p.</hi> 14, nor <hi>p.</hi> 18. But what then? I do it in another page. This is rare Logick. Now, I ſay, you have both in <hi>p.</hi> 3. quoted from <hi>The Plea of the Innocent.</hi> Which <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> has quoted for another purpoſe, but could not ſee it for that.</p>
               <p>And all this Proof is, that I did not tell it in <hi>p.</hi> 14, nor <hi>p.</hi> 18 but I did it in <hi>p.</hi> 3. His Argument is a Sophiſm, and is faulty in not making a ſufficient enumeration.</p>
               <p>Again they cenſure him for charging me with Nonſence. Pray, may not a meeting held ſix months after contradict a meeting going before? Very well. But he has given out that I am ſo weak a man, that <hi>I</hi> cannot write ſence. This morning one came to me with <hi>Henry Goldney,</hi> and ſaid, People would hoot at me in the Meeting, (but it is fulfilled on themſelves) thinking me craz'd: And ſo here is a Paper againſt me, that <hi>I</hi> cannot ſpeak ſence: And why? Becauſe he feigns, that <hi>I</hi> ſaid a meeting ſix months before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts a meeting held ſix months after it; when there is no ſuch thing; but that a meeting ſix months after, contradicts a meeting ſix months before.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> could not prove, that <hi>I</hi> began the Separation at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> by any Evidence of Matter of Fact, he eſſays to do it by falſe Logick, arguing, That the Cauſe muſt be before the Effect. Therefore becauſe, <hi>I</hi> ſay, <hi>Th. Loid</hi> and they that were Magiſtrates went away, this was the beginning of the Separation, and a cauſe of it. And ſo when he cannot bring a reaſon in Matter of Fact, he will go to falſe Logick for it: So <hi>I</hi> anſwer'd his Argument, ſaying, All learned men, that write of cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, acknowledge that a priority of time is not neceſſary to the cauſe; but it is enough that there be a priority of nature; the firſt moment the Sun was created, there was light. And then beſides, the cauſe cannot be the effect, ſays he; if their going away from that meeting were the cauſe of the ſeparation, it was not the effect. But I ſaid to him, formal and material cauſes may be both cauſe and effect. As for example; The formal and material cauſes of a man, are his Soul and Body, and they are the man. The material and formal cauſes of this Houſe, are the Stones, the Bricks, the Timber, and the Faſhion. Now here theſe cauſes are the effect. Now <hi>Th. Loid</hi>'s going away was a cauſe of the Separation, and yet was a beginning of the Separation: And is it not ſhameful? They accuſe me of Separation, but they run to a perverſion of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy to prove it by, that the cauſe is before the effect; when they have no other Arguments againſt me, but falſe Logick and vain Philoſophy and Deceit, and his own Brethren here in this Paper do cenſure him, for his arguing unfairly by Logical nicety.</p>
               <p>Here is another Obſervation of theſe honeſt men: they cenſure him for ſaying, he did not underſtand that the Doctrine of the Faith of Chriſt, as he died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Salvation, was reputed a Doctrine in Controverſie betwixt us.— Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the principal Doctrine in Controverſie between them and me, was about the Faith of Chriſt, as he died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether neceſſary to our <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Note, W. Penn</hi> (as is proved) hath ſaid, We need not preach it, the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof is, They need not believe it.</note> Salvation.</p>
               <p>Here is ſomething alſo to take notice of, that he blames me as not fair, for not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Name to my Book, nor the Name of the Printer. Now the Quakers have done ſo in <hi>England,</hi> in Suffering Times; and yet the Printer in <hi>America</hi> was proſecuted by an Act of Parliament, for not printing his Name to ſome of my Books, and they took away
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95822:27"/>
his Letters and Frame: But, <hi>I</hi> find, that which is Perſecution in <hi>England,</hi> is eſteem'd good Juſtice in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>

               <p>I have ſomething to propoſe to you, if you pleaſe. We are all in general very apt, and too apt, to have a good Opinion of ourſelves, it is very near to Mankind to do ſo. You have very well anſwer'd the Deſign of this meeting in this; you have heard him with a great deal of temper. I deſire you further to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all conſiderate men, when they hear one part, hear but with one Ear. So far as <hi>G. Keith</hi> thinks fit to make this publick, you may expect an Anſwer, and I hope you will reſerve one Ear to hear that. I have a Paper that ſome perſons concerned in this Challenge have ſent, that they desire may be read. <hi>Which was conſented to.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G. Keith.</speaker>
               <p>The truth is, I could be almoſt content to go away, and ſay nothing to it, there is ſo little of value in it. They ſay <hi>I</hi> began with them, but they began with me in <hi>Penſylvania. I</hi> was doing my duty, in preaching Chriſt without, and Chriſt within; they charged me with preaching two Chriſts. <hi>I</hi> went to ſome of them about it, but they took their part againſt me. <hi>I</hi> laid it before the Miniſtry at the Yearly meeting, they alſo took their part. Now, you know, he that affirms, on him lies the buſineſs of proving. <hi>W. Pen,</hi> when <hi>I</hi> was opening a place of Scripture, he charges me with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apoſtate and Impoſtor. Here he charges me with being an Apoſtate; <hi>I</hi> ſay, to him it belongs to make his charge good, but he goes away. — At the Yearly meeting, <hi>I</hi> put it to him to make it good. <hi>I</hi> do not doubt but this meeting will ſound through the Nation. They urge me to Printing; I ſay again, I have not either Eſtate or Time to print Book upon Book. And tho' I have not anſwer'd the ſaid two <note n="(b)" place="bottom">So nor have they anſwer'd my Book, <hi>Groſs Error and Hypocriſie detected</hi>; nor my Book againſt <hi>Samuel Jennings.</hi> So here are Two for Two: But I think I have effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd them here, as to the main, and ſo, I hope, will many others judge.</note> Books, why may not I ſay as they do, They are not worth anſwering? As for example, There is a Book called, <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> (I would not vindicate all things in it) but they have been urged to anſwer it; their Anſwer is, it is not worth anſwering: This man that prints this half-ſheet ſays, it cannot be ſuppoſed that <hi>G. Keith</hi> can anſwer eighteen ſheets of Paper in a Meeting. Why can it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uppoſed? But <hi>G. Fox</hi> can anſwer an hundred ſheets of Paper in a few Pages. He has anſwer'd Books of ten or twelve ſheets in a few lines. And as for their upbraiding my Friends for not bearing the charge of Printing my Books, they that own me here, are not many of them rich, and I would not put them to it. But now there is the thing, the Controverſie is, whether the rich Church, or the poorer Church, be the Ch. of Chriſt. <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s is the <note n="(c)" place="bottom">I call it not <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Church, otherwiſe than as related to them as one of them; as I call the other their Church, <hi>N.

I have weaken'd my Eſtate by printing what I have prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted already; there is a Printer here, that can own <hi>I</hi> have paid near forty pounds to him for Printing.

                  <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded the Reaſons given in the Paper read at the beginning, were no juſt Reaſon for their not appearing. But though ſome compariſons are odious, yet give me leave to make a compariſon. May a <hi>Malefactor</hi> make this excuſe; You ſhall not call me before a Juſtice without my conſent? If a man rob me, I may complain of him as a Robber, and without his conſent call him to account; but here is a ſtrange thing,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95822:27"/>
injuring men may not be called to account without their conſent, it will treſpaſs againſt the Law, and intrenches upon liberty of Conſcience. <hi>I</hi> was adviſed to go before the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> did, and told him, <hi>I</hi> hoped it would give no offence to Authority: for the things <hi>I</hi> was concerned in were the common Doctrines of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; if there be any Tumult, ſays <hi>I</hi> it ſhall not be on my ſide: And the Lord Mayor was pleaſed to conſent to it.

            <head>AN APPENDIX, CONTAINING Some other Conſiderable Paſſages for Proofs, out of theſe Mens Books, relating to the foregoing Heads; and ſome few more of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s and <hi>G.

            <p>IN <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Book called <hi>The Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> he hath this moſt unſound and ſcandalous paſſage concerning Chriſt, how a Sacrifice, and his Blood.</p>
            <p>In his Anſwer to <hi>T. Danſon</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis of Quakeriſm, p.</hi> 70. firſt he ſets down the words of <hi>John Owen</hi> thus: <hi>The Sacrifice denotes his Human Nature, whence God is ſaid to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his Church with His own Blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>for He offer'd Himſelf through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit; there was the Matter of the Sacrifice, which was the Human Nature of Chriſt, Soul and Body; His Soul was made an Offering for Sin, Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>His Death had the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt theſe ſound words of <hi>John Owen</hi> he quarrels, and contradicts thus:</p>
            <p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d; as alſo we do not read in Scripture, that the Blood of God, by which he purchas'd his Church, is ever call'd the Blood of the Human Nature: nor that the Soul of Chriſt was the Human Nature, or was put to death with the Body, (for the Wicked could not kill the Soul) though his Soul was made an Offering for Sin, and he poured it out to Death, (he bore the Sin of many, and made interceſſion for Tranſgreſſors) but what Death (and in what manner) was it, is a Myſtery truly to know; for his Soul in his own being was immortal, and and the Nature of God is divine, and therefore that the Blood of God ſhould be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (or earthly) nature, appears inconſiſtent; and where doth the Scripture call the Blood of God Human, or Human Nature? Neither do we read, that the Blood which beareth Record in the Earth, and agrees in one with the Spirit, (and which purgeth the Conſcience, waſheth and cleanſeth the Believer in the Light from all Sin) was ever called by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> the Blood of the Human Nature. Nor do we read, that the Saints did eat and drink Fleſh and Blood that was of a human nature, to receive Divine Life in them thereby: for the Water of Life and Blood of Chriſt, which are ſaid to waſh, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, and juſtifie; which agrees with the Spirit in thoſe Works and Effects We never read, that they are called in Scripture by the name of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> for the Spirit that quickens is divine, and it is the Spirit that gives Life, the Fleſh profiteth nothing, <hi>John</hi> 6.</q>
Now this unſound Doctrine of <hi>G. W.</hi> doth ſo well agree with that in <hi>John Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi>'s two Letters abovementioned, that <hi>John Humphrey</hi> ſeems to have been his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Caſe: and it is certain this ſort of Doctrine of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath corrupted the Minds of many. We ſee he will not own either the Fleſh, or Blood of Chriſt, or Soul of Chriſt, to belong to the human nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annotat.</hi> Before <hi>I</hi> underſtood the Myſtery of <hi>Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> that lay hid, under the finding fault with this name or term <hi>Human Nature of Chriſt, and his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> obſerving that divers found fault with it, <hi>I</hi> was ready to excuſe them, thinking, that tho' they diſowned the term <hi>Human,</hi> yet they owned that ſignified by it, to wit, the real <hi>Manhood</hi> of Chriſt, having a real Soul and Body, that is not the Godhead, but moſt gloriouſly united therewith. And accordingly <hi>I</hi> did in part excuſe them, as in my Book <hi>The True Chriſt owned, pag.</hi> 20 and <hi>pag.</hi> 105 I cited ſome words of <hi>Hilarius, Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de Trinitate; Quid per Naturam Humani corporis concepta ex Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95822:28"/>
S. caro judicatur.</hi> i. e. <hi>Why is the Fleſh conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, judged by the nature of an Human Body?</hi> But neither <hi>Hilarius</hi> nor I judged that the Body, though conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, was any part of the Subſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, the Particle <hi>of</hi> in that place denoting the Holy Ghoſt to be the Efficient Cauſe of that Conception, but not the Material. But that my Mind and Senſe, that Chriſt had the true Nature of Man, of Soul and Body, neither of which were the Godhead, was ſound then as now, and the ſame as now, plainly appears from <hi>Page</hi> 20. of my Book above cited, where I ſay, <hi>Human Soul may ſignify the true Soul of Man, having all the eſſential properties of man's Soul, and its whole Perfection. And if in this ſenſe any will ſay, That Chriſt hath a Human Soul, and call the Manhood of Chriſt his Humanity, there needeth no contention about it: For in the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue we have not a word ſo proper as</hi> Humanitas, <hi>to ſignify the Manhood; and if we may ſay</hi> Humanitas <hi>in</hi> Latin, <hi>we may ſay in</hi> Engliſh, <hi>Humanity. G Whithead</hi> his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the word <hi>Human,</hi> as ſignifying Earthly, hath the ſame force againſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt <hi>Adam,</hi> coming from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Adamah,</hi> that ſignifieth Earth. And the Scripture calleth the Man Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>; and certainly the Man Chriſt had not only that which was Heavenly, but had even our Earthly part, but without ſin; his Body being nouriſhed with Earthly Food, which Body now glorified is Heavenly. But that I differed as much in Doctrine from <hi>G. Whithead</hi> then as now, as concerning the Blood of Chriſt, and the ſenſe of that place of Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. (what that Blood of God was, wherewith he purchaſed his Church, he affirming it was the Blood, not of the Human Nature or Humanity, but of the Divine Nature, as may be ſeen above) appears in my Book above-mentioned, <hi>The true Chriſt owned,</hi> pag. 94. I expreſly ſay,
<q>I grant that there is ſuch a figurative ſpeech of the Communication of Names and Properties, whereby the Man Chriſt is called God, and alſo God is called Man; and God is ſaid to have ſhed his Blood, although Chriſt as God hath not Blood to ſhed, but only as Man; yet by reaſon of that moſt rare and wonderful Union betwixt the Godhead and Manhood, the Blood of the Man Chriſt is called the Blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</q>
This may ſerve as one great Inſtance, to ſhew, That as I am not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this Doctrine from what I was many years ago (that Book of mine being print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Anno</hi> 1679.), ſo I did then as widely differ from <hi>G. W.</hi> in that great Article of Faith, as I do now. But I confeſs I knew not that any ſuch abſurd Doctrine was in his Books, till of late that I made a more narrow ſearch, occaſioned by his defending the ſame Errors in his <hi>Penſilvanian</hi> Brethren.</p>
            <p>Again; In the ſame Anſwer to <hi>T. Danſon</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis, T. D</hi> having affirmed that there is a continual need of Faith and Repentance in this life, <hi>G. Whithead</hi> anſwereth, That there is a continual need of Repentance, this I deny; for true Repentance, where it is wrought, and the fruits of it brought forth, this is unto Salvation never to be repented of, and is attended with a real forſaking of ſin and tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annot. G. Whithead</hi>'s Ignorance greatly appeareth in this, that he thinks Repentance and Perfection inconſiſtent; but it is a ſtrange Perfection that deſtroyeth an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Virtue and a Fruit of the Spirit, ſuch as Repentance is; and what is Repentance? A change of the mind, or a transformation of the mind, as the <hi>Greek</hi> word, Engliſhed Repentance, implieth; or more particularly, true Evangelical Repentance is a great averſion and perfect hatred of the ſoul to all ſin, and a deep humiliation before God, with godly ſorrow and contrition of ſoul for ſins paſt, which is very conſiſtent with, and very becoming the moſt perfect and holy men that ever lived, ſince all have ſinned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It ſeems it is from this great Error that he and many others of his Brethren ſeldom, if ever, pray for Forgiveneſs of ſin, at leaſt for themſelves; for if there be no need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it will follow that there is no need of praying for Forgiveneſs: But all ſound Chriſtians of true ſpiritual experience do know, that both Repentance for ſin, and praying for Forgiveneſs of ſin, are well conſiſtent with the greateſt degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs attainable in this life: Nor doth the praying for Forgiveneſs imply univerſally the want of it, more than the praying for the Spirit implieth the want of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95822:29"/>Again; Whereas it was ſaid in the above Narrative, That <hi>G. Whithead</hi> hath allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed away the Birth, Death, Reſurrection, and coming again of Chriſt without us to Judgment; take theſe plain Proofs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His allegorizing away his Birth, propheſied of by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 9 6. <hi>Unto us a child is born, a Son is given</hi>: This he expoundeth of Chriſt born within. <hi>He-Goats Horn, Page</hi> 51.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He allegorizeth away his Reſurrection, expreſly denying that Chriſt was bodily ſeen of <hi>Paul,</hi> and perverting that place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8. to Chriſt within. <hi>Page</hi> 51.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He allegorizeth away his coming without us to Judgment, in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.27, 28 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4 15, 16, 17 Light and Life, <hi>Page</hi> 40, 41.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Both he and <hi>Richard Hubberthorne</hi> allegorize away his Burial, <hi>Light and Life, Page</hi> 52. and <hi>He-Goats Horn, Page</hi> 62 perverting that Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>He made his grave with the wicked</hi>; he adulterates the true Tranſlation, and turns it, <hi>in the wicked,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> doth not bear: Where ſee a moſt abſurd account of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, turning it wholly to the Resurrection of two Seeds in two Bodies within men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He allegorizeth away the Reſurrection of the Saints Bodies, by his perverſion of that place of Scripture, —<hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, and faſhion it like to his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body,</hi> Phil. 3.21. to a change of the Body that the Apoſtles and Saints witneſſed before death; and yet in contradiction to that, in his <hi>Real Quaker a Real Proteſtant, Page</hi> 105. he underſtands that very place of a change of the vile, or low and humble Body, like unto the glorious Body of Chriſt, as a thing to come.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Some other of <hi>Geo. Whithead</hi>'s Contradictions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>GEO. Whithead</hi> in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> page 69. thinks him a very blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man that reckons Bodies Celeſtial and Terreſtrial to be all one in Matter and Subſtance; and yet the ſame <hi>G. W.</hi> in malice of the <hi>Independant Agent, pag.</hi> 17. (recited and approved by <hi>John Pennington, Apoſtat. expos'd,</hi> p. 16.) owns that Chriſt's Body now in Heaven is the ſame in ſubſtance he had on earth: So by his own words he hath declared himſelf to be a blind and ignorant man, and yet Infallible, otherwiſe by his own word no true Miniſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a late <note n="*" place="margin">Called the Chriſtian Faith.</note> printed Half ſheet, ſigned by him and ſeventeen more, he owneth Chriſt to be both God and Man, and owneth the Humanity of Chriſt, making it ſynonimous with Manhood; and yet it is proved in the above Narrative, that he neither owneth him to be God or Man; finding fault with <hi>W. Burnet</hi> for ſaying that Chriſt as God had a Father, and had Glory with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began; arguing as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, that this would imply two Gods; ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e <hi>Light and Life,</hi> page 47. Again; He finds fault with <hi>T. Danſon</hi> for ſaying that the Man Chriſt had a Created Soul: <hi>Anſwer to</hi> T D.<hi>'s Synopſis,</hi> p. 18. And he blames <hi>R. G.</hi> for ſaying Chriſt hath a Bodily Exiſtence without us, in Heaven; <hi>Nat. of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> page 41.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his late Anſwer to the Queries ſent to the Yearly Meeting of the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> ſigned by Dr. <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> Chaplain to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> he owns the Blood of Chriſt that was outwardly ſhed, to be a part of the Sacrifice, even Chriſt's Blood that was ſhed without the gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> together with the whole Sacrifice of himſelf, both of Soul and Body, was a true Propitiation and Atonement for man's Reconciliation and Peace with God, for Remiſſion of ſin, through a living Faith, and true Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> he denieth that the outward Blood was that by which we are either ſanctified or juſtified, and calleth it <hi>a Type,</hi> and ſaith the <hi>shedding of it was a wicked man's act</hi>; from whence he inferreth that we are not juſtified by the outward Blood, but pleadeth, that the <hi>Offering Paſſover Blood, by which we are cleanſed, is within,</hi> as the New Covenant is, and not without; See in the Narrative above. And this ſort of Unchriſtian Doctrine <hi>G. Whithead</hi> (as many
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95822:29"/>
others) did receive neither from the Spirit of Chriſt within, nor from the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but, as it ſeems, from <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who in a printed Paper of his, having this Title, <hi>To all People in</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>concerning Perfect Love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>alſo concerning Chriſt's Fleſh which was offered,</hi> (which printed Paper I have; it is joined with ſome other printed Papers under this general Title, <hi>Several Papers given forth for the ſpreading of Truth</hi>; See <hi>Page</hi> 55, 57, 59.) hath very unſound and unchriſtian Doctrine concerning Chriſt's Fleſh, that is, the Offering, in which is the belief; by Chriſt's Fleſh meaning not his outward Fleſh. Some of his words I ſhall faithfully recite as followeth, (that to me are very unſound, and I believe in general to all ſound in the Faith):—
<q>And Chriſt according to the fleſh crucified, the Lamb ſlain; that fleſh of his which is a Myſtery, when the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s and <hi>Eve</hi>'s fleſh was defiled, and ſo death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> pag 55. —And <hi>Pag.</hi> 57. So <hi>Adam</hi>'s, <hi>Eve</hi>'s fleſh was defiled, but the fleſh of Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, yet his fleſh never corrupted, which fleſh is the offering; for as he was God he did not dye; and this fleſh is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; and in this <hi>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So through this Offering is the Reconciliation, through the offering of his fleſh, that never corrupted, but takes away corruptions, and his Blood cleanſeth from Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>the Life real.</hi> And ſo this pure Fleſh, this Offering, is ſet over all, which never corrupted, which muſt be your meat if you live: Though there is more in all theſe things, which is hard to be uttered, and cannot be uttered <hi>Yet.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. In a Treatiſe of Oaths preſented to the King and Parliament, 1675. recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Preface to it, and the Reaſons given in it, which Preface is ſigned by <hi>George Whithead,</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> and Eleven more, and which Preface obligeth <hi>G. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> to confeſs that he owned the Contents of that Book at that time, otherwiſe he might be conſtrued to put a Trick upon the whole Nation, it is expreſſly ſaid, <hi>Page</hi> 17. <hi>N</hi> 7.
<q>We look upon it (ſaith he and they) to be no leſs than a preſumptuous tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, to ſummon him as a Witneſs, not only to our terrene but trivial buſineſs, ſuch as we ſhould doubtleſs account it an high Indignity always to ſollicite an Earthly Prince to give his attendance about. What! make God, the Great God of Heaven and Earth our Caution in worldly Controverſies; as if we would bind him to obtain our ends, that is to make too bold with him, and to carry an undue diſtance in our minds towards him that made us; an Irreverence we can by no means away with.</q>
But in flat Contradiction to this, there is an Epiſtle printed to the Friends called Quakers, within theſe few Weeks, in this preſent Year, 1696. that comes from the Meeting of Sufferings, ſigned by <hi>Benjamin Bealing,</hi> their Clerk to their Yearly Meeting. In which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95822:30"/>
Epiſtle they ſay they give the Senſe of Ancient Friends, <hi>George Fox, Edw. Burrough, Francis Hougel, W.

Whithead</hi> hath not ſigned that Epiſtle, ſo is not chargeable with that Contradiction; I anſwer, So nor hath any other of the Miniſtry, not indeed any one but their Hireling Clerk: But it is well known that <hi>G. W.</hi> is a frequent Member of that Meeting of Sufferings, and hath been a main Inſtrument to perſuade his Friends to give theſe Solemn Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he and many others (I ſay not all) judged unlawful, and forbidden by Chriſt, to uſe in caſes of worldly affairs, as <hi>Recovery of juſt Debts,</hi> and the like. Nor will <hi>G. Whithead</hi>'s hiding himſelf by not ſigning to this Epiſtle, and others concerned, but getting their Hireling Clerk to ſign for them (who for his Yearly Salary muſt do their Drudgery-Work; and if fault be found afterwards with what is done, have this hole to creep out at, <hi>They did not ſign it</hi>), be any Excuſe for him or them, to clear them of ſuch palpable Contradiction, or not varying from their former Principle. The only uſe I make of it, is to prove, That <hi>George Whitheaed</hi> (as well as others of the Ancient Friends of the Miniſtry, have palpably contradicted their former Teſtimony, delivered in Print to King and Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1675. and that in a very weighty matter; and therefore they are not ſuch infallible men as they have made their too credulous Followers think them to be, and have given out themſelves for, charging all others to be no Miniſters of Chriſt, if not infallible, as the above Narrative ſheweth. But let none from this infer, that I blame them who in ſome weighty Caſes, eſpecially in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their Fidelity and faithful Subjection to the Government they are under, do uſe ſuch ſolemn Atteſtations, or judge and condemn their liberty in ſo doing. But the Contradiction of <hi>George Whithead</hi> and ſome others to what they have formerly aſſerted very publickly, is that which I would have notified, and their great Hypocriſy ſtill to pretend to Infallibility, and as if ſtill they had never varied in their Principle in any thing; and alſo charging <hi>G. K.</hi> with Apoſtacy, becauſe I have declared. That in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places and paſſages of my former Writings, I have found cauſe to make ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Retractation; God having been pleaſed of late years further to enlighten me, yet without any change of my Faith as to any one Article of the Chriſtian Faith, ſo far as I know.</p>

In his Rejoinder to <hi>John Faldo,</hi> page 179, 180. he greatly blames <hi>Sydrach Sympſon,</hi> an Independent Preacher, for excommunicating <hi>Robert Norwood</hi> for his Opinion, which he, to wit, <hi>W. Penn</hi> himſelf, ſaith, <hi>Is not very offenſive</hi>; and he tells us what that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is; 1. <hi>For denying the Locality of Heaven and Hell, that is void of outward place, as looking upon them to have a more Spiritual ſignification</hi>; and that the other was too Carnal, indeed <hi>Mahometan.</hi> 2. That he believed the Soul to have been breathed from God, thereby aſſigning to it more of Divinity than the uſual Opinion doth. — Now that he ſaith this <hi>Ro.

And next, his excuſing the ſaid <hi>Robert Norwood,</hi> for aſſigning to the Soul ſomething more of Divinity than the uſual Opinion doth, is offenſive and ſcandalous

to Chriſtian Ears: For though it ſhould be owned, That the Divine Power that made the Soul of man, is in it, and operateth in it more manifeſtly than in the inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet the Soul of man is a created Being, and hath nothing of Divinity eſſential to it; for that were to make it God himſelf. And whoever ſhall compare the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication given out againſt <hi>Rob.

His entring in within the Vail of his Fleſh is either perfect Nonſenſe, or it hath this ſenſe, That he hath put off his Body he had on earth, and is ſeparated from it; as one <hi>Robert Young,</hi> a Preacher among the Quakers in <hi>Penſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> at a Meeting affirmed, and brought theſe very words of <hi>W.

That he ſaith, That all muſt know a death to their knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh; it is plain from his words, that he hath this unſound ſenſe of it. That they muſt know a death to the knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh, as that fleſh ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the fleſh of Chriſt, as he came in the fleſh.

            <div type="part">
               <p>I ſhall now point at ſome of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s moſt groſs and palpable Contradictions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His first Contradiction. In the Treatiſe of Oaths above-mentioned, ſigned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by <hi>William Penn,</hi> he is earneſt againſt all Oaths under the Goſpel; and yet in his <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing</hi> he uſeth the greateſt Oath that ever was uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to wit, <hi>As God liveth,</hi> or <hi>The Lord liveth</hi>; which was the form of their Oath, as is clear from many places of Scripture, but particularly <hi>Jerem</hi> 4.2.5.2. Now let us hear how he himſelf hath practically uſed this Oath againſt <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> pag. 180.
<q>O that theſe heavy things might not be laid to thy charge, for <hi>ſo ſure as God liveth</hi> great will be the Wrath that ſhall follow, yea, God will viſit for theſe unrighteous dealings; and I teſtify to thee from God's Living Spirit, if thou deſiſt not, and come not to deep Repentance, the Lord will make thee an Example of his Fury, and thy head ſhall not go down to the Grave in Peace; and by this ſhalt thou know that not a Lying or Deluſive, but a True and Infallible Spirit hath ſpoken by me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annot.</hi> Theſe words imply ſome Prophecy that <hi>W. Penn</hi> thought he had from the Infallible Spirit of God, againſt <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> importing he ſhould be made an Example of his Fury: But they that ſaw <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> dye, and knew him living, ſay, nothing of this was fulfilled, nor did any thing extraordinary, as any Example of Divine Fury happen to <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> either before he died, or at his death.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:95822:31"/>2. His ſecond Contradiction is this; In the Book called <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> pag 13. owned and ſigned by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> he thus gloſſeth on <hi>Matth</hi> 18.17. <hi>Go tell the Church,</hi>
                  <q>That Chriſt as well gave his Church Power to reject, as to try Spirits, is not hard to prove; that Notable Paſſage, <hi>Go tell the Church,</hi> does it to our hand; for if in caſe of private Offence betwixt Brethren, the Church is made <hi>Abſolute Judge,</hi> from whom there is no Appeal in this world, how much more in any the leaſt caſe that concerns the Nature, Being, Faith, and Worſhip of the Church her ſelf?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annot.</hi> This he ſpoke with reſpect to the Quakers Church, whoſe Power he ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily extols, that ſhe is made Abſolute Judge, from whom there is no Appeal in this world. But having to do with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any other Church of them called Proteſtants, we ſhall ſee how he makes a contradictory Gloſs on the ſame Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Go tell the Church.</hi> In his Addreſs to Proteſtants, ſecond Edition, <hi>p.</hi> 152. he ſaith,
<q>But what then can be the meaning of Chriſt's words, <hi>Go tell the Church?</hi> Very well, I anſwer, It's not about Faith, but Injury, that Chriſt ſpeaks; and the place explains it ſelf; <hi>Moreover, If thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone;</hi> here is Wrong, not Religion; Injustice, not Faith or Conſcience concerned, as ſome would have it, to maintain their Church-Power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annot.</hi> Here you ſee he makes the Church-Power very low as by Church he means the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any other Church beſides the Church of the Quakers. But when he means the Church of the Quakers from the ſame Text, he magnifies her Power as great as ever <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other Jeſuit magnified the Church of <hi>Rome. She</hi> (to wit, the Quakers Church, otherwiſe tell us what other Church he means) <hi>is made Abſolute Judge,</hi> from whom there is no Appeal in this world. Then be ſure, if <hi>W. Penn</hi> can prevail to keep up this Authority in the Quakers Church, neither <hi>G Keith,</hi> nor any other againſt whom that he calleth the Church, to wit, the Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> hath paſſed any Sentence, however unjuſt, muſt expect to have any Relief or Redreſs in this world. Well, It is a great Comfort that we may expect it in the world to come. If this be not to play the Ambidexter (a Crime <hi>T. Elwood</hi> unjuſtly caſteth on me in another caſe) I know not what is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Third Contradiction is this. In his <hi>Addreſs to Protestants,</hi> ſecond Edition, <hi>pag.</hi> 246. he ſaith,
<q>Men that are angry for God, paſſionate for Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that can call Names for Religion, and ſling Stones for Faith, may tell us they are Chriſtians if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch by their fruits; to be ſure they are no Chriſtians of Chriſt's making.</q>

Fox</hi> Incarnate Devils, Wolves, Dogs, in his Preface to <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Fixed,</hi> 1682. Behold therefore their Injuſtice and Partiality, for when did they ever ſo much as cenſure either of them for ſuch ſcurrilous, abuſive Language, or any others that have uſed the like? Nay, of all people on the face of the Earth, many of the Preachers and Writers among the Quakers, that I know of, have been moſt guilty in this thing, and doubled this guiltineſs in fathering theſe ſinful Words, and their ſinful Paſſion on the Spirit of God, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> did, when he called me Apoſtate, and Impoſtor, for defending Chriſtian Doctrine common to all Chriſtendom, ſaying, He was tranſported by the Glorious Power of God. For my own part, wherein I have at any time either in word or Writ exceeded in giving any uncharitable Names to any, or in any uncharitable practiſe or behaviour, I declare I am ſorry for it, and have begged, and do beg God's forgiveneſs for it, for his dear Son's ſake, and alſo the forgiveneſs of any whom I have at any time juſtly offended in Words or behaviour; and I bleſs God, who has taught me more patience by the late Exerciſes I have gone through of the ſtrife of Tongues; and I hope I can in meaſure ſay, that I witneſs that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fulfilled, <hi>That tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience</hi>; and this I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times acknowledged to my late Adverſaries, who have made ill uſe of it againſt me, but I never knew they made any ſuch acknowledgment to any, I am ſure never to me, whom they have moſt unworthily abuſed both by Word and Pen.</p>

               <p>I Shall paſs by at preſent his many Forgeries, and Perverſions, and Abuſes againſt me in this his laſt Book, and his two former Books; to the firſt of which I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in print, having collected out of his two laſt Abuſive Books above an hundred manifeſt Perverſions, Forgeries, and Falſities he hath heaped up againſt me, which I have in readineſs to ſhew, and which I keep by me for a reſerve, until I find an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to publiſh them, either by print, or otherwiſe; therefore I ſhall only now make an Index of ſome of his Vile and Groſs Errors contained in his laſt Book, called <hi>Truth Defended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Blood that came out of Chriſt's Side, its ſhedding, was not done to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Offering, becauſe, before that, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Conſummatum eſt, it is finiſhed,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:95822:32"/>
p. 99. Note, this is as much againſt his Death, for before his Death he ſaid, <hi>it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He juſtifies <hi>George Whithead</hi>'s Doctrine and Words, denying that the material Blood of the Beaſts were Types of Chriſt's material Blood, and yet fallaciouſly ſeems to own it, <hi>p.</hi> 106.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He juſtifies <hi>W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Penn</hi>'s Doctrine; ſaying, The one Seed cannot be an outward thing; for one outward thing cannot be the proper ſign of another outward thing; <hi>p.</hi> 113.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He denieth that the gift of the Divine Grace or Power within, is the real Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt's Obedience unto death; arguing, That if ſo, that would not be the free Gift of God, <hi>p.</hi> 121. This is contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. and 4.7, 8 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He blames me for ſaying Chriſt's Body is the ſame in ſubſtance it was on Earth, <hi>p.</hi> 129. now if not the ſame in ſubſtance, then that Body he had on Earth is not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or he muſt hold the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation in that caſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He denieth that Chriſt came by Generation of, and from the Properties of Man in <hi>Mary,</hi> p. 136. and in ſo doing, he muſt deny him to be the Son of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. He perverteth the Apoſtle's Creed, in that Clauſe; <hi>Conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, p.</hi> 138. by which he infers, that Chriſt came not by Generation of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Man in <hi>Mary</hi>; and in ſo doing, he makes the Holy Ghoſt to be the material Cauſe of that Generation; as if that Holy Thing conceived, were of the Subſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; whereas the Holy Ghoſt was the efficient Cauſe thereof, but not the material Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His falſe way of reaſoning againſt the Man Chriſt's being created, from my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, if not created, therefore not Man; by retorting, if created, therefore not God; and in this he chargeth me to be deeply drenched into <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> but this is his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This is as fooliſh as to argue, <hi>A. B.</hi> is no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, therefore is no Man; whereas it is good arguing, <hi>A. B.</hi> is no Man, therefore no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man; the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Error is not, that Chriſt is a Creature, but that he is a meer Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> only Man, and not both God and Man, <hi>p.</hi> 139.</p>
               <p n="9">9. His blaming me, to make light of the work of Generation in compariſon of Chriſt's Incarnation; therefore according to him, Regeneration is greater than Chriſt's Incarnation. Oh great Blaſphemy! <hi>pag.</hi> 155.</p>
               <p n="10">10. His ſaying, That the Author of Regeneration is Chriſt <hi>chiefly,</hi> as he is manifeſted inwardly in the heart, <hi>p.</hi> 152. This is as abſurd, as to ſay, The Beams of the Sun that deſcend on the Earth, are the chief cauſe of the Earth's fruitfulneſs, and not the Sun it ſelf that is in the Firmament.</p>
               <p>My anſwer to <hi>John Pennington</hi>'s Book, falſly called, <hi>An Apoſtate Expoſed:</hi> In his ſaid Book he brings no matter againſt me, either as to Doctrine or Life; but ſets down ſome Citations out of my Books, and the Doctrine in all theſe Citations I own. But that I thought it had been the Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, and of <hi>George Whithead</hi> and <hi>William Penn</hi> in particular; in that I own my miſtake; but this is no contradiction, or proof of my Apoſtacy; for I did not poſitively ſay, they had no Errors, but according to the beſt of my knowledge they had no Errors; this is no contradiction; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions (according to that true Maxim) are <hi>ſecundum idem, ad idem eodem loco, tempore &amp; ratione.</hi> But he hath not ſo much either Logick or common Senſe to underſtand, that this is no contradiction, or what a true Contradiction is, as neither his <hi>quondam</hi> Tutor <hi>Tho. Elwood</hi> hath.</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> his Book, falſly called, <hi>His Modeſt Account</hi>; I have a full Anſwer to it in readineſs, but there is no preſent need of its publication. But let it be noticed, that my Adverſaries have owned it, as having unity with it; and no doubt it was approved by the 2d Days meeting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95822:33"/>I only at preſent note theſe few groſs things in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He miſ-ſtates the Queſtion, which was not, That the Light within is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Salvation, without ſomething elſe; for the Light within, or Grace within <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi> is ſufficient to Salvation, without thouſands of ſome things elſe, as without thouſands of <hi>Caleb Puſeys,</hi> and all of us; but not without the Man Chriſt without us. But the true ſtate of the Queſtion was, and is, That whereas they blamed my Aſſertion, <hi>viz. The Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation, without ſomething elſe.</hi> They are obliged to hold the Contradictory, which is, The Light within is ſufficient to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any, or every thing elſe; true Contradictions being betwixt the one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the other Univerſal; but it hath been my Lot to have to do generally with ſuch ignorant Men of late in diſpute, that know not either by true Logick or common Senſe, what a true Contradiction is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Page</hi> 8. His falſe quotation of my words, citing my Book called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>A Refutation, pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 38, 39. where he brings me in ſaying, It is a real degree of Blaſphemy to ſay, <hi>This Light</hi> cannot make Satisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I uſe no ſuch words, therefore this is a groſs Forgery, which I charge upon the Second day's Meeting; for in all that Treatiſe I neither ſaid nor intented any thing of the <hi>Light within</hi> making Satisfaction; for the Queſtion there treated of by me, was not about Satisfaction, but Revelation, what the <hi>Light within</hi> could reveal. And I was ſo far from affirming, the <hi>Light within,</hi> as we give Obedience to it, to make any Satisfaction for our ſins, that I plainly ſaid, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>ad finem,</hi> That man's moſt exact Obedience to the Light in him, cannot be an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Propitiation unto God for ſins paſt or preſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Fallacy or Forgery, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. in feigning a Contradiction on me, concerning the expreſs Knowledge of Chriſt, neceſſary, and not neceſſary; whereas I never ſaid it was univerſally neceſſary, but only to ſuch who have the occaſion to hear it preach'd; therefore I diſtinguiſhed betwixt the Expreſs and Implicit, ſaying this laſt was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally neceſſary, the former only to Particulars.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. His moſt groſs Aſſertion, which is juſtly charged on the Second day's Meeting (who have approved his Antichriſtian Book), That ſurely <hi>Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> cannot be ſomething elſe than the Light, Spirit, and Power within: For at this rate the <hi>Jews</hi> who own and confeſs to the Light within, and <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers who blaſphemed againſt the Man <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> yet confeſſing to the Light within, may be ſaid to confeſs <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi>; and if <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi> be not ſomething elſe than the Light within, then it is in vain to preach any Chriſt without, that was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and converſed at <hi>Nazareth.</hi> But he is guilty of groſs Forgery, to infer it from my words: He ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. The Word only is alone, and admits of nothing elſe; but I anſwer, It admits not of another Chriſt, but it admits of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt <hi>without</hi> us, that is not <hi>within</hi> us; as Chriſt that died for us is the only Saviour; this only admits not of another Saviour, or Chriſt, <hi>within</hi> us, yet it admits of ſomething of Chriſt within us, that was not outwardly crucified, <hi>viz.</hi> His Grace and Spirit.</p>
               <p>As concerning the pretended Confeſſion of Faith, called, <hi>Our Ancient Teſtimony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,</hi> of our Adverſaries from <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> ſubſcribed by <hi>Caleb Puſey,</hi> and above Thirty ſix more, though the Scripture-Words as therein recited, we own, yet ſeeing they (and particularly he) who have differed from us in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> have declared a contrary ſenſe to all theſe Places of Scripture touching the things in Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, and have neither in that Confeſſion, nor elſewhere, renounced their former Errors, whereof they have been proved guilty, their Confeſſion is but a mere Sham, and Mock-Confeſſion.</p>
