            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>How truly then may you take up that expression of holy <hi>Job, I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ears, but now mine eyes seeth thee,</hi> Since that amiable promise of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable presence with his people, which you heard with comfort imperfectly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Sermon, you have seen with joy fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and I doubt not but you say to God with adoration in words, not much unlike those the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> spake to <hi>Solomon</hi> with admiration, <hi>The one half of the</hi> goodnesse of thy presence, O Lord, <hi>was not told me,</hi> so far doe all verball Discoveries come short of Gods reall manifestations.</p>
                        <p>And surely what should move your Lordship to desire a representation of this weak Discourse I know not, unless that you might see how that Doctrine which is here dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:44918:3"/>
illustrated, hath been to you superabundantly verified.</p>
                        <p>I little thought such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polished piece should ever have been exposed to publike view; but Gratitude hath taught me rather to undergoe the Worlds harsh censure, then incur your Lordships just displeasure.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, though it greatly troubleth me that in publishing these rude notes I must set forth my ignorance, yet withall it much rejoyceth me that I have an opportunity by these lines to acknowledge your Muneficence.

                        <p>The truth is, the most reviving Cordiall to a fainting spirit, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Antidote against the deadliest afflictions, is the operative presence of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious God.

            <p>There are two sorts of waters through which every Saint must passe, the waters of contrition and affliction, of inward sorrow end outward trouble, those we may call the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> repentant tears being full of bitternesse, and yet sweetned by casting in the tree of the crosse; these the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Meribah</hi> caused through the spirit of contention in wicked men,<note place="margin">Exo. 15.23.</note> which makes them strive with, and set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against Gods people,<note place="margin">Numb. 10.13.</note> to passe through those is our duty, through these our misery: to the one we are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the other we must be prepared: those the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> maketh the matter of his desire. <hi>O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,</hi> Jer. 9. these the Prophet <hi>David</hi> maketh the object of his complaint, <hi>Hear me O God,</hi>

            <p>Many are the resemblances to which the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the afflictions of the Church, but none more common then this of waters; in the thirtieth of this Prophecy, we finde <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>water</hi> joyned together,<note place="margin">Isa. 30.20.</note> the one whereof is eaten, and the other drank, to teach us that afflictions are as needfull for us as the food by which we are nourisht, in this Verse we finde <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water</hi> joyned together, through both which the Church is forced to passe, sometimes materially, however analogically.</p>

            <p>But whence, may some say, are these waters and rivers? I answer:</p>
            <p>Partly from the bottles of Heaven above, which being opened, pour out waters upon the earth, <hi>affliction comes not out of the dust,</hi> nor befals us by chance, but by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, those cruelties to which the Saints are exposed, by whomsoever acted, are by God disposed,<note place="margin">Job 5.6.</note> both the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44918:7"/>
and continuance of those waters are at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: true it is, the waters that fall from the clouds above, are bred of the vapours that ascend from the earth below, and it is our sins that are the cause of all troubles, which are sent by God upon us, we deserve, he inflicts, we provoke, he chastiseth, our iniquities are the meritorious, his equity the efficient cause of all calamity.</p>
            <p>Partly, as many Rivers are fed by Springs out of the bowels of the earth; so these waters arise out of the depths of hell; it is Satan that opens the fountain of malice in wicked mens hearts, whence the streams of oppressions flows upon good men heads; it is the winde of diabolicall instigation which raiseth the waves, encreaseth the water, augments the rage of <hi>Zions</hi> adversaries; thus both heaven and hell concurre to the sending forth of these waters, but on a different ground, and to a different end; God justly, Satan unjustly; God for our sins, the devil for our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. Finally, Gods end is to cleanse our filth, and wash away our pollutions, the devils to overwhelm our persons, and sink us into the depth of misery.</p>

to Heaven watery through afflictions: Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> assertion is universall, <hi>All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12. <hi>Christianus non est, qui non crucianus:</hi> Christianity entitles her professors to the crosse, the way to blisse is not strewed with Roses, but hedged with thorns: he that lives in pleasure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the worlds favour, may well suspect himself as a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer in the broad way; but he that findes hatred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution from ungodly <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> may at least probably conclude himself in favour with God, and a Traveller in the way to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. It is but a passing through, not a dwelling in, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

            <p n="3">3. Consider not so much through what, as whither thou passest, look beyond the waters to the shore, the passage is calamitous, the Countrey where thou art going glorious; it is to possesse thy inheritance, and receive thy crown.

Finally, know to thy comfort thou shalt passe through these waters, no remora shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, nor contrary windes impede thee, though thou maist be molested, yet not overflown by those waters: which leads to the second Generall.</p>

And the Church useth the like expression, where she saith, <hi>the waters flowed over my head,</hi> Lam. 3.54. So may you have sometimes seen the surly waves over-topping the ship, and yet at last the ship arising above the waves, or a skilfull swimmer diving into the River, but coming forth again; and thus, the Church though she be not only wet in the shallow but cast into the deep, bound in the prison but thrown into the dungeon, yet all this is only for a time; and after all, she shall come forth gloriously: indeed like the palm tree, the more she is opprest the more she spreads, like the Camomil the more she is trod
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44918:8"/>
upon she groweth the faster, and her greatest sufferings prove not exitiall but medicinal. Nor is this lesse true of every Saint in particular then of the Church in generall, <hi>In the flouds of many waters they shall not come nigh him,</hi> saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> of a godly man, <hi>Psa.</hi> 52.7.

            <p>What the banks are to the Sea, that his presence is to these waters in bounding them, what the plank is to the shipwrackt Marriner, that is Gods presence to the Saint, carrying him safe to shore. Finally, what a Convoy is for the guarding, a Pilote for the guiding or the Shippe, and a faithfull friend to comfort in a storm, all this is Gods presence to the Church in her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is with us in the waters <hi>cohibendo,</hi> to bridle the rake of these waves, and bound the fury of these waters: he that sets bounds to the sea, saying, <hi>Hitherto it shall passe and no further,</hi> restrains the power,<note place="margin">Job 38.11.</note> quiets the rage of wicked men, and saith, Thus much they shall do and no more. These waters ebbe and flow at Gods pleasure, he keeps the Sluce to let them in and out as he will. So true is that of the Psalmist, <hi>Surely, the wrath of man shall praise thee: and the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain,</hi> Psal. 76.10. Persecutors are a rod, but in Gods hand; they are Lions and Wolves, but chained by his Providence; swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling waters, but bounded by his commandment. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of this, as an effect of Gods presence, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated by the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.9, 11. In the 9. verse he assures the <hi>ceasing of warres,</hi> the <hi>breaking of the bowes,</hi> the <hi>burning of the Chariot,</hi> that is, to weaken the strength, and bridle the malice of <hi>Zions</hi> enemies, and if we would know how this should be effected, the answer is given at the 11. verse, <hi>The Lord of Hosts is with us</hi>; and yet more fully, the Church acknowledgeth this truth. <hi>Psal.</hi> 124. <hi>If it had not been the Lord had been on our side, when men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick, and the waters had overwhelmed us.</hi> Indeed, it is only an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty presence can command and stiil the ptoud waves.

who sitting at a low water upon the river <hi>Thames,</hi> commanded the water it should not come nigh him, but the Tide returning, ceased not to rise higher till it wet his feet: whereupon he went home, and set his Crown upon the Crucifix at <hi>Westminster.</hi> It is none but God can stay the course of the water, and it is the same hand must stop the current of wicked mens fury against his people: thus God was with the three Worthies to quench the violence of the fire, with <hi>Daniel</hi> to stop the mouths of Lions, and with <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to bridle his Uncles envy.</p>

mercy conveyed to land in a Whales belly: thus doth God prosper weak and small means, yea, finde out strange and unexpected waies for the rescue of his Saints.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he divides the waters,<note place="margin">Evo. 14.11. Jud. 2.22.</note> 
               <hi>as he did the red Sea</hi> for <hi>Israel</hi>; he sets the Churches enemies one against another, and by dividing, both weakens them, and preserves his: So he did for <hi>Gideons</hi> small Army to the <hi>Midianites</hi> mighty host, setting every mans sword against his fellow.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he turneth the streames of the waters, changeth the windes, that whereas before they were contrary, they become favourable to the Church, and serviceable to her passage. Thus was <hi>Esau's</hi> heart mollified towards <hi>Jacob,</hi> who in stead of a devouring enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an embracing friend, and meets him with kisses;<note place="margin">Gen. 33.4.</note> to whom he had intended blows.

               <hi>that they are in the hands of the Lord as the rivers of waters, and he turns them whithersoever he will:</hi> no wonder then, if sometimes he mollifies the obdurate, qualifies the malicious, and melts the frozen hearts of wicked men unto love and compassion towards his servants.</p>
            <p>Finally, Sometimes he abates, and wholly dries up these waters, so that the Sea becomes a dry Land, when he lessens the power, takes away the sting, breaks the horn, and dashes out the teeth of the ungodly, so that they are not able to hurt his Saints; the heat of the Sun dispels the clouds, and dries up the over-flowing waters, and the presence of God is many times pleased to vanquish his enemies, scatter their forces, thereby commanding deliverances for <hi>Jacob,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if he deliver nor out of, he will by these waters; if he save not from trouble, he will make the very trouble a means of safety, and when they may perish temporally in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of distresse, he will yet be with them to save them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the mansion of blisse.</p>
            <p>You have seen the extent of this comfortable promise, and

She is his Spouse, and he her husband: no relation engageth to nearer union and fuller communion then this; one house, one board, one bed holds the man and wife. Who should defend the woman when assaulted but the husband? and will God that is spiritually married to his people withdraw himself, or withhold his succour from them? Finally, she is the Ship, and he her Master; and though while the Ship is in harbour, the Masters absence may be dispensed with, yet by no means when she is sailing in the deep.</p>
            <p n="2">2: His deer affection to his Church inclines him, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus non ubi animat, sed ubi amat</hi>: the soul is not so much where it lives, as where it loves: indeed love is <hi>affectus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> a desire of union, it was the wish of two friends to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> that he would new make them into one: and surely Gods love to his Church infinitely surpassing the love of any creature, must needs unite him to, and make him one with her. The Psalmist speaking of a righteous man, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this as the reason of Gods being with him, because he hath <hi>set his love upon God,</hi> but doubtlesse the reason holds far stronger in the other way,<note place="margin">Psa. 91.14, 15.</note> because God hath set his love upon his Church, therefore he will be with her; such is Gods tendernesse toward his people, that were it not for his own honour and their good, he would not suffer them to passe through the waters; sure then he cannot but be with

them when they are in the waters, yea, for this cause he is pleased to bring them into depths of misery, that the glory as of his power, so love, may be heightned in their delivery.</p>

            <p>If God be with us, all the creatures are for us; what <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> said to <hi>Ahab,</hi> that God saith unto his Church, <hi>I am as thou art, my people as my people, and my horses as thy horses,</hi> 2 King. 3.7. It was the comfort Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gave the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in them all beleevers. <hi>Whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. The Angels are ours to guard us, the Ministers to comfort us, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to serve us, and surely he need not fear the waters, that hath the winde and tide on his side: what trouble should dismay a Christian that hath heaven and earth to support him? no wonder then that we finde the Scripture so often disswading from carnall fear upon this ground of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual presence. Not to multiply instances, view <hi>Isa.</hi> 10.15, 14. where no lesse then four times God cals upon his Church <hi>not to fear,</hi> upon this argument, because he was with her and would help her.</p>
            <p>Chear up then thou disconsolate soul, doubt not of the Churches safety in generall, <hi>The Lord in the middest of her is mighty, he will save, he will rejoyce over her with ioy,</hi> Zeph. 3.17.

So true is that of the Psalmist, <hi>The Lord on high is mightier then the noise of many waters: yea, then the mighty waves of the Sea,</hi> Psal. 93.4. <hi>In persecutionibus nemo cogitet quod periculum Diabolus importet, sed consideret quod

auxilium Deus praestat, nec mentem labefactet humana in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festatio, sed corrohoret fidem divina protectio.</hi> Consider not so much thy distresse, as thy deliverer, and when mens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious combination may affright thee. let divine asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation support thee; the danger may exceed thy resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but not Gods assistance; the enemies power may surpasse thy strength, their subtlety out-wit thy prudence, but neither can excell the wisedom and might of God that is with thee. Oh learn, therefore, to try God in his strength, to trust him in difficulties, and when the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse waves are ready to swallow thee, commit thy self to his custody. <hi>Mos est naucleri coelum aspicere.</hi> The Mariner in straights looks up to heaven, do thou so, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that when the waters are about thee, the Sunne shines upon thee.</p>
            <p>But now (me thinks) the despairing soul replies, were I sure God was with me, I should not fear, but the clouds are so thick that I cannot see the Sun, my troubles so great that I cannot beleeve God is present. But stay thou drooping Saint and know</p>
            <p n="1">1. God may be with thee though thou seest him not, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous sinners uhink God is near them when he is farre off, doubting Saints think God far off when he is nigh them. I remember <hi>Jacobs</hi> Speech, <hi>Surely God is in this place, and I know it not:</hi> and God may be with thee, though thou art not aware of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is with his people divers waies, and though in one kinde he be absent, yet in another he may be present; if he be not with thee to remove the distresse, yet he may be with thee to support thy strength; though not to give out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deliverance, yet to afford inward comfort; though he doth not presently take away the burden from thy shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet if he enable thee with patience to bear it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance to wait on him, it is an undoubted argument he is still with thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods with-drawments from his people in dangers, are rather seeming then reall; <hi>Deus suos non negligit, cum

negligit:</hi> when God seems most to neglect his people, he doth not forsake them, and his end in withdrawing his sensible presence from them, is that they should run the more swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And lastly, though God with-draw for a time, yet he will return at last, <hi>For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 54.2.</note> 
               <hi>saith the Lord thy Redeemer.</hi> I have read a story of a poor man that served God faithfully, and yet was opprest cruelly, having all his goods taken from him by an oppressing Knight, whereupon he perswaded himself that <hi>God was dead,</hi> but going about to make a funeral for his God, who had formerly been so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him, and now (as he thought) left him; an old man met him and desired him first to deliver a Letter unto the hands of his oppressor: upon receipt and perusall of which the Knight was so convinced, that immediatly he confest his fault, and restored the goods which made the poor man say, <hi>now I see God may seem to sleep, but can never die:</hi> with this meditation, comfort thy self, O Christian, in the saddest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, that though God in wisedom may for a time hide his face, yet at last he will in mercy lift up the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon thee to thy joy, and make bare the arm of his power for thy succour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Since God will be with thee in the waters, do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake God for fear of the waters, let no tribulation make thee disclaim him who is ready to own thee, it is not seldom seen that persecution causeth men to forgo their profession, and which argues as little policy as piety for fear of a storm they run from their shelter: but why O man, dost thou by' indirect waies seek to save thy self, when by cleaving to God thou maist be sure of his defence?

Indeed his own tender mercy is the impulsive cause, but our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble addresse is the procuring means of his gracious presence; neglect not then so facil a duty which will procure so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a mercy, and be sure in thy approaches to God that it be his face thou seek, before and above all other blessings, a carnall heart when under affliction only begges deliverance from trouble, and regards not the presence of God, his praier is that God would send help for him, he cares not whether he come to him or no; oh, let thy praiers flow from higher principles, beg the presence of his grace, and leave the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall of thy deliverance to his wisedom, what our Saviour saith of the <hi>Kingdom of God, seek</hi> that <hi>first, and all these shall be added,</hi> that may I apply to the face of God, seek first his face and all other things that thy necessities call for, shall be conferred: only let me adde one word more, As thou cravest Gods presence with thee, put sin far from thee, distresse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth him to thee, but sin separates him from thee: let not any iniquity rule over thee, and then God will be with thee, nor shall any calamity prevail against thee.</p>
            <p>To end this, we all either are or may be called to sail through the waters of tribulation, and surely what will be more fit then that, what God here promiseth, we should pray for; to beseech him, who of his great mercy did save <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family in the Ark from perishing by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and did safely leade the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> through the Red Sea, that he would be pleased so to behold us with his favour, be with us by his grace, and refresh us with his presence, that we being rooted in faith, joyful

            <p>And now to close up all in a literall application of this Scripture, to those who go down into the deep, and more especially to you my honoured Lord: being now to take a long voyage, and transplant your self with you fruitful Vine and Olive-plants, for a time into a farre Countrey. What God said to <hi>Abraham, Gen</hi> 12.1. he seems to say to you, <hi>Get thee out of thy Countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from thy kindred, and from thy Fathers house to a Land that I will shew thee.</hi> The way you are to passe is through the great waters, and therefore cannot but be perilous. <hi>Anacharsis</hi> being asked in what number he should put those that went to Sea, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the living or the dead, was doubtfull, <hi>An inter vivos habendi, qui vitam undarum ac ventorum arbitrio commissis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> whether they should be reckoned among the living who commit their lives to the mercy of windes and waves, he spake in that like an Heathen, Christians know better, who recommend themselves into the hands of God, that rules both, but however, Sea-voyages are doubtlesse attended with many dangers; it was a true saying of the same Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, to which the Apostle alludeth, who being told the distance of the Ships deck from the water was four fingers, answered. <hi>Tantillum absunt a morte qui navigant,</hi> there is but so much space between death and Sea-men;<note place="margin">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44918:16"/>
worse waters, I mean, the furious rage of unreasonable men. But let this golden word <hi>Emmanuel</hi> be your support; let that precious sentence, <hi>If God be for us who can be against us,</hi> be your continuall meditation; a Scripture, with which <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor was so much in love, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to be wrought in Checquer-work upon his Table, let it rather be imprinted in your Honours breast to your solace and comfort. Your calling is just and full, having the stamp of Royal Majesty upon it, the consent of the honourable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to it, and the election of that worshipfull Society, whose affairs you are to manage, concurring with it. The Service you undertake is not only Lawful but Noble, to be an Embassadour from <hi>Englands Monarch</hi> for his Subjects Trade and Commerce with the <hi>Turkish Empire</hi>; and surely going about so needfull a work with so good a warrant, you need not doubt of the Almighties assistance to make the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse happy.</p>
            <p>If then the parting with your Native soyl, neer allies, and familiar friends trouble you, remember when these are farre off, God is at hand. Is was the Psalmist comfort, <hi>When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up,</hi> Psal. 27.10 give me leave with a little alteration and inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to apply it for your encouragement, when you must leave mother, kindred and acquaintance, God will take you up, and stand by you.</p>
            <p>If the peril of the Seas or storms affright you, ingage by faith and praier divine power to, and for you. It was the proud speech of <hi>Caesar</hi> to his Mariner, who was afraid in a desperate storm: <hi>Quid times? Caesarem vehis &amp; fortunas ejus,</hi> Why dost thou fear? thou carriest <hi>Caesar</hi> and his fortunes with thee; with better confidence may your Honour say in the midst of a violent storm, Why should I despair who have God and his strength with me; it is observable of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, whithersoever they went they would still carry their gods with them, so <hi>Aeneas</hi> advised his father,

               <hi>They that go down into the deep</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>see the wonders of the Lord,</hi> indeed, as he is mercifully present in all places, so he shews himself wonderfully present in the waters; there it is he ofttimes works <hi>potenter &amp; patenter,</hi> with power and glory; so that the finger of a Deity evidently appears: of him it is that may be most truly affirmed which the Poets feign of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> that he carried the windes in his hand, and could command them at his pleasure, he can rebuke the stormy windes, still the raging of the waves, having in his hands as well the deprhs of the Sea, the windes of the air, as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, when the long inquity of the place, inhumanity of the people, whither, and among whom you are going may perplex you; think God saith to you, as in another case he did to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Fear not, I will go down with thee into Egypt,</hi> his power, prudence,<note place="margin">Gen. 46.4.</note> and providence shall stand by you to remove all difficulties, and prevent all designs, he will command his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to pitch their tents about you, and keep you in all his waies.</p>
            <p>I end my consolation from God to you with an invocation on God for you, that your egresse may be cheerful, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse successeful, your regresse joyful.
