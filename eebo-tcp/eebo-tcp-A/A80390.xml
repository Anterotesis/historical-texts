            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PLymouth,</hi> being a Towne farre remote, and the paſſage being by Sea, an account of Gods workings (for <hi>Plymouth)</hi> againſt the Enemy, cannot ſo ſpeedily be given as might be wiſhed and expected, beſides the Commanders (being more deſirous to ſerve their God and Country, then to gaggle like hens on the laying of every Egge) are contented to be ſilent, untill there is enough acted to fill up a Relation. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not willing that Gods mercies ſhould be ſtifled, but publiſhed for his glory, and the heartning of ſuch as ſtand up couragiouſly, for the Lord againſt the mighty, this enſuing Narration (as a continuation of the moſt obſervable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in and about <hi>Plymouth)</hi> is thought fit to be publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Our laſt ended Decemb. <hi>25.</hi> and this begins Ian. <hi>26.</hi> for in the Interimour great care was, and ſtill is, to fortifie the Towne, in pulling down Hedges, without our Works, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing decayed and ruined Out-works, in building new, where they are wanting, and running Breaſtworks from worke to worke: Two new works are made, two repaired that fell down, Decemb. <hi>25.</hi> at night, the very night, after the enemy remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſtrait ſiege, and let not the world wonder, that we lay ſtill a month, without encounters, when we had ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hedges, to pull down, and <hi>3.</hi> miles of ground, to be new fortified againſt the Enemy, beſides the ſleighting of the Enemies works.</p>
            <p>If none of this had bin Neceſſary, it might have bin need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to refreſh ſuch a tyred, and almoſt worne-out Garriſon, it being common in the winter, for the poore Souldiers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <hi>6.</hi> or <hi>7.</hi> nights duty, without releife, beſides their hard bickerings, and encounters with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>But if the world knew, what rubs againſt action hath lain in the way, it would not wonder that, that gallant garriſon hath given no better account to the Parilament, how-ever take this Narration for a truth without queſtioning it, and bleſſe God for this, and pray for them that are (by Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance) reſolved to doe more.</p>

            <p>By his death, the affaires of the Towne likely to be out of order, a Commiſſion was granted to the Major of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Colonell <hi>Crocker,</hi> Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Martin</hi> for the ordering of the affaires of the Garriſon, untill a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Chiefe was ſent from the Parliament.</p>

The proceſſe of ſo long tune ſpent at <hi>London,</hi> made me and many others plainly ſee the inquity of their Policy, for I found Religion was the cloak for Rebellion, &amp; it ſeemed not ſtrange to me, when I found the Proteſtant religion was infected with ſo many independants and Sectaries of infinite kinds, which

would not heare of a peace, but ſuch as would be in ſome kind as pernicious as was the warre. The Priviledges of this Parliament I found was not to be bound by any of the former, but to lay them aſide &amp; alter them as they advantaged their party. This ſeemed ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to me that I reſolved to lay my ſelf, as I have done, at his Ma: feete, from whence &amp; his moſt juſt cauſe, no fortune, terrour or cruelty, ſhall make me ſweru, in any kind: and to let you ſee alſo what hath formerly paſt, I have ſent you theſe incloſed.
