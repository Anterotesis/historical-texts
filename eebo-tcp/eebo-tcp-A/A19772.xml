            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>This is the Day.</hi> Which <hi>Day,</hi>
there is not one of the Fathers, that I haue

            <p>And so we haue brought the Text, and the
Time together. We know, who is the <hi>Stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Christ. Who the <hi>Builders: Caiphas</hi> and those
with him. When <hi>refused?</hi> In his Passion. When
<hi>made Head?</hi> at his Resurrection: that is, this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which day is therefore, (at the 27. verse) said to
bee, <hi>Constitutus dies solennis:</hi> made a solemne
Feast day: <hi>in condensis,</hi> on which the Church to

            <p>This (I take it) is a good warrant, for our

Psalme, for this Day; as peculiar and pertinen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to the Feast it selfe. And a good warrant, for
vs, so to apply it. It is the Holy Ghosts owne
application, by the mouth of <hi>S. Peter:</hi> we may
boldly make it, ours.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But though this be the chiefe sense: yet, is it
not, the onely. The chiefe it is: for the Spirit of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1826:3"/>
Prophesie, is in it, which <hi>is the testimony of Iesus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc 19.</note>
Yet, not the onely: for according to the letter,
wee cannot deny, but that originally, it was
ment of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Hee was a <hi>Stone</hi> too, and in his
time <hi>refused:</hi> yet after, raised by God to the
highest place, euen to bee King of his people.
The <hi>Chaldey Paraphrast,</hi>) (the oldest we haue)
is enough for this; thus, hee turneth the
verse. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>&amp;c. The Childe, whom the chiefest
men oppugned, Hee of all the Sonnes of Ishai, was
made Ruler of Israel.</hi> A second sense then it
hath, of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, by analogie, it will beare a third; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
will sort with <hi>Ours,</hi> or with any Prince: in like
manner banded against, and sought to bee put
by, as <hi>Hee:</hi> and yet, after brought by God, to
the same place, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was. To any such it
will well agree, and bee truely verified of him,
and rightly applied to him. And, I confesse,
I chose it the rather for this third. Because, (as
this yeere falleth out) vpon one day, (and <hi>Hic
est dies,</hi> This is the day) Wee haue in one a
memoriall of two benefits; of our Sauiours
exalting, by his Resurrection: and of our
Soueraignes exalting, and making Head of
this Kingdome. Both, lighting so together,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1826:4"/>
we were (as mee thought) so to remember the
one, that we left not the other out. And this
text, will serue for both. Both, may in one be
set before vs: and so wee reioyce and render
thankes to God for both: For the <hi>Lord Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and for the <hi>Lords Christ,</hi> vnder one.</p>
            <p>Three senses then, there are of the Text
and (to do it right) we to touch them all three.
1. <hi>Christ</hi> in prophesie. 2. <hi>Dauid</hi> in History. 3.
<hi>Our owne</hi> in analogie. But will giue <hi>Christ</hi> the

To <hi>be built,</hi> and to <hi>build,</hi> both <hi>Stones;</hi> in regard
of them whom God hath set ouer vs; who are
to frame vs, and we so to suffer them. <hi>Builders,</hi>

If we haue an Houshold, of them, to <hi>build</hi>

If a Country or Kingdome, then a <hi>Basilica,</hi> or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1826:6"/>
                  <hi>Metropolitan Church:</hi> which is properly, the
Princes Building.</p>
               <p>This in the Text (the <hi>builders</hi> heere were in
hand with) was a <hi>Basilica:</hi> for it was the frame
of the <hi>Iewes</hi> Gouernment: but, is applied, to all
States in generall. For <hi>Iury</hi> was the Scene or
Stage, whereon the errors or vertues of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments,
were represented, to all posterity.</p>
               <p>Foure words there be in the Text. 1. <hi>Aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes,</hi>
Builders. 2. <hi>Lapis,</hi> Stone. 3. <hi>Angulus,</hi> a
Corner, and 4. <hi>Caput,</hi> the Head. From the first
word <hi>Aedificantes;</hi> this wee haue: That States
would not bee, as Tents: set vp, and taken
downe, and remouable. They would bee <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;</hi>
to stand steddie and fixed. Nothing so
opposite vnto a State, as not to stand.</p>
               <p>2. From the second, <hi>Lapis:</hi> that, this <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
would be, not of clay and wood, or (as wee
call them) Paper walles: but, <hi>Stone-worke,</hi> as
strong, as defensible, as little subiect to concus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or cumbustion, as might be.</p>
               <p>3. From the two parts specified; first, <hi>Anguli:</hi>
This <hi>Stone-worke,</hi> is not a wall, forthright, to
part in sunder, or to keepe out: but, it consists of
diuerse sides: those sides meete in one Angle:
where if they meet, and knit well: all the better
will the <hi>building</hi> be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1826:6"/>
4. <hi>Caput.</hi> And they will knit the better, if
they haue a good <hi>Head.</hi> For, where they meet,
no place so much in danger of weather going
in, and making the sides flie off, if it want a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering.
A <hi>head</hi> it would haue, to couer it: It is
a speciall defence, and besides, it is a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
beauty, to the whole <hi>building.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that <hi>Head,</hi> would not be of <hi>plaister,</hi> to
crumble away: or of <hi>wood,</hi> to warp or rot, with
the weather: or of <hi>lead,</hi> to bow or bend, and to
cracke: but of <hi>Stone,</hi> and the principallest <hi>Stone,</hi>
that could be. The chiefe part it is, the <hi>head:</hi> the
chief care, &amp; consultation would be, what <hi>Stone</hi>
meet for that place: for indeed, it is all, in all.</p>
               <p>That: is the consultation here. Here is <hi>Christ,</hi>
