            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE ensuing Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Substance of sundry
Sermons Preached in a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Some, who heard them,
considering the Subject-Matter
Treated of, and the Design in them,
with respect unto the present state of
things in this Nation, did judge that
it might be convenient and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make them more publick, for
the Use and Benefit of others. But
<pb facs="tcp:50059:3"/>
knowing how remote I was for any
such Intention in their first Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and how naked they were of
all Ornaments that might render them
meet for publick view, I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for a season to comply with their
Desires. Neither was it their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
(which as they did not use,
so I should not in this Case have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued)
but their Reasons that prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with me to consent, that they
might be Published by any that had a
mind thereunto, which is all my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
therein. For they said,
that whereas the Land wherein we
live, is filled with Sin, and various
Indications of God's displeasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet there is an unexemplified
Neglect in calling the Inhabitants of
it unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb facs="tcp:50059:3"/>
of <hi>Impendent Judgments.</hi>
The very <hi>Heathen,</hi> they said, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
less Evidence of the Approaches of
<hi>Divine Vengeance,</hi> than is now
amongst us, did always solemnly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to their <hi>Deities,</hi> for
the turning it away. Wherefore this
<hi>Neglect</hi> amongst us, they supposed
to be of such <hi>ill Abode,</hi> as that
the weakest and meanest Endeavour
for <hi>Releif</hi> under it, might be of
some use; and of that nature I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but esteem this Discourse to be.</p>
            <p>They added moreover, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on various Accounts, there are
<hi>continual Apprehensions</hi> of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Calamities,</hi> all mens Thoughts
are exercised about the Ways of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi>
from them. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they fix themselves on various and
<pb facs="tcp:50059:4"/>
opposite <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> for this
End, the Conflict of their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>
and <hi>Designs</hi> encreaseth our
Danger, and is like to prove our
Ruine. And the great Cause here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is a general <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>
of the only <hi>true Way</hi> and
<hi>Means,</hi> whereby this Nation may be
delivered from <hi>Destruction</hi> under
the <hi>Displeasure</hi> of God. For if
their <hi>Thoughts</hi> did agree and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therein, as it would Insensibly
work them off form their present <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
destructive Animosities;</hi> so
also it is of such a Nature, as would
lead them into a <hi>Coalescency</hi> in
those Counsels, whose Fruit would be
the Establishment of <hi>Truth</hi> with
<hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> Now
this Way is no other but <hi>sincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50059:4"/>
and <hi>universal Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
in all sorts of Persons
throughout the Nation.</p>
            <p>That this is the only Way for the
saving of this Nation from <hi>impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Judgments,</hi> and <hi>wasting
Desolations,</hi> that this way will be
effectual unto that End, when all
others shall fail, is asserted and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this <hi>Discourse,</hi> from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Lord Jesus Christ himself,
to confront the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
who are otherwise minded, with
a plain Word of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was hoped also by them, that
some Intimation of their Duty, might
be hereby given unto those, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Ministerial Oversight</hi> of
the Generality of the People to
Divert their Mindes unto the <hi>Pet-Petty
<pb facs="tcp:50059:5"/>
Differences</hi> and <hi>Contests,</hi>
whil'st the <hi>Fire</hi> of Gods <hi>Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
for Sin, is ready to devour their
Habitations. And the Truth is, if
they persist in their <hi>Negligence,</hi> if
they give not a <hi>publick Evidence</hi>
at this Season, of their <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
and <hi>Reformation of
Life,</hi> among all sorts of Persons, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before them in their <hi>Example</hi>
and <hi>Endeavours,</hi> unto the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, I understand not how
they will give an Account of their
<hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to God or Men.</p>
            <p>And therefore were I worthy to
give Advice to any of my Brethren
in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> who are in the
<hi>same Condition</hi> with my self, as
unto <hi>outward Circumstances,</hi> it
should be this only; Namely, That
<pb facs="tcp:50059:5"/>
whilst others do seek to obstruct them
in the whole <hi>Discharge</hi> of their
<hi>Duty,</hi> and to deprive the Church of
the <hi>Benefit</hi> of their <hi>Labours,</hi> they
would by their own <hi>Personal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
by <hi>Peculiar Endeavours</hi>
in their Congregations, among all
that hear them, and on every Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so press the present Calls of God
unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> and so promote
the Work of a <hi>visible Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as eminently to help in saving of
the Nation from <hi>approaching
Judgments,</hi> and therein, of them
also who design their <hi>Trouble;</hi>
And I doubt not, but most of them
are already engaged and forward
herein.</p>
            <p>This shall be <hi>our Testimony,</hi>
and <hi>our Peace,</hi> in whatever may
<pb facs="tcp:50059:6"/>
befall us in this World.</p>
            <p>Let us not satisfie our selves, that
our <hi>Congregations</hi> are in so good a
Posture, as that they may continue
for our Lives; and so be like <hi>ill
Tenants,</hi> who care not if their
<hi>Houses</hi> fall upon the <hi>Expiration</hi> of
the Term of their <hi>Interest</hi> in them.
That <hi>Reparation</hi> is required of us,
which may make them serve for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Generations.</p>
            <p>And when any Church is so in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant
of its own Decays, as to be
<hi>negligent</hi> of Endeavours for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
Reformation,</hi> if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while, any will deliver their
own Souls, it must be by a Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from them that <hi>hate to be
Reformed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a fond Imagination, that
<pb facs="tcp:50059:6"/>
Churches may render their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
useless and dangerous, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Heresie, Tyranny,</hi> and
<hi>False Worship;</hi> an <hi>Evil, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Corrupt Conversation</hi> in the
Generality of their Members, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Doctrine of the Gospel,
not <hi>opposed</hi> and <hi>contradicted,</hi>
by a constant Endeavour for <hi>sincere
Reformation,</hi> is no less <hi>ruinous</hi>
unto the <hi>Being</hi> of Churches, than
any of these other Evils.</p>
            <p>On these and such like Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I was not willing that this <hi>plain
discourse</hi> should be exposed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view; hoping that it might stir
up others of <hi>greater Abilities</hi> and
<hi>Opportunities,</hi> more effectually to
pursue the same Design, I do not
think it needful to make any Apology
<pb facs="tcp:50059:7"/>
for the <hi>Plainness</hi> both of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Stile</hi> in this small Treatise.</p>
            <p>The least Endeavour to attire a
Discourse of this Nature, with the
Ornaments of <hi>Speech</hi> or <hi>Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi>
is even ridiculous; it is more
fit to bear the Furrows of Sighs and
and Tears, than to be smoothed and
flourished with the Oyly Colours of
Elegance and Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>And as for the obvious Plainness
of the Matter contained in it, it is
suited, as I Judge, unto them whose
Good is principally designed therein.
Plain men have sinned as well as
others, though it may be, not unto so
high a degree, nor in such an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of Excess. However, on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Considerations they are likely first
to suffer, unless <hi>impendent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50059:7"/>
are diverted by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do but a little plead with every
man for himself, and in his own
Cause. Neither however wise or
learned men may be, is it meet in
this Case to treat them otherwise.
It is to no purpose to make a fine
Speech unto such as are falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Lethargy; nor to discourse
learnedly of the Art of Navigation,
unto them that are ready to perish in
a Storm; they must be plain Words
and plain Things that are forcible in
this Case. And these by whom they
are despised, from any Principle of
Self-Elation, give but an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Indication of what will be
the Issue of their Dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50059:8"/>
Let therefore the Reader but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
excuse, and pass by the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which he will be put unto by the
frequent Mistakes of the Press, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Mis-pointings, rendring the
Sence sometimes obscure and unobvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and I have on the behalf of the
Treatise it self, no more to desire of
his forbearance.</p>

Dispensations of his Providence; for
they are instructive warnings, and of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50059:9"/>
great importance in his Government of
the World. In them the <hi>Voice of the Lord
crieth unto the City, and the man of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
shall see his Name.</hi> And there is a
Mark left on them, as profligate Persons,
who will <hi>not see when his Hand is so lifted
up.</hi> An Example of this Wisdom is given
us here in our Blessed Saviour; who on
the Report that was made unto him of
some severe <hi>Providential Accidents,</hi> then
newly fallen out, gives an <hi>Exposition</hi> of
the Mind of God in them, with an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi>
of them, unto the present Duty
of them that heard him, and <hi>Ours</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</p>
            <p>Some things may be observed in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
to give Light into the <hi>Context,</hi>
and the Design of our Saviour in this holy
Discourse.</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>Time</hi> when the Things mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
did fall out, and wherein our Saviour
passed this judgement on them.</p>
            <p>1. It was a Time of <hi>great Sin;</hi> of
the abounding of all sorts of Sins: The
<hi>Nation</hi> as such, in its Rulers and Rule;
the <hi>Church</hi> as such, in its Officers, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and VVorship; and the Generality of
the <hi>People,</hi> in their Personal Capacities,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50059:9"/>
were all overwhelmed in provoking Sins,
<hi>Hypocrisie, Oppression, Cruelty, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Vncleanness, Persecution, Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi>
and <hi>Security,</hi> all proceeding from
Unbelief, had filled the Land, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
it. We have a sufficient Account
of this State of things in the <hi>Story of the
Gospel;</hi> so as that it needs no other
Confirmation. Yea, so wicked were
the <hi>People,</hi> and so corrupt the <hi>Church-State,</hi>
and so impenitent were the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of them therein, that it suited
the Rightousness and Holiness of God,
to revenge on that Generation, not only
their own Sins, but the Sins also of all
wicked persecutors from the Foundation
of the World; a thing which he doth
not do but on high Provocations; <hi>Luke
11. 50. 51. That the Blood of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
which was shed from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World, may be required of this
Generation; from the Blood of</hi> Abel, <hi>unto
the Blood of</hi> Zacharias, <hi>which perished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Altar and the Temple: Verily I
say unto you, it shall be required of this
Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is in this <hi>Commination</hi> an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Severity, beyond the Rule
established, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. There God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
That as he is <hi>a jealous God,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50059:10"/>
Title he assumes to himself, with respect
unto the highest Provocations, that he
<hi>will visit the Iniquity of the Fathers on
the Children to the third and fourth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of them that hate him.</hi> But here
the Vengeance and Punishment due unto
the Sins of <hi>an hundred Generations,</hi> is
threatned to be inflicted on that which was
present.</p>
            <p>Something in our passage may be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the Vindication of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
herein, seeing we may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in that <hi>Divine Commination</hi> than
the most are aware.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Case</hi> here is <hi>particular.</hi> That
in the Commandmont respects the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Case</hi> of all <hi>false Worshippers,</hi> and
their Posterity; but this respects <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
unto Blood and Death</hi> of the true
Worshippers of God. Now though God
be very much provoked with the Sins of
<hi>false Worshippers,</hi> yet he can either bear
with them, or pass over their Sins with
lesser Punishments, or at least for a long
season; but when they come to <hi>Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Blood</hi> of them who worship him
in Spirit and in Truth, in his appointed
season he will not spare them; their own,
and the Iniquities of their Predecessors,
shall be avenged on them which will be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50059:10"/>
the end of the <hi>Antichristian Church-State,</hi>
after all its present Triumph.</p>
            <p>2. All those who from the beginning of
the World suffered unto Blood, on the
account of Religion, suffered <hi>in the Cause
of Christ,</hi> for their Faith in him, and
Confession of him, namely, as he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
unto the Church. Unto him and
his Office did <hi>Abel, by Faith,</hi> bear Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in the Bloody Sacrifice that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
So it is said that <hi>Moses,</hi> in his
danger for killing the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> hare the
<hi>Reproach of Christ,</hi> because he did it in
Faith of the Promised Seed, which was
<hi>Christ.</hi> They were therefore all slain in
the Cause of Christ: And whereas <hi>this
Generation</hi> was to <hi>slay Christ</hi> himself, and
did so, they did therein approve of, and
justifie <hi>all the Blood</hi> that was shed in the
same Cause from the Foundation of the
World; and made themselves justly lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto the Punishment due unto it.
Hence our Saviour tels them. <hi>Matth. 23.
35.</hi> That <hi>They,</hi> the Men of that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>slew Zechariah,</hi> who was actually
slain many hundred years before.</p>
            <p>3. Our Blessed Saviour mentions <hi>Abel,</hi>
and <hi>Zechariah</hi> Particularly. This <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi>
called the son of <hi>Barachias,</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the <hi>Zechariah</hi> mentioned 2 <hi>Chr.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50059:11"/>
24. 20, 21, 22. For concerning those two
alone, it is observed, That the one <hi>dead,</hi>
and the other <hi>dying,</hi> cryed for Vengeance.
So God testifieth of the Blood of <hi>Abel,
Gen.</hi> 4. 10. And <hi>Zechariah</hi> when he died,
said, <hi>The Lord look upon it, and require it.</hi>
Hence the Apostle affirms, That <hi>Abel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead, yet speaks,</hi> Heb 11. 4. that is,
his Blood did so, it did so then, and it
spake <hi>for Vengance,</hi> as he intimates, <hi>Ch.</hi>
12, 24. It did so before and until the
Destruction of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> For in the
Rejection and absolute Destruction of that
<hi>Apostatized Church</hi> and People, the Blood
of all that suffered under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was expiated; <hi>Abel's</hi> Blood cries
no more; nor doth God look any more
on the Blood of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> to require
it.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>same Voice</hi> and Cry is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by another sort of Men; namely,
those who have suffered in the <hi>Cause of
Christ,</hi> since his Coming, according to the
Promise, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9. 10. And this <hi>Cry</hi> shall
be continued until the appointed Time
doth come for the utter Destruction of
the <hi>Antichristian apostatized Church-State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. When a <hi>Sinfull Church or people</hi> have
passed the utmost Bounds of Divine Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50059:11"/>
and Forbearance, they shall fall into
such <hi>abominable crying Sins</hi> and Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as shall render the utmost Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
beneath their Deserts. So <hi>Josephus</hi>
affirms of this Generation, after they had
rejected and slain the Lord Christ, that
they fell into such an Hell of provoking
Abominations, that <hi>if the</hi> Romans <hi>had
not come and destroyed them, God would
have sent Fire and Brimstone upon them from
Heaven, as he did on</hi> Sodom.</p>
            <p>And we may by the way, observe from
hence.</p>
            <p>It is a dangerous thing to live in the times
of declining Churches, when they are hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
unto their fatal Period in Judgements;
<hi>such as will inevitably befall them all and
every one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is so, for these three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</p>
            <p>1. Because such Times are <hi>perillous</hi>
through Temptations from the abounding
of <hi>the Lusts of Men,</hi> in all Uncleanness
and Wickedness. So the Apostle states it,
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If any think they
are free from Danger, because as yet they
feel no Evil, whilst <hi>the Lusts of Men</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Christian Religion, visibly and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50059:12"/>
abound and rage in the World, they
will be mistaken.</p>
            <p>2. Though Destruction do not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
befall them, yet when they have
passed the time of Divine Patience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
their <hi>Reformation;</hi> they shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
themselves into <hi>Bloody Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
as did the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Judgment shall at length overtake
them, and God will revenge on them the
Sins and Provocations, especially the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
and Blood</hi> of them that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and lead them into their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.
So when he shall come to destroy
<hi>Mystical Babylon,</hi> or the Antichristian
Church-State, it is said, that <hi>in her was
found the Blood of the Prophets, and of
Saints, and of all that were slain upon the
Earth,</hi> Rev. 18. 24. Even the Blood of
Saints, that was shed by <hi>Pagan-Rome,</hi> shall
be avenged on <hi>Antichristian Rome,</hi> after
she hath espoused the Cause, and walked
in the way of the other, justifying in her
own Practice, what they had done,</p>
            <p>II. It was a <hi>Time wherein Judgments
were near approaching;</hi> so our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
affirms it to have beeen, Luke 19.
42, 43, 44. <hi>Hadst thou known in this thy Day,</hi>
They had now but a <hi>Day,</hi> and that now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50059:12"/>
almost ready to expire, though they saw
it not,) nor would beleive it. But the <hi>day
of their desolation</hi> approached continually,
and when the Apostle wrote his Epistle to
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was making its entrance
upon them <hi>Chap. 10. 25. ye see the day
approaching,</hi> And we may hence learn That,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the approaching of desolating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on a sinfull provoking Church or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God is pleased to give previous Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his displeasure,</hi> as well in the works
of Providence, as by the Rule of his
Word; such were those here so interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our Saviour in such a Season.</p>
            <p>This, I say, is the ordinary process of
Divine Providence; and it may be no
Nation, <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi> ever utterly
perished without <hi>Divine Warnings</hi> of their
approaching desolation: some indeed
seem to be taken away with a sudden sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal,
as God threatneth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 9,
10, 11.</p>
            <p>But this is from their own security, and
not for want of Warnings; so the <hi>Old
World</hi> before the Flood, had warnings
sufficient of their Destruction, by the
Preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the building of
the <hi>Ark,</hi> by which he <hi>condemned the
World,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. or left them unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
to divine Vengeance. Yet they took
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50059:13"/>
no notice of these things, but were supri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the Flood, as if they had never
heard or seen any thing that should give
them warning of it, as our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 38, 39. and when the
time comes of the destruction of <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal-Babylon,</hi>
she shall say in that <hi>very day</hi>
wherein her Judgements come upon her, <hi>I
sit as a Queen, and shall see no sorrow;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all her warnings in the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out of the <hi>Vials</hi> of previous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>2. It is the height of security in such a
time and season, either to neglect the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of extraordinary Providences, or
to miss-interpret them as unto any thing, but
Tokens of approaching Judgements, if not
prevented.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be questioned herein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Arraignment of the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
and Application that he
makes of these <hi>Accidents.</hi> No doubt but
they were neglected and despised by the
<hi>most,</hi> as common things; to take any great
notice of such Occurrences, is esteemed
<hi>Pusillanimity</hi> or Superstition. So it is by
many at this day, wherein all things, as
we shall see afterwards, are filled with <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of divine displeasure:</hi> But things will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50059:13"/>
come shortly unto another account; in the
mean time it is safe to follow this <hi>Divine
Example,</hi> so as to find out sacred Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in such Providential Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Providential Accidents</hi> spoken
of, are two, and of two sorts.</p>
            <p>1. The first was that wherein <hi>the bloody
Cruelty of men</hi> had an hand. The <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
whose blood <hi>Pilate had mingled with
their sacrifices.</hi> When this was done, on
what occasion, and what was the number
of the Persons so slain, the Scripture is
silent. However it is certain that it was
done at <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> for Sacrifices might not
be offered any where else. Thither came
the <hi>Galileans</hi> with their Sacrifices; that
is either the <hi>Beasts</hi> which they brought to
the Preists to offer for them; for they
might not offer Sacrifices themselves, or
the <hi>Paschal Lamb,</hi> which they might slay
themselves.</p>
            <p>Whil'st they were ingaged in this work
<hi>Pilate</hi> the <hi>bloody Roman Governour,</hi> on
what occasion or provocation is unknown,
came upon them, and slew them in a <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
manner,</hi> intimated in that Expression,
that <hi>he mingled their Blood with their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>
And this Providence is the more
remarkable, in that it fell out whil'st they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50059:14"/>
were ingaged in their Sacred Worship;
which carries an Indication of Divine Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.
And it may be there was, as it is
in the ruine of Mankind every day, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
taken for it, from the difference that
was between two wicked Governours, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
and <hi>Herod,</hi> unto whose Jurisdiction
these <hi>Galileans</hi> did belong, in whose blood
<hi>Pilate</hi> thought to revenge himself on his
Enemy. However they both combin'd
at last in the killing of Christ, as others
use to do in the World; and so made
themselves Freinds, leaving their Example
to their Successors.</p>
            <p>2. The other was a <hi>meer Effect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, the death of eighteen men</hi>
by the fall of a Tower in <hi>Siloam;</hi> that is
a place of <hi>Waters,</hi> and a running stream
in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it self. And our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ declares herein, not only that
all such Accidents are disposed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, but that he <hi>speaks in
them</hi> for our Instruction.</p>
            <p>Both these, as they were <hi>Warnings,</hi> as
we shall see, so they were <hi>Figures</hi> of the
approaching destruction of the City and
People: for that in the first place is the
perishing here intended, as is manifest in
the ensuing <hi>Parable,</hi> wherein the Church-State
of the <hi>Jews is</hi> compared unto a <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50059:14"/>
Fig-tree,</hi> which was to be cut down
and destroyed. And accordingly that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
did befall them, partly by the
<hi>bloody Cruelty of the Romans,</hi> and partly by
the fall and ruine of the <hi>Temple,</hi> Towers,
and Walls of the City, both included in
the VVord, <hi>likewise; ye shall likewise perish,</hi>
or in like manner. But although they
were of various kinds, and men might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the consideration of them on several
pretences; the one being nothing but the
<hi>Tyrannical Fury of Pilate,</hi> the other only
a somewhat <hi>unusual Accident,</hi> yet our
Lord Jesus Christ finds out the hand and
Councel of God in them both, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the same Language to be spoken in
them both. Signs of the same event are
<hi>doubled</hi> to shew the certainty of it, like
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dreams.</p>
            <p>And we may observe; That</p>
            <p>1. All sorts of unusual Accidents, or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Providence in a season of Sin and
approaching Judgements, are of the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
and ought to have the same Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
            <p>So is the same Application made
of both these different <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Warnings</hi>
by our Saviour; they have, saith he; the
same Language, the same Signification.
There was nothing at this time more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50059:15"/>
the Jews unto their utter ruine, than
the <hi>false Application</hi> they made of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Signs</hi> and Warnings which were all
multiplyed among them, as <hi>boding</hi> their
good and deliverance, when they were all
Tokens of their approaching ruine. For
when such things are rejected as <hi>Warnings</hi>
calling to Repentance and Reformation,
as they were by them on a presumption
that they were Signs of Gods appearance
on their behalf, they became to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but certain <hi>Forcrunners</hi> of greater
Judgements, and infallible Tokens of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
and so they will be to them
likewise by whom they are yet despised.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>God is pleased sometimes to
give warnings of approaching Judgements, not
only as unto the matter of them, that they
shall be accompanied with severity; but also
as unto the especial nature and manner of
them;</hi> so was it with these two Signs of
<hi>Blood</hi> by the Sword, and <hi>Death</hi> by the fall
of the Tower, representing as in a Glass,
that common calamity which was to befall
the City and Nation. And I pray God
that the prodigious Appearance of <hi>fiery-Meteors,</hi>
like Swords, Armies, and Armes,
with other things of the like nature may
not be sent to point out the very <hi>kind</hi> and
<hi>nature</hi> of the Judgments which are coming
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50059:15"/>
on <hi>England</hi> if not diverted; for as unto
these <hi>Signs,</hi> not only the Scripture, but
all <hi>Heathen-Stories,</hi> are filled with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them. Before the approach of
desolating Judgements, Nature the common
Parent of Mankind, did always put forth
it self <hi>in irregular, unusual Actings,</hi> in fiery-Meteors,
Comets, Earthquakes, strange
Appearances in the Air, Voices heard, and
the like.</p>
            <p>The brute Elements tremble at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of God in his Judgement against
the Inhabitants of the Earth; so the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
expresseth it, <hi>Hab. 3. 10. The
Mountains saw the and they trembled, the
overflowings of thee Water passed by, the
deep uttered his voice, and lift up his hand
on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are as it were cast into a posture
of trembling and Supplication. And
<hi>Aschylus</hi> an Heathen Poet in <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>

                     </gap>.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>When the dreadfull Eye of God (<hi>in his
Providence</hi>) is lifted up, all things tremble
before it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50059:16"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Interpretation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
made of these severe Accidents
by our Saviour in his divine VVisdom, we
may observe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1.</hi> Especial Judgments in such a season,
befalling in any, do not prove an especial Guilt,
or provocation in them.</p>
            <p>This our Saviour expresly denies, and
that with respect unto both the Instances
insisted on, and that distinctly, verse 2.
v. 4. I do not hence absolutely establish
a general Rule as unto all Times and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
For.</p>
            <p>1. The observation is here confined
and limited, unto such a Season as that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consideration; namely a time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Sins in the generality of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and approaching Judgments. In
such a season no assignation of especial
Guilt ought to be made on especial Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
Sufferings.</p>
            <p>2. Some Persons may be guilty of such
<hi>daring presumptous Sins,</hi> that if they are
overtaken with especial Judgements in this
VVorld, it is the height of Impiety not to
own the especial revenging hand of God,
in their destruction; such was the Death
of <hi>Herod,</hi> Acts 12, 22, 23.</p>

2. <hi>Judgments on private men in such a
season are warnings to the publick.</hi> This is
intimated by our Saviour in this place;
Namely, that God uses a Soveraignty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by singling out whom he pleaseth to
make them Examples unto others; this
saith he, was the sole reason, as far as
you are concerned to judge or know, why
God brought these sore destructions upon
them; namely, that by these Warnings
he might call you to Repentance. Yet I
judge God doth not ordinarily exercise his
Soveraignty in this kind, unless it be when
<hi>all</hi> have deserved to be destroyed; and
then, as in the Sedition and Mutiny of
<hi>Military Legions,</hi> they decimated them,
or slew some for an example and terrour
unto others; so God calls out of a guilty
multitude whom he pleaseth, to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Instances of approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Those who first fall under Judgments,
are not always the worst that Judgments
shall befall, nor are the first Judgments usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the most severe;</hi> so it is plain in these
Instances. And because we have Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this nature amongst us, we should
consider how to make a right Judgment
concerning them; and these three things
we may safely determine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50059:17"/>
1. That those who suffered
were Sinners also,<note place="margin">These things were spoken on the burning of several Persons to death, in one of the late Fires in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </note> though
they were not so only, or in
an especial manner. This is
necessary unto the vindication
of the Justice of God.</p>
            <p>2. That he who hath made
them warnings unto us, might
have made us <hi>warnings</hi> unto them; herein
his Soveraignty and Mercy towards us,
who escape, is manifest.</p>
            <p>3. That we also have an hand in that
<hi>Guilt,</hi> forerunning such Providences so far
as there is any thing poenal in them. For
such private previous Judgments are the
effect of <hi>publick Provocations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here is a sure Rule, given us, of
the Interpretation of <hi>severe Providences</hi>
in such a season, as that here intended.
Such I mean as we have had amongst us,
in <hi>Plague,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> and such
as we have the Signs and Tokens of at this
time in Heaven and Earth. For three
things we are here taught safely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
concerning them,</p>
            <p>1. That they are <hi>warnings</hi> from God.
This our Saviour plainly declares in the
Interpretation and Application of these
two Instances.</p>
            <p>2. That their Voice and Language is a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50059:17"/>
Call to <hi>Repentance and Reformation: Except
ye repent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. VVhen they are neglected as <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
calling to Repentance, they change
their nature, and become certain <hi>Signs</hi> of
approaching Destruction. And in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of these Rules of Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Providential Severities, given us by
our Saviour, we may be preserved from
the excesses of neglecting on the one hand,
what is contained in them; and of rash
judging of Men or Causes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>These things being premised for the
opening of the words, the Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are instructed by them, appears to
be this.</p>
            <p>When a Land, a Nation, a City, a
Church, is filled with sin, so as that God
gives them Warnings or Indications of his
displeasure by previous Judgments; or other
extraordinary Signs, if they are not as
Warnings complyed withal by Repentance
and Reformation, they are Tokens of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Judgments, that shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,</p>
            <p>This is that sacred Truth which our
Lord Jesus Christ doth here recommend
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50059:18"/>
to our Observation. It is the <hi>great Rule of
Divine Providence,</hi> with the <hi>especial Seal</hi>
of our Lord Christ annexed to it; <hi>I tell
you Nay but unless you repent, you shall all
likewise perish.</hi> When <hi>Warnings</hi> for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
are not received, they are To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of Destruction. This is a Truth
which none almost deny, and none almost
believe. Had it been believed, many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solating
Judgments in former Ages had
been prevented, Nations and Cities
should have abode in Prosperity, which
are now sunk into Ruine, yea, into Hell.
See <hi>Luke 19. 41, 42, 43, 44. Mat.</hi> 11.
23. And were it believed in the days
wherein we live, it would be the means of
saving a <hi>poor Nation</hi> from, otherwise inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ruine. The State is so with us, that
<hi>unless we repent, we shall perish.</hi> I do not
prescribe unto the Soveraignty of God in
his Providential Administrations. He
can if he please, suffer all his Warnings
to be despised, all his <hi>Calls</hi> neglected, yea
scoffed at, and yet exercise <hi>Forbearance</hi>
toward us, as unto a speedy execution of
Judgment. But wo unto them with
whom he so deals; for it hath only this
end, that they may have a space to fill up
the measure of their Iniquities, and so be
sitted for eternal Destruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50059:18"/>
There is a threefold Issue and event of
the State we have described.</p>
            <p>1. When a <hi>sinfull Church or Nation</hi> so
atend unto Gods Warnings in <hi>previous
Judgments,</hi> and other Signs of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as to comply with them by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Reformation. This is a blessed
Issue which will certainly divert all impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
judgments; as shall be afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>2. When by reason of the neglect of
them, and want of complyance with them,
God doth bring distress and calamities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a People in general. This is a sad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
But however, under it God doth often
preserve a Seed and Remnant, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought through the Fire, and thereby
purged and purified, though but as a poor
and afflicted People, yet they shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
as a Seed, and Reserve for a better
State of the Church, see <hi>Zach. 13. 8, 9.
Isai. 6. 11. 12, 13. Chap. 14. 6. Chap. 24.
13. Zeph. 3. 12. Ezek</hi> 5. 2, 12.</p>
            <p>3. When God utterly forsakes a People,
will regard them no more; but give them
up unto <hi>Idolatry, False-Worship,</hi> and all
sorts of Wickedness. VVhen he says,
<hi>Why should you be stricken any more, you will
revolt more and more.</hi> This is the sorest
of Judgments. VVo unto them saith the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50059:19"/>
Lord, <hi>when I depart from them,</hi> Hosea, 9.
12. Of such a People their shall be neither
Hope nor Remnant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 11. VVho
would not rather see a Nation suffering
under some Judgments as the Effects of
God's displeasure, for the neglect of his
warnings, whereby it may be purged and
purified, and restored, than to be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Idolatry</hi> and all manner of VVickedness
for ever.</p>
            <p>But the way is here proposed for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance
of these Evils. And these things
will be more fully spoken unto after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> shall first give some Evidences of the
Truth laid down, and then the reason of
it, which will make way for what <hi>I</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
intend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> shall not insist on the <hi>especial kind</hi> of
Warnings or Signs here mentioned, but
only on the <hi>general nature</hi> of divine
Warnings by the Word or otherwise, in
such a season, as wherein an abounding of
Sin is accompanied with great evidences
of approaching Judgments.</p>
            <p>1. According unto this rule was the
dealing of God with the <hi>Old World,</hi> which
is set forth unto us for an Example; see
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. with 2. 5.</p>
            <p>The men of the <hi>Old World</hi> were a sinful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50059:19"/>
provoking Generation. God gave them
warning of his displeasure by the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Noah,</hi> and other ways; during his
<hi>Ministry,</hi> the long suffering of God wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi>
For this was the end both of the Season,
and of the Ministry granted unto them
therein: But when it was not complyed
withal, he brought <hi>the Flood on those ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. So he dealt with the <hi>Church under
the Old-Testament.</hi> A Summary account
is given of it; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16, 17.
After a contempt of all Gods previous
warnings, with a neglect of Repentance
and Reformation, the time came when
there was <hi>no remedy,</hi> but the City and
Temple must be destroyed, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be partly slain, and partly carried into
Captivity. Accordingly there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule established for all times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>Prov,</hi> 29. 1.</p>
            <p>3. Neither have his dealings been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
with <hi>the Churches of the New
Testament.</hi> All those of the first Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have been ruined and destroyed by
the Sword of God's displeasure, for impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency
under divine Calls and Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50059:20"/>
4. God gave an eminent instance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the <hi>Ministry of Jeremiah</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
he gives him the Law of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
<hi>Chap. 18, 7, 8. At what Instant I
shall speak concerning a Nation, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Kingdom, to plùck up, and to pull
down, and to destroy it, if that Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom I have pronounced, turn from
their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I
thought to do unto them.</hi> Here is the whole
of the Truth laid down represented unto
us. The Nation and Kingdom especially
intended, was that of the people and
Church of the Jews. Concerning them
it is supposed, that they were evil, that
Sin abounded amongst them, In this State
God gave them warning by the <hi>Ministry
of Jeremiah</hi> as he did otherwise also.
The voice of these warnings was that
they should repent them of their Evil, and
reform their ways. On a supposition
whereof he promises to remove the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which they had deserved, and which
were impendent over them: upon their
failure herein, he declares that fearfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
should befall them, as it did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<hi>verse</hi> 16, 17. According to this
Rule the Prophet persisted in his Ministry
The Sum of his Sermon? was this; <hi>It is
a time of great Sin and Provocation, these
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50059:20"/>
and these are your Sins; these are evident
Tokens of God's Displeasure against you,
and of the near approaching of desolating
Judgments. In this State Repent, return and
reform your ways, and you shall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
in case you do not, utter Destruction
shall come upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Princes, the Preists and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the People set themselves against him
herein and would not believe his Word.</p>
            <p>And by three things they countenanced
themselves in their Unbelief and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
that they should be delivered, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they did not <hi>repent</hi> nor <hi>reform</hi>
their VVays.</p>
            <p>First, By their <hi>Priviledges;</hi> that they
were the only Church and People of God;
who had the Temple and his VVorship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: as if he should say, <hi>The
best reformed Church in the World.</hi> This
they directly confront his Ministry withal,
<hi>Chap</hi> 7, 3, 4. They fear none of his
Threatnings, they despise his Counsel
for their Safety, approve their ways and
their doings, because they were <hi>the Church,</hi>
and had the <hi>Temple</hi> for their Security.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By their own <hi>Strengh for
War,</hi> and their Defence against all their
Enemies. They gloried in their <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
their <hi>Might,</hi> and their <hi>Riches;</hi> as he
intimateth. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50059:21"/>
Thirdly, By the Help and Aid which
they expected from others, especially
from <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And herein they thought
once that they had prevailed against him,
and utterly disprov'd his Rule of Safety by
<hi>Reformation</hi> only; for when the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>
besieged the City, by whom the Judgments
he had threaned them withal, were to be
executed, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up against them, they departed from
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> for <hi>fear of his Army. Ch.</hi> 27, 5, 11.
Hereon, no doubt, they triumphed against
him, and were satisfied that their own way
for Deliverance, was better than that
troublesome way of Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
which he prescrib'd unto
them. But he knew from whom he had
his Message, and that would be the Event
of the false Hopes and Joys which they
had entertained: So he tells them, <hi>verse
9, 10. Deceive not your selves, saying, the</hi>
Chaldeans <hi>shall surely depart from us; for
they shall not depart: For though you had
smitten the whole Army of the</hi> Chaldeans,
<hi>that fight against you, and their remained
but wounded men amongst them, yet should
they rise up every man in his Tent, and burn
this City with fire.</hi> Which accordingly
came to pass.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50059:21"/>
And so will it be with any other People,
against all Pleas and pretences to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Let the Case be stated according as it is
laid down in the Poposition, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the instance of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose a Church or People do <hi>abound
with provoking Sins;</hi> that during the time
of God's Patience towards them, and
<hi>Warning of them,</hi> there are <hi>Signs and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi>
of his <hi>Displeasure,</hi> and of impendent
Judgments; let them feed themselves so
long as they please with hopes of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Safety, unless they comply with
the Calls of God unto <hi>Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
they will fall under desolating
Judgments, or be utterly forsaken of God
for ever.</p>
            <p>The Grounds and Reasons of this Rule
and Order in Divine Dispensations, are
many, plain and obvious, which I shall
not at large insist upon.</p>
            <p>I shall only at present mention some of
them, because those of the most Evidence
and Importance will accrue afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Consideration.</p>
            <p>1. This Rule of proceeding is suited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>the Righteousness of God in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World,</hi> in the in-bred Light of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50059:22"/>
the Minds of Men. This Notion. That
<hi>Judgment or Divine Vengeance will overtake
impenitent Sinners, who have been previously
warned of their Sin,</hi> is that which we are
not taught, which we do not learn from
one another, which is not only the Voice
of Divine Revelation, but that which is
<hi>born with us,</hi> which is inseparable from
our Nature; the Light and Conviction
whereof, neither with respect unto our
selves or others, we can avoid, this is
the Voice of nature in Mankind <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sinners, incurable by Warnings, are
the proper Objects of divine Displeasure.</hi> And
the absolute impunity of such Persons,
would be a great Temptation unto Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
as the suspension of deserved Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on provoking Sinners, is with some
at this day. But ordinarily and finally
God will not act contrary unto the <hi>inbred
Notions</hi> of his Righteousness the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath implanted in the Minds of Men.
But as for the Times, Seasons and Ways
of the Execution of his Judgments, he
hath reserved them unto his own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.</p>
            <p>2. It is needfull unto the <hi>Vindication of
the Faithfulness of God in his Threatnings</hi>
given out by Divine Revelation. By this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50059:22"/>
he hath alwaies from the beginning of the
VVorld, testified unto his own Holiness
and Righteousness, whereof they are the
most proper Expressions. Those first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of them are in the <hi>Prophesie</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi>
Jude 14, 15, And they have been
since continued in all Ages. But whereas
the Wisdom of God acting in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hah been accompanied with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Forbearance, in the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of these Threatnings, there have
been, and yet are <hi>Mockers</hi> and <hi>Scoffers</hi> at
these Divine Threatnings, as though they
were a meer Noise, of no efficacy or sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.
So the Apostle declares the
Thoughts of the Minds of Men prophane
and ungodly, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. Wherefore
there is a <hi>Condecency</hi> unto the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
that God in his own Way and
Time should vindicate his Faithfulness in
all his Threatnings.</p>
            <p>3. God hereby manifests himself to be
a God hearing Prayers, regarding the
Cries of his poor and distressed VVitnesses
in the VVorld. When the VVorld abounds
in provoking Sins, especially in Blood and
Persecution there is a conjunct Crie unto
God, of those that <hi>have suffered,</hi> and
those that do suffer, in Heaven and Earth,
for Vengeance on obstinate impenitent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50059:23"/>
Sinners. See <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 7, 8. with <hi>Rev. 6.
10.</hi> The <hi>Voices</hi> of all those, <hi>I</hi> say, who
have suffered unto Death in foregoing
Ages, for the Testimony of Jesus, and
are now in Heaven, in a state of Expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of compleat Glory, with all those of
them, whose Sighs and groans under their
Oppressors, do at present ascend unto the
Throne of God, have the sence in them
by Divine Interpretation, that <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be inflicted on impenitent Sinners;</hi> as
is plainly expressed by our Saviour in that
Place of the Gospel, affirming that he
will avenge his Elect speedily who cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him Day and night. Herein God will
vindicate his Glory, as the God that hears
Prayers.</p>
            <p>4. A sence of this Divine Truth, is a
great and effectual Means of God's Rule
in the Hearts of men in the World, setting
Bounds to their Lusts, and restraining that
superfluity of Wickedness and Villany,
which would otherwise take away the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
as to Sin, between the Earth and
Hell. If men can at any time free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Terrour and restraining
Power of this Consideration, that <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is alwaies approaching towards impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sinners,</hi> there is nothing so vile, so
prophane, so flagitious, as that they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50059:23"/>
would not wholly give up themselves unto
it <hi>Eccles. 8. 11. Because Judgment is not
speedily executed against an evil Work, the
Hearts of the Sons of Men is wholly set in
them to do evil.</hi> And God knows, that if
Impunity in this World should alwaies
accompany provoking Sinners, the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
would be too strong and powerful
for the Faith of weak Believers, which
he will therefore relieve by frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of his Severity.</p>
            <p>In a successive continuation of <hi>previous
Judgments</hi> on impenitent sinners, there is
an incontroulable Evidence given of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of that <hi>final Judgments</hi> which all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
shall be called unto. So the Apostle
proves it, and intimates that it is a foolish
thing, the effect of obstinacy in Sin, if men
do not learn the certain Determination
and Approach of the Eternal Judgment,
from the <hi>Drowning</hi> of the <hi>Old World,</hi> the
<hi>Conflagration of Sodom,</hi> with the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Divine Severity, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>My present Enquiry hereon, is, what is
our own Concernment in these things, what
are we for our own Good to learn by the
<hi>Blessed Instruction</hi> given us by our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, in his Interpretation of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50059:24"/>
               <hi>Providential Occurrences</hi> mentioned in the
Text.</p>
            <p>And this I shall manifest by an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Enquiry into the things ensuing.</p>
            <p>1. When doth a Church, a Nation, a People,
or City so abound in Sin, as to be immediately
&amp; directly concerned in his Divine Warning,
and what in particular is the case of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein we live, and our own therein?</p>
            <p>2. Of what sort are those desolating
Judgments which in one way &amp; sence or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are impendent with respect unto such a
Church or Nation, and consequently unto our
selves at this season?</p>
            <p>3. What warnings, Calls and Indications
of Divine Displeasures, and the Approach
of calamitous distresses doth God usually
grant, and what he hath given, and is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto us at present?</p>
            <p>4. What is the Equity, and wherein it doth
consist of thy Divine Constitution here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by our Blessed Saviour, that in such a
Case Repentance and Reformation, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else shall save and Deliver a Church,
a People, a Nation from Ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50059:24"/>
5. Whereas this Rule is so holy, just and
equal, whence is it that all sorts of Men
are so unwilling to comply with it, even in
the utmost Extremity, when all other Hopes
do fail and perish; and whence is it so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our selves at this Day?</p>
            <p>6. What is required unto that Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may save any Nation, this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live, from desolating Calamities, when
they are deserved?</p>
            <p>7. From what Causes at present such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
may be expected, and by what
means it may be begun and accomplished, so as
to prevent our utter Ruine.</p>
            <p>8. What is the Duty, what ought to be
the frame of Mind in true Believers, what
their Walk and Work in such a season;
that in case all Means of Delivery do fail
they may be found of Christ in Peace at his
Coming; for it is but yet a little while, and
he that shall come, will come, and will not
tarry.</p>
            <p>These things are necessary to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into, that we may help to beat out the
Paths of Truth and Peace, the only ways
that lead unto our Deliverance. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50059:25"/>
is filled with Complaints and Fears,
<hi>mutual Charges</hi> on one party and another,
as unto the Causes of our present Troubles
and approaching dangers; various designs
and contrivances, with vain hopes and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
desires of this or that way or
means of help and deliverance; cruel
Hatreds and Animosities on differences in
Religion, designing no less than the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of all that is Good therein, do
abound in it, by all means rending it self
in peices, wearying it self in <hi>the largeness
of its ways,</hi> and yet says not there is no
hope. But for the most part, the <hi>true
Causes</hi> of all our Troubles and Dangers,
with the <hi>only Remedy</hi> of them, are utterly
neglected. The World is filled, yea, the
better sort of men in it, with other designs,
other discourses; we here rarely of these
things from the Pulpits (which are filled
with Animosities about Petty Interests,
and private difference in the Approaches
of publick ruine) nor in the Council of
those who pretend to more VVisdom.
Some shall think they shall do great things
their VVisdom and Counsel; some by
their Authority and Power, some by their
Number, some by owning the best cause as
they suppose, and with many such like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are the Minds of men possessed.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50059:25"/>
But the truth is, the Land abounds in Sin,
God is angry, and risen out of his holy
place, Judgment lyes at the Door, and in
vain shall we seek for remedy or healing,
any other way than that purposed. This
therefore we shall enquire into.</p>
            <p>The first thing supposed in the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before laid down, was taken from the
<hi>Circumstance of the time</hi> wherein, and with
reference whereunto our Lord Jesus
Christ delivered the Rule <hi>of the necessity of
Repentance and Reformation, unto an escape
from total Destruction;</hi> and this was a
time when <hi>Sin greatly abounded in the
Church an Nation.</hi> And this Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the foundation of the truth of the
whole Assertion; for in other Cases it
may not always hold. Our first enquiry
therefore must be,</p>
            <p>When a People or Nation is so filled with
Sin, or when doth Sin so abound among them,
as in conjunction with the things afterwards
to be insisted on, to render their Salvation or
Deliverance impossible without Repentance
and Reformation? <hi>And it doth so;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. When <hi>all sorts of Sin abound in it.</hi>
I do not judge that every particular Sin, or
kind of sinning that may be named, or
may not be named, is required hereunto;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50059:26"/>
nor is it so, that there should be the same
outrage in publick Sins; for instance, in
Blood and Oppression, as there hath been
at some times, and in some places of the
World, the dark places of the Earth being
silled with Habitations of Cruelty; nor; is
it so, that Sin doth reign at that height,
and rage at that rate, as it did <hi>before the
Flood,</hi> or in <hi>Sodom,</hi> or before the final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or as it doth in
the <hi>Kingdom of Antichrist;</hi> for in that
case there is no room or place either for
Repentance or Reformation; God hides
from them the things that concern their
peace, that they may be utterly and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably
destroyed. But this I will grant
is required hereunto; namely, that <hi>no
known Sin</hi> that is commonly passant in the
World, can be exempted from having a
place in the publick Guilt of such a Church
or Nation. If any such Sin be committed in
the <hi>Roll of the Indictment,</hi> peace may yet
dwell in the Land. It would be too long,
and not to my purpose, to draw up a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Sins, from the highest <hi>Atheism</hi>
through the vilest <hi>uncleaness,</hi> unto the
lowest <hi>Oppression,</hi> that are found amongst
us. I shall only say on the other hand, that
I know <hi>no provoking sin</hi> condemned as such,
in the Book of God, whereof instances
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50059:26"/>
may not be found in this Nation. Who
dares make this a plea with God for it,
namely, that <hi>yet it is free and innocent from
such and such provoking Sins? Produce your
Cause sayeth the Lord, bring forth your strong
Reasons, sayeth the King of Jacob;</hi> let us
stand up if we can, and plead for our selves
herein. But the only way whereby we
may come to plead with God in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is fully described, <hi>Isai.</hi> 15, 16, 17,
18, 19. 20. It must be Repentance and
Reformation, laying a ground for plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and arguing with God for pardon and
Mercy, that must save this Nation if it be
saved, and not a plea for exemption from
Judgments on the account of our Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
This is that which of all things God
most abhorred in the People of old, and
which all the Prophets testifyed against in
them.</p>
            <p>But yet to speak somewhat more Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
unto the first part of the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in reference unto our selves.</p>
            <p>There are four Sins, or four sorts of Sins,
or ways in sinning, which unless God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
will be the ruine of this Nation.</p>
            <p>1. The first is <hi>Atheism,</hi> an abomination
that these parts of the World were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50059:27"/>
with all untill these latter Ages. I
do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not speak concerning <hi>Speculative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
Opinionative Atheism,</hi> in them that deny
the Being of God, or which is all one, his
righteous Government of the World; for
it will not avail any man to beleive that
God is, unless withal he believe that he is
the Rewarder of them that diligently seek
him. Yet of this sort it is to be feared,
that there, are many amongst us, yea some
that make great <hi>Advantages of Religion,</hi> do
live and talk as if they esteemed it all a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But I speak of that which is called
<hi>Practical Atheism,</hi> when men live and act
as if they were influenced by prevalent
thoughts, that <hi>there is no God:</hi> such the
Nation is replenished withal, and it exerts
it self especially two ways.</p>
            <p>1. In <hi>Cursed Oaths</hi> and blasphemous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations,
whereby the highest contempt
is cast on the Divine Name and Being.
The most <hi>excellent Thuanus,</hi> giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Parisian Massacre,</hi> with the
horrible Desolations that ensued thereon,
ascribes it in the first place unto the <hi>Anger
of God, revenging the horrid Oaths and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Blasphemies, which from the Court,
had spread themselves over all the Nation.</hi>
Histor. Lib. 53: Nor is it otherwise among
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50059:27"/>
us at present, though not Generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all, yet amongst many, and those
unpunished.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Boldness, Confidence,</hi> and <hi>security in
sinning.</hi> Many are neither ashamed nor
afraid to act, avow, yea, and boast of the
vilest of Sins, The awe that men have of
the Knowledge, Conscience and Judgment
of others, concerning their evil and filthy
actions, is one means whereby God rules in
the VVorld for the restraint of Sin. VVhen
the yoke hereof, is utterly cast away, and
men proclaim their Sins like <hi>Sodom,</hi> it is
the height of <hi>Practical Atheism.</hi> Nor I
think did it ever more abound in any age,
than in that wherein we live.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The loss of the Power of that Religion</hi>
whose outward Form we do retain. VVe are
all <hi>Protestants,</hi> and will abide to be of the
Protestant Religion; but wherein? in the
<hi>Confession</hi> and all the Outward Forms of
the Rule and Worship of the Church. But
are men changed, renewed, converted to
God by the <hi>Doctrine of this Religion?</hi> are
they made Humble, Holy, Zealous, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in good Works by it? have they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the power of it in their own Souls
in its transforming of them into the Image
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50059:28"/>
of God? Without these things it is of
very little avail what Religion men profess.
This is that which is of evil <hi>Abode</hi> to the
Professors of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> at this
day through the World. The Glory, the
Power, the Efficacy of it, are, if not lost
and dead, yet greatly decayed; and an
outward <hi>Carcase</hi> of it, in Articles of Faith
and Forms of worship, doth only abide.
Hence have the Reformed Churches most
of them <hi>a name to live, but are dead;</hi> living
only on a traditional Knowledge, Principles
of Education, Advantages and Interest, in
all which the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> doth every
way exceed them, and will carry the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
when the Contest is reduced unto such
Principles only. And unless God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by some <hi>renewed Effusion of his Blessed
Spirit from above,</hi> to revive, and re-intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Spirit of Life, Holiness, Zeal, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Cross, Conformity unto Christ,
and Contempt of the World, in &amp; among the
Churches which profess the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
he will ere long take away the <hi>hedg
of his protecting Providence,</hi> which now for
some Ages he hath kept about them, and
leave them for a spoil unto their Enemies.
So he threatneth to do in the like case,
<hi>Isai.</hi> 5. 5, 6. such is the State described,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:50059:28"/>
3. <hi>Open Contempt and Reproach of the
Spirit of God in all his Divine Operations,</hi> is
another Sin of the same dreadfull Abode.
Our Lord Jesus Christ tells us, that he
who speaks against <hi>the Holy Ghost, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this World,
neither in the World to come,</hi> Mat. 12. 32.
That is, those who persist in opposing or
reproaching the holy Ghost, and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
and Operations under the New
Testament, shall not escape vengeance and
punishment <hi>even in this World;</hi> for so it
befell that Generation unto whom he
spake. For continuing to do despight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> wrath at length
came upon them <hi>even in this World</hi> unto
the utmost, which is the sense of the place.
Now scarcely where the Name of Christ
was known, did this Iniquity more abound,
than it doth at this day amongst us, For
not only is the <hi>Divine Person</hi> of the holy
Spirit by some denied, and the substance
of the <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> of many is
to oppose all his peculiar Operations but
they are all made a Scoff, a Derision, and
a Reproach openly and on all Occasions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day. Especially as he is a Spirit of
<hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Supplication,</hi> he is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Multiplyed sober Blasphemies.
This Iniquity will be revenged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:50059:29"/>
4. <hi>The abounding of Vncleanness,</hi>
which having broken forth from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Fountain, hath overspread the Land
like a Deluge, These Sins I say among
others have such a <hi>Predominancy</hi> among us,
as to threaten perishing without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is required, <hi>that all sorts
and degrees of Persons, are concerned in the
Guilt of some of these provoking Sins.</hi> For
Destruction is threatned unto all; <hi>you
shall all likewise perish,</hi> all, not universally,
<hi>pro singulis generum,</hi> but <hi>generally, pro gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
singulorum.</hi> Therefore all must be
<hi>some way</hi> guilty of them. And this they
may be three ways.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Personally</hi> in their own Hearts, Lives
and Practices, which includes a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By not hindring</hi> and preventing these
Sins in others, so far as their duty leads,
and their power enables them unto. What
number of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> of
<hi>Parents,</hi> of <hi>Masters</hi> of Families are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
herein, is evident unto all, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Ministers,</hi> see <hi>Mal. 2, 7, 8. Jer.</hi> 23.
14, 15.</p>
            <p>3. By not mourning for what they <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50059:29"/>
help or remedy.</hi> For it is such alone
as shall be exempted from publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. And this in some measure
takes us in all. And the due Consideration
hereof, is necessary, upon a double Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>1. It is so unto the Manifestation of the
Glory of God, in publick Calamities and
Desolations; <hi>when the Sword slays suddenly,
and destroys the righteous with the wicked;</hi>
one way or other, in one degree or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we have all of us an excess unto the
Guilt of those things whereby such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are procured, Who can say he is
innocent? who can complain of his share
and interest in the Calamities that are
coming upon us? who can plead that he
ought to be exempted? There will be
at last an eternal Discrimination of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but as unto Temporal Judgments,
we must own the Righteousness of God, if
<hi>we also fall under them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, 2. It is so, for the humbling of our
Souls under a sense of Sin, which would
better become some of us, than feeding
on the <hi>Ashes of Reserves</hi> for Exemption in
the Day of Distress.</p>
            <p>Some may suppose that by reason of
their <hi>Personal Freedom</hi> from those publick
provoking Sins which abound in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50059:30"/>
that on one account or other, by one
means or other, they shall be safe, as in
some <hi>High Place.</hi> whence they may <hi>look
down</hi> and behold others in Distress and
Confusion. But it is to be feared their
Mistake will serve only to increase their
Surprizal and Sorrow.</p>
            <p>But yet farther, even the <hi>Practice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Sins,</hi> abounds among all sorts of
Persons. I do not say that all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals</hi>
amongst us, are guilty of them:
for were it so, our Case were irreparable,
like that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when there were not
ten righteous persons to be found in it,
that is, such as were free from the Guilt of
those Sins, whose Cry came up to Heaven;
for then there would be no room for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
or Reformation. But whereas
there are several sorts and degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
some high and some low, some Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and some Ruled, some Rich, and
some Poor, there is no Order, Sort, or
Degree, in Court, City, Country, Church,
or Commonwealth, that are free from
provoking Sins: <hi>Individuals</hi> of all sorts
may be so, but no entire sort is so; and
this farther entitles a Nation unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
enquired after,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is so, when</hi> the World is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50059:30"/>
fully of such Sins as are its own, as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to it; and the Churches or Professors
such as are peculiar unto them. <hi>If</hi> either <hi>of
these were free from their</hi> several Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<hi>there might be yet room for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Mercy. And these are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sins of the World are, <hi>the Lusts
of the Flesh, the Lust of the eyes,</hi> and the
<hi>Pride of Life.</hi> Sensuality, Luxury, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness
Covetousness, Ambition, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and the like, with Security. In
these things the Nation is fertil towards
its own Ruine.</p>
            <p>The Sins <hi>peculiar unto Churches</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,</hi>
are intimated by our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
in his Charge on the <hi>Asian Churches
Rev. 2, 3. Decays in Grace,</hi> Loss of Faith
and Love. Barreness in good Works,
Deadness, Formality, Coldness in profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Self-Pleasing, Pride, Hypocrisie,
Want of Zeal for God, and Delight in
him, Divisions among themselves, and
Conformity unto the VVorld. And some
of these things at present are so prevalent
among us, that they can never be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bewailed.</p>
            <p>It is no small Evidence that the Day
of the Lord is nigh at hand, because the
<hi>Virgins</hi> are all slumbring. And it is not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50059:31"/>
unlikely that <hi>Judgment will begin at the
House of God.</hi> All Flesh hath corrupted
its ways; and therefore the End of all,
as to its present Condition, is at hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is so, when the Sins of a
People are accompanied with the <hi>highest
Aggravations that they are capable of in this
World;</hi> and those arise from hence, when
they are committed against <hi>Warnings,
Mercies and Patience.</hi> These comprize
the ways and means which God in his
Goodness and Wisdom useth to reclaim
and recall men from their Sins: And by
whomsoever they are despised, <hi>they trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
up unto themselves wrath against the
Day of wrath, and the Revelation of the
righteous Judgments of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 4, 5.
What can save a People by whom the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Remedies of their Relief are despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
What Warnings and Previous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we have had in this Nation, shall
be afterwards spoken unto. That there
hath been no effect, no fruit of them, is
evident unto all. Their Language is,
<hi>Except ye repent ye shall perish.</hi> Who
hath complied with the Calls of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
What <hi>Reformation</hi> hath been enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in on this account? Have we not
turned a deaf ear to all the Calls of God?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50059:31"/>
who hath mourned, who hath trembled,
who hath sought for an Entrance into the
<hi>Chambers of Providence</hi> in the Day of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation?
By some these Warnings have
been <hi>despised</hi> and <hi>scoffed</hi> at, by some <hi>put
off unto others,</hi> as their Concernment, not
their own, by the most <hi>neglected,</hi> or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into matter of common Discourse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
laying them to heart.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Mercies,</hi> the whole <hi>Earth</hi>
hath been turned into a <hi>Stage</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of them on the Lusts of Men.
The Nation hath been soak'd with <hi>Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Mercies,</hi> enough to have made it
very fruitful unto God; but through a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
malignant Humor</hi> in the hearts of
Men, there have been truly brought forth
nothing but Pride, Vanity, Gallantry,
Luxury, and Security in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
every where. The Pestilent deceitful
Art of Sin hath turned the Means of our
Conversion unto God into instruments of
Rebellion against God. How will <hi>England</hi>
answer for abused Mercies in the Day of
Visitation? And in all these things hath
the <hi>Patience</hi> also of God been abused,
which hath been extended unto us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all thoughts and Expectations. And
yet Men of all sorts please themselves, as
if that they were over this or that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50059:32"/>
all would be well again without any
Return unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> These things render impendent
Judgments inevitable without Repentance
and Reformation, <hi>when they are committed
in a Land of Light and Knowledge.</hi> Such
the Land hath been, and wherein yet there
is any defect therein, it is a part of the Sin
and Punishment of the Nation. See <hi>Isa.</hi>
26. 10. From the Light that was in it, it
might well be esteemed a Land of Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
But how hath it been rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
hated, opposed, maligned and
persecuted in all the Fruits of it, is rather
for the sake of some to be bewailed, than
declared.</p>
            <p>And thus much may suffice to be spoken
unto the first <hi>Supposition</hi> in our Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning the Sins of a Church, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or People, which unavoidably expose
them unto desolating Judgments, when
God gives Indication of their Approach,
unless they are prevented by Repentance;
and we have seen a little, and <hi>but a little</hi>
of what is our Concernment herein.</p>
            <p>2. Our Second Enquiry is, <hi>Of what
sort those Judgments are, which in a time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50059:32"/>
of great provocation, are to be looked on as
impendent, and ready to seize on us.</hi> And
they are of three sorts.</p>
            <p>1. Such as are <hi>Absolute, Decretory,</hi> and
<hi>Vniversal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is mention in the Scripture of
Judgments <hi>Threatned,</hi> which God hath as
it were <hi>repented him of,</hi> and changed the
Actings of his Providence, that they should
not be inflicted. See <hi>Amos</hi> 7, 3, 6. And
there are Judgments threatned, which
have been diverted by the <hi>Repentance of
Men;</hi> as it was in the Case of <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
But in this case, neither <hi>will God repent,</hi>
nor <hi>shall man repent;</hi> but those judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shall be universal and unavoidable:
And of this sort we have three Instances
recorded in Scripture, two are past, and
one is yet for to come.</p>
            <p>1. The first is that of <hi>the Old World:</hi>
It is said. that upon their Provocations,
<hi>God repented him that he had made Man,</hi> on
the Earth; that is, he would deal with
him as if he had done so, which must be
by an universal Destruction. He <hi>would
not repent</hi> of the Evil he had determined;
but positively declared, that <hi>the End of all
Flesh</hi> was come before him. Nor <hi>did Man
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50059:33"/>
repent;</hi> for as our Saviour testifies, they
continued in their Security until <hi>the Day
that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the Ark,</hi> Matth. 24.
Yet it may be observed, that after things
were come to that pass, that there was no
possibility of turning away the Judgment
threatned, yet God exercised <hi>Forbearance</hi>
towards them, and gave them the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Means of Repentance</hi> and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. They had amongst
them the <hi>Ministry of</hi> Noah, <hi>a Preacher
of Righteousness,</hi> and that continued for a
long season in the Patience of God.</p>
            <p>[And let none please themselves, that
they have the <hi>outward means of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi>
continued unto them; for not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that fruit of Gods Patience, their
Destruction may be inevitable. For as
God may grant unto them to satisfie
his own Goodness, and Glorisie his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
so unto them, it may be no other
End, but the hardning of them in their
Sin, and the Aggravation of their Sins,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9. 10, 11, 12. And this Example
of <hi>the Old World,</hi> is frequently proposed,
and that to Christians, to Professors, to
Churches, to deliver them from Security
in a time of approaching Judgments.]</p>

2. The second Instance hereof was in
the <hi>Judaical Church</hi>-State; the People,
Nation, Temple, Worship, and all that
was valuable among them. This Judgment
also in its approach, was such, as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
whereunto, <hi>God would not repent,</hi> and
<hi>Man could</hi> not repent, although a day, a
time and space of Repentance was granted
unto them. So it is declared by our Lord
Jesus Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41. 42, 43, 44,
They had a <hi>Day,</hi> it was theirs in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner, a day of Patience and of the
means of Conversion, in the Ministry of
Christ and his Apostles. Yet saith he,
<hi>the things of thy Peace are now hid from thee,</hi>
so as that they must irrecoverably and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
perish. So is their State described
by the Apostle; 1 <hi>Thes. 2. 14. 15,
16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be said, if their Destruction
<hi>was so absolutely determined,</hi> that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it should be either longer suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or diverted. Unto what end did God
grant <hi>them a Day,</hi> such <hi>a day of Grace and
Patience</hi> which they could not make use of?
I answer he did it for the Manifestation of
the Glory of his Grace, Righteousness
and Severity; and that these two ways.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:50059:34"/>
1. In the Calling, Conversion, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of his <hi>Elect</hi> out of the Perishing
multitude of them that were hardned.
During the continuance of that day of
Grace, and Patience among them, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the space of fourty year, all the Elect
of that Generation were converted to God,
and delivered from the Curse that came
upon the Church and Nation. For although
I will not say, but some of them might
suffer, yea fall in the outward publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
of that season, yet they were all
delivered from the <hi>Wrath of God</hi> in them, and
saved eternally.</p>
            <p>Hereof the Apostle gives an account,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. It is therefore
in a time of great Provocations, no certain
Evidence, that inevitable publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not approaching, because the
<hi>Word,</hi> and other <hi>means of Grace,</hi> are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to the Conversion of some amongst
us; for God may hereby be gathering of his
own unto himself, that way may be made
for the pouring out of his Indignation on
them that are hardned,</p>
            <p>2. He did it that he might be an <hi>Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Sin,</hi> and a space to fill up
the measure of their Iniquity; to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his severity in their Destruction;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50059:34"/>
               <hi>towards them that fell, Severity.</hi> They had
time to contract all the guilt mentioned by
the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. and
were brought into the State and Condition
described by the same Apostle; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
26, 27, 28, 29, 30. see <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 6, 10, 11.
12.</p>
            <p>Of this Judgment and Destruction, that
of the <hi>Old World</hi> was a Precedent and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
which was despised by those obdurate
Sinners, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>3. The third Instance of a
Judgment of this nature which is yet to
come, is in the <hi>Destruction of Antichrist,</hi>
and the Idolatrous Kingdom of the great
Adultress, and the persecuting Beast.
With respect hereunto also, God <hi>will not
repent,</hi> nor <hi>shall men do so;</hi> so that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable.
So is it declared, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 8.
This God hath determined, and it shall
be accomplished in its appointed Season;
<hi>for strong is the Lord God who Judgeth them,</hi>
and none shall deliver them out of his
Hand; because of the improbability of it
because of the great Power of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in
its self, and in its Allyes, the Kings and
Merchants of the Earth. The <hi>Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of God is engaged to secure the Church
of its Destruction; <hi>strong is the Lord God
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50059:35"/>
who judgeth her.</hi> She also hath her day,
wherein she <hi>will not,</hi> wherein she <hi>shall not</hi>
repent. When God begins to execute his
Plagues against her, none that belong unto
her will repent of any of their Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20. 21. and Chap. 16. 9,
11. Yet is there <hi>a day of Patience</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto this Idolatrous persecuting Church,
partly that they may <hi>fill up the measure of
their Iniquities;</hi> and partly that God may
by the Word and means of Grace, gather
out all his People from amongst them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto his Calls; <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 14. And
our slowness in coming forth from them,
is probably one means of prolonging the
day of her desolation. And now the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ seems to say unto his People, what
the Angel said unto <hi>Lot,</hi> when he led him
out of <hi>Sodom; Make hast to escape, for I
cannot do any thing until you are escaped,</hi>
Gen. 19. 22. And I hope the time is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
wherein he will deal with his
People as the Angel dealt with <hi>Lot,</hi> v. 16.
They are apt to linger, and know not how
to leave the outward Accommodation of
the <hi>Babylonish State,</hi> nor clear themselves
of innumerable Prejudices received there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
But he being <hi>merciful unto them,</hi> will
at length lay hold on them by the Word
of his Power, and take them out of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50059:35"/>
City, in a compleat Relinquishment of that
cursed State.</p>
            <p>Now unto this sort of Judgments, there
are two things concurring.</p>
            <p>1. That there is a <hi>Determinate Decree</hi>
concerning them.</p>
            <p>That there is a <hi>a Judicial Obduration</hi>
upon the People, whom they are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against, <hi>accompanying them;</hi> that no
Calls to <hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>Reformation</hi> shall be
complyed withal, so as to divert them. I
am satisied upon such Evidence as I shall
give afterwards, that this is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>England;</hi> howbeit, we have
cause enough to tremble at the severest of
Divine Judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The second sort of Judgments
are, such as are <hi>deservedly threatned,</hi> and
determined, yet so as that no <hi>Judicial hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
doth absolutely go a long with them,
to make utterly void the proceeding Day of
Grace and Patience, and all Reformation
impossible.</p>
            <p>They cannot, they shall not be utterly
remov'd by a total deliverance from them,
but yet they may have many Alleviations,
and Mitigations; and be sanctisied
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50059:36"/>
unto them whom they do befall; a full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
hereof we have in the <hi>Babylonish
Captivity,</hi> as an Account is given us of it,
2 Kings 23. 25, 26, 27. <hi>Like unto him
was there no king before him, that turned to
the Lord with all his Heart, and with all his
Soul, and with all his might, according to all
the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>never after him arose
there any like him. Notwithstanding, the
Lord turned not from the fierceness of his
wrath wherewith his Anger was kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
Judah, <hi>because of all their Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that</hi> Manasseh <hi>had provoked him withal.
And the Lord said, I will removed</hi> Judah <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
out of my sight, as I have removed</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
<hi>and will cast off this City</hi> Hierusalem
<hi>which I have chosen, and the House of which
I said, My Name shall be there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath decreed and determined to cast
off <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for their Sin, to
bring a wasting Desolation upon them.
When this Judgment was approaching, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
endeavours a <hi>through Reformation</hi> of
all things in the Land, Religious, Civil,
and Moral. Yet would not God revoke
his Sentence of a great Calamity on the
whole Nation. The secret Reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was, that the Body of the people was
<hi>Hypocritical</hi> in that Reformation, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50059:36"/>
quickly returned unto their former Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
ver, 3. 10. <hi>Judah hath not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me with her whole heart, but feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
saith the Lord.</hi> See Chap. 4. 18. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
this Reformation of <hi>Josiah</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
with God, and had its influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Mitigation or Sanctification of the
ensuing Desolation.</p>
            <p>And this sort of Judgment is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that before insisted on: For,</p>
            <p>1. It is but <hi>Partial;</hi> there is a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
alwaies left among a People, that
shall escape it. So was there in those
days; there was an <hi>Escape</hi> of it, a <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
whom God delivered and preserved;
which were as a Blessing in the Cluster, on
the Account whereof, the whole was not
utterly destroyed, This the Scripture ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much insists on, <hi>Isai 65. 6, 7. Zech 3.
11, 12. Amos</hi> 9. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>As it is not Total, so it is not Final;
even in the severity of his Wrath God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
the Recovery of that People again
in the appointed Season; giving Promises
thereof unto them that feared him: And
so it came to pass in the return of their
Captivity. See the <hi>History hereof</hi> Jer. 31.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50059:37"/>
32. God may have, for our Sins, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
a desolating Calamity on this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet if there be not a <hi>Judiciary hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
upon us, it may only be <hi>partial</hi> and
<hi>recoverable,</hi> not as it was with <hi>Israel
1 Kings</hi> 14. 10. See <hi>Jer. 4. 27. Chap. 5. 18.
Chap.</hi> 30. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>3. It was <hi>sanctified</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> unto them
who were upright and sincere, and who
endeavoured the removal of it by Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
though they suffered in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Calamity. The <hi>Good Figs,</hi> or those
Typed by them, were carried into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
but the dealing of God with them
therein, was in Mercy, <hi>Jer. 24. 5. 6, 7.
I will</hi> (saith God) <hi>set mine Eyes upon
them for Good; I will build them up, and
not pull them down; and I will give them an
heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and
they shall be my People, and I will be their
God.</hi> Whatever was their outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
those internal, Spiritual Mercies
and Priviledges made it sweet and useful
unto them; <hi>The third part was brought
through the Fire,</hi> Zech 13. 8. 9.</p>
            <p>4. God makes this sort of Judgment a
Means fully to <hi>reclaim and reform</hi> them,
as many of those who in general suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50059:37"/>
them. They are Gods Furnace, but
not to burn; they purifie and cleanse as
Silver is tried, and not burn up as Stubble
is consumed: So was that Church by
their Captivity, Purged from their Idols
for ever. And many other Differences of
the like Nature might be assigned.</p>
            <p>And in the Consideration of this sort of
Judgments lies our Concernment. Who
knows but that God, for our horrible
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> with
all the <hi>cursed Immoralities</hi> and Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which have ensued thereon, and the
cold dead frame of Professors under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Means of Instruction, hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to bring a wasting Calamity on this
Nation, and that he will not turn away
from the fierceness of this wrath, but it
shall overtake us? If their be a <hi>jùdicial
Hardness</hi> upon the Land, so as that there
is <hi>no Repentance, no Reformation</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Day of Patience and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
which we yet enjoy, our Desolation
will be total, unsanctified, irrevocable;
and through another People may be raised
up to profess the Gospel in the Land, yet
shall we be unconcerned in the Mercy, So
hath it been before in this Nation, and in
all the Christian Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> Wo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50059:38"/>
unto us, if we thus betray the Land of
our Nativity; if we thus give it up to be
an Hissing and Astonishment. Hearken
not unto vain words; this or that way we
shall be delivered; it is the Day of our
Trial, and who knows what will be the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
thereof? But on the other hand,
although a publick Calamity should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
irrevocably against us, if we use
the Day of Forbearance unto the Ends of
it, in Repentance and Returning unto
God, we shall at length have all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
beforementioned: it will be but
<hi>partial,</hi> it will be but <hi>for a time,</hi> it <hi>will be
sanctified,</hi> it will <hi>purifie</hi> the Church, and
restore it unto a more Glorious State than
ever before.</p>
            <p>3. There are judgments which are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,</hi>
and <hi>threatned,</hi> but not <hi>decreed</hi> and
<hi>determined,</hi> which may be absolutely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and escaped. This sort of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is frequently mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and so also are frequent Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from them, by the Ways and Means
of Gods appointment.</p>
            <p>And concerning them, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50059:38"/>
1. That this <hi>Threatnings of approaching
Judgments,</hi> which yet may be averted, is
a <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>ordinary Rule of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice, according whereunto, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or People, without an interposition of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Mercy, ought to be destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God doth not threaten, he doth not
give Warnings, Signs or Indications of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Judgments, but when they are
deserved, and may righteously be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
nor is there any known Rule of the
Word, to give an Assurance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
All that can be said, is, <hi>Who
knows but that the Lord may repent and turn
from the fierceness of his Wrath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The threatnings of them is an Ordinance
of God, to call us unto the Vse of such Means
as whereby they may be prevented.</p>
            <p>He foretells our Destruction, that we
may not be destroyed; as it was in the
Case of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> and this is the only
<hi>Symptom</hi> whereby we find out and discern
the Nature of <hi>threatned impendent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
If the Consideration of them, be
an Ordinance of God, stirring us up to
the diligent Use of the Means whereby
they may be prevented, the Design of God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50059:39"/>
is, to give in Deliverance in the Issue. If
it doth not, they are inevitable. God
holds the Ballance yet in his hand, and
we know not which way we incline. The
best prognostication we can take, is from
the frame of our own hearts,, under the
Threatnings of them,</p>
            <p>Here lies the Trial of this poor Land
and Nation at this Day; Judgment is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,</hi>
Judgment is <hi>threatned,</hi> Judgment
is <hi>approaching, the Clouds are the Dust of
his feet,</hi> If <hi>all sorts</hi> of Men turn not to
God by <hi>Repentance,</hi> if we are not humbled
for our contempt of the Gospel, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
against it, if we leave not our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Sins, Evil will overtake us; and
we shall not escape. And yet on the other
hand, by a due Application unto him who
holds the Ballance in his hand, <hi>Mercy may
Glory against Justice,</hi> and we may have
Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Those great Men who suppose all things
pervious unto their Wisdom, and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by their Industry, who have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>flattering</hi> Contrivances, for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Nation, cannot more despise these
things, than I do all their Councels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. And when they shall be at a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50059:39"/>
loss, and shall find one Disappointment
following on the Neck of another, those
who attend unto the Advice of God in
this Case, shall <hi>find rest and Peace</hi> in their
own Souls. And as for them who <hi>scosf</hi> at
these things, <hi>and say, Where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of his Coming?</hi> (that is, in the way
of Judgment) <hi>For since the Fathers fell
asleep, all things continue as they were from
the Creation:</hi> there needs no regard unto
God in these things; trouble us not with
the <hi>Fooleries</hi> of your <hi>Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
God will laugh at <hi>their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 26. to the End.</p>
            <p>This is the Second thing we were to
insist on for the Clearing and Confirmation
of the General Proposition before laid
down.</p>
            <p>III. Our third Enquiry is, What <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
we have at present, or what <hi>Warnings</hi>
we have had of approaching Judgments?
For this also belongs unto the indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Necessity of <hi>Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
upon the approaching of Troubles.
And they are the Ordinances of God unto
that end; which, when they are despised,
desolating Judgments will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nsue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50059:40"/>
And we may unto this End, observe
these things.</p>
            <p>1. Ordinarily God doth not bring wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
desolating Judgments on any People,
Church or Nation, but that he gives them
Warnings of their approach.</p>
            <p>I say, he doth not <hi>Ordinarily</hi> do so; for
he may, if he please, surprize a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
provoking Generation of men with
the most dreadfull Destructions; as he did
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> of old: And very
many dayly are so surprized, as unto their
<hi>own Apprehensions;</hi> though really God
had given them <hi>Signs</hi> of what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them, but they regarded them
not, and so perished as in a moment. But
ordinarily before he executes great and
severe Judgments, he gives such <hi>Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Signs and warnings</hi> of their coming
as that men should be forced to take notice
of them, unless they be absolutely hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and blinded. So he dealt with the <hi>Old
World,</hi> in the <hi>Building of the Ark,</hi> and
the Ministry of <hi>Noah:</hi> so he dealt with
the Church under the Old Testament, in
and by the Ministry of the Prophets; See
<hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8. And so he hath done with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50059:40"/>
all others, who have had any Knowledge
of him or of his ways. They that are wise
may discern these things, <hi>Hosea</hi> the last,
<hi>Mat. 16. 3. Micah 6. 9. Dan.</hi> 12. 10.
And in all Heathen Stories of the times
that passed over them, we find Remarks
of strange Indications of approaching
Desolations. And he doth it for two
Ends.</p>
            <p>1. For the Satisfaction of his own <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Love to Mankind</hi> in the Exercise
of Patience and Forbearance unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
<hi>Hosea</hi> 6. 4. as also for the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of the Glory of his Justice,
when he comes to execute the severity of
his Wrath. When men are surprised with
publick Calamities, they shall not be able
to say, would none tell us of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
would none give us warning of
them? had we been told of the terrour of
the Lord in his Judgments, we would have
turned from our Iniquities, that we might
have escaped. In this case, it is usual
with God in the Scripture to call <hi>Heaven
and Earth to Witness</hi> against Men, that he
did warn them by various means of what
would befall them in the End. This is
our principal reason why this weak, but
sincere <hi>Testimony for God</hi> is published.
And this shall be an Aggravation of their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50059:41"/>
misery in the day of their distress, when
they shall seriously reflect upon themselves
as unto their Folly, Guilt, and Obstinacy,
in despising the Warnings which they had
received; which is a great part of the
punishment of the Damned in Hell, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>2. God doth it for the End under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
namely that they may be a
<hi>means to call a poor guilty People</hi> unto that
Repentance and Reformation, whereby
impendent Judgments may be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are five ways whereby
God giveth <hi>Warning of the approach of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solating
Judgments,</hi> VVhen a Land is full of
Sin.</p>
            <p>1. He doth it by a lesser <hi>previous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Severities:</hi> So was it in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the <hi>Text.</hi> The destruction of
some by the Sword, and the fall of a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
was a <hi>Warning</hi> to the whole Nation of
the approach of a publick Calamity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they repented. As particular Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are given us hereof in the Scripture,
so we have a general account of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Divine Providence, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 1,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50059:41"/>
2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. First God sent the
Judgment of the <hi>Grashoppers,</hi> which eat
up all the Grass of the Land, and so occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
a <hi>Famine.</hi> This Judgment being
not improved unto Repentance, he called
<hi>to contend by Fire,</hi> which devoured the
<hi>Great Deep, and did eat up a part,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
their Treasure, devouring a part of
their Substance. But when this also was
neglected, then came the <hi>Plumb-Line</hi> of
a levelling Desolation.</p>
            <p>2. He doth it by <hi>extraordinary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
Operations</hi> in the works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
such as are <hi>Comets,</hi> or <hi>Blazing-Stars,
Fiery Meteors, dreadfull Phantsins or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
in the Air, Voices, Predictions</hi> of
uncertain Original, <hi>mighty Winds, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
stopping the Course of Rivers,</hi> and
the like. An Account of these things, as
they were to fortel and fore-signify the
fatal Destruction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> is given
us by our Saviour; <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 25, 26. And
the story of the Event in <hi>Josephus,</hi> is an
admirable Exposition of this Prophecy of
our Blessed Saviour; see <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 13, 14.
The <hi>Frame of Nature,</hi> is as it were cast
into a trembling disorder, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of God in his wrath and Fury,
and puts it self forth in extraordinary
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50059:42"/>
signs of its astonishment; trembling for
the Inhabitants of the Earth, and calling
on them to repent, before the wrath of
the terrible one do seize upon them. So
in the Scripture, the Seas, and Rivers,
Mountains, and Hills are represented as
mourning, shaking, trembling at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God; when he comes to execute
his Judgments, see <hi>Hab, 3. 6. 7, 8, 10
He drove asunder the Nations, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Mountains were scattered, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
hils did bow; Was the Lord displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
against thy Rivers? Was thine Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy Rivers? Was thy wrath against
the Sea? The Mountains saw thee and they
trembled: the overflowing of the Water pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by: the deep uttered his voice, and lift
up his hands on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mountains, Hills, Seas, Rivers,
bowed, trembled, and <hi>lifted up their hands,</hi>
as crying for compassion, see <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. 2, 3,
4, 5, 6. By these Signs and Tokens in
Heaven and Earth doth God give Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his coming to judge the Inhabitants
of the Earth. God doth not work these
strange things in Heaven above, and the
Earth beneath, that they should be gazed
at only, and made a matter of talk; not
that they should be Subjects of some mens
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50059:42"/>
Curiosity, and of the Scorn of others.
There is a voice in them all, a voice of
God, and it will be to their hurt by whom
it is not heard and understood.</p>
            <p>3. He doth the same constantly by <hi>the
Light of his VVord.</hi> The general Rule of
Gods ordinary Dispensations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is fully laid down in the Scripture.
<hi>God hath magnified his VVord above all his
Name:</hi> so as that no VVorks of Providence
shall be unsuited to the Rule of the word,
much less contrary to it, or inconsistent
with it. And if we were wise to make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it unto present Affairs and
Occasions, we should in most instances
know in general what God is doing. Of
old it was said, <hi>Surely the Lord God will
do nothing,</hi> that is, in the way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>but he reveals his Secret to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the Prophets,</hi> Amos 3. 7. What they
had by immediate Revelation, we may
have in a measure by the Rule of the
word, and the Declaration which God
hath made therein, how he will deal with
a sinful provoking People. So having threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
various sorts of Judgments, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
adds, <hi>Search you out of the Book of the
Lord, and read, no one of these shall fail,
Isai.</hi> 34. 16. That this great means of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50059:43"/>
VVarnings may be usefull unto us, we
are to consider,</p>
            <p>1. VVhat are the stable Rules given in
the Scripture concerning Sin, Repentance,
Impenitence, and Judgments. Such Rules
abound in it: And no dispensations of
Providence shall interfer with them; God
will no give such a Temptation unto Faith,
that any of his works should be Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
unto his VVord. And if we will
learn our present Condition from these
Rules, it will be an <hi>Antidote</hi> against Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>2. Consider the Instances recorded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of Gods dealings with sinfull provoking
Nations and Churches, This God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
directed the People of old unto, when
they boasted of their Church-Priviledges,
sending them to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
And when we find a Record in
the Book of God concerning his severity
towards any Nation in our Circumstances,
it is our duty to beleive, that he will deal
so with us also, in his time, unless we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>3. Always bear in Mind our <hi>Infallible
Guidance</hi> as unto Gods final dealing with
impenitent Sinners. This the whole
Scripture constantly, equally, universally
witnesses unto; that it shall be eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50059:43"/>
and this will preserve us from
distracting Surprisals, when we find things
fall out beyond our Expectation in a way
of Severity.</p>
            <p>4. Consider those Signs, Marks and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of Approaching Judgments, which
are set up in the VVorld; which, whoso doth
wisely consider, he will not fail in his
Prognostication of future Events. Among
these, <hi>abounding in Sin with Security,</hi> in such
Persons, Nations, Cities and Churches, as
God is pleased by the Gospel to take near
unto himself in a peculiar manner, is the
most eminent. For those Signs are Buoys
fixed to shew when we shall certainly make
Shipwrack, if we approach unto them.
VVhen these Rules are observed, when
they are diligently attended unto, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
withal, so as that we receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from them, I shall say with some
confidence, that every Believer shall know
what God is doing in a way of Judgment,
so far as is necessary unto his Guidance in
his own Duty, wherein he shall find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and not provoke God in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of it.</p>
            <p>5. God hath appointed the <hi>Ministry
of the word</hi> unto the same end. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
End of the <hi>Ministery</hi> under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50059:44"/>
is the Dispensation of the word of
<hi>Reconciliation.</hi> But neither is yet this
work of giving <hi>warning of approaching
Judgments,</hi> exempted from that Office and
Duty. Christ himself, in his Ministry
preacheth here on this Subject. They are
<hi>Watchmen</hi> and <hi>Overseers;</hi> and their Duty
herein is graphically expressed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. When God placeth
any as a <hi>VVatchman</hi> for a People, one part
of his Duty is to look diligently after the
approach of Dangers and Evils; such I
mean, as come on the account of Sin, and
thereon to awaken and stir up the People
to take care of themselves, that they be
not destroyed. The <hi>Shepard</hi> is not only
to provide good Pasture for his Sheep, but
to keep them from danger. The Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>hearkned diligently, with much heed,
and he cryed a Lyon,</hi> Isai. 21, 7, 8, Having
made a discovery of approaching danger,
he cries out to the People to warn them
of it. But if the <hi>Watchmen</hi> are slothful,
and sleepy, if they are dumb Dogs and
cannot bark when Evil cometh, if they
are light and treacherous Persons, blind
Guides that have no vision; if they also are
under a spirit of slumber and security, so
as that the people are not warned by them
of their danger; this is one of the most
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50059:44"/>
               <hi>severe Tokens</hi> of wrath approaching. It is
a great warning, when God takes away
the Means of warning; when he says unto
a People, <hi>I will warn you no more,</hi> by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them such watchmen as are neither
faithful, nor able to warn them, and by
taking away those that are.</p>
            <p>6. God gives warnings hereof, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a people into such a Posture, Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Circumstances, as do in their
own Nature tend unto Ruine Such are
cross Interests among themselves, incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Divisions, contrary and unsteddy
Counsels, weakness in Spirit and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
mutual Distrusts, Effeminacy through
Luxury, with one or other insuparable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement;
which are the Ways and
Means whereby Nations precipate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into calamitous Condition. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as unto this previous warning of
approaching Judgments, God threatens to
send among a People who are tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Ruine, a <hi>Moth</hi> and an <hi>Hornet.</hi> The
<hi>Moth</hi> he threatens <hi>Isai. 51. 8. Hosea</hi> 5. 12.
Somewhat that shall <hi>eat up</hi> and devour the
Strength and Sinews of the Counsels of a
Nation, as a <hi>Moth</hi> devoureth a Garment.
Whilst it lies still, it seems, it may be, to
be sound and firm; hold it up to the <hi>Light,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50059:45"/>
and it appears full of holes, and is easily
torn with the Finger. So is it with a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whatever outward Peace it seems
to enjoy, when it is decaied in the VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and strength of its Counsels, it is
easily torn in pieces. And in like manner
he sends the <hi>Hornet</hi> unto the same end,
<hi>Exod. 23. 28, Deut.</hi> 7. 20. that is, that
which shall vex, disquiet and torment
them, that they shall be ready every one
to strike himself, or the next that he meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
withal; as many of these <hi>Hornets</hi> are
at present among us.</p>
            <p>These are some of the VVays whereby
God warneth a People, Church or Nation
of approaching Judgments.</p>
            <p>It concerneth us now to enquire how it
is, how it hath been with us, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
hereunto. And I say,</p>
            <p>It is <hi>not necessary</hi> that God should use <hi>all
these ways of Warning</hi> of a sinful People,
of approaching Desolations, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by Repentance: It is enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ends of this Dispensation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
VVisdom and Goodness, if he make
use <hi>of some of them,</hi> or of <hi>any one of them</hi>
in an eminent manner, Wherefore if any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50059:45"/>
of them have been wanting among us, yet
if we have had others of them, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to render us excusable, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not. But,</p>
            <p>2, The Truth is, we have, upon the
matter, <hi>had them all,</hi> and they have abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst us</p>
            <p>VVe have had the <hi>previous Judgments</hi> of
<hi>Plague, Fire</hi> and <hi>War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may say, they were <hi>desolating
Judgments</hi> themselves; and so indeed
they were: But whereas Sin still abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and no Reformation ensued upon
them, in any Places, among any sort of
Persons, they were but Warnings of what
is yet to come, if not prevented. And
their Language is, <hi>Except you repent, you
shall all likewise perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have had a <hi>Multiplication of Signs</hi>
in the Heaven above, and in the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath;
such as all Mankind have ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
Forerunners of publick Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and the more they are despised, the
lowder is their Voice to the same purpose.
God hath continued hitherto his <hi>Word</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, wherein the ordinary Rule of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50059:46"/>
his Providence in these things is openly
declared. And if those unto whom the
Declaration of the Word of God in the
Dispensation of it is committed, have
not faithfully warned the People of their
Danger, their Blood may be found at
their Door. Herein at present lies our
greatest streight; The <hi>Efficacy</hi> of all other
Calls of God unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> depends
much on the Application of them unto
the Souls and Consciences of Men in the
<hi>Preaching of the Word.</hi> But whilst by some
this Work is despised, at least counted
unnecessary; by some it is neglected utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and others by reason of their private
Capacities, whereby they are disenabled
to speak unto <hi>Magistrates, Cities,</hi> or the
Community of the People, Think not
themselves concern'd therein, it is almost
wholly laid aside. For what will some
say, doth this speaking unto <hi>a few</hi> in a
Retirement signifie as unto a General
Reformation of the People of the Land?
But whereas we have all sinned in one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Churches, and all sorts of more
strict Professors of Religion, it is every
ones Duty to be pressing these Warnings
of God within his own Bounds and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
And if each of us should prevail
but with <hi>one,</hi> to return effectually to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50059:46"/>
God, it will be accepted with him, who
in such a season, <hi>seeks for a man</hi> to stand
in the gap, to turn away his wrath; and
will save a City for the <hi>sake for Ten,</hi> if
they be found therein. Let us not pretend
that the Repentance and Reformation
called for, respects the <hi>publick enormous
Sins</hi> of the Nation, in <hi>Atheism, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
Sensuality, Luxury, Pride, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Hatred of the Truth, Contempt of
the Ministry of the Gospel,</hi> and the like;
they do so indeed, but not <hi>only,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
also the <hi>Decays in Faith, Love, Zeal,</hi>
with <hi>Love of the World, Conformity unto
it, Lukewarmness,</hi> that are found amongst
the most eminent Professors of Religion.
This is our present wound; here lies our
weakness; namely, in the want of a quick,
active, zealous Ministry, to call and stir
up Magistrates and People to effectual
Repentance and turning to God. Unless
this be given unto us, I fear we cannot be
saved. If it be otherwise, if we have a
Ministry that really do attend unto their
Duty in this Matter, I beg their pardon
for other apprehensions; but then I shall
think it the most pregnant Sign of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Destruction; seeing it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
unto all, that their Endeavours have
neither Fruit nor Success.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50059:47"/>
               <hi>So far have we proceeded with our</hi>
Proposition; <hi>Namely; That</hi> Sin abounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us; <hi>That</hi> Judgments are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
That God hath given us manifold
Warnings of their so doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4. That which in the next Place we are
to speak unto is, the</hi> Equity of this Divine
Constitution, that in the ordinary way of
Gods Rule, and Dispensation of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
Repentance and Reformation shall
turn away impendent Judgments, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
unto a People a blessed Deliverance, and
nothing else shall do it. Except you repent
you shall perish.</p>
            <p>That upon Repentance they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and delivered, is intended in the same
Rule. This is the unalterable Law of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence; this shall do it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else shall so do. The <hi>VVisdom</hi> and
<hi>Power</hi> of Men shall not do it; <hi>Fasting</hi> and
<hi>Prayer,</hi> whilst we continue in our Sins, shall
not do it. <hi>Repentance</hi> alone is made the
Condition of Deliverance in this State of
things.</p>
            <p>Upon this Rule, did God vindicate the
<hi>Equity of his Ways</hi> against <hi>Repining</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50059:47"/>
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 29, 30, 31. Can any thing
be more <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equal?</hi> Ruine and utter
Desolation are ready to fall upon the
whole People: This you have deserved
by your Iniquities, and multiplied provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
In strict Justice they ought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to come upon you: But <hi>my ways are
equal;</hi> I will not deal with you in a way of
strict Justice; I will do it in <hi>Equity,</hi> which
is a meet Temperature of Justice and
Mercy. And this I make evident unto
you herein, in that, whilst the Execution
of Judgment is only threatned and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
if you make unto your selves a
<hi>new Heart and a new Spirit,</hi> in sincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
if you <hi>cast away all your Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi>
by a thorough Reformation of
your lives, <hi>Iniquity shall not be your Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</hi>
What can be more Just, righteous.
and equal? Who can complain, if after
all this, evil doth overtake you, and you
shall not escape? The same he pleads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 33. 10, 11. as in many other
Places.</p>
            <p>That this Divine Constitution, namely,
That Repentance and Reformation shall
save a Church, People or Nation in the
state before described, and that nothing
else shall do so, however men may please
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50059:48"/>
and pride themselves in their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
is equal, just and good, that it
is meet it should be so, that it hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencie
unto the Divine Excellencies, and
the Rule of Righteousness in government,
is evident for,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Notion of this Rule</hi> is inbred in
Mankind by Nature, as was mentioned
before. There is no man, unless he be <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istically
profligate,</hi> but when he apprehends
that Evil and Ruine, especially as unto his
Life, is ready to overtake him, &amp; seize upon
him, but he reflects on his Sins, and comes
to some Resolutions of forsaking them for
the future, so he may be at present deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from his deplorable Condition.
Now all this ariseth from these indelible
Notions ingrafted on the Minds of Men;
that all evil of Punishment is from God,
that it is for Sin, that there is no way to
avoid it but by Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And those who will not improve
this Natural Light, with respects unto the
<hi>Publick,</hi> will be found, as it were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will or no, to comply with it,
when it comes to be their own Case in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
Herein lies a thousand Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
unto the <hi>Equity</hi> of this Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:50059:48"/>
2. When this Rule is complied withal,
when <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> do ensue
upon Divine warnings, whereby Peace
with God is in some measure attained; it
will give men Trust and Confidence in
him, with expectation of Divine Relief
in their Distress, which is the most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Means for men to be instrumental unto
their own Deliverance. And on the other
side, when it is neglected, when Evil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
Guilt and Terrour will haunt
the Minds of men, and they shall not be
able to entertain one thought of Divine
Help, which will render them heartless,
Helpless, Senceless, and betray them into
Cowardise and Pusillanimity, however they
may boast at present, If these two sorts
are opposed, ten shall chase an hundred,
and an hundred put a thousand to flight.
And if any Nation do openly refuse a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with this Constitution, if God
should send an other to invade them in a
way of Judgment, they would melt away
before them as Wax before the Fire. When
Evils compass us about, and are ready
to seize upon us, a Reduction on the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of this Rule, will disturb our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
distract our Thoughts, distress our
Minds, weaken our Confidence in God,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50059:49"/>
and dishearten the <hi>stoutest</hi> of the Sons of
Men, giving them up a Prey to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>3. This Rule or Constitution hath an
impression of all Divine Excellencies upon
it; namely, of the Goodness, Patience,
Wisdom, Righteousness and Holiness of
God.</p>
            <p>If when Judgments are approaching,
and deserved, men could divert them by
their <hi>Wisdom,</hi> Courage or Diligence, it
would reflect Dishonour on God in the
Government of the World; see <hi>Isa. 22.
7, 8, 9, 10, 11:</hi> But in this way of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of any People, there is a <hi>Salvo</hi>
for the Glory of, all the Divine Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
as is manifested unto all.</p>
            <p>When therefore in this state, impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Judgments are not absolutely <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,</hi>
yet so <hi>deserved,</hi> as that upon a
Supposition of continuance in those Sins
whereby they are deserved, the Glory of
Divine Justice cannot be vindicated in the
absolute impunity; and whereas God hath
now prepared all things, and made them
ready for their execution, all Means and
Instruments being girt unto the Work, his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50059:49"/>
Sword is whetted, and his Arrows are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the bow, he will first give <hi>Warning,</hi>
then give <hi>Space</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> for Repentance,
and requires no more for the laying aside
of all his Preparations for Destruction,
surely his <hi>Ways are equal,</hi> kind, and full
of Mercy,</p>
            <p>If Men will look for, if they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Deliverance, without a complyance
with these good, Holy, Just, Gracious, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
terms, they will find themselves in
the issue wofully deceived. And if after
all this, we in this Nation should be found
in a neglect hereof, if the Nation should
continue in its present frame, wherein, of
all other means of Safety, this seems to
be least thought of or regarded, what
shall we plead for our selves? who shall
pity us in the day of Distress? Most men
now despise these, things, but can their
hearts endure, or can their hands be strong
in the Day that the Lord shall deal with
them? But,</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Whereas</hi> this Way, this Means of
Deliverance is so just, so equal, so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
manifesting it self to the Consciences
and Reason of Mankind, owned by the very
Heathens, and fully confirmed by Divine
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50059:50"/>
Revelation, <hi>our next Enquiry must be,
Whence it is that</hi> there is such an unreadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
such an unwillingness to comply with
this Duty as there is? that so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are esteemed to be in it; so as that
there is little hope it will be found among us
in a prevalent degree?</p>
            <p>If Men, especially such as are Great,
and esteem themselves to be wise, are told
that this is the way to save and deliver the
Nation, they turn away in a wrath, as
<hi>Naaman</hi> did, when the Prophet bid him
<hi>Wash and be clean,</hi> when he would have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expected an Injunction of some <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick</hi>
Exploits: These are Thoughts for
weak and pusillanimous Souls, who under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stand
nothing of State-Affairs. But it
will ere long appear who is wisest, God or
Men. But an hard thing it is to prevail
with any to think well of it, or to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, or to judge that it is the only Balm
for our Wounds.</p>
            <p>To find out the Cause hereof, I shall
breifly consider <hi>all sorts of Persons</hi> who
are concerned to plant this healing Tree,
whose Root is Repentance, and whose
Fruit is Reformation of Life. And they
are of three sorts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50059:50"/>
               <hi>1. Magistrates. 2. Ministers. 3. The
People themselves</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unless there be a Concurrence of the
Endeavours of them all in their several
Places and Duties, there will be no such
publick Work of Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
wrought as is suited unto the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of Publick Calamities. But yet
though it be the express Duty of them all,
though it be their Interest, though it cannot
be omitted, but at their utmost peril, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Temporal and Eternal Events, yet it is a
marvellous hard and difficult work to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with any of them to engage vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
in it. Some do not think it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
some after conviction of its Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
either know not how to go about it,
or linger in its undetaking, or are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wearied; some wish it were Done, so
as that they may not be at the Trouble
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us consider them Distinctly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As unto <hi>Magistrates.</hi> When <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat</hi>
set himself to reform the Church,
or his Kingdom, to escape the Judgment
that was denounced against them, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50059:51"/>
for <hi>Magistrates and Judges,</hi> men
fearing God, and hating Covetousness:
And his charge unto them was, <hi>Let the
Fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed
and do it; thus shall you do in the fear of
the Lord, faithfully and with a perfect heart,
2 Chron.</hi> 19. 6. 9. Without this, there
will be no publick Reformation; and
therefore the first Difficulty of it ariseth
from this sort of Persons, and that upon
two Accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Magistrates</hi> themselves do
live in Sin, and love it, and hate to be
personally reformed; yea take delight in
them that openly live in Sin also, which is
the heigth of wickedness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32.
When <hi>Magistrates</hi> are prophane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or Scoffers, at the Power of Religion,
or Drunkards, or unclean Persons, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Oppressors, a great Obstruction
must needs be laid in the way of publick
Repentance and Reformation ; neither
doth this Difficulty at present arise meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from their personal Sins and Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
but also from the want of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a Sence of their Duty in their
Places, with the Account which they
must give thereof. For.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:50059:51"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They seem not to believe that
the <hi>attempting of this Work</hi> is any part of
their Duty, or that they are concerned
therein: Let it therefore be never so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
so Equal, so Important, so Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
unto the Deliverance and Salvation
of any people, if those who should further
it in the first place, do obstruct and hinder
it, it will be attended with Difficulties. Ill
Examples and Negligence have ruined this
Nation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we may lay it down as an
assured Truth, which the Text will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm;</p>
            <p>That unless Magistrates, who have the
visible Conduct of the People, are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that it is their Duty to promote the
Work of Repentance and Reformation,
at this time, by their own Example, and
in the Discharge of their Offices, the
Case of this Nation is deplorable, and
not to be relieved but by Sovereign Grace
and Mercy: For what shall the People
do, when they see their Guides, unto
whose Pattern they conform themselves,
utterly regardless of any such thing? This
is one Means of the Difficulty which is
found among us, of affecting the Minds
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50059:52"/>
of Men with this equal Constitution.</p>
            <p>2. Those who are principally concern'd
herein, are <hi>Ministers,</hi> or those who have
the Administration of the Word and
Ordinances of the Gospel committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. Unto these, is this Work given
in charge, in an especial manner. They
have the principal means of Repentance
and Reformation committed to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.
From them is the beginning
and carrying on of this Work expected
and required. Hereof, as unto their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and diligence, they must give an
Account at the last Day. And if this
Spring be stopped, whence should the
refreshing VVaters of Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
arise? But yet herein the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Difficulty of the whole VVork doth
consist: For.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> some there are pretending unto
this Office in whom lies no small part of
the <hi>Evil</hi> that is to be Refomed. Persons
who labour among the most forward to sill
up the measure of the Iniquities of this
Nation; such as whose Ignorance. Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
Prophaneness and Debauchery,
are in all their Effects transfused and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
unto all that are about them:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50059:52"/>
Shall we expect that such persons will be
instrumental in the Reforming of others,
who hate to be reformed themselves? <hi>Jer.</hi>
23. 15. It was so of old. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are very few of this
sort of Persons, who will be at the <hi>charge
of carrying on this Work.</hi> They may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find what it will cost them; for unless
they are <hi>Exemplary</hi> in it themselves, it is
in vain once to attempt the pressing of it
upon others. They cannot go about it,
without great Retrenchings of that
which they have esteemed their <hi>Liberty</hi> in
the course of their Conversations. All Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with unreformed persons, for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Ends, all Conformity unto the course of
the World, in Jolities, and Pride of Life,
all Ostentation of Riches, Wealth and
Power, all Self-seeking, and Self-pleasing,
all Lightness, and carnal Confidences, must
utterly be cast away: And not only so,
but unless by uncessant Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
with Earnestness and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
they labour for <hi>fresh Annointings</hi>
with the Spirit of Grace in their own
Souls, that Faith and Love and Zeal for
God, and Compassion for the Souls of
Men, and Readiness for the Cross, may
revive and flourish in them, they will not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50059:53"/>
be usefull nor instrumental in this Work.
And is it any wonder, that the most of
them think it better to suffer things to go
on at the present rate, than to venture at
that which will <hi>cost them so dear</hi> in its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit?
The Truth is, I know very few, if
any, who are meet and fit to engage in this
Work in a visible eminent manner: those
who have the best, almost the only opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for it, seem to be asleep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Besides the <hi>Charge</hi> they must
be at themselves, they perceive the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
they shall meet with all from others.
They find that they shall not only disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
and provoke all sorts of Persons, and
lose many of their <hi>usefull friends,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
expose themselves unto <hi>Obloquy, Scron
Contempt</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> of all sorts. He is
a lost man in this world, who with out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Persons, will engage seriously in
this Work; every day he shall find one or
other displeased, if not provoked. This
neither they nor their <hi>Families</hi> can well
bear withal. Indeed the hardest and most
difficult Service that ever God called any
of his Ministers unto, excepting only Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ and his Apostles, hath been in
the endeavouring the Reformation of
<hi>back sliding</hi> or spiritually decay'd Churches.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50059:53"/>
These are <hi>the two Witnesses</hi> which in all
Ages <hi>have Prophesied in Sackcloth.</hi> Such
was the Ministry of <hi>Elijah,</hi> which brought
him unto that Conclusion, and an earnest
longing to be delivered by Death from
his Work and Ministry, 2 <hi>Kings 19. 4. So,</hi>
was that of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in the like Season,
whereof he so complains, <hi>Chap. 15. 10.
John the Baptist</hi> in the same work, lost
first his Liberty, then his Life. And in
after-Ages <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> for the same Cause
was hated by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> persecuted by
the <hi>Court,</hi> and at length driven into <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
where he died. Most men care
not how little a share they have in such a
Work as this, whose Reward will reach
them according to the Proportion of their
Engagement in it. All Churches, all
Persons almost, would willingly be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in the Condition wherein they are:
They that would press them unto due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation,
ever were, and ever will be
looked on as their <hi>Troublers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence then it is, that our Wound is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.
Few of this sort are convinced
of the present Necessity of this Duty;
they hope things are indifferently well
with them and their Flocks, that they may
endure their time well enough: Few are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50059:54"/>
willing to undergo the <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Trouble</hi>
of it, to put all their present Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into Disorder, few have received an
<hi>Annointing</hi> for thee; many are able to
<hi>dispute</hi> against any Attempts of it; and
not a few have Expectations of strange
Deliverances without it; what is left us
in this Case, shall afterwards be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>3. It is difficult also on the Account of
the <hi>People</hi> that are to be Reformed. It is
hard to convince them of its <hi>Necessity;</hi>
hard to perswade them to <hi>endeavour</hi> it;
hard to get them to <hi>perservere</hi> in Attempts
for it.</p>
            <p>Some of the Reasons hereof we may
breifly consider: As,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Self-Justification</hi> and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of themselves, which all sorts of
persons, both by Nature, and by incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prejudices, are inclined unto, lie at
the bottom of this fatal Negligence.
VVhen they see all things amiss, they will
grant that there is some <hi>Reformation</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
but that it is so for <hi>others,</hi> and
not for them. Those that are worse than
they (as there are but few who do not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50059:54"/>
think on one pretence or other, that there
are many worse than themselves) they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Duty is necessary unto; but not
unto them. And if there are none <hi>visibly</hi>
so, yet they will make them and judge
them so to be. But whilst men have a <hi>form
of Godliness,</hi> though they deny the <hi>power</hi>
thereof they will justifie themselves from
all need of Reformation. Churches will
do so, and all sorts of Professors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
will do so; especially if they have any
peculiar Notion or Practice, which they
value themselves upon. So was it with the
<hi>Jews</hi> of old, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 6, 7. and with the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> in the Days of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi>
9. 40. It is so at this Day; and it is a rare
thing to meet with any who will own
themselves to stand in need of real labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reformation.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that <hi>no Churches</hi> would <hi>ever
Reform themselves,</hi> which have been the
cause of all Division and Seperation,
whereby some have been saved from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Apostasie. They all approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their State and Condition, which
is come to that height in the <hi>Papal Church</hi>
that they boast themselves infallible, and
not <hi>capable of Reformation</hi> in any thing. I
pray God secure others from the like Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50059:55"/>
it will be their Ruine by
whom they are entertained; yet so it is
at this Day. Most Churches think they
need more <hi>Revenues,</hi> more <hi>Honour,</hi> more
<hi>Freedom from Opposition,</hi> more <hi>Submission</hi>
of all men unto them; but they almost
abhor the Thoughts that they stand in
need of any <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Nature of the Work it self</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it difficult; for it requires a general
Change of the Course wherein men have
been engaged; a thing as difficult, as to
cause the Streams of a mighty River to
change their Course, and run backward.
Vicious habits must be subdued, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
reveted in the Mind by long Practice,
and Custom, be cast out, ways of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
promoted and strengthened by
all sorts of Circumstances changed; which
render the Work unto some men impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So the Prophet declares it, <hi>Jer. 13.
23. Can the Aethiopian change his Skin, or
the Leopard his spots? then may ye also do
good, who are accustomed to Evil.</hi> Men
cannot easily <hi>unlearn</hi> what they have been
so taught or accustomed unto. The mighty
power of God on the Souls of Men, both
as unto individual Persons, and whole
Societies, is required unto this Change;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50059:55"/>
So it may be wrought and not otherwise
<hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>3. The Advantage which many make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselves, by the present posture of
things, and fear of Alterations by Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
is a Mountain in the way, a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Obstacle against entertaining serious
Thoughts about it.</p>
            <p>4. The Scripture most frequently casts
the Cause hereof on mens <hi>Security</hi> in
their Earthly Enjoyments. This keeps
them safe from hearing Gods Calls, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of his warnings: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is laid down, as the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Forerunner</hi> of all desolating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
It is at large insisted upon by our
Saviour himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
17. 26.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Security</hi> is like the Disease in
the Body, which is commonly called the
<hi>Scurvy;</hi> It is not any single <hi>Distemper</hi> or
Disease, but a Complication or Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of many prevalent Distempers. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> is not the Name of any one vicious
Habit or Inclination of the Mind, but it is
a concurrent complication of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<hi>Stupidity</hi> and Sloth, called a Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50059:56"/>
               <hi>of Slumber, Love of the world, carnal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Groundless hopes of Life,</hi> all Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Vnbelief,</hi> do concur in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
And if a Practice in a Course
of Sin, have for some season ensued on
these Principles, whereby Conscience comes
to be <hi>seared,</hi> or is made senceless, the Case
of those in whom it is, is for the most part
remediless. And not a few of this sort
are amongst us.</p>
            <p>And many other Reasons there are, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
this VVork full of <hi>Difficulty,</hi> though
it be so necessary, so just and equal. As
for those by whom all these things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
and even scoffed at, something
shall be spoken afterwards unto them, or
concerning them.</p>
            <p>But yet this Consideration ought not to
deter any from endeavouring the discharge
of their own Duty herein: For as we
have seen, it is indispensably necessary,
that we and the Nation may be saved from
desolating Judgments; so we shall see af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
how and by what means this
Difficulty may be surmounted, and those
Obstacles removed out of the way. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
happy will they be, be they ever
so few, never so Poor, never so unknown
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50059:56"/>
to the World, whom God <hi>shall find so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
when he ariseth out of his Place to
shake the Earth terribly</p>
            <p>VI. I shall therefore in the next place,
to bring all things nearer home, enquire,
What is <hi>the Nature of that Repentance and
Reformation which at this time God requires
of us all, that we may not perish in his sore
Displeasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a <hi>Devastation</hi> made of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> by sundry Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
successively, <hi>Vespasian</hi> coming to the
Government, acquainted the <hi>Senate,</hi> that
there was need of so <hi>many Millions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
that the <hi>Empire might stand;</hi> not
that it might <hi>flourish and grow vigorus,</hi>
whereunto much more was required; but
that it might be preserved from Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Ruine: And I shall propose not
what is requisite, to render the Church of
God in this Nation, orderly, beautiful,
and vigorous, but only what is necessary,
that it may <hi>stand</hi> and live, by a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from Desolating Judgments. And,</p>
            <p>1. The Repentance which in any Case,
God requireth <hi>absolutely,</hi> is that which is
<hi>internal, and real, in sincere Conversion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50059:57"/>
himself</hi> accompanied with Fruits meet
for such Repentance. So is it declared,
<hi>Ezek. 18. 30, 31 Therefore I will judge
you, O House of</hi> Israel, <hi>every one according
unto his ways, saith the Lord God: Repent
and turn your selves from all your Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
so Iniquity shall not be your Ruine.
Cast away from you all your Transgressions,
whereby you have Transgressed, and make
you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, for why
will you die, O House of Israel? A new
Heart,</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit,</hi> or real <hi>internal
Conversion</hi> unto God by the grace of the
Covenant, is required in this Repentance,
as the Renunciation and Relinquishment of
all Iniquities, must be the <hi>Fruit</hi> of it. So
also is it expressed, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 16, 17. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
purification of the heart, with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of universal Obedience, and absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of all Sin, is that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>This is that Repentance which was the
Subject of the Ministry of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;</hi>
on the neglect whereof, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the People with final Excision; which
accordingly not long after befell them, <hi>Mat.</hi>
3. 8, 9, 10. God doth not require a <hi>feigned</hi>
Repentance, or that which is meerly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50059:57"/>
and temporary: In this Case, see
<hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12, 13. But,</p>
            <p>2. Where there is Repentance and
Reformation that are <hi>real</hi> in the <hi>Root</hi> or
Cause of them, which is an effectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Sin, and Sense of ensuing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Judgments, giving testimony of
Sincerity in its Fruits, by an Abstinence
from open Provoking Sins, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of known Duties, unto its Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
in both which, a Sense and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of God is owned, though it be not
in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny, in the most, it may be in few,
<hi>absolutely sincere and holy,</hi> yet may it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
to the turning away of threatned
Judgments, at least for a season.</p>
            <p>These things therefore are required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Repentance.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A Real Conviction of Sin,</hi> in them
that are called unto it, or do make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of it. If this lie not in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
no expression of Repentance, no
Profession of Reformation is of any value
in the Sight of God: Yea, it is a Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, which is the highest Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Men without this Conviction,
may be driven to somewhat that <hi>looks like
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50059:58"/>
Repentance and Reformation;</hi> as the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Days of Fasting or Humiliation,</hi> by
outward Force or Compulsion of Law; but
there is nothing in what they do, of what
we enquire after. By such days and Ways
they shall never save the Nation, <hi>Jerem.</hi>
3. 10.</p>
            <p>2: <hi>A real Sence of Gods Displeasure,
and the Approach of desolating Judgments.</hi>
It is not enough that we have a Conviction
and Sence of our own Sins, but we must
have them also of the Sins of the Nation,
whereby God is provoked to Anger; and
Apprehensions of his Displeasure are to
influence our Minds in all that we go about
herein. Unless these abide and dwell in
our Minds, unless they accompany us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in all our Ways and Occasions,
rise and lie down with us, we shall not
cordially engage in this Duty</p>
            <p>3. Real Reformation is an <hi>Abstinence
from all known Sin,</hi> and the avowed Fruits
of a reformed Converstion are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hereunto, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>4. That it be <hi>persisted in,</hi> Hos. 6. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:50059:58"/>
On these Suppositions, that this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is usefull unto the End proposed, is
made fully evident in the Instances of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi>
and of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 21. 27, 28, 29.
<hi>Ahab</hi> in his Repentance and Humiliation,
manifested a deep Sense of the Guilt of
Sin, and Divine Displeasure. <hi>Seest thou,</hi>
saith God, to <hi>Elijah, how he humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</hi>
It might easily be known and taken
notice of. There is an Humiliation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Chap. 58.
v,</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. which God abhorreth, and
which shall be profitable for nothing. Such
have been the Humiliations among us for
the most part: But although it be the
Duty of every man, to endeavour that his
Repentance and Reformation do consist in
a sincere, internal, cordial Conversion unto
God, which the Divine Calls do intend;
without which, it will not be of advantage
unto his own Soul, as unto his eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
yet as unto the turning away of
<hi>Temporal Calamities,</hi> at least, as to the
suspension of them, such a publick Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Reformation as evidence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their Fruits, do proceed from a
real Sense of Sin and Judgment, may be
usefull and prevalent. In breif, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
which God requireth, with respect
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50059:59"/>
to his <hi>Covenant,</hi> that the Souls of men may
be saved, unto the Glory of his Grace by
Jesus Christ, is eternal, spiritual, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
whereby the whole Soul is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
changed and turned unto himself.
But as God is the supream Governour of
the World in Temporal things, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto the <hi>Dispensation of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
in Mercies and Judgments, there
may be a Repentance and Reformation,
wherein his Glory is vindicated in a visible
compliance with his Calls and Warnings,
and an Acknowledgment of him in his
righteous Judgments, which may be of
Use unto the End proposed. Besides,
where-ever there is a <hi>General Reformation
of Life</hi> sincerely attempted, it is to be
believed, that in many it is spiritual and
saving.</p>
            <p>3. The Repentance and Reformation
required, must be suited unto the <hi>State and
Condition of those who are called ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unto.</hi>
All are to consider what is amiss in them,
as unto their own State and Condition, <hi>Isai.
55. 7. Let the wicked forsake his Way, and
the unrigheous man his Thoughts,</hi> every
one his own Way and Thoughts in their
present Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50059:59"/>
Wherefore the Persons intended in
this Call, are of two sorts.</p>
            <p>1. Such as <hi>are wicked,</hi> as unto their
State and Condition, persons unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unregenerate, not born of God.</p>
            <p>And as are <hi>sincere Believers,</hi> really
converted unto God.</p>
            <p>The Call of God is unto both sorts:
Repentance and Reformation are required
of them both: And they are so in a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
unto their different conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</p>
            <p>In each of these sorts, there are <hi>various
Degrees</hi> of Sin and Provocation. Some of
the first sort are openly flagitious, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
habitual Sinners, such as whose <hi>Sins
go before-hand unto Judgment,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 24. And some are
<hi>more sober</hi> in their outward Conversation.
The Call of God respects them all in their
several degrees of sinning. Let the <hi>wicked
man</hi> forsake his Ways, and the <hi>unrighteous
man</hi> his Thoughts, those which are his
<hi>own,</hi> which are proper to him. None
doubts, unless it be themselves, that the
<hi>first sort</hi> ought to reform themselves; the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50059:60"/>
Generality of men cry out against them,
and fear, that for <hi>their Sins,</hi> especially if
they be Persons in high places, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God will come upon the Land.</p>
            <p>But if those of the <hi>other sort</hi> also, who
are apt to justifie themselves, because they
run not out unto the same <hi>Excess of Riot
with them,</hi> do not apply themselves unto
the Repentance and Reformation which
are proper unto their <hi>State and Condition,</hi>
the Will of God is not answered in his
Warnings. Yet, it is the Impenitency of
this sort of men, that is the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Symptome</hi> at this day in the Nation.
Their unshaken Security keeps all that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fear God in a trembling posture.</p>
            <p>6. It is so with <hi>Churches</hi> peculiarly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi>
and <hi>true Believers</hi> in them; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
all other true Beleivers, who walk more
at large. They also are called unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Reformation, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their State, and their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
degrees therein: For some are <hi>more
Guilty</hi> than others, in decays of Faith,
Love, Zeal, Holiness and Fruitfulness in
Obedience. with Conformity to the
World. And if their should be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Reformation in the Nation, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50059:60"/>
               <hi>provoking Sin;</hi> yet if these of <hi>this
sort,</hi> do not reform themselves, according
as their Condition doth require, the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Deliverance</hi> would scarcely be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And wo be to such persons, if through
their Neglect of their Duty, the whole
Nation should be exposed to Ruine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>4. The Reformation called for, as the
condition of escaping of impendent
Judgments, must be <hi>Vniversal,</hi> at least
<hi>General;</hi> amongst all sorts and Degrees,
all Orders and Estates of Men. All sorts
have sinned, all sorts are threatned; and
therefore Repentance is required of <hi>all,</hi> if
we would not perish. It is so of <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
and <hi>Ministers,</hi> of <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People</hi> in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country;</hi> and that
to be evidenced by its Fruits; so as that
it may be said of us <hi>See you not how they
humble themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this be so, some may be apt to
say, It seems if <hi>All</hi> do not set their Hearts
and Hands unto this Work, if <hi>All sorts</hi>
do not engage in it, there is no good effect
to be hoped or looked for: But when shall
we see any such thing? When shall we
see the <hi>Generality</hi> of all sorts of men in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50059:61"/>
this Nation cordially to go about this
Work of Repentance and Reformation?
as good therefore let it alone, as go about
to attempt it.</p>
            <p>I Answer, 1. If you cannot be <hi>content to
perish</hi> with the impenitent and unreformed,
you may chuse to do as they do: If you
would avoid their Punishment, you must
avoid their Sin, especially their refusal to
turn on the Call of God.</p>
            <p>2. Some must <hi>begin this Work,</hi> and be
exemplary unto others. And blessed are
they of the Lord, who shall receive the
Grace and Honour so to do, Let us not
then sit looking on others to see what
they will do, but immediately engage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our own Duty.</p>
            <p>3. The duty herein, of <hi>no one private
Person,</hi> much less of whole Churches shall
be lost, though the Nation should not be
reformed in general. For,</p>
            <p>1, They <hi>shall deliver their own Souls</hi> and
if they be not saved (as I believe they
would be in an eminent manner) from
somewhat of the outward part of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Calamity, yet they should be from all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50059:61"/>
the Wrath and Displeasure of God in it.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>few,</hi> for ought I know, <hi>one man,</hi>
may sometimes prevail with <hi>God,</hi> for the
suspending, at least of Judgments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto a whole Nation. And hereby,</p>
            <p>3. They shall give unto others a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Season of Repentance,</hi> which God can
bless and make effectual unto them. There
are therefore blessed Encouragements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Churches, unto all individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to endeavour a compliance with the
present Calls of <hi>God,</hi> though <hi>the Body of
the People should not be gathered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. Our next Enquiry is, <hi>Whence, or
from what Causes such a Reformation may
be expected, as may be useful unto the turning
away of impendent Judgments?</hi> And these
Causes are either supream, or Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>The Supream Cause hereof, must be
the <hi>Sovereign Grace of God,</hi> in fresh Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of his Spirit on the Souls of Men, to
turn them unto himself. Without this,
all other ways and means of attaining it
will be in vain. This is every where in
the Scripture attested unto, as the only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50059:62"/>
efficient Cause of the Conversion
of Men unto God. And unto that State
are things come to amongst us, that unless
we are made partakers of it in a some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than <hi>ordinary manner,</hi> our
Breaches cannot be healed; Whether we
have Grounds or no to expect any such
thing, shall be afterwards considered: At
present there seems to be no other hopes
of it, but only because it is a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Act
of Divine Grace, which hath been exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
in the Church of old. There
seems indeed rather as yet, to be a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
drawing of the Communications of the
Holy spirit in effectually prevalent Grace,
on the part of God, and a contempt of
them, on the part of Men: But Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
can conquer all Obstacles. This way
did God heal and recover his Church of
old when all other Means, all Mercies,
Afflictions and Judgments failed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. And it
may at present be for a Lamentation, that
this work of Grace is so disregarded by
the most, so <hi>despised by many,</hi> and so little
cried for by the Residue. But without it,
in vain shall we use any other Remedies,
we shall not be healed. It is not the best
Projections of men for Reformation by
this or that Order or State of things in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50059:62"/>
Church or State, that <hi>without this,</hi> will be
of advantage unto us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Subordinate Causes</hi> hereof, must be
the diligent Discharge of their Duty, by
<hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall but name these things, that I give
no place to Complaints or Indignation,
though just and almost necessary. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As unto the Furtherance of it by
<hi>Magistrates,</hi> it must consist in three
Things.</p>
            <p>1. By evidencing that the <hi>Promotion</hi> of
it is their <hi>Interest.</hi> Unless it be understood
so to be, whatever else they do in the
Countenance of it, will be of no Use
nor Advantage. For this is that which
the <hi>Generality</hi> will conform unto, or
comply with all. And if it be once under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that <hi>Reformation</hi> is what they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi>
what they <hi>design,</hi> what they place
their <hi>cheif Interest</hi> in, as it was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Hezekiah, Josiah,</hi> and others, it will
have an Influence on the People, not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
unto what the Design of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in
pursuit of his corrupt Interest, had on
the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> to sin, All other
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50059:63"/>
Means are dead, unless they are enlivened
by an Evidence of Reality in the Minds of
Magistrates, and an high Concernment in
the prosperity of their Work. Let them
make what Laws and Orders they please,
appoint what outward Means they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
unless it be made uncontroulably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it is their <hi>Cordial Design,</hi> and
what they place their <hi>Cheif Interest</hi> in,
they will not be available. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</p>
            <p>2. The due Execution of Laws against
<hi>Flagitious Immoralities.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>3. An encouraging Example in their
own persons; without which, all things
will grow worse and worse, whatever else
be done. Men seem to be weary in some
measure, of the <hi>dismal Effects of Sin;</hi>
but they seem not to be <hi>weary of Sin.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this weariness, they yet want Motives,
Encouragements and Examples. And it is
strange unto me, that in all our Fears and
Dangers, in the Divisions of our Councels,
and Confusions amongst all sorts of Men,
under an high Profession of Zeal for the
<hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> in the Nation, and
the Preservation of it, that this only Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for our Relief and Safety lies wholly
neglected,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50059:63"/>
As unto <hi>Ministers,</hi> the Faithful Discharge
of his Duty in Preaching, Prayer, and
Example is required hereunto. Should I
stay to shew the necessity hereof at this
season; as also what is required thereunto,
what <hi>Care,</hi> what <hi>Diligence,</hi> what <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi>
what <hi>Compassion,</hi> what <hi>Zeal,</hi> what
<hi>Exercise of all Gospel-Grace,</hi> with the
<hi>over-Neglect</hi> of these things among many,
it would take up a Volume, rather than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Place in this present Enquiry.</p>
            <p>But I proceed unto that which is more
our immediate Concernment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>VIII. What if all these Means do fail?
what if all Expectations from them be in
vain? What is incumbent on them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
who are really sensible of these things;
namely of the abounding of provoking Sins,
and the near Approach of deserved Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p>That which I design herein, is to give
some Directions, as unto what <hi>Frame of
Heart</hi> ought to be found in us, and the
<hi>Practice of what Duties</hi> we ought to be
found in at such a Season as this is. It is
no common, no easie thing to wait for the
<hi>Lord in the way of his Judgments, Isai.</hi> 26,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50059:64"/>
8, 9. There is inward Soul-work night
and day, as well as outward Duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto it. That God may be <hi>Glorified</hi>
in a due manner, that we may be <hi>found in
Peace,</hi> whatever be the Event of things;
that we may be <hi>usefull</hi> unto others; and
in all serve the Will of God in our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
are all expected from us in a way of
Duty,</p>
            <p>Unto this End, the ensuing Directions
may be made use of.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Take heed of stout-heartedness, and a
Contempt or neglect thereby of Divine Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
There is a Generation, who either
really, or in pretence, are bold, fearless,
stout-hearted, regardless of these things;
they seem to provoke and dare God to do
his utmost, all that he seems to threaten.
So they speak, <hi>Isai. 5, 19. Let him make
speed, and hasten his Work, that we may see
it; and let the Counsel of the Holy One of</hi>
Israel <hi>draw nigh, that we may know it.</hi> Here
is much talk indeed of the Judgments of
God, and of their near Approach; When
shall we see them? why do not they come?
when shall he bring forth his Work?</p>
            <p>This hath been the great Controversie
between the Church and the wicked World
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50059:64"/>
from the beginning of it. Those that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feared God, were always testifying that
God <hi>would come,</hi> and take vengeance on
them for their Impieties and Impenitency.
But because these Judgments were not
speedily executed, the sinful world did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
despise their warnings, and scoff at
their Message, So <hi>Enoch</hi> the seventh from
<hi>Adam,</hi> he Preached and Prophesied of
these things; namely of the <hi>Coming of
God to take vengeance of ungodly men,</hi> Jude
14, 15. And this Message was scoffed at,
as is evident, because no Reformation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
thereon, until the Flood took them
all away. So was it with <hi>Noah,</hi> and his
Preaching; and so it hath been with all
that fear <hi>God,</hi> in their several Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and this was one especial thing that
the Pagans laughed and mocked at the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians about; as is plain in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>'s
<hi>Philopatr.</hi> So the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> gives
us an Account both of what was past, and
what would afterwards come to pass, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 3, 4, 5, 6. unto the End.</p>
            <p>And such as these abound amongst us:
All the <hi>Warnings</hi> of God have been turned
into <hi>Ridicule,</hi> previous Judgments despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and Sin it self made a Scoff of. But
of all others, God most abhorreth this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50059:65"/>
sort of Men. They are said to be <hi>far from
Righteousness,</hi> Isai. 46. 12. Unto such he
speaks in his Wrath, <hi>Hear ye despisers,
wonder, and perish.</hi> Yea, the Scripture is
full with the severest Threatnings against
this sort of men; nor shall any in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
season, drink deeper of the Cup
of Gods Indignation. See <hi>Isai: 28, 14, 15.
Deut.</hi> 29. 19. 20. Such secure Despisers,
such Scoffers at approaching Judgments,
such Deriders of the Signs and Tokens of
them God will deal withal. And some
there are, who it may be, not from the same
Spirit of open Prophaneness, but out of
Prejudices, corrupt Arguings, pretended
Observations of things past, Disbelief of
all they do not feel, and such like effects
of long Security, do utterly scorn and scoff
at all these things. They account it a
matter of <hi>Weakness, Pusillanimity,</hi> or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
to concern themselves in these
warnings of Providence, or the explication
of them by the Word: but their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sleepeth not. And it may be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and will be found true, that when
Judgments do really approach, of all sorts
of men, they are the most <hi>cowardly,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
fearfull and void of Counsel: For
when God begins to deal with them, their
hearts cannot indure, nor their hands be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50059:65"/>
strong, He smites through their loins, and
filleth them with a Spirit of horrour and
fear, that they shall tremble like the Leaves
of the Forrest. In that day you may say unto
them, as <hi>Zebul</hi> did to boasting <hi>Gaal,</hi> upon
the Approach of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> his Enemy,
<hi>Where is now thy Mouth wherewith thou
saidst, Who is Abimelech?</hi> Where is now your
Mouth and your Vauntings, with respect
unto these Judgments of God? So <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi>
the Prophet told <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the false
Prophet, in his Boasting and Confidence
of Success, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22. 25. With all thy
confidence &amp; boasting, thou shalt be one of
the first that shall endeavour to fly and hide
thy self. Yea, this sort of persons are
commonly the most ridiculous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
when real Danger overtakes
them, of any sort of men in the world.</p>
            <p>That which God requires of us in such
a season, is called in Scripture <hi>Trembling;
They that tremble at my word.</hi> This he
regards, this he accepts, this he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
of, <hi>Isai. 66. 2, 5. Jer.</hi> 5. 22. It is not
a weakning, an astonishing, heartless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
of Spirit that is intended; not
such a Dread and Terrour as should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us in the chearfull performance of
Duty, and preparation to comply with
the will of God, Such is that mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50059:66"/>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 18, 66, 67. which is the most
severe of judgments. But it is an awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of the Greatness and Holiness of
God, in the way of his Judgments, casting
out all carnal Security, Self-confidence,
and contempt of Divine warnings, so
bringing the soul into a submissive compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the will of God in all things.
But look well in the first place, that this
Evil on no pretences do make any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
unto you.</p>
            <p>If one Evil seems to be diverted, do not
say with <hi>Agag, surely the bitterness of
Death is past;</hi> which will prove an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into this evill Frame, and so grow
regardless of your Duty: God expects
other things from you. <hi>The Lion,</hi> saith
he, <hi>hath roared, who will not fear?</hi> Amos
3. 8. There is the Voice of a Lion roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his Prey, in the present Divine
Warnings: Take heed that you despise
not that, which when it comes to pass,
you can neither abide, nor avoid.</p>
            <p>2. Take heed of a Frame of heart that
is <hi>regardless</hi> of these things We have a
sort of Men, who although they will not,
they dare not openly, as others, despise
Divine Warnings, yet they see all things
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50059:66"/>
in such a Light, as suffers them not to take
Notice of any Concernment of their own
in them, <hi>Psal. 28. 5. Jer.</hi> 36. 24. The
Land is <hi>filled</hi> with <hi>Sin;</hi> it is true, but they
are the Sins of other men, not theirs;
<hi>There are Tokens and Signs of Gods Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure</hi>
in Heaven above, and the Earth
beneath, but men are not agreed whether
these things be of any signification or no;
some say Yea, and some Nay; but they
are new and strange, and so are meet to
be the Subject of Discourse; <hi>previous
Judgments have been upon us;</hi> they are but
such Accidents as fall out frequently in the
world. But <hi>the Divisions among our selves,
and contrivances of our Adversaries,</hi> seem
to threaten Ruine to the Nation; it may
be so; but these things belong unto our
Rulers; and Men are divided about this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
some say one thing, and some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Some say there was a Plot, and
some say there was none. In the mean
time, they are <hi>filled with their own Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and will not be diverted from them,
unto any serious regard of God in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Dispensations; like the <hi>wild Ass in
her occasion, who can turn her away?</hi> Jer.
1. 24. Of this Frame the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
as that which God will surely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<hi>Isa. 26. 11. Lord, when thy Hand
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50059:67"/>
is lifted up, they will not see; but they shall
see and be ashamed, for their Envy at the
People; yea the Fire of thine Enemies shall
devour them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others look on all things in another
Light, and under another Notion; for
whereas it is part of our Sin and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this Nation, an evident fruit of
the Evil of our ways, that we are <hi>divided
into Designing Parties</hi> the one seeking the
Ruine of the other, they consider all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
as relating unto such Differences.
This gives them a zealous Concernment in
them, and continued Talk about them;
but the Will, Work and Design of God
in them is not laid to heart.</p>
            <p>Some are so well pleased with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Advantages, in Promotions, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Wealth, as their Interest, that
they cannot endure to think of these
things. Whatever warnings are portend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of approaching Judgments, they look
on them as the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of such as have
ill will against them, and would have these
things to portend their Trouble: Guilt
makes them fearful and sensible: and they
think it best to hide those things from
themselves, which, if they are so, they
cannot remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:50059:67"/>
To free us from this Miscarriage also
this unanswerableness unto the Mind of
God in his present Dispensation, we may
consider,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>a deep consideration of , and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Mind of God in such a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as we have described, is required of us in
a way of Duty.</hi> It is our Sin to neglect it,
and that attended with many Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is not a thing that <hi>we may attend
unto</hi> or <hi>omit</hi> as it seems convenient; but it
is required as <hi>a Duty</hi> of us, without which
we cannot Glorifie God in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>He that is not daily exercised with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
Thoughts about the present ways
of God in the Approach of his Judgments,
lives in such <hi>a Neglect of Duty,</hi> as will
bring in a Negligence and Coldness in all
other Duties whatsoever; for this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that when God calls unto any espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Duty in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> way or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
in any season, those by whom it is
neglected, are really cold, formal, and
negligent in all other ordinary Duties
whatever. That Grace which will not be
excited unto especiall Duties on extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50059:68"/>
occasions, is very lifeless in all other
things. This is the best Note to try, if
not the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet the <hi>Power</hi> of Grace.
When it is in its vigor and due exercise,
it makes the Soul to be ready, inclinable and
disposed unto all Intimations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will and Pleasure; as speaks the
Psalmist; <hi>Thou shalt guide me by thine Eye
and lead me with thy counsel.</hi> He attended
to each Look and Guidance of Divine
Providence to company with it, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
must be forced with strong <hi>Curbs
and Bridles, like the Horse and Mule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is such a Duty, as whereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Wisdom and Diligence are required.
We think it needfull to use our Wisdom
about other things, our own Affairs: But
in this it is most necessary. <hi>The Voice of
the Lord crieth unto the City, the Man of
Wisdom shall see thy Name;</hi> Micah 6. 9.
Ordinary, slight and transient Thoughts
will not answer this Duty. Such, all men
that are sober cannot but have; and their
Discourse is answerable thereunto. But
Consideration with Diligence and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is required of us: Let these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
be consulted to this purpose, <hi>Psal.
65. 9. Deut. 12. 10. Hos. 4. last. Psal.</hi>
107. 43. Prayer, Study and Meditation
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50059:68"/>
are all diligently to be engaged herein.</p>
            <p>2. Take heed of <hi>vain Confidences.</hi> Men
are apt in such seasons, to fix on one thing
or other, wherewith they relieve and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
themselves. And there is not any
thing that is more effectual to keep them
off from this Duty, and the Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which is required in them. If you
speak with any man almost, you may with
a little heed discover wherein his <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
doth lie, and what it is that he trusts
unto. But saith the Prophet unto such
persons, <hi>The Lord hath rejected thy Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and thou shalt not prosper in them,
Jer.</hi> 2. 37.</p>
            <p>There are sundry sorts of <hi>vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi>
wherewith men are apt to relieve
their Minds in such a season, so as to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
themselves in their Security and
a Neglect of this especial Duty. Two in
particular I shall onely mention, as I do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
name the Heads of things, which might
be much enlarged.</p>
            <p>I. The first is <hi>some certain Priviledges,</hi>
whereon they trust for an exemption from
common Calamities: they are the <hi>Church,</hi>
they are the <hi>People of God,</hi> they are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50059:69"/>
from the world, and persecuted by
it; and hence there is a secret Reserve in
their Minds, that indeed they shall not be
in trouble as other men. So was it with
the <hi>Jews</hi> of old; when they were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Judgments of God for their
Sins, and called thereon to Repentance,
they justified themselves in their ways,
and despised all Divine warnings, on a
Confidence they had in their Church-Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.
They cried against the Prophet,
<hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the
Lord, the Temple of the Lord are these,</hi> and
no evil shall come nigh us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. And
in confidence hereof, namely, that they
were the Church, and enjoyed the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
belonging thereunto, and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Worship of God therein, they gave
themselves up unto all abominable Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
under an Assurance of Impunity
by their priviledges as the prophet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids
them, <hi>v. 8. 9. Behold ye trust in
lying words that cannot profit. Will you steal,
murder, and commit Adultery, and swear
falsly, and burn Incense unto</hi> Baal, <hi>and
walk after other Gods whom ye know not;
and say you shal be delivered?</hi> At this
day all sorts of men claim a Refuge in
their priviledges. Those who design the
Ruine of the Nation, and of all true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50059:69"/>
therein, do it with <hi>Confidence</hi> of
Success from hence, That <hi>they are the
Church,</hi> That the <hi>Temple of God</hi> is with
them, That all the priviledges belonging
unto the Church are theirs, and so are the
Promises made unto it. And such is the
infatuating Efficacy of their prejudicate
peswasion herein, that it hath had two
marvellous Effects; the one against the
<hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and the other against
the <hi>Fundamental Principals</hi> of Religion.</p>
            <p>For first, Under the Influence of this
confidence, they have engaged into as
<hi>vile Immoralities</hi> as ever were perpetrated
under the Sun. Murder, Persecution, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinations,
Dying in Falshoods, with a
general Design to pursue the same ways
unto the utmost, in the Destruction of
multitudes of innocent persons; as they
did formerly in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But what if they
do all those <hi>Abominations?</hi> Yet they are
the <hi>Church;</hi> the promises and priviledges
of it are theirs, and all they do is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with God; a principal tending directly
to the vilest Atheism.</p>
            <p>Again, Although God in a marvellous,
yea a miraculous manner, hath discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and frustrated their Hellish Designs-and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50059:70"/>
brought many of them into the Pit
they digged for others, yet they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of <hi>no Rebuke from God,</hi> but go on in
an obstinate Presumption that <hi>they are the
Church,</hi> and shall prevaile at last. And
<hi>that Church</hi> which shall prevail by these
Means, no doubt they are. Some indeed
pretend highly <hi>to be the Church,</hi> but they
lay claim, so far as I can find, to no other
Advantages thereby, but <hi>Dignities</hi> and
<hi>Promotions.</hi> And others also are apt to
relieve themselves with this Confidence,
that they are <hi>the People of God,</hi> and shall
have an especial interest in Deliverance on
that Account. And I say, far be it from
me, to weaken any perswasion of Gods
especial Regard of those that are truly his.
God hath a peculiar People in the World,
let the World scoss at it whilst they please,
unto whom all the Promises of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and all the Priviledges of the Church
do belong. These Promises they ought
to mix with Faith, and plead before God
continually and they shall be all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
towards them in the way and time
of Gods appointment. Nor do any sort
of dissenting Professions, as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that I know of, appropriate this
Right and Priviledge unto themselves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the exclusion of others; but extend it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50059:70"/>
to all who are sincere Believers. But this
is that which I say concerning all sorts of
men. That if an Apprehension or Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that they are the <hi>Church or People of
God,</hi> do keep them off from that Duty
of Repentance and Reformation, which
God cals unto, it is a <hi>Confidence</hi> which
God rejecteth, and in which they will not
prosper. I desire to ask of any, Hath
not the Church sinned? Have not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
sinned? Are there not sins amongst
us against the Lord our God, proper unto
our State, and according to our Measure?
If it be so, our being <hi>the People of God,</hi>
any of us, if we are so, <hi>unless we repent,</hi>
doth only, as unto these Providential Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations,
expose us unto his just Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for <hi>Judgment must begin at the House
of God; it must begin at us.</hi> Take heed
of this failing <hi>Reserve:</hi> I have observed
much Security to arise from hence, and
great Negligence of known Duties. If
you are the People of God, you had the
more need to tremble at his Judgments,
and at the Tokens of his displeasure. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ought it to be so with you at this
Day, when God seems in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to be displeased with the <hi>Rivers,</hi> as
the Prophet speaks, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 8. Those
who should send forth streams of refesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50059:71"/>
unto the Nation. To me at present
all things appear in that condition, That
there is <hi>no Reserve</hi> left as unto publick
Judgments, but only in <hi>Sovereign Grace
and Mercy,</hi> to be waited for in a way of
<hi>Repentance and Reformation.</hi> As unto our
priviledges, God speaks unto us, as he did
to the people of old, concerning their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
<hi>Exod. 33. 5. Put them off, that I
may know to do unto you.</hi> We are to
lay aside our pleas and pretences, beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our selves to Sovereign Grace and
Mercy alone.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Another Ground of vain confidence
may be,</hi> an unjust Expectation of such an
Accomplishment of Scripture-Promises, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
and Predictions, as are not applicable
unto our present Condition.</p>
            <p>It is undeniable that there are such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
prophesies and predictions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Deliverance of the Church, the
Ruine of its Adversaries, the Glory and
Beauty of the Kingdom of Christ, as those
intended. For although the most of that
kind in the old Testament, are of a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Interpretation,</hi> and have their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
in all the Elect in every Age,
whatever be their outward State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50059:71"/>
yet that there are such also as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the <hi>State of the Church in this World,</hi>
and the Ruine of all its <hi>Antichristian Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
with Peace and Glory ensuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>And concerning them, we may observe
sundry things, that we may not abuse them
into vain <hi>groundless Confidences</hi> in such
a Season this as is.</p>
            <p>1. That we ought to have a <hi>firm Faith</hi>
of their Accomplishment in their proper
Season. The Rule of them all is that of
the Prophet; <hi>I the Lord will hasten it in
his time,</hi> Isai. 60. 22. As it is also, <hi>Hab.</hi>
2. 2, 3. Though they seem to be prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and <hi>tarry</hi> beyond their proper season,
yet they have their <hi>fixed and determinate
time,</hi> beyond which they shall not tarry.
And two things I would offer on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>1. That we are not <hi>only to believe their
Accomplishment,</hi> but to be in the Actual
Exercise of Faith about it. For without
this, we shall want a great supportment
of patient long-suffering in every time of
Trial. And by this Faith do we take in
the Power and Comfort of things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50059:72"/>
things not actually enjoyed. For Faith
is <hi>the Substance of things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11
1. that which gives a previous subsistance
in the Mind and Soul, as unto the benefit
and comfort of them, of <hi>the things hoped
for.</hi> And those whose Minds are exercised
unto these things, do know what benefit
they have by such a preception of them.
They are carryed sometimes by a way of
believing into Communion with them who
lived in the Old World, as they had with
us in the expectation of what we enjoy; and
into the same kind of Communion with
those who herafter shall enjoy the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of those Promises which may be
yet afar off.</p>
            <p>2. This Faith ought to be most firm
when all things seem to conspire in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the Accomplishment of such Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
not only improbable, but also impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as unto present outward Causes, as in
the State of things at this day in the world.
There are no visible or appearing means of
the fulfilling any of them; yet the whole
World is joyned in a conspiracy to defeat
them; but true Faith riseth against those
Oppositions, and is prevalent against them
all.</p>
            <p>For having God alone, his Power, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50059:72"/>
and Truth for its Objects, it values
not the Opposition that men can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. That shall be done in this
kind, which God is able to do, let men do
what they please. God laughs all their
proud Attempts to scorn, and so may the
<hi>Virgin Daughter of Sion</hi> also.</p>
            <p>2 It is our Duty <hi>to pray for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of all the Promises and Predictions</hi>
that are on Record in the book of God
concerning the Kingdom of Christ and his
Church in this World. God will do these
things, yet for all of them, he will be
sought unto <hi>by the house of Israel.</hi> This
hath been the Practice of Believers in all
ages both under the Old Testament and
the New, Prayer for the accomplishment
of Promises, hath been the Life-breath of
the Church in all Ages; and Faith hereby
brings in great refreshment unto the Soul.
And the greatest Evidence of its approach
will be a plentiful effusion of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the hearts of Believers, be they few
or more at any time in the World, stirring
them up and enabling them to pray effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
and fervently for their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as in the Example of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap.
9. 1, 2, 3. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:50059:73"/>
3. There are three things considerable
in such Promises and Predictions.</p>
            <p>1. The Grace and Mercy that is in
them.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>suitableness</hi> of that Grace and
Mercy unto the State of Believers at any
time.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Litteral Accomplishment</hi> of them
in their outward Circumstance. The two
former belong unto us at all times, and
we may plead with God in Faith, for the
Effects of them in all our Trials and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses.</p>
            <p>With respect hereunto, it is, that the
People of God have Faith in him against
the World, with all their Enemies and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors,
which they have been so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
withal, as the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> was
with his Faith unto the same Purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi>
22. 8. When thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seem to go evil with
them, when they are shut up in the hands
of their Enemies and Oppressors, as the
Lord Christ was upon the Cross, the
World is ready to approach them with
their Confidence in God, and there own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves to be his People; but they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50059:73"/>
faint not herein. However things may
go for a season, they are secur'd of the
Grace and Mercy which is the Promises,
which are suited unto all their Wants, all
that they can desire absolutely; yea, their
full Deliverance, when it is best for them:
But,</p>
            <p>4. Remember, That as unto the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi>
of the Accomplishment of such
Promises and Predictions in their outward
Effects, unto certain Times and Seasons,
many have been wofully mistaken, which
hath been the Ground and occasion of very
scandalous Miscarriages: The World hath
scarce seen greater outrages of Sin and
Wickedness that have been countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by this Pretence, that <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a
time was now come, and that therein <hi>such</hi>
and <hi>such</hi> things were to be done by those
who made such Interpretations and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
For when such a Conceit befalls
the Minds of men, it sets them loose
from all Rules but their own Inclinations
And many have from such Apprehensions
fallen under sad and scandalous disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
VVherefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such an Expectation</hi> or Confidence of
the Events of Promises, Prophesies, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50059:74"/>
Predictions, as hinders men from apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Minds throughly unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Duties that God calls for, is heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be watched against. I have heard
many arguing and pleading for the
strengthening of such Confidences, but I
never saw good effect of them; they please
for the present, they profit not.</p>
            <p>The Story of the Prophets <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
and <hi>Hananiah,</hi> is applicable in this case,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 28. And it is certain that before the
Final Destruction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> that
which principally hardened the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their utter Ruine, so as they would
hearken neither to the Voice of God nor
man for their safety, was a Presumption
they had, that at <hi>that time</hi> their <hi>Messiah</hi>
would come and save them,</p>
            <p>6. Few know of what sort <hi>Day of
the Lord</hi> will be, which they desire long
for an expect. We know how it proved
unto the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Mal. 3. 1. 2,
A Day may be coming, which, although
it may be a glorious Issue, yet it may
consume all the Hopes that men have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
up in their expectation of it. But I
will not touch farther on these things:
My Design is only to take us all off from
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50059:74"/>
such vain Confidences as may obstruct us
in a diligent attendance unto those Duties,
which God at this season calls us unto;
which shall be declared immediately.</p>
            <p>3. Some place their Confidence in <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Reserves</hi> which they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that however it go with others,
yet they shall escape well enough. They
are <hi>rich,</hi> and they intend to be <hi>wise:</hi> They
intend not to be ingaged in any thing <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
or <hi>Religious,</hi> that should prejudice
them in their Possessions: whilst things
pass at the cheap rate of talking, they
will be like unto others; but when Trials
come, they will make a safe Retreat. We
have their character and their Doom, <hi>Jer.</hi>
28. 15, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>4. A Fourth Direction for our Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in such a season is, That <hi>we diligently
consider and search our own hearts, and ways,
to find out and understand how it is between
God and our Souls.</hi> This Direction is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us <hi>Lam. 3. 39. 40. Wherefore doth a
living man complain, a man for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Sins? Let us search and try our
ways, and turn again to the Lord.</hi> When
Trials and Punishments draw nigh, or
are upon us, it is not our Business nor Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50059:75"/>to lie <hi>complaining</hi> under them, but so to <hi>search and try our Ways,</hi> as <hi>to turn unto the Lord.</hi> This is the first word of the voice of God in approaching Judgments, <hi>Search your selves, try your hearts and your ways,</hi> try how it is with you. At such a season to pass by the consideration of our selves, of our State, of our VValk, of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in an ordinary manner, or with slight
or common thoughts, is to despise the Voice of God. God speaks aloud, the <hi>Voice of God cryeth unto the City</hi>; he doth so by the ways before-mentioned; he speaks articulately, distinctly, so as that <hi>a man of Wisdom may see his Name,</hi> and know his mind; he speaks unto us; and says, <hi>Search now your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this Search, respect is to be had unto the things ensuing.</p>
            <p>1. In general, Search into your <hi>State and Condition</hi>; try whether it be built on a good foundation; on the <hi>Rock</hi> by Faith; or on the <hi>Sand,</hi> by Profession only; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will hold his Trial who will bring it to the Refiners fire; <hi>He shall slay the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite with the breath of his mouth.</hi> And many dreadfull Discoveries will be made of the false and rotten States of men when<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50059:75"/>the Lords day of Trial shall come. This is one certain End of a fiery Trial; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to discover and consume the <hi>Profession of Hypocrites,</hi> as hath been done in part already.</p>
            <p>2. With respect unto those Ways and Sins which are the <hi>peculiarly provoking sins</hi> of Churches and Professors; such as the Lord Christ testifieth his Displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst in them, and which may have as great an influence into the procurement of temporal Judgments, as the more flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sins of open Sinners: such are <hi>Decays in Love, Zeal</hi> and <hi>Fruits of Obedience,</hi> want of Delight, VVarmth and Life in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Gospel-VVorship: with Pride, Elation of Mind, Self-conceit, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness in good VVorks. If we would know what are the Sins in Churches and Professors, that the Lord Christ is so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with us, as to threaten his departing from them, we cannot better learn it, than in the Declaration of his Mind, which he makes unto the Churches of <hi>Asia, Rev</hi> 2 and 3. And these are the things which he chargeth on them: For persons under the Capacities of Church-Members and Professors, to content themselves with <hi>such a Search</hi> of their outward Actions <pb n="136" facs="tcp:50059:76"/>
and Duties, of all sorts, Religious, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Civil, as none may justly cast blame
upon them, it know way answers the <hi>search</hi>
that God calls them unto. How is it as
unto the inward frame of the heart?
What is the vigour and power of Faith
and Love in you? how do they act them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
what is your real delight in the
ways of God? Where is your Fruitfulness
in works of Charity and Mercy? VVhere
is your readiness to forgive your Enemies?
Are there no Failings, no Decays in these
things? Are there no Indispositions,
Deadness and Coldness in Duties, grown
upon you? How is it as unto constant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
on spiritual things, and the fixing
your Affections on things that are above?
VVith respect unto these things, ought
we to <hi>search our selves diligently</hi> in such a
Day as this is; and if we find our selves
under <hi>Decays</hi> in them, let us know of a
truth that God calls us unto Repentance
or pain of his highest Displeasure.</p>
            <p>For our parts, we cannot search into,
we cannot judge the hearts of others, any
other way but by the <hi>Application</hi> of the
Word unto their Consciences. But I must
needs say, That if mens outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be an Indication of the inward frame
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50059:76"/>
of their Minds, there is reason enough
for the most of us to be jealous over our
selves herein.</p>
            <p>2. With respect unto your <hi>Callings,
Circumstances</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> and the
Sins that are peculiar unto them. There
are Sins which are very apt to insinuate
themselves into the <hi>Callings</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
of men, both of high and low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that do <hi>easily beset them;</hi> as Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Oppression, Severity and Unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
in those that are great, and have
large Possessions; and Deceit, Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Over-reaching, in those of more
ordinary Employments. I speak not of
these at present: They are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those <hi>which go before-hand unto Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
But these things, namely, mens
<hi>Callings, Circumstances</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi>
are apt to influence their Mind with vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Habits, and to render their ways crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Pride of Life, Self-Conceit, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in holy Duties, Destempered Passions</hi>
and <hi>Lusts, devouring Cares, carnal Fears,</hi>
with other hurtful Evils, do spring from
these things, if not watched against. In
reference unto them therefore are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to search our selves in Day wherein
God is pleading with us. With respect
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50059:77"/>
unto them ought we to be exceding jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
over our selves; for verily they have
rendred the VVays and VValkings of the
Generality of Professors a great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
unto Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>4. In an especial manner with a respect
unto <hi>Love of the World,</hi> and conformity
thereunto. This is that which the Lord
Jesus Christ will not alwaies bear withal in
his Churches; for it lies in opposition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole work of Faith, and all the
Precepts of the Gospel; It is not against
this or that Command only, but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the whole Design of the Gospel,
and the Grace administred therein.</p>
            <p>Now at present concerning our outward
Conformity unto the VVorld there needs
no <hi>great Search</hi> to be made: it is open
and evident unto all; so that as unto At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
Fashions, manner of ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Mispence of Time, Feastings of
rich ones, and Jolities, there is little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
left between Professors and the
World, which God will not long bear
with them in; especially not in those who
have increased their wealth in, and grown
into Conformity with the VVorld, whilst
others under the same Profession, have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50059:77"/>
been harrassed, imprisoned, impoverished
and ruined by the VVorld. And as for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Love</hi> unto the VVorld, I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
so often to it, treated so much of it,
that I shall not here again insist upon it: I
shall only say, that when men grow proud,
high-minded, and value themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the increase of their earthly
Enjoyments, and think themselves wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if others do not also so value them, it
is in vain for them to pretend that their
hearts do not inordinately cleave unto the
VVorld, and the things of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Self-Searching</hi> is the first Duty we
are at this season called unto; and if we
are negligent or overly herein, we shall
not answer the Mind and VVill of God in
any one Duty or Instance of any other
kind. VVe are therefore herein to call in
God and Men unto our Aid and Assistance
as also to stir up our selves unto it with
Diligence and Perseverance. So the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,</hi>
lest, he should not be able to make a
diligent effectual Examination of himself
and his ways, cries unto God, to <hi>search
and try him,</hi> that he might be known unto
himself, especially with respect unto any
<hi>evil way of Sin</hi> or wickedness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.
23, 24. So we ought to cry for fresh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50059:78"/>
of the Holy Spirit of God in
his <hi>convincing Efficacy,</hi> to acquaint us
throughly with our selves, and to deliver
us from all self-deceivings in this matter.
For when we go about this Search, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pretences and arguings will arise, to
the Concealment or Countenance of Self
and Sin, against a Discovery and Pursuit.
Nothing can remove and scatter them, but
the power of the Holy Spirit acting in his
convincing Efficacy. The whole Deceit
of the heart in such a season will be put
forth, to hide, palliate, excuse and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
such Frames and actings as ought
to be seized on and brought to Judgment.
There is need of the <hi>Candle of the Lord
to search the inward parts of the Belly,</hi> Prov.
20. 27. of Spiritual Light, to look into
the secret recesses of the Mind and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to discover what is amiss in them.
And there is need of Spiritual Strength,
to <hi>cast</hi> down all the <hi>Srong holds</hi> and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
of Sin, which will be all set up
at such a time, and will not be demolished
or scattered without powerfull actings of
Grace. This therefore in the first place,
we are to apply our selves unto, if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any Success in this work of Self-Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:50059:78"/>
So also are we to pray, that the <hi>Word</hi>
in the <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Dispensation</hi> of it,
may be effectual unto the same End, that
we may find it <hi>quick and powerfull,</hi> Heb. 4.
12. that it may so judge the <hi>Secrets of our
Hearts,</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 25. that we may fall
down and judge our selves also. To hide
our selves at such a season,, from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Word, is an open Evidence of
a ruining Security.</p>
            <p>This Work in the use of these Means,
is to be called over and persisted in, if we
design a Compliance with the present Calls
of God, or an Endeavour to be found of
him in Peace, when he cometh.</p>
            <p>5. To be deeply <hi>humbled before the Lord</hi>
for our own Sins, with a Relinquishment
of them all thereon, is the principal part
of our Duty in this Season. This the whole
Scripture testifieth unto, speaking of these
things. Without this, all that we do, or
can do, signifies nothing as unto a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the Calls of God. This is the
End of the Search before insisted on. We
are to find out, to know every one the
<hi>Plague,</hi> the stroke, the Disease of his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50059:79"/>
own Heart, so as to be <hi>humbled</hi> before the
Lord for it.</p>
            <p>And unto this Humiliation it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</p>
            <p>1. That it be <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>sincere.</hi> There
is an Humiliation commonly expressing it
self in the Observation of <hi>Days of Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Prayer,</hi> which oftentimes is but the
<hi>Hanging down of the Head like a Bulrush for
a Day.</hi> However, it may be so carried
sometimes, as to divert or prolong the
Execution of threatned Judgments: But
that which God requireth of us, is to be
in the <hi>fixed Affections of the Heart.</hi> VVhen
the Lord Christ comes to enjoyn Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Reformation, he gives himself
that Title, <hi>I am he that searcheth the Reins
and Hearts,</hi> Rev. 2. 23. It is an internal
hidden work, which he looks after in our
Humiliation for Sin. So saith <hi>David</hi> in
the same Case; <hi>Thou requirest Truth in the
inward parts,</hi> Psal. 51. Truth or Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Affections, is that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
in our Humiliation; which answers
the Charge in the Prophet, <hi>Rend your
Hearts, and not your Garments:</hi> Inward
Power, not outward Signs, are accepted
with God in this Matter. Let us every
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50059:79"/>
one take it on our own Souls, every one
charge his own Conscience in private with
the performance of this Duty: God will
bear no longer with Pretences; no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Appearances or evanid Affections in
a temporary Humiliation for <hi>a Day,</hi>
though in the Observation of the most
solemn Duties, required on such a Day,
will answer the Mind of God herein.
For</p>
            <p>2. It must be <hi>extraordinary.</hi> Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for our own Sins, is a Duty constantly
incumbent on us. To <hi>walk humbly with
God,</hi> is the principal thing that he requires
of us in this world, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 9. Hereof
Self-Abasement in a sence of Sin is the
Life and Soul, the Principle of all other
Acts and Duties belonging thereunto. But
when the <hi>Calls of God</hi> are <hi>extraordinary,</hi> as
they are at this day, it is necessary that we
attend hereunto in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Failing in the necessary degrees of a
Duty, renders it ineffectual and unaccept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
If as unto Times and Seasons,
VVays, Means and Manner of this Duty,
we do not apply our selves unto it with
more than ordinary diligence, and with
great intention of Mind, we sail in what
is expected from us. To deal with God
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50059:80"/>
on <hi>extraordinary Occasions,</hi> in an <hi>ordinary
frame of Spirit,</hi> is to despise him, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
at least no due Reverence of him in
his Judgments, nor a due apprehensions of
our own Concerns in them.</p>
            <p>3. It is required that Humiliation for
Sin be accompanied with a <hi>Relinquishment
of Sin: He that confesseth his Sins, and
forsaketh them, shall find Mercy.</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is grown a cheap and easie Labour,
whether it be <hi>read out of a Book,</hi> or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
by vertue of Spiritual Gifts. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
may be <hi>pretended,</hi> when it is not;
and <hi>expressed,</hi> when it is transitory, no
way answering the Mind and Will of God.
But the <hi>real Relinquishment</hi> of sinful frames,
sinful ways, sinful neglects, can neither be
pretended, nor represented better than it is.
He that thinks he hath <hi>nothing</hi> to forsake,
no <hi>evil way,</hi> no sinfull negligence, no frame
of Heart, will be awakened to a better
kowledge of himself, when it is too late.
This we may therefore evidently try our
selves by; what real Change hath there
been in us, in compliance with the Calls
of God? what have we relinquished in
our ways, frames or actings? what vain
thoughts are utterly excluded, whereunto
we have given entertainment? what Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50059:80"/>
or Affections have been reduced into
Order, which have exceeded their due
Bounds and Measures? what vain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
formerly accustomed unto,
hath been watched against and prevented?
what Dissimulation in Love hath been cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or cast out? what irregular actings in
our Persons, Families or Occasions of Life
have been forsaken? An Enquiry into
these things, will give us real, sensible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
whether our <hi>Humillation</hi> for our
own Sins be compliant with the present
Calls of God.</p>
            <p>6. Another Duty of the Season is, That
<hi>we mourn for the Sins of others;</hi> of those
especially in whom we are Providentially
concerned; as Relations, Churches, the
whole People of the Land of our Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with whom we are engaged by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Bonds and Means of Conjunction. It
is well known that this sincere Mourning
for the Sins of the Places and Times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live, of the People and Churches
whereunto we do belong, is eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of God, and a Token unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in whom that sence is, of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in a Day of Calamity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. 5,
6. To have Minds careless and regardless
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50059:81"/>
of the Sins of other Men, is a great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of want of Sincerity in our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Detestation of Sin. Many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
there are of it; as that they will
not hear us, we are not concerned in them;
That they are wicked Enemies of God,
and the worse they are, the more will their
Destruction be hastened: By such Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do men deceive their Souls into a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of this Duty, yea, unto provoking Sin
such as this is.</p>
            <p>It is a Matter of Sorrow unto them that
truly fear God, and have any Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Glory, or the Honour of
Christ, that the whole VVorld, so far as
we know, is filled with all abominable
provoking Sins; it lies under <hi>a Deluge of
Sin,</hi> as it lay of old under a Flood of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
only here and there appeareth an
<hi>Ark,</hi> that is carried above it. <hi>Atheism,
Anti Scripturism, Disbelief of Gospel-My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
Contempt of the Religion which they
themselves profess;</hi> amongst all sorts <hi>of
Christians, the Loss of all Publick Faith
and Trust;</hi> with a Litter of unclean Lusts
<hi>Ambition, Pride, Covetousness,</hi> in many
who have the outward Conduct of
the Church, have spread themselves over
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50059:81"/>
the face of the Earth. VVhen God thus
deals with the World, when he gives it
up unto this open <hi>profligate Excess</hi> which
now abounds in it, it becomes unto all
that truly fear him, a Place of Darkness
and Sorrow, which calls for a mourning
Frame of Heart.</p>
            <p>It is so much more as unto the <hi>Land of
our Nativity.</hi> From a Conjunction with
this People in Blood, Language, Manners,
Laws Civil Interests, Relations, arising
form the common <hi>Law of Nativity,</hi> in a
Place limited and bounded by Providence
unto especial Ends, we cannot but have a
great concernment in their Good or Evil. It
is greater from hence, that the <hi>same true
Religion</hi> hath been professed in the whole
Nation, with innumerable Priviledges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
it.</p>
            <p>On these and the like Considerations,
the whole Nation is laid under the same.
Law of Providence for Good or evil.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Sin</hi> therefore of this People we
are in a peculiar manner concerned; and
shall be so in their <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:50059:82"/>
Whether Sin abound in the Land at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
we have already made Enquiry; and
nothing, spoken before, shall be repeated.
If we have not a sense of these Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if we endeavour not to affect our
Hearts with them, and mourn over them,
we are very remote from that frame which
God calls unto.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Mourning for the Sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
from a double Spring.</p>
            <p>Zeal for the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Compassion for the Souls of Men;</hi>
yea, for the <hi>woful calamitous State</hi> and
<hi>Condition</hi> which is coming upon them, even
in this World.</p>
            <p>Surely those who are true Believers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be concerned in all the Concerns of
the Glory of God. If in <hi>all our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he is Afflicted,</hi> in all the sufferngs of
his Glory, we ought to suffer. In the
blessed <hi>Direction</hi> given us for our Prayers,
as unto what we ought to pray for, that
which in the first place is prescribed, as
that which principally and eminently we
ought to insist on, is the <hi>Glory of God</hi> in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50059:82"/>
the <hi>Sanctification of his Name,</hi> the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive
Coming</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ,
and the <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of his VVill
by the Obedience of men in the
world. If we are sincere herein, if we
are servent in these Supplications, is it
nothing unto us, when all these things are
<hi>quite contrary</hi> amongst us? when the
Name of God is blasphemed, and all
things whereon he hath placed his Name
are derided; when the whole <hi>Internal Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
and Kingdom of Christ are opposed, and
the <hi>outward Court</hi> of the Temple, given
every where to be <hi>trodden down of the
Gentiles?</hi> when all manner of Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in opposition unto the <hi>Will</hi> and
Commands of God; when the <hi>Earth</hi> is
almost as unlike unto <hi>Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Hell</hi>
it self; is their nothing to be mourned
for herein? VVe are for the most part
selfish, and so it may go well with our
selves, according to the extent of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Circumstances, we are not
greatly moved with what befals others.
There is Evil enough herein; but shall
we be moreover so minded towards <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> that whilst we are in safety,
we care not though his Concernments
are in the utmost hazard? Do we love
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50059:83"/>
the Name of God, the Ways of God,
the Glory of God in his Kingdom and
Rule, we cannot but be deeply affected
with the suffering of them all in these
Days.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Spring of this Mourning</hi>-Frame,
is Compassion for the <hi>Souls of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
and their Persons also in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Calamitous Desolations.</p>
            <p>I am hastening to an End, and cannot
insist on these things: This only I shall
say, He that can take a Prospect of the
eternally miserable Condition of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
among whom we live, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Miseries, which, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Reformation will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
and not spend some Tears on
them, hath a Heart like a Flint or Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
that is capable of no Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>7. It is a Season wherein we are called
to a diligent, heedfull Attendance unto
the <hi>Duties of our Stations Places and
Callings.</hi> Duties in our Church-Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Duties in our Families; Duties in
our Callings and manner of Conversation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50059:83"/>
in the World. This is the Advice given
by the Apostle, with respect unto such a
season, 2 <hi>Pet. 3, 13, 14. Seeing that all
these things shall be dissolved, what manner
of Persons ought ye to be, in all manner of
Conversation and Godliness: Wherefore be
diligent that you may be found of him in
peace, without spot and blemish.</hi> Without
a sacred Diligence in all these Duties, we
cannot be <hi>found in peace</hi> of the Lord
Christ when he comes to judge the world,
and purifie his Church with a fiery Trial.</p>
            <p>Negligence, Coldness and Sloth in these
things are Tokens of approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
And of some of them at this
day the Generality of Professors seem to
be almost weary of, and to attend unto
them in a very indifferent and overly
manner. But we may know assuredly,
that if we thrive not in our Diligence
in these things, if the vigour of our
Spirits in Watchfulness be not engaged
in them, we are not compliant with the
present Calls of God.</p>
            <p>8. It is required of us that we cry
earnestly, continually, with preserverance,
for such an <hi>Effusion of the Holy Spirit from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50059:84"/>
above,</hi> as may dispose and work the Inlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Land unto Repentance and
Reformation.</p>
            <p>That this is the only Way, the only
Means of Releif, of a sanctified Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from Desolating Judgments. hath
been declared. And this is the only Way
which some of us have to help and assist the
Nation in its Distress. Wherefore by a
constant continuance in Supplication for
such <hi>Fffusion of the Holy Spirit,</hi> we shall
have a threefold Advantage.</p>
            <p>1. We shall hereby <hi>discharge the Duty
we owe unto the Land of our Nativity,</hi> in
such a way as none can deny or hinder.</p>
            <p>We owe a Duty unto it on all good
Accounts, Moral, Political, Spiritual.
We are, for the most of us, shut up from
giving any other Assistance unto it, by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Counsel, or Action; this is that
which none can hinder; wherein the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
may be as useful and serviceable as the
Mighty. And if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be diligently attended
unto, it will be far above whatever can
be contributed by Wisdom, Wealth or
Strength unto the same End. For by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50059:84"/>
this Means we shall be saved or perish.</p>
            <p>2. It will preserve our own Hearts in the
<hi>best frame</hi> for what we our selves may be
called unto. He that is earnest and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
in his Supplications for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of the Spirit unto others, shall
not want blessed supplies of him in his own
Soul: He will not withdraw from them,
as unto themselves, who so esteem, prize
and value his VVork towards others.</p>
            <p>3. VVe shall hereby give <hi>Testimony unto
God</hi> and his Grace, against the cursed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness
of the world; who reject and
despise this only Means of Relief and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance:
For when all other Remedies
fail, if God will not utterly forsake a
Church or People, he doth constantly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
this, as the only Means of their Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
See <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 32. 33. Ezek. 11. 17,
18, 19. Chap.</hi> 36. 25, 26, 27. This way
the VVorld despiseth, regardeth not;
wherefore we can in nothing give a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Testimony unto God,</hi> than by insisting
on this way, with Faith and Patience,
contemning the Reproaches of the world,
on the Account of it.</p>

9. Let us labour our selves to be <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
in Reformation,</hi> thereby to promote
it among others. Let us plead and exhort
what we will, unless we give an Evidence
in our own persons, of the necessity which
we judge that there is of <hi>present Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
we shall we be of little Use unto the
Promotion of it.</p>
            <p>Many Retrenchments of Liberty in
Conversation may be made among the best
of us; many Duties may be attended
with more diligence; many Causes Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
avoided; many Evidences given of
a deep sence of deserved Judgments, and
of our Reverence of the Name of God
therein; much Fruitfulness in Charity
and good works be declared.</p>
            <p>I have heard, that in the Country,
where a man is looked on to be a wise
man, and a <hi>good Husband,</hi> among his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they will <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te the times</hi> of his
Plowing, Sowing and manuring his Ground,
and not undertake any thing, until they
find him going before them in it, And if
men are looked on in a peculiar manner as
<hi>Professors of Religion</hi> at such a time as this,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50059:85"/>
under Calls and Warnings from God for
Repentance and Reformation, the <hi>Eyes
of other men</hi> will be towards them, to see
what they do on this Occasion. And if
they find them as unto all outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
careless and negligent, they will
judge themselves unconcerned, and abide
in their Security. Wherefore, so far as I
know, if such persons be not <hi>exemplary,</hi>
not only in <hi>Repentance.</hi> But also in the
<hi>Evidence</hi> and Demonstration of it, by its
outward Fruits, they may be, and are the
great Obstructers of the Reformation of
the Cities, Towns and places wherein
they do inhabit; nor can any contract
the Guilt of a greater Sin. And if God
should bring an overflowing Scourge on
the Inhabitants of this Land, because they
have not turned unto him at his Calls, it is
most righteous that they should share in
the Judgment also, who were an Occasion
of their Continuance in Security; a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have all just Cause to tremble at.</p>
