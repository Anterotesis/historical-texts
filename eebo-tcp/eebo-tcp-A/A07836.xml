            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And as this custome is very ancient, so is it also exceeding profitable. For first, the sacred memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of worthie men, is by the continuance of the bookes that are dedicated vnto them, preserued from forgetfulnes, and challenged from the ruine of time. Which time, if it growe to bee <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:13264:3"/>
as well ouerwhelme with darkenes, things which are now lightsome and glorious, as it will reueale and bring to light, things that yet lie hidden and vnknowne. The greatest men, for want of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials haue in continuance of time, been buried in obliuion. Secondly, this cannot but cheare vp and encourage men of vertue and of godlines, to perseuer and to grow olde in goodnes, when they see that their persons are regarded of men that now liue, and their names are like (by the bookes which are now dedicated vnto them,) to bee regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, and recorded to the generations to come.

            <p>First, the question of <hi>vsurie,</hi> being controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in these dayes among manie (and those verie learned) diuines: requireth and needeth an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trer of much reading, experience, and moderation. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> said, <note n="x" place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, your <hi>Grace</hi> is reported to bee one, who neither lendeth, nor taketh vpon <hi>vsurie,</hi> which is not in this age euery such mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.

But the summe of that poynt is this: If I haue done both, or either of both, that helpeth not their cause: If I haue not done both, nor neither of both, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is their sinne.</p>
            <p>Two things I require of the good Christian reader. The one: that thou stumble not at the title of this treatise. So many hauing written of this argument, it was not the easiest thing to finde a name whereby to distinguish it from other mens labours. All that I haue aimed at therein is, that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> might be <hi>rei notamen,</hi> (as <note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>August. de Genesi ad lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram cap. 6. tom. 3.</hi>
               </note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh) that is, that the title of the booke might deliuer the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and matter therein contained. Other quilitie or new deuise I haue affected none.</p>
            <p>The other is this: that thou hold it not strange to see, that after <hi>The Death of Vsurie,</hi> published the last yeare by one man, thou hast now the yeare following his <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Conuiction</hi> by another. For first, many times it falleth out, that malefactors are executed before their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Conuiction</hi> bee published to the world. Secondly, <hi>The death of Vsurie</hi> came foorth from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I hope no lesse but it is dead indeede. <hi>Schollers</hi> haue not so great store of money that they can, nor so little store of learning that they will be practisers of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie.</hi>

               <l>Emollit mores.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But this <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Conuiction of Vsurie,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth from <hi>London:</hi> where though it hath in former time been pleaded against by <hi>D. Wilson,</hi> concluded against by <hi>M. Caesar,</hi> and now of later times reproued by <hi>M. Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull,</hi> and examined by <hi>M. Smith:</hi> yet is it not hetherto tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly conuicted in the consciences of the people, much lesse put to death and executed as it should. Thirdly, wee see that <hi>Iudges</hi> of life and death, doe not all hold their <hi>Sessions</hi> or <hi>Assises</hi> at one and the same time. But when some haue exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb facs="tcp:13264:9"/>
fellons in one shire: some begin their arraignment in another. And therefore what shall let me to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and after the <hi>Assises</hi> ended, and <hi>vsurie</hi> executed at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to proceede on to <hi>The Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction</hi> thereof, in the citie of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I speake not, as if I could speake nothing els in this case, but as sparing and pitying the Author of that treatise, who hath ploughed with my heifer, and whose bookes haue been published vnder my name, to my great preiudice and discredit. But I remember what <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth: <note n="u" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>A foole powreth out all his minde: but a wiseman keepeth it till afterward.</hi> All therefore that I will adde is this, If this booke benefite thee, thanke God that gaue the meanes. If it offend thee, yet know that I ment well, and aimed at thy good, and haue written without gall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any mans person. And so I bid thee farewell in Christ.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here hée two things very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to a Preacher of the word: the one that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which hée handleth bée soundly interpreted: the other that the doctrine which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth from it, be directly and necessarily collected. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the former is the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of errors, and to want the latter is to build without foundation. And therefore before I procéede to the handling of the matter and argument contained in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13264:12"/>
this scripture, some things are of necessitie to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued concerning the sense and interpretation of the words.</p>
               <p>First this is not so fitly translated, <hi>by vsurie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:</hi> for neither is <hi>vsurie</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> all one (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards shall appeare) neither is <hi>interest</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word of God. And besides that, this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>by vsurie and interest,</hi> agréeth not either with the originall, or with any of the interpretors. For the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> hath <hi>Beneshech vetarbith:</hi> and the <hi>Greeke</hi> hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> : <hi>Tremellius, Pagnine,</hi> and other of the <hi>Latines</hi> translate it <hi>Vsura &amp; foenore.</hi> Now neither <hi>Tarbith</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> nor <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>Greeke,</hi> nor <hi>Foenus</hi> in the <hi>Latine,</hi> can properly be interpreted, <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> in the <hi>English:</hi> But rather <hi>Superabundantia,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or <hi>Augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tum,</hi> that is, <hi>Superabundance,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,</hi> as <hi>Vatablus</hi> hath well obserued on this place. And yet is this defect fauourablie to be ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sured, yea ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to be pardoned in our <hi>English</hi> tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slators: partly in regard of the want of our <hi>English</hi> to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, whose penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie affoordeth not alwayes two seuerall words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse one and the same thing: partly because the olde translation readeth it, <hi>Vsura &amp; foenore liberali.</hi> Now <hi>Foenus liberale,</hi> is often giuen (at the least it may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) in consideration of <hi>Interest:</hi> and partly also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the vse and custome of speaking hath confounded the sense of these two words in our vsuall language. We say commonly, he taketh vpon <hi>Interest,</hi> he payeth <hi>Interest,</hi> he lendeth vpon <hi>Interest:</hi> when our meaning and intendement is to say, he taketh vpon <hi>vsurie,</hi> he payeth <hi>vsurie,</hi> he lendeth for <hi>vsurie.</hi> And therefore the words being confounded in our common vse of spéech, no meruaile though they be coupled and vnited toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the interpretors in this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching the meaning of this <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:13264:12"/>
we are to knowe that when <hi>Salomon</hi> saith here, the <hi>vsurer</hi> gathereth his riches <hi>for him that will bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to the poore,</hi> this is not spoken according to the minde and intendment of the <hi>vsurer,</hi> as if this were his desire or purpose in gathering of his wealth, that hée might haue whereof to be liberall and to giue almes vnto the néedie. For first, <hi>the couetous man dooth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well, but when he dyeth,</hi> saith the auncient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe. Secondly, <hi>vsurie</hi> is a sinne which shutteth vp compassion, as after shall appeare. And thirdly, where shall you finde men lesse pittifull then are <hi>vsurers</hi> to the poore? But this is spoken of <hi>Salomon</hi> in respect of the prouidence of God, which oftentimes maketh good vse of riches euill gotten: and so disposeth of the issue of things, as that the wealth which the owner hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vp by euill meanes (namelie by <hi>vsurie</hi>) hée draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth foorth to good purpose, namely to the benefite of the poore.</p>
               <p>But now, how and by what meanes God conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>vsurers</hi> wealth to the relieuing of the néedie, that is the doubte and question which ariseth to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued in this place. One of the <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Rabbins</hi> referreth it, <hi>ad magistratum &amp; fiscum,</hi> to the confiscation of the <hi>vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> goods vnto the Magistrate: for thereunto wée sée that the riches and wealth of great men are many times deuolued. God often suffereth men which by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill meanes haue gathered their riches, to fall into the danger of politique penall lawes and so to forfeite their goods to the crowne: whereof it commeth (or it may come) to passe, that of those goods so gathered and so forfeited by iniquitie, the poore may be relieued, high waies may bee repaired, publique charges may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed, the burden of the Church and of the common weale may be eased to the people. And so, <hi>He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth his riches by vsurie and interest, gathereth them for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13264:13"/>
him that will be mercifull to the poore.</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>F. Vatablus annot. in Pro.</hi> 28.8.</note> Others referre this vnto the gouernement and sentence of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate: as if <hi>Salomon</hi> would speake to this effect and purpose. An <hi>vsurer</hi> shall by his riches euill gathered together, thus helpe and relieue the poore. The good and godlie magistrate séeing him by so euill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie meanes rake wealth together into his hands, will enact such lawes, and take such order as shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate him of his wealth, and will more profitablie, and more righteouslie imploye it: namely (among other particulars) to the relieuing of the poore. <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>L. Lauater comment. in Pro.</hi> 28.8.</note> Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this spéech vnto the <hi>vsurers</hi> heyre, or to him to whom the <hi>vsurer</hi> leaueth and bequeath his goods. Hée shall leaue them to a liberall man that will bee merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto the poore. Now though I condemne not this sence, yet I doe not so much approue it, partly because an <hi>vsurer</hi> will hardly be induced to bequeath his goods to him who hee feareth will mercifullie and liberallie imploy them: and partlie because that though the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that putteth to <hi>vsurie</hi> may sometimes haue a kinde and a mercifull sonne as appeareth by the <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.14 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Prophet:</hi> yet to beholde this is almost as rare a thing as it is to sée a blacke Swan floating on the waters. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly such egge such chickin, such syer such childe: the father an <hi>vsurer,</hi> the sonne vnmercifull. And therefore I rather follow those <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Con. Pellican. comment. in Prou.</hi> 28.8.</note> who not descending into any particular meanes (because they are infinite in the hand of God) doe generally applie this sentence vnto his holy prouidence. As if hee had saide: God hating the <hi>vsurer</hi> and condemning his course, doth one way or other defeate him and his of their hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the goods which he gathereth by oppressing of the poore, those hée conueyeth to another which of a mercifull minde will be liberall to the poore. So that this sentence of <hi>Salomon</hi> is almost all one with that

which else where he hath in this booke of the <hi>Prouerbs.</hi>

                  <hi>Hec hath deuoured substance, and he shall vomite it: for God shall drawe it out of his bellie.</hi> And with that which <hi>Luther</hi> speaketh in his treatise of <hi>Vsurie:</hi>

                     <hi>M. Luther. lib. de taxanda vsura tom.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Nec vnquam opes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suris partae, sunt durabiles &amp; perpetuae, Riches gotten by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie are neuer permanent or durable.</hi> For one way or other, sooner or later, the Lorde by his prouidence will defeate the <hi>vsurer</hi> of them: and conuey them into the hands of those, which of charitie will imploy them to the benefite of the poore. That whereas the <hi>vsurer</hi> careth not who waxeth poore so he may grow rich, nay taketh the way to deuoure the poore, nay is the meanes to make the rich poore: hee himselfe and his substance shall (farre beyond his meaning and expectation) bée made a meanes to ease, and helpe, and relieue the poore. As here <hi>Salomon</hi> saith: <hi>He that increaseth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the drift of the holy Ghost in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to disswade from the practising of <hi>vsurie:</hi> and that he doth by an argument drawne from the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect which shall betide such riches so gathered in the ende. Namely, that whereas men gather riches with a purpose and desire that they may abide to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and to their posteritie: yea and whereas, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and ordinarilie men by the wealth, that they lawfullie procure, doe mainetaine themselues, relieue others, and prouide for their children in time to come: it shall by the hand of GOD fall out farre otherwise with the <hi>vsurer,</hi> his wealth shall bee taken from him, yea it may be from all that are his, and cast as it were into the lappe of one that will be mercifull to the poore.</p>
               <p>This scripture therefore giueth (as we see) direct occasion to intreate of <hi>vsurie:</hi> then which there are not many arguments more necessarie or profitable to be

               <p>If any man demaund a reason why after so many that haue laboured in this argument, and among so many brethren in this countrey more able to deale in such a cause then my selfe: I the most vnworthie and insufficient of a great number haue presumed to set foote into this floore, and to wage battaile with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so mightie aduersaries: him I doe desire with patience and charitie to heare this <hi>Apologie</hi> in mine owne behalfe. First, I haue béen challenged more then once for the doctrine which sometimes in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I haue béen supposed to deliuer concerning <hi>vsurie.</hi> As that I haue called it <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Robberie:</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I haue not done: but sometimes haue shewed that it is forbidden vnder this commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <note n="p" place="margin">

Secondly, I haue béen challenged, that sometimes in preaching I haue coupled and recited <hi>vsurie</hi> with the most grieuous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: as namely with Adulterie, Drunkennes, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, Oppression, Extortion, and such like.

Thirdly, I haue béen challenged, that in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching against <hi>Vsurie,</hi> I haue alleadged nor could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge nothing against it but the 15 <hi>Psalme.</hi> A chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge most false and vntrue. For in <hi>Catechising</hi> I haue stood vpon <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. and some other places to that purpose. And if I could alleadge no more then the 15. <hi>Psalme,</hi> yet were that alone suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to stoppe the mouthes of all the <hi>Vsurers</hi> in the world: seeing that <note n="y" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>The whole scripture is giuen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of God,</hi> and <note n="z" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>no prophecie in the scripture is of any priuate motion.</hi> But now, what I am able to alleadge more against <hi>vsurie</hi> then the 15. <hi>Psalme,</hi> shall by Gods grace appeare in this treatise following. Last of all, besides that I haue béen thus sundrie waies challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (and so iustly prouoked) to deale more largely and thoroughly in the matter: this also is to be added as not the least spurre to pricke me forward thereunto: namely, that I haue béen called foorth and required to this busines, not onely of many of the common sort of men (which notwithstanding were not to be neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but also most of the <hi>Brethren</hi> about me, and some euen of the best gifts and account, haue exhorted me to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13264:15"/>
begin, and encouraged me to continue this argument and treatise of <hi>vsurie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thrée things I would require of this Auditorie, during the time of this treatise and the handling of this controuersie. First, that you expect not from me much feruencie of spirit or vehemencie of spéech. For I doe willingly abstaine from all apparance of heate or choller co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued against any particular man practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this trade of <hi>vsurie.</hi> And besides that, feruencie and vehemencie of spéech doe belong more naturallie to admonition, reprehension, and exhortation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I must now bee wholly taken vp in doctrine, and reasons, and allegations. Secondly, my petition is, that I may without offence make recitall of <hi>Doctors,</hi> of <hi>Councels,</hi> of <hi>Ciuilians,</hi> of <hi>Canonists,</hi> in a word, of writers of all sorts, of all times, of all religions. A thing which I am not woont (you knowe) much to affect in my vsuall ministerie: yet must I now of necessitie vse some libertie in that vaine, not onely because the matter is disputable betwéene the greatest men of learning on both opinions: but also because the question is greater concerning both the scriptures alleadged, and the reasons vsed in this case, then I may presume to define or determine by mine owne authoritie. You shall therefore rather heare what their iudgements and arguments are whose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I fauour: then what my selfe can say, or might say, or dare say, in so difficult a question. Thirdly, my desire is, that you which are now present, and haue begun with patience to attend vpon this busines, will vouchsafe also your presence at other times when this argument shal be handled, and continue hearers euen vnto the end. For wise men know that all cannot be deliuered at once: especially in so large a field, wherin so many haue runne their race at length with much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13264:16"/>

These two kindes of <hi>vsurie</hi> being thus shortly passed ouer, as not so pertinent to this present trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise; I come vnto the third, which for difference and distinction sake we may call <hi>Foenus ciuile, aut politicum: Ciuill, or politique vsurie.</hi> Which is when gaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease is raised from the vse of worldly goods, which are things belonging to the ciuil and politique estates of men. And of this kind of <hi>vsurie,</hi> I find that there are two sortes: One is <hi>Actual</hi> or <hi>Outward,</hi> when by acte &amp; outward deede, increase is made by the vse of a thing. An other is <hi>Mental</hi> or <hi>Inward,</hi> which consisteth onely in the hope and purpose, and expectation of the man. So saith <hi>Caietanus,</hi>

                  <hi>Molanus,</hi> and diuers others too tedious to repeate. Of <hi>Outward actuall vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> there are also two kinds: The one <hi>Voluntarie,</hi> the other <hi>by Compact. Voluntarie vsurie</hi> I take to be that which men commonly call <hi>Foenus liberale,</hi> and is then performed, when the borrower hauing profited, and benefited himselfe by another mans goods, which he borrowed, doth voluntarilie, vnbound, or vnrequired, yéeld a thankfull, or kind remembrance to the lender: not as a recompence of the other mans lending, but as a testimonie of his owne thankfulnes. Now I am not ignorant that other men haue iudged otherwise of this poynt. <hi>Pellicane</hi> putteth this difference betwéene <hi>Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> and <hi>Foenus:</hi>

                  <hi>Vsura dicitur quod supra sortem datur ex pacto: Foenus quod libere datur supra sortem sine pacto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vsurie is that which is giuen by couenant aboue the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13264:19"/>
and Foenorie is that which is giuen freely and without couenant more then the principall.</hi> But this distinction I approue not, vnlesse he put to <hi>foenus</hi> the addition of <hi>liberale,</hi> to discerne it, and specifie it for a kind by it selfe: because it is euident that <hi>vsura</hi> and <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> are taken <hi>promiscuè,</hi> both in one sense, and both in the worst part among all writers. Others haue thus distinguished betwéene <hi>vsurie,</hi> and <hi>liberall</hi> or <hi>voluntarie Foenorie:</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">

                  <hi>Vsura est quod datur supra sortem ex pacto praecedente, scilicet inter vsurarium &amp; debitorem: Foenus liberale est retributio mutuatae pecuniae in debitoris libera voluntate constituta: Vsurie is that which is giuen aboue the principall by couenant, made before betweene the vsurer and the detter: Voluntarie Foenorie is the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the money borrowed, consisting in the free will</hi> or choyce <hi>of the detter.</hi> And he addeth: <hi>Ita solet definiri: So is it vsually defined.</hi> Now vsually it may be, but tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and soundlie (in my suppose) it cannot be thus defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For by this meanes <hi>Foenorie</hi> shall be onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of such a debt, as which a man may chuse (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is not bound) whether he will discharge or no. In which sense I doe not remember that euer I read the word vsed in any kind of writer. And besides that, neither can he be called <hi>Foenerator</hi> which lendeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out couenant or assurance to receiue his owne againe: neither can that bee called <hi>mutuata pecunia,</hi> which a man so putteth foorth, as he leaueth it frée in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> choyce of the borrower, whether he will euer repay it or no. And therefore without question, <hi>Ita nequit desiniri.

I doe therefore so vnderstand <hi>voluntarie vsurie,</hi> as I haue before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it: and being so taken and vnderstood, I see not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13264:20"/>
how it can be condemned by the word of GOD. For first, it is onely a testimonie of thankfulnes, and not a recompence of a benefite. Secondly, it is the frée wil of the giuer: now what is fréer then gift? And againe, <hi>Volenti non fit iniuria:</hi> If he will giue it vnasked or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compelled, he hath no iniurie offered in the taking. Thirdly, he that lendeth might lawfully before he lent receiue a frée gift of the borrower. <note n="t" place="margin">

Verbi gratia: Si dederis solidos decem &amp; amplius quaesieris, vel dederis frumenti modium vnum, &amp; super aliquid exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: Vsurie is when any thing is required,</hi> or demaunded, <hi>more then was giuen</hi> or lent forth. <hi>As for example; If thou lendest ten shillings and demaundest more, or len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest a bushell of corne and demaundest more,</hi> this acte is <hi>vsurie.</hi> This definition steppeth a degrée beyond the former sorte. For where the other spake onely of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and receiuing more then the principall: this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a requiring, a demaunding, and an exacting of more then the principall. And yet this definition cannot be sound, nor sufficient to expresse vnlawfull
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13264:23"/>
                     <hi>vsurie.</hi> For if all kinde of demaunding more then the principall be <hi>vsurie,</hi> then here is cut off all the taking of the forfeiture of any bande or obligation, for any cause or consideration whatsoeuer: because in so dooing, a man demandeth and receiueth more, yea as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as the due debte and principall. Now it is true, that this taking of forfeitures, is a grinding of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the poore too common in this vncharitable age, and it is a kinde of gaine which our fathers in former ages scarse knew, but seldome or neuer practised. Yet no man may simplie and absolutelie forbid another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by bandes to take securitie of his owne: neither may men peremptorilie bee condemned, when being damnified for want of their owne, they séeke to make themselues whole or to saue themselues harmelesse by the penaltie and forfeiture of bandes.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13264:23"/>
the non payment then, his dammage can possiblie be for the forbearing of his goods.</hi> These are thrée rules which if they were well séene into and obserued, would cut off many <hi>vsurarious</hi> bargaines that passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene man and man, vnder pretence of billes and bandes, forfeitures and obligations. It being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practise in these dayes, that when men lende vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bandes, with intent of <hi>vsurie:</hi> when the daye is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and the bande is forfeited, though they haue for want of their money at the appoynted day susteined no certaine, nay no likely dammage, yet to paye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues sometimes double and treble <hi>vsurie</hi> by the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the band.

                  <p>Note by the way for the better discouerie of the <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers</hi> euill dealing, that howsoeuer hee to glose with the world, is wont to confound the names of <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>vsurie:</hi> and men are woont to say, that they take <hi>Interest,</hi> and lend vpon <hi>Interest;</hi> when indéed they take <hi>vsurie</hi> and lend vpon <hi>vsurie:</hi> yet that there are two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and essentiall differences betwéen <hi>vsurie</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> which doe so distinguish the one from the other, as that they cannot possibly be confounded. One dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is this: <hi>Vsurie</hi> is an ouerplus or gaine taken more then was lent: <hi>Interest</hi> is neuer gaine or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus aboue the principall, but a recompence demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and due for the damage that is taken, or the gaine that is hindered through lending. An other difference is this: <hi>vsurie</hi> accreweth and groweth due by lending, from the day of borrowing, vnto the appointed time of payment: <hi>Interest</hi> is neuer due but from the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted day of payment forward, and for so long as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare my goods after the day, in which I did couenant to receiue them againe. So that, if once I haue lent fréely vnto a certaine day, I shall not demaund <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> for any dammage susteined, or gaine hindered du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that tearme of time, for which I haue lent vnto another. But if at the couenanted time I receiue not mine owne againe, then what harme soeuer do betide me after that day for the forbearing thereof, reason will that it be recompenced of the borrower. And so much of <hi>Interest,</hi> and of the difference betweene it and <hi>vsurie.</hi>

                  <p>Now these descriptions are somewhat more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then those that went before: for they doe adde the mention of <hi>Gaine</hi> vnto <hi>Exaction.</hi> And whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirmed that whatsoeuer is exacted more then the principall, that is <hi>vsurie:</hi> (so condemning both <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> thinges which are lawfull in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equitie,) these definitions doe import that <hi>vsurie</hi> is neither <hi>penaltie</hi> nor <hi>Interest,</hi> taken for the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of any thing longer then the appointed day: but that it is a <hi>gaine,</hi> an <hi>ouerplus,</hi> and increase arising from the very act of lending. And yet these séeme not to me to be perfect and absolute enough to the purpose. For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13264:25"/>
put the case that I lend an hundred poundes to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant aduenturer, with these conditions: <hi>viz.</hi> if hee gaine not by imploying of it, I require no gaine: if he loose in the imploying of it (doing his good and honest indeuour, that there bee not <hi>Culpalata,</hi> as the <hi>Ciuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> speake) I will beare halfe the losse: if he gaine nothing, but onely saue the principall, I will haue that wholly repayed againe: if hee not onely saue the principall, but gaine by the imploying of it also, I wil not only haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principall, but part of the gaine also. In this case I demaund gaine of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I lent, euen because I lent it: and yet I take not this gaine to bée <hi>vsurie</hi> or vnlawfull. First, because I doe herein aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the principall. Secondly, because I am contented to partake the losse. Thirdly, there is neither certainty of gaine, neither if I do gaine, is there anie measure or proportion of gaine agréed vpon. It may bée some man will iudge this to be <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tractus societatis. The contract of society,</hi> or partnership<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it be, yet it differeth very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from <hi>lending.</hi> If it be <hi>lending,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth it annihilate the definitions last aboue mentioned: as those which do not sufficiently describe that kind of <hi>vsurie</hi> which is vnlawfull and condemned by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Not much vnlike or differing from this, is the right <hi>Contract of Societie,</hi> or <hi>partnership</hi> in deede: An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof may (for examples sake) bee deliuered in a <hi>Scholler:</hi> who hath readie money left him of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but hath no trade wherein to employ it, because he hath béen continuallie trained vp in learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hée hauing a friende that is a Marchant, committeth the occupying of his money vnto him: with condition that they shall diuide the gaine equallie betweene them, if it increase, and beare the losse equallie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them if it decaye. The summe of the couenant is thus much in effect. The <hi>Scholler</hi> shall after a sorte

lend the <hi>Marchant</hi> his money, and the <hi>Marchant</hi> shall after a sorte lend the <hi>Scholler</hi> his labour: both shall be combined, and the losse or gaine shall be equallie diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

This is the proper interpretation of vsurie,</hi> (say the Fathers assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in that <hi>Councel</hi>) <hi>when men labour to get gaine and increase from the vse of a thing which groweth</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth <hi>not:</hi> and that <hi>with no labour, with no cost, with no danger,</hi> or aduenturing. And therefore conferring al these definitions together, and gleaning out of them all, that which I holde most essentiall to this purpose: I doe thus define that <hi>Open, Outward,</hi> and <hi>Actuall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie</hi> whereof I now intreate, and which I take to be forbidden by the worde of God.</p>
                  <p>Vsurie is a lending for gaine, by compact, not aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing the principall.</p>
                  <p>Or more plainly thus.</p>
                  <p>Vsurie is, when a man not aduenturing the goodes which hee lendeth, couenanteth to receiue againe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13264:27"/>
more then he lendeth, euen vpon this consideration, because he lent them.</p>
                  <p>Note by the way, that I here do define the action or sinne of <hi>vsurie,</hi> and not the <hi>vsurie</hi> it selfe, as many haue done in the former descriptions. For one sayd rightly, <note n="f" place="margin">

                     <hi>Aliud est peccatum vsurae, &amp; aliud vsura: The sinne of vsurie is one thing, and vsurie</hi> it selfe <hi>is an other thing. The sinne of vsurie is to take or to desire vsurarious gaine: but vsurie</hi> it selfe <hi>is the gaine which in the owne nature may be valued for money, and is demaunded principally for the dutie either of direct or coloured lending.</hi> Now the sinne or fault of <hi>vsurie,</hi> is the thing which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the worde of God, and therefore that is it which I déemed here most fit to bee described. And in this kind of <hi>vsurie</hi> thus described and layd foorth, I doe obserue foure thinges which must of necessitie concur and méete together. 1. The first is <hi>Lending.</hi> 2. The second is lending for <hi>Gaine.</hi> 3. The third is <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi> for gaine. 4. The fourth is, <hi>The not aduenturing of the principall.</hi> Of which foure particulars, as of thinges whereupon dependeth the waight and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this controuersie, my purpose is seuerally and largely to intreate in the sermon following.</p>

                  <hi>There cannot bee any vsurie where lending is not.</hi> And therefore the scripture sayth, speaking of <hi>vsurie:</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25.</note>

               <p>Now sith <hi>vsurie</hi> is onely in <hi>lending,</hi> it is necessarie that we consider what <hi>lending</hi> is: and consequently, that we haue some recourse vnto the lawyers schooles, to whome the handling of <hi>contracts</hi> doth specially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine. And yet so, as that in speaking thereof, wée shall not wholly transgresse the boundes and limites of <hi>Diuinitie.</hi> For although, <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>For the rule of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> (sayth <hi>Chemnitius</hi>) <hi>is this. Ita exercendos contractus, vt conspiciatur fides, &amp; exerceatur dilectio: Contractes,</hi> and bargaines <hi>must so be vsed among men, as they may shew their faith, and exercise their loue</hi> towardes their brethren.

               <p>But to returne to the point: If we wil know what <hi>lending</hi> is, and what manner of <hi>bargaine</hi> a man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth when hee <hi>lendeth</hi> to his neighbour: me thinkes

Giuing is, when a man bestoweth a thing</hi> vpon an other, <hi>with this minde</hi> and purpose, <hi>that hee would presently haue it become his that doth receiue it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in any wise to be returned againe vnto himselfe.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence then we may easily obserue, that the <hi>vsurer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth</hi> not forth his money or his goodes: in as much as he hath no purpose to make them become for euer, the goodes of the receiuer: but couenanteth, that in time they shal againe returne vnto himselfe. And therefore, though sometimes wee reade this phrase or manner of speaking in the holy scripture. <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit</hi> 25.37.</note>

                  <hi>He that giueth not his money to vsurie,</hi> and such like: yet wee must not bee so simple, as to gather from thence, that the <hi>vsurer</hi> prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiseth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13264:29"/>
the contract and couenant of <hi>giuing:</hi> for as much as he indenteth for the returne, and repaying againe of such thinges as are deliuered. Whereof it is that though the prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> do vse also the same phrase of <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.13.</note> 
                  <hi>giuing forth to vsurie:</hi> yet he addeth thereunto, the <hi>taking of increase:</hi> which noteth, that it is such a kinde of <hi>giuing,</hi> that is practised in <hi>vsurie,</hi> as caryeth taking with it. As if a man would say in this case, and in this sense, as it is sayd in Authors of some kinde of <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting.</hi>

Letting</hi> (sayth <hi>Melancthon</hi>) <hi>is a contract, in which a thing is transferred</hi> or made ouer from one man to another, <hi>as touching the vse, but not as touching the propertie for a certaine price, and for a certaine time.</hi> As for example, I <hi>let</hi> thee my seruant by the day, to labour in thy haruest: I <hi>let</hi> thée my horse by the wéeke, to ride vpon, my howse by the yeare to dwell in, my land to occupie, &amp;c. not that my seruant, or horse, or howse, or land should become thine owne in propertie, and should abide by thée for euer: but that thou shouldest haue the <hi>vse,</hi> and profite, and benefite of them for a certaine season.

                  </note> If a man <hi>let</hi> a thing, and by casualtie it perish in the vse: the hyrer shall not bee bound to make it good, because the dominion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie resteth not in him.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13264:30"/>
from <hi>lending.</hi> For <hi>lending, is the translation of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a thing, Nullo interposito pretio: For no price or consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> but <hi>selling</hi> is the alienating of a thing, <hi>Pro iusto pretio: For a set price to be paide,</hi> and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be made. Secondly, it may appeare that the <hi>vsurer</hi> practiseth not the contract of <hi>bargaine</hi> and <hi>sale.</hi> For he doth not alienate his goods for a certaine price, and for euer, as in <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>selling</hi> men alwayes doe: but hee doth alienate the propertie and vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely for a time, and for that temporall alienation and vse, demandeth recompence and consideration. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>buyeth</hi> and <hi>selleth</hi> not.</p>
               <p>From <hi>selling,</hi> let vs passe on to <hi>exchanging:</hi> and let vs enquire if the <hi>vsurer exchangeth</hi> his goods. <hi>Exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is thus defined. <note n="u" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Permutatio est vnius rei certae, pro alterare certa vicaria praestatio. Exchanging is the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of one certaine thing, in the stead,</hi> or in the roome <hi>of an other certaine thing.</hi> As thus: A man <hi>exchangeth</hi> his coate for an other mans cloake, or ten coombes of Rye for eight coombes of Wheate: or one howse for an other, or one piece of land for an other, &amp;c. And this doth manifestly differ from <hi>lending.</hi> For in <hi>lending</hi> I looke for mine owne againe: in <hi>exchanging,</hi> I looke for some other thing in lue of mine owne. In <hi>lending,</hi> I looke that <hi>Eadem res reddatur in specie. The same thing which I lent, should bee rendered againe in the owne kinde.</hi> As money for money, wares for wares, corne for corne, &amp;c. In <hi>exchanging,</hi> it is not necessarie that the recompence be of the same kind: for a man may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge</hi> house for land, corne for cattel, golde for siluer, &amp;c. Now then, it is manifest that the <hi>vsurer</hi> in putting forth of his goodes, <hi>exchangeth</hi> them not. For hee doth not couenant to take one certaine thing, in the steade of an other certaine thing: as money or wares in the steade of his money or wares: but hee couenanteth to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13264:30"/>
haue his money againe, &amp; an other certaine thing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of his money; his wares againe, and an other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thing for the vse of his wares. The <hi>vsurer</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>exchangeth</hi> not.</p>
               <p>From <hi>exchanging,</hi> I procéede to <hi>accommodating:</hi> a kind of contract, whereunto the scarsitie of our eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish tongue yéeldeth no proper nor peculiar name. The <hi>Latines</hi> haue two kindes of <hi>lending, Mutuatio,</hi> and <hi>Accommodatio:</hi> we for distinctions sake, must call them (though somewhat barbarously) <hi>mutuating,</hi> and <hi>accommodating.</hi> And these two kindes of <hi>lending,</hi> doo differ very apparantly in two materiall pointes. For first, in that kind of <hi>lending,</hi> which they call <hi>Mutua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> &amp; which I haue before defined: <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 2. § <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellata. &amp;</hi> §. <hi>Si creditum ff. Si certum peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> §. 1. <hi>Iustit. Quibus mod. re cont.</hi>
                  </note> there is a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the propertie and dominion of the thing which is lent, from the <hi>lender</hi> to the borrower. As for example: I lend a man money, or corne, or wares: I make them in <hi>lending</hi> to become his owne, so as hee may doe with them what himselfe listeth: hee may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change them, he may sell them, hee may giue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yea (if he list) he may cast them away: for they are his proper owne. And therefore it is called <note n="y" place="margin">

                  <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum, quod de meo fit tuum:</hi> as a man would say, <hi>Mine thine,</hi> or <hi>mine, by this lending I make thine.</hi> But in that kind of <hi>lending,</hi> which is called <hi>Accommodatio,</hi> or <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating:</hi> it is far otherwise. For there is onely a transferring of the vse (not of the propertie) to the borrower: and therefore he cannot euery way vse the thing borrowed as his owne. As for example: I lend a man my horse: he shall not by vertue of my <hi>lending,</hi> doe with him what he will, as with his owne: he shall not kill him, he shall not giue him away, hee shall not sell him away, hee shall not exchange him away. And why? the horse is none of his. And why that? I did not make him by this kinde of <hi>lending</hi> owner of my
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13264:31"/>
horse, nor transferre the propertie or dominion vnto him: but I yéelded vnto him onely the vse and benefite of my horse. And therefore hee shall ride him, hee shall labour him, he shall imploye him in drawing, in cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and such like: but he shall not doe with my horse whatsoeuer himselfe listeth, because by this kinde of <hi>lending</hi> I haue transferred onely the vse and not the propertie of my goods. Secondly, <hi>mutuating</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating,</hi> doe differ in this: <note n="z" place="margin">

                     <hi>Vrsinus Ibid.</hi>

So that (as I said) these two kindes of <hi>lending</hi> which for distinctions sake we call <hi>mutuating,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:13264:31"/>
doe differ in these two poyntes. First, in the one there is an alienation both of the vse and propertie: in the other, onely of the vse, and not of the propertie. Secondly, in the one it is sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay the like, or the equiualent to that which was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed: in the other it is required that the same parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and none els, be restored againe vnto the <hi>lender.</hi> Now, by this which hath béene spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it may appeare, that the <hi>vsurer</hi> doth not <hi>accommodate</hi> his goodes, or practise that kinde of <hi>lending</hi> which we call <hi>accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> For first, hee giueth the borrower interest in the propertie of his goodes: else the borrower might not doo with them what himselfe listed. Secondly, he requireth not againe the selfesame particular which he lent, but the like or the worth onely: none of both which are done in the contract of <hi>accommodatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The <hi>vsurer</hi> therefore <hi>accommodateth</hi> not.</p>
               <p>There bee diuerse other kindes of <hi>contractes.</hi> As <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Selnecerus Instit. Christ. rel. part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 614.</note> 
                  <hi>Depositum, Pignus, Stipulatio, Fideiussio, Emphyteusis, Societas, Mandatum,</hi> with the rest. But because the committing of <hi>vsurie</hi> doth hardly fal into some of these, and rarely into others: therefore for breuities sake I haue thought good to ouerpasse them in this treatise. The reasons why I haue made mention of those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearsed are these. Namely, that wee might sée, 1. what <hi>lending</hi> is. 2. How it differeth from other contracts. 3. That this <hi>Outward, Open,</hi> and <hi>Actuall vsurie,</hi> of which yet wee speake, is committed onely in the bargaine of <hi>lending.</hi> For the <hi>vsurer</hi> giueth not, hee <hi>letteth</hi> not, hee <hi>selleth</hi> not, hee <hi>exchangeth</hi> not, hee <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodateth</hi> not, &amp;c. Therefore he <hi>lendeth</hi> onely: and <hi>vsurie</hi> is onely in the contract of <hi>lending</hi>: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>vsurie is a lending,</hi> which is the first point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the definition thereof.</p>
               <p>Now before I procéed to the handling of the second
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13264:32"/>
particular, it is very requisite that wee obserue two necessarie consequences or inferences, arising from that which hath béene alreadie deliuered, concerning this point of <hi>lending.</hi> The first is this. We haue heard that <hi>lending</hi> or <hi>mutuation</hi> is such a contract, as toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the vse doth tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sferre the dominion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the thing vnto the borrower. From whence must necessarily followe, that <hi>Obiectum mutui, The thinges subiecte to this kinde of lending,</hi> must bée onely such as whose vse and propertie cannot be seuered: so as a man cannot yéeld another the vse of them, but hee must also yéeld the propertie: and he cannot yéelde the propertie, but hee must also yéelde the vse. Of which nature and condition are only such things as consist &amp; passe from man to man by <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Nota quod non potest committi vsura, nisi in his rebus tantum, circa quas contingit fieri mutuum: scilicet quae consistunt in numero, pondere, &amp; mensura. Note</hi> (saith one) <hi>that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie cannot bee committed, but onely in such thinges which are subiect to</hi> that kinde of <hi>lending</hi> which wée <hi>mutuation: that is to say, in such things as consist in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, waight, and measure.</hi> In <hi>number,</hi> as money: In <hi>waight,</hi> as leade: In <hi>measure,</hi> as corne, &amp; such like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: these are the thinges that can onely be <hi>lent,</hi> and taken vpon <hi>vsurie.</hi> For <hi>vsurie</hi> is only in that kind of <hi>lending:</hi> and such thinges onely as consist in <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, waight,</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> are subiecte to that kinde of <hi>lending</hi>: and therefore onely in such thinges can <hi>vsurie</hi> be committed.</p>
               <p>The second inference arising from the premises is this. <hi>Vsurie</hi> is in <hi>lending,</hi> and therefore may bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in any thing which is subiecte to <hi>lending:</hi> that is in any thing which consisteth in <hi>number, waight, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13264:32"/>
measure.</hi> And this is the rather to be obserued, because it is a receiued opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the vulgar sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>vsurie</hi> is committed onely in the putting forth and taking vp of money. Whereas <hi>Hemingius</hi> sayd truly, <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>In omni re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mutuatione vsura dicitur. Vsurie is sayd</hi> to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, (and may bee committed) <hi>in the mutuating</hi> or lending <hi>of any thing.</hi> And this the very wordes of the text doe make plaine in the scriptures: <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not</hi> (sayth <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi>) <hi>giue to vsurie to thy brother, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie of money, vsury of meate, vsurie of any thing that is put to vsury.</hi> And again in <hi>Leuiticus:</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsury, nor lende him thy victuals to increase.</hi> So that, there is not onely <hi>vsurie</hi> of money, but also <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie</hi> of meate and victuals, yea of many other thinges which are put forth, and may be put forth to <hi>vsurie,</hi> as hath béene before expressed. <hi>S.

                  <hi>Putant quidam, vsuram tantum esse in pecunia. Some are of this minde, that vsurie is onely committed in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13264:33"/>
if thou <hi>lend</hi> any thing and takest increase for it, thou committest <hi>vsurie:</hi> in as much as <hi>vsurie</hi> may bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in all such thinges as passe from one man to an other in this kinde of <hi>lending.</hi> So that (to conclude this first poynt at length) by that which hath béen spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning <hi>lending,</hi> it may euidently appeare: First, that in <hi>vsurie</hi> there must be <hi>lending</hi> of necessitie, because it is committed in no other kinde of contract. Secondly, that <hi>vsurie</hi> is only committed in such things as consist in <hi>number, waight,</hi> and <hi>measure:</hi> for they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are subiect to that kinde of <hi>lending.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>vsurie</hi> may be committed not only in the <hi>lending</hi> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but also in the <hi>lending</hi> of many other things: &amp; that for the reasons which haue beene before rehearsed.</p>
               <p>THe second thing to bee obserued in this kind of <hi>vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> is, that there be lending for <hi>gaine.</hi> For if a man lend ten poundes, onely to receiue ten pounds againe, and no more: or if he lend ten coombes of corne, onely to receiue the same measure againe, and no more: this lending cannot any way be called <hi>vsurie,</hi> because he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no <hi>gaine,</hi> nor increase, for that which hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered. Neither may any man dare to condemne such kinde of lending for vnlawfull: nay it is that which God often commaundeth, and requireth in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Christ</hi> sayth in the Gospell, <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>Lucrum non dicitur nisi deductis expensis: A man is not saide to gaine, vntill hee haue deducted his expenses,</hi> and then some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerplus remaine and abide vnto him. So that, if after a man haue lent, and all charges bee defrayed which his lending caried with it, then he receiue, or couenant to receiue, any money or monies worth more then his owne, this is <hi>gaine</hi> or <hi>increase.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then arise two things to be considered of vs. First, sith <hi>vsurie</hi> is onely lending for <hi>gaine,</hi> and <hi>gaine</hi> is onely that increase which is money or monies worth: therefore it followeth, that if a man lend not to <hi>gaine,</hi> either money or any thing that may be valued
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13264:34"/>
by money, he cannot be saide to lende for <hi>vsurie.</hi> As for example: a man may lend to <hi>gaine</hi> the fauour of God, who requireth lending, and hath promised to rewarde it: now the fauour of God, &amp; his rewarde, are things which cannot be valued with money. A man may lend to giue good example: now the benefite of good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cannot be valued with money. A man may lend to purchase the loue and liking of another: now loue is a thing that cannot bee valued with money. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he that lendeth to any of these endes <hi>gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> excéedinglie, if hee obtaine that which he aymeth at: yet therein he committeth no <hi>vsurie,</hi> because he <hi>gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> neither money nor any thing that can bee prized for money. Againe, I may lend so to requite the kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which I haue receiued from another man. This is not <hi>vsurie:</hi> for it is not lending for <hi>gaine:</hi> because I doe not thereby increase mine owne, but as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change a benefite, or rather make a requitall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of a benefite. Yea, I goe further: a man may lende to saue his owne, and yet not commit <hi>vsurie:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he lendeth not for <hi>gaine</hi> or <hi>increase.</hi> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: one oweth me alreadie tenne poundes, and yet he commeth to me to borrowe fiue poundes more. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the debte is desperate, and therefore make him this answer, that if he will put me in good security to pay at such a time the ten poundes, which alreadie he oweth me, and together with that, the fiue poundes which now hee requireth, I am content to satisfie his demaunde, <note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>Non committo vsuram:</hi> Herein <hi>I committe no vsurie.</hi> And why? <hi>Quia illa decem quae recipio, non ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt nomine lucri, quia aliàs mea sunt &amp; mihi debita. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the tenne poundes which I receiue,</hi> with the fiue poundes that last I lent, <hi>come not in as gaine or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: for they were mine and due to mee before.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, put the case I heare that to morrowe one is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13264:34"/>
purposed to come to borrowe money of mee, who I knowe is hardly able to paye againe: and whome therefore I am loath to trust. To defeate him I lende away my money this day vnto another: that when he commeth I may answer in trueth that I haue no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by me to lend him. I may perhaps herein not bée so charitable as I should: but it is euident that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no <hi>vsurie.</hi> For I did not lend away my money to <hi>gaine</hi> more then mine owne, but onely to saue that which was mine owne, and to kéepe it out of danger. Now if I lend not to <hi>gaine,</hi> I cannot come within the compasse of <hi>vsurie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second thing arising to bee obserued from that which hath béen spoken concerning <hi>gaine</hi> and <hi>increase</hi> is this. <hi>Vsurie</hi> is lending for <hi>gaine,</hi> and <hi>gaine</hi> is either money or monies worth: and therefore, hee that len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, to <hi>gaine</hi> by lending, any thing that is money or monies worth, that man committeth <hi>vsurie.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they much deceiued which thinke that they commit not <hi>vsurie,</hi> vnlesse for their money lending, they receiue shéere money againe. <note n="u" place="margin">

                  <hi>Et esca vsura est, &amp; vestis vsura est, &amp; quodcunque sorti accedit vsura est: If thou take victuals</hi> (saith <hi>Ambrose</hi>) <hi>that is vsurie: if thou take apparrell, that is vsurie: and whatsoeuer is aboue the principall, that is vsurie. Quod velis ei nomen imponas, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura est: call it what thou wilt,</hi> or name it what thou wilt, <hi>it is vsurie. Saint Hierome</hi> also is of the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hierom. com. in Ezech.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Alij pro pecunia foenerata solent munuscula ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere diuersi generis: there be some</hi> (saith he) <hi>who for the money that they haue lent, are wont to receiue giftes,</hi> or rewardes <hi>of another kinde. Et non intelligunt vsuram ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellari, &amp; superabundantiam, quicquid illud est, si ab eo quod dederint, plus accipiant: and they vnderstand not that all whatsoeuer it bee, is called vsurie and increase, if they receiue any</hi> thing <hi>more then that which they deliuered.</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:13264:35"/>
And therefore in these cases which followe, and in the like to these, is <hi>vsurie</hi> manifestlie committed. I borrow fortie poundes for a yeare, I promise to the lender, that for the vse of his money I will bestowe a gowne cloth vpon his wife, or a nagge vpon himselfe, or a peece of plate vpon one of his children: hee that len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in these or the like considerations committeth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie. Againe, I knowe a man that is in speciall fauour with the <hi>L. Keeper,</hi> the <hi>L. Chiefe Iustice,</hi> the <hi>L. Chiefe Barron,</hi> or some such like great personage in authority: I will lende him a péece of money, and for the vse of it hee shall doe no more but procure me an office in the <hi>Chauncerie,</hi> in the <hi>Kinges bench,</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or some other place: that man that so lendeth, and to such purpose, committeth <hi>vsurie</hi> Againe, a Lorde of a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath diuerse poore Tennants that want money, and come to him to borrow. He demaundeth what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations they are of: the one answereth hee is a daye labourer. I will (saith he) lend you thus much money, and for the vse of it, you shall helpe mee so many dayes in haruest. Another answereth, hee is a husbandman, I will (saith hee) lende you thus much money, and for the vse of it, you shall till me thus many acres of land. This man (together with the rest before specified) committeth <hi>vsurie:</hi> for hee lendeth for <hi>gaine,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee requireth no money for <hi>increase,</hi> yet hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that which is monyes worth, and the worth whereof may be valued and prized for money. So that as touching this second poynte of lending for <hi>gaine,</hi> there are these thrée things to bee considered. First, lending for <hi>gaine</hi> is lending for increase of money or monies worth. Secondly, lending for any thing which is not money or monies worth, is not lending for <hi>gaine,</hi> and therefore no <hi>vsurie.</hi> Thirdly, the lending for the <hi>gaine</hi> of anything which is money or monies
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13264:35"/>
worth, is within the compasse of <hi>Outward, open,</hi> and <hi>actuall vsurie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe third point obserued in the definition of <hi>vsurie,</hi> is <hi>couenanting</hi> &amp; <hi>compacting.</hi> For this kinde of <hi>vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> doth not onely lende for gaine, but also maketh composition and agréement for gaine.

In this case is intended the consent of the children to the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parentes. And why? reason presupposeth, that if either partie had béene discontented with the match, they would by one meanes or other haue sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their dislike.

And I warrant you the <hi>vsurer</hi> will not forget to vrge it, if the borrower be negligent in performing of his offer. And this I thought good to note, least men should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken with a <hi>couenant</hi> in this kinde of <hi>vsurie,</hi> before they be aware, and should depart from the <hi>vsurer,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyed and intangled, then euer they suspected.</p>
               <p>But to procéede.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13264:37"/>
the forbearing thereof. Contented sayth the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that I will by Gods grace, and thanke you too. In this case they haue consented and <hi>couenanted</hi> by bare worde and promise, the one to take, the other to pay <hi>vsurie.</hi> And this is <hi>Nudum pactum, A bare or naked co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.

By wordes,</hi> as <hi>Stipulatio,</hi> and <hi>Fideiussio.</hi> And therefore he which lendeth, and taketh before witnes the borrowers solemne promise, for the payment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: or lendeth and taketh an other mans worde for the borrowers paiment of the increase: that man <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenanteth</hi> and <hi>compacteth</hi> for <hi>vsurie. By writing:</hi> as by bill, or booke, or obligation. And therefore, hee that lendeth and taketh of the borrower a bill of his hand, or his hande to his booke, or his bande, or obligation for the payment of <hi>vsurie,</hi> that man doth <hi>couenant</hi> and <hi>contract</hi> for gaine. I doo not take vpon mee curiously to enter into all kinds of <hi>contracts</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians:</hi> these onely haue I noted, as most vsuall and most incident to this case of <hi>vsurie:</hi> that both the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower and lender may knowe, how that many waies they may in borrowing and lending giue consent and make <hi>compacte</hi> of gaining. The conclusion of this point is this: whosoeuer when hee lendeth, doth take the consent of the borrower for payment of increase, and doth take this consent of his, by pawne, by stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by suerties, by his owne promise, by his bill, by his hand, by his obligation, yea by his secrete and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended consent: that man <hi>couenanteth</hi> for gaine, and is within the compasse of <hi>Outward, Open,</hi> and <hi>Actuall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie</hi> intended in this definition.</p>

Therefore, euen as there is in these dayes little vse of <hi>lottes</hi> themselues among men: so is there no right vse at all of the name of <hi>lotte</hi> among <hi>vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi> Unlesse perhaps some man will say that the <hi>vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> goodes may bee called <hi>lotte,</hi> as <hi>S.

               <p>But I am not ignorant what the <hi>vsurer</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie in this behalfe. Why sir (will hee say) whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or howsoeuer, or to whomsoeuer I lende, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that I <hi>hazard</hi> and <hi>aduenture</hi> my goods. For, say that I take the borrowers bande or bill, or pawne, or suerties, or promise for mine own securitie: yet it may come to passe, that hee and his suerties may proue banckroute, his and their goods may by some offence bee confiscated and forfeited to the crowne, hee or they may flée the countrie, or kéepe the house, that they are not to be gotten: nay euidences may bee stolne, lost, brent, caught out of my hand by cousenage, &amp;c. a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand waies are there, by which notwithstanding mine assurance, I may be defeated of mine owne. And therfore it is euident that I <hi>aduenture</hi> my goods. Now to this obiection of theirs, I answer two manner of waies. First I say, that in this sorte and this respect, euery man <hi>aduentureth</hi> his goods, euen hee that hath sufficient pawne in hand, yea euen he that kéepeth his money fast lockt in his cofers: for they may be burnt, or stollen, or by cousenage conueyed away. All the goods of this life are of this nature <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19.</note> 
                  <hi>The rust and moth may corrupt them, theeues may breake through and steale them away.</hi> And yet I trowe no man will say that hée doth aduenture his money, who taketh for it sufficient pawne in hand, or who kéepeth it by himselfe vnder locke and key in his owne closet. I put an example to make the cause plaine. Wee haue in <hi>England</hi> two
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13264:39"/>
sortes of <hi>Marchants, Marchant Aduenturers,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Retaylers.</hi> The <hi>Retayler</hi> cannot but <hi>hazard</hi> much, for he must trust often, sometimes for round summes, sometimes for a great while, sometimes vpon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers bare worde, or hand to his booke, (which assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance no <hi>vsurer</hi> will take) and yet no man calleth him a <hi>Marchant Aduenturer,</hi> neither is hee assumed into their hall and companie. How much lesse then can an <hi>vsurer</hi> bee called an <hi>aduenturer</hi> of his goods, when hee will neither trust, nor lend for long time, nor but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all sufficient securitie? Secondly, to the plea of the <hi>vsurer</hi> touching the <hi>aduenturing</hi> of his goods, I answer in this sorte. There is <hi>aduenturing</hi> in a double respect, 1. First, <hi>Quoad euentum.</hi> 2. Secondly, <hi>Quoad media.</hi> A man may <hi>aduenture as touching the issue: and as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> meanes.</hi> As touching the <hi>issue,</hi> it is confessed that the <hi>vsurer aduentureth:</hi> and no gramercie, for hee cannot possiblie doe otherwise. Because no man can sée the ende of a thing when hee beginneth it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the ouerruling prouidence of God will worke when it pleaseth, sometimes beyond meanes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without meanes, sometimes contrarie to meanes: therefore is it, that no man can say assuredly what the issue of any thing will proue. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>meanes,</hi> the <hi>vsurer</hi> worketh so sure, as hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any reason be saide to <hi>aduenture.</hi> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: it is said in the <hi>Actes of the Apostles,</hi>

haue promised so much, and this argument dooth exact it at my hand.

For who coulde euer drawe a full and liuelie pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Proteus</hi> that changeable sea God?

And that which I doe, I will doe with this minde, not as taking delighte in beholding the face, or drawing the picture of so misshapen a monster: no more then the <hi>Poets</hi> affected the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of those <hi>Furies</hi> which they raised from hell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the stage.

               <p>The ground of this point, I deriue from that which I finde in <hi>Rainerius, Bromyard,</hi> &amp; others of the schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who shew by diuers instances, how <hi>vsurie</hi> cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it selfe vnder the pretence of buying and selling, of letting, of exchanging, &amp;c. which are contractes approoued by God, and by the practise of all good men.

               <p>For first, in <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>selling</hi> men play the <hi>vsurers</hi> many wayes. As for example: <note n="s" place="margin">

againe. Nowe for readie money perhaps I sell the plate for foure score pound. The broaker carieth back the plate to the owner, and from him bringeth foure score pounde in readie money to the borrower. The borrower must pay the lender an hundred pounde for his plate at the day appointed, and ten pounde for the <hi>vsurie</hi> in the meane season.

At the yeres ende, yee shall giue mee thus much money for the hire of euery Cow, and ye shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with restore to me the kine themselues, in that forme in which I deliuer them vnto you: that is (to deale plainely) in so much readie money. Here séemeth to be hiring of kine in the borrower, and <hi>letting</hi> of kine in the lender, and yet at the yeeres ende all prooueth but thus much loane for the forbearing of so much money:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13264:43"/>
and so it is <hi>vsurie</hi> vnder pretence of <hi>letting.</hi> Againe, one commeth to me to borrow a hundred pound for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yéeres. I answere that hee shall haue it with this condition: hee shall hyre of mee a house and certaine land, at such a yerely rent, and hee shall take a lease of them for the space of seuen yeeres. The house and land perhaps are hardly worth ten pound a yeere, yet I couenant to receiue twentie pound a yere rent. So it commeth to passe, that the rent of the lease, payeth the <hi>loane</hi> of the money, euen tenne pound for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and <hi>vsurie</hi> is committed vnder pretence of <hi>letting.</hi> Or thus againe. A man commeth to mee to borrowe twentie pound. I answer, I cannot forbeare so much to lend him: but I haue twentie pound in olde golde, or faire golde, which I am loth to forgoe, or to haue it changed: and to doe him a pleasure I will lend him that, to lay to pawne to another, and to borrowe so much money vpon. But withall for my kindnes, he shall giue mee twentie shillings for hauing my money to lay to pawne to another. This is neither of the two kinds of <hi>lending:</hi> it is neither <hi>mutuating,</hi> nor <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating. Mutuating</hi> it is not, for hee doth not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the dominion and propertie of his money to the borrower. <hi>Accommodating</hi> it is not, because his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney goeth not free: therefore of necessitie it is <hi>letting,</hi> or <hi>vsurie,</hi> taken vnder pretence of <hi>letting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is with letting, so it is also with <hi>lending:</hi> for <hi>vsurie</hi> is many times committed vnder pretence of frée <hi>lending.</hi> As for example: <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lauater comment. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech.</hi> 18. <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.</hi> 76.</note> An occupier or shopkéeper will take all kind of gold that is brought vnto him for payment: as clipt Angels, light french Crownes, souldred Soueraignes, and such like. Prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that he will not take them for payment, vnlesse hee haue recompence according to the want: for one sixe pence, for another a groate, for an an other twelue
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13264:44"/>
pence allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or more or lesse. Now this light gold, or souldred golde, or clipt gold, will hee kéepe by him, and will lend it out fréely to any man that desireth to borrow. All the recompence that he requireth, is no more then that which he lendeth out, viz. ten pounde for ten pound, twentie pound for twentie pound, that is, (as it séemeth) onely his owne againe. But when the day of payment commeth, where hee lent Angels that wanted sixe graines, and french crownes scarce worth fiue shillinges: hee will bee paide againe with good, lawfull, and currant english money. So in euery péece of gold which he <hi>lent,</hi> wil he gaine twelue pence, or sixe pence, or a groate, &amp; yet séemeth to <hi>lend</hi> fréely, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any consideration. Againe, I come to an <hi>vsurer</hi> to borrow ten pound for a yeare. He answereth, hee cannot so long forbeare his money: but to doe mee a pleasure he will lend me so much for a moneth. And he will lend it for so long <hi>Gratis, Freely:</hi> (hee meaneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede <hi>Gratis</hi> the <hi>Nowne,</hi> not <hi>Gratis</hi> the <hi>Aduerbe: Gratis,</hi> that is, <hi>gratis hominibus, To men</hi> which hee hopeth in their consideration and recompence will proue <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>) All that he will require, is a bande for the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne againe. But hee knoweth well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that it is an hundred to one that he which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to borrow tenne pound for a yeare, shall not bée like nor able to pay it againe within a moneth. Well yet this hee offereth fréely, &amp; the borrower being pent is glad to accept of any thing. Hee taketh the money, he entereth a band, the moneth is soone expired. Hée cannot prouide the money so spéedily, for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and therefore the band is forfeited. Then will the <hi>vsurer</hi> pay himselfe his loane with the forfeiture of the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it may be thrise as much as the <hi>loane</hi> is worth: and yet make the poore borrower beléeue that hee doth much befriend him, in not taking the whole forfeiture:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13264:44"/>
considering that he brake day with him, who lent his money out of his purse freely, and without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Thus the poore man payeth thoroughly for his borrowing, and the <hi>vsurer</hi> is thorowly satisfied for his <hi>lending.</hi>

They neuer practise but couertly, as it were in the darke. And no marueile, for their whole trade is the worke of darkenes. Amorous are they as goates in their wordes, but bloodie and cruell as wolues in their heartes: and with their deuices doe they shoote, and dart through the poore and néedie people.

                  </note> which is committed in facte, and betrayeth it selfe to the world by some outwarde action. Now it remaineth, that we intreate of that kind, which lurketh secretly in the heart, as it were a serpent in the bosome. We know that the lawes of God doe, as in other respects, so namely in this particular, differ and dissent from the lawes of earthly princes. Mens lawes can onely restraine the outward déedes, committed by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the bodie: but the lawes of God restraine the euill thoughts, and conceipts, and intentions of the heart. Therefore the <hi>Psalmist</hi> said: <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.7.</note> 
                  <hi>The lawe of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the soule:</hi> (or as <hi>Tremelius</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

it) <hi>Restituens animam, Restoring,</hi> or making vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the decayed breaches of <hi>the soule.</hi> Now it could not restore the soule, if it could not worke vpon it: and it could not worke vpon it to restauration, vnlesse as a skilfull Chirurgion, it could search, and launch all the festered, and corrupted corners of the same. The lawe of God condemneth him for a <hi>murtherer,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which in déede runneth his neighbour through, but him also which hath the same purpose and intendment. And therefore was <hi>Saul</hi> a murtherer, <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.11</note> in casting his iaueling at <hi>Dauid,</hi> with a purpose to nayle him to the wall: though <hi>Dauid</hi> by Gods prouidence auoyded the blowe, and escaped safe out of his presence. Againe, the lawe of God condemneth him for an <hi>Adulterer,</hi> not onely who actuallie hath had vnlawfull copulation with a woman, but also him that doth intend and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, yea who doth <note n="i" place="margin">

Yea, if we will beleeue S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> there is so much power and vertue, in the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose wherewith a man goeth about the doing of a thing, that if it be good the action is good, if it be euill, the action is euill also.

And indeede, well may they in this point be vnited and coupled together: because if the one of them be vnlawfull, it will follow that the other must néedes be condemned. As for example: If to commit <hi>vsurie</hi> in acte, and to take <hi>vsurie</hi> in déede, be an vnlawfull thing, then is the intent, and purpose of taking <hi>vsurie,</hi> euill and vnlawfull also.

But the <hi>vsurer</hi> will neuer aduenture the principall, sincke hée, or swimme he that borroweth, lose he neuer so much, and bee his casualtie neuer so apparant: yet the <hi>vsurer</hi> will bee sure at the least to receiue his owne, if not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Againe, the law of God did bind the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to no more but only to make good the things which perished, or decayed, or waxed the worse by the vsage. For hee sayth, <hi>If it be hurt or die, hee shall surely make it good.</hi> But the <hi>vsurer</hi> will gaine by the lending of that which either decayeth not at all in the vse, as money and coyne, or if it doo decay, may bee restored full as good, as corne, wine, oyle, and such like marchandise. Againe, the lawe of God required the friendship and good will of the <hi>lendor</hi> no better, nor with no more then the receiuing of his owne againe. Now the <hi>vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> will professe that he <hi>lendeth</hi> for good will, and that if you were not his speciall friend, hee would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare his goods: and yet will hee bée requited with a great deale more then his owne againe. So deare and precious a thing is an <hi>vsurers</hi> friendship. So that if there bee any <hi>equitie</hi> in the lawe which God made for <hi>lending,</hi> thou certainely there is no <hi>equitie</hi> but much iniquitie and vnrighteousnes in <hi>vsurie.</hi>

               <p>But me thinkes I heare some <hi>vsurer</hi> or other, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with himselfe, and replying in this manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which hath beene spoken.

To which obiection of theirs, I answer diuerse and sundry waies. First, I say with <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:13264:53"/>
And where shall you al most finde an <hi>vsurer,</hi> who if his owne money bee abroad, will very readily bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe money or wares vpon <hi>vsurie,</hi> to relieue his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessitie?

And when his will is so tossed vp and downe, as that he is compelled to will that, which if he were his owne man he would not, yea and misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13264:53"/>
vtterly that which of necessitie he willeth: how can his will be saide to be moderated with equitie and reason? And when his straightnes &amp; exigent compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him to reach out his hand to vnlawfull meanes, and so to forget both God, himselfe, and his neighbour: how can that minde bee saide to bee well gouerned by <hi>loue?</hi> Therefore from such a will so straitned, so dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating from kinde, and so farre from <hi>loue,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a rule, vnto frée kindenes and <hi>loue</hi>

Thirdly, I answer to this obiection of the <hi>vsurer:</hi> say that thou wouldest be glad in thy necessitie to borrow vpon <hi>vsurie</hi> of another: yet this will of thine is not simple nor free, but thou wishest and willest so to doe, onely to auoyde a further danger. As the Marriner tossed with an extreame tempest vpon the sea, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde vtter shipwrack casteth his goods and fraught not vnwillinglie ouer the board: which not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he would not willinglie haue done, but to escape the losse of his life that was more déere vnto him. Now these and the like are called <hi>mixtae actiones, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led actions:</hi> done partly voluntarily, and willinglie, partly inuoluntarilie and vnwillingly. A man would not do such a thing simply if he were at his frée choyse, yet he will doe such a thing to auoyde a greater euill. So that to will, &amp; not to wil, do after a sorte concurre in one and the same action. But now the meaning of Christs rule is: whatsoeuer we would willinglie and chéerefully, that others should doe to vs, following the light of nature, and ordering our mindes by <hi>loue:</hi> that the lawe of <hi>charitie</hi> bindeth vs to yéelde, and to performe to others. And therefore that pretence of <hi>doing as wee would bèe done vnto,</hi> is but an apron of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13264:54"/>
figge leaues too slenderlie sowed together, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble throughlie to shroude from sight the <hi>vsurers</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable shame. Hee doth not as hee woulde bee done vnto, and therefore fulfilleth not (nay hee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturneth) the lawe of <hi>charitie:</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hee and his practises are worthilie condemned in the holy Scriptures.</p>

Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> saith: <hi>No man ought to make gaine of another mans goods.</hi> But <hi>he that taketh vsurie, maketh gaine of that which is another mans: because the lending hath transferred the dominion</hi> of the goods from the lender to the borrower. <hi>Therefore it is no iust nor equall gaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why? but sir (will the <hi>vsurer</hi> obiect,) graunte that by lending I do make my goods for the time to become another mans: yet why may I not iustly demaunde gaine and increase of the borrower, euen in this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

onely? Namely, because I am contented for the time, to put out of mine owne hand into his, the dominion and propertie of my goods? I answer: that if thou sellest any thing to another man, thou maiest so doe in déede. The nature of that contract permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee to take consideration, for the making ouer and alienation of thy goods vnto another: but thou in putting forth to <hi>vsurie,</hi> doest exercise onely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of lending. Now lending is <hi>translatio dominij nullo interposito pretio: a transferring of the dominion</hi> of a thing, from one man to another, <hi>without any price,</hi> or consideration, as hath been before declared. If then thou takest consideration, thou lendest not: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou professest to lend, therefore for translation of the propertie thou must craue no consideration. <hi>Lactantius</hi> describing diuerse particular dueties to bée exercised of a christian man, among others he nameth this for one. <note n="d" place="margin">

Now to receiue more then he lent, is an vniust,</hi> or vnequall <hi>thing.</hi> Out of which spéech of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> these poyntes may fitlie, and profitablie bee obserued. First, he that lendeth to relieue necessitie must yéelde

                  <hi>Beneficium incolume, a free good turne: Ergo,</hi> hee must take no consideration. Secondly, his lending must be frée, least he seaze vpon another mans goods. Thirdly, because he that taketh increase by lending, seazeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is none of his owne, therefore hee doth that which is <hi>vnequall</hi> and vniust. So that, from him it may bée gathered, that to make thy goods another mans by lending, and then to demaunde gaine of that which thy selfe hast made none of thine, is a very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and <hi>vnreasonable</hi> thing.</p>

As for example, (that the simplest may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me) I cannot lend a man money, or corne, or oyle, or such like things, but I must make them fully his, to doe with them what he will: if I do not, hee can make no vse of them, nor receiue benefite by them. So as he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not haue the vse of them, vnlesse hee haue the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and what shall he do with the proprietie for a time, vnlesse hee may haue the vse of them also? Well then: if I lend money, and so with the money the vse of it, as one entire thing (because the vse cannot be seuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proprietie) and I demaunde againe not onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which of necessitie bringeth vse with it, but also more money for the vse of my money: I demaunde two thinges for one, &amp; seuerall things, for them which

cannot be seuered. And this is the reason of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> against <hi>vsurie,</hi> which hee maketh plaine by this example. <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>But now, vpon this I know the <hi>vsurer</hi> is ready to reply, that many haue gained greatly by borowing vpon <hi>vsurie.</hi> And he will not sticke to giue instances of some, who by this meanes haue recouered their houses and landes which lay to morgage, like to bee lost: and of some manlisters who at the first began with little stocke of their owne, but by vsing money taken vp in this order, haue growne very wealthie. Yea, and I lent money to such a man, and such a man, (saith he) and he brought my money againe at the day with many thankes, &amp; professed that he gained great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by me. And how then is this such a monstrous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay to priuate families, as you haue before reported? Now, to this I may make answere diuerse and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wayes: first, I doubt not but some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may gaine by taking vpon <hi>vsurie:</hi> for they may light on a match which shall yéelde them treble increase. So may a man gaine that ouerbuyeth his wares, or ouerhireth his farme or ouer exchangeth his horse: he may happen on such gaine in selling the same wares, or letting the same farme, or exchanging the same horse againe, as shall yéeld double or treble recompence, for the harme of his former bargaine. But that excuseth not the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse of the first seller, letter, or exchanger: no more doth this, the <hi>iniquitie</hi> of the <hi>vsurer.</hi> So that a man may say in this case of him that boroweth as <hi>Leo</hi> sayd of him that lendeth, <note n="k" place="margin">

               <p>I might now proceede to another argument, but that me thinkes I heare the <hi>vsurer</hi> thus replying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which hath bene last deliuered. It is true indéed (will some men say,) <hi>vsurie</hi> is able to ouerthrow, and somtimes (I confesse) it hath ouerthrowen whole families, yea whole countryes, and kingdomes: but that is immoderate, extreme, oppressing, griping, and byting <hi>vsurie.</hi> So as hence it followeth not, that this should bee ascribed as an ordinarie effect to euery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée, and measure of <hi>vsurie.</hi> To which I answere, that it is true indéede, <hi>vsurie</hi> the lesser it is, the lesse it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: the greater it is, the sooner it consumeth. As poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the weaker it is, the longer nature resisteth it: and the stronger it is, the sooner it killeth. And as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the heauyer it is, the faster it wearyeth, but a light burthen (saith the <hi>Prouerbe,</hi>) will proue heauy with farre caryage: so is it with <hi>vsurie,</hi> the greater, and the smaller, both eate and consume, but the first in the shorter, the last in the longer continuance. But let vs examine from experience (which is the foundation of wisedome,) if the measure, and moderating of <hi>vsurie,</hi> be able to make it commodious to a state: And if in the greatest moderation that can bee made of so bad a practise, it haue not proued the decay of families, and common wealthes, as haue bene before expressed.

then for a man to exacte gaine for that which is none of his owne? or to take two recompences for one and the same thing? yea, I may adde the third reason, to those two of the schoolemen.

                  </note> and the last argument which I meane to vse against <hi>vsurie,</hi> shalbe drawen from the <hi>vsurers</hi> themselues. For this is not the least that can be sayd against it, namely that it is a practise which is iudged and condemned in the <hi>vsurers</hi> owne <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And that may appeare by diuerse and sundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. First, they will not willingly be knowne to be <hi>vsurers:</hi> no some of them will protest and sweare déepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they are no <hi>vsurers.</hi> And that they may not bée knowne to bee such as they are, they will either lende very closely, requiring faithful secrecie of the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: or they will colour their lending vpon <hi>vsurie,</hi> with the pretence of some lawfull contracte, or they will when they haue couenanted for gaine, take certaine notes, or (as I may cal them) certaine letters pattens, consigned with the borrowers hand, in which he shal make it knowne to all men by those presents, that the <hi>vsurer</hi> hath lent him freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without any motion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13264:64"/>
of increase. Secondly, that their owne <hi>consciences</hi> doe condemne them in their profession, may appeare by this also: namely, that though they bee knowne, and reputed to bee common <hi>vsurers,</hi> yet they take it a great disgrace to bee so called and tearmed of others. Yea, and whereas other men haue names and titles giuen them from their trades, by which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly written, and distinguished: as, such a man marchant, mercer, grocer, taylor, cordiner, and such like: there is none of this trade, but doth both in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and writing, disdaine (nay abhorre) the name and title of an <hi>vsurer.</hi> Thirdly, that in their <hi>conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> they finde this to bee no lawfull practise, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, in that they dare not call a spade, a spade, nor <hi>vsurie, vsurie.</hi> But whereas we are wont to say in our common and grosser spéech, such a man, or such a man taketh <hi>vsurie:</hi> they say in somewhat a finer phrase, hee taketh <hi>vsance,</hi> or he taketh <hi>interest,</hi> or he taketh <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:</hi> as being indéede ashamed of the direct name of <hi>vsurie.</hi> Now what doth the séeking of such couerts argue, but that themselues in themselues are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their dealing. That euen as <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayd of an heretique, that hee <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Titus</hi> 3.11.</note>

                  <hi>with an euil conscience</hi> or against his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>hee sinneth willingly, and of set purpose,</hi> (for so <hi>M. Caluine</hi> speaketh vpon that place:) so I am afraid it may bee sayd of a number of them, that in their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they are condemned of themselues: because wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly, they follow a practise, contrary to the checke, and touch, and light of their owne <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>

                  <hi>Musculus</hi> also proueth by these argumentes. <note n="u" place="margin">

                  </note> First, because it approueth good, and condemneth euill. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because it is not attained by learning, and art. Thirdly, because it is agréeable to the written word. Well then: I inferre thus much vpon the premises. <hi>The law of nature</hi> is put into vs of God, and this lawe of nature is the squire of the <hi>conscience:</hi> and the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> of the <hi>vsurer</hi> condemneth him of euill: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he and his practises are condemned of the <hi>lawe of nature,</hi> which by the instinct of GOD ruleth in his heart. Now if it be condemned of the <hi>lawe of nature:</hi> no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though it bee forbidden in the written worde. For what difference is there betwéene the <hi>lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the written worde, but this, that the latter is as it were a termination, and specification of the former: and the one was written in tables of stone, but the other is ingrauen in the heartes of men?</p>
               <p>And in this sence no doubt, that may truely be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed which I méete withall in the writings of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men, and which it séemeth they haue all drawne from <hi>Aristotles</hi> fountaine: namely that <hi>vsurie</hi> is <note n="x" place="margin">

And that it is contrarie to the <hi>lawe of nature</hi> may further appeare: because not onely the gentiles <note n="z" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Let this then bee the conclusion of the second parte of this treatise: séeing that <hi>vsurie</hi> ouerthroweth the nature, and equitie, and vse of lending: séeng it ouer-turneth charitie, and the rule of charitie, <hi>doe as thou wouldest be done vnto</hi> séeing it carieth with it so much <hi>inequalitie,</hi> as it is by that meanes the vsuall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of priuate families and publique estates: last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, séeing it is by the light of nature iudged, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for euill in the <hi>vsurers</hi> owne conscience: no maruaile though the word of God haue so manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and so often forbidden it as a wicked, and vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous practise.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">1. <hi>The first obiection in defence of vsurie: the lawe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is onely politicall.</hi>
                  </note> First, it is <hi>obiected,</hi> that <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Caluin epist. resp. de vsuris.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the lawe of Moses</hi> concerning <hi>vsurie, is politicall</hi> onely: <hi>Ergo, illa non tenemur, vltrà quàm aequitas ferat, &amp; humanitas: therefore wee are not bound vnto it, further then equitie, and humanitie permitteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To which <hi>obiection,</hi> I answer: first, that this is a very causeles <hi>Ergo,</hi> an inference, &amp; Illation, made without cause: <hi>the lawe is politicall: Ergo, we are not further bounde vnto it, then equitie, and humanitie will beare.</hi> For, although those lawes of <hi>Moses</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and confessed to be <hi>morall,</hi> yet euen then, they binde vs no further, <hi>then equitie, and humanitie will permit:</hi> the <hi>morall lawe,</hi> being in it selfe, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and squire of all <hi>equitie,</hi> and <hi>humanitie</hi> among men. And that may appeare, by other precepts, and commaundements of <hi>Moses,</hi> of which no man euer doubted, but they were branches, and members of the <hi>morall lawe</hi>: and yet <hi>they binde vs no further, then equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and humanitie doe require.</hi> As for example, this is a branch of the <hi>morall lawe:</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.32</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt rise vp before the hoare head, and honour the person of the olde man:</hi> and yet, a prince that is a childe, is not by this lawe bounde to rise vp, or to stoope downe, to an olde man, that is a beggar. Why so? <hi>Aequitas non fert, &amp; humanitas: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and humanitie will not beare it.</hi> Againe, this is a branch of the <hi>morall lawe:</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt take no gift, for the gift blindeth the wise, and peruerteth the wordes of the righteous.</hi> And yet, is it not simplie vnlawfull, for a Magistrate, to take a gift of a stranger, or of a néere
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13264:67"/>
neighbour, which hath no cause like to come before him, or of him, whose cause hee hath dispatched, with spéede and righteous fauour. And why? <hi>Aequitas fert, &amp; humanitas: equitie and humanitie will permit it.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this is a branch of the <hi>morall lawe:</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 25.21.</note> 
                  <hi>If hee, that hateth thee, be hungrie, giue him breade to eate, and if he be thirstie, giue him water to drinke.</hi> But now, what if mine enemie, be also a malitious professed enemie to God? What if my liberalitie, bee like to minister fewell to his malice? What if I cannot both féede him, and my selfe, or my familie? then, am I not bounde, to ease and relieue him. Why? <hi>Aequitas non fert, &amp; humanitas: Equitie and humanitie, will not beare it.</hi> So then, this is a very causeles, and vnnecessarie inference: <hi>the lawe of Moses is politicall: therefore we are not bounde vnto it, further then equitie, and humanitie will permit.</hi> For, though the lawe of <hi>Moses,</hi> concerning <hi>vsurie,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be <hi>morall</hi>: yet must <hi>equitie,</hi> and <hi>humanitie,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe boundes, and limites thereunto.</p>
               <p>But, further I answer, for the discussing of this question, that, I sée no reason, why those precepts of <hi>Moses,</hi> concerning <hi>vsurie,</hi> shoulde be reckoned among the <hi>iudiciall,</hi> and not among the <hi>morall lawes.</hi> For first, sure I am, that most learned men, of all ages, and of all kindes, haue numbred them, among the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> and alleadged them, and spoken of them, in their writings, as of <hi>morall</hi> lawes. As for instance, (to goe no further, then mine owne reading) among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Basile, Chrysostome, Clemens Alexandrinus, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius Nissenus, Origen, Ambrose, Ciprian, Augustine, Hierome</hi> and others: among the schoolemen, <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Peter Lumbard, Dionisius Carthusianus, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Biel, Lira, Rainerus, Aquileius,</hi> and others: among the late writers, <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Brentius, Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Chemnitius, Aretius, Hemingius, Wigandus, Zegedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13264:67"/>
Molanus, Viguerius, Wolphius,</hi> and a number of others: who do all, in their writings, speake of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as of a morall dutie, and alledge those places of <hi>Moses,</hi> as <hi>morall</hi> lawes.</p>
               <p>And whereas here it may bee replyed, that diuerse godly men, of rare learning, &amp; singular iudgement, as <hi>Caluin, Bucer, Bullinger, Danaeus, Lauater, Carolus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineus,</hi> and some others, haue iudged those lawes of <hi>Moses,</hi> to be but <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> and therefore haue tolerated, yea approued some kinde of <hi>vsurie</hi>: to this I thinke good, not to answere, without some Preface, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble vsed in their behalfe. I doe acknowledge (and that vnfainedly) that these men haue beene great lights, to dispell the darknesse of this latter age, and to be such, as from whose opinion, and iudgement, I do not dissent, without some feare, and suspition of my selfe, nor without great reuerence yéelded to them: and after a sort, leaue, and pardon, and license craued of them. Especially <hi>M.

                  <hi>Caluinianum me esse perne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go: I deny to beare the name of a Caluiniste,</hi> more then of a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or a <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> or some other.

ascited, as a Patron of their vnlawfull practise.</p>
               <p>But, to returne thither from whence I haue a little digressed: it is not otherwise like, but that the preceptes of <hi>Moses</hi> concerning <hi>vsurie,</hi> are partes and parcels of the <hi>morall law.</hi> For <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 50. <hi>Psalme</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.5.</note> reckoneth it among <hi>morall</hi> duties. And <hi>Ezekiell</hi> in one place hedgeth it in, with <note n="z" place="margin">

                  <hi>Briberie</hi> on the one side, and with <hi>defrauding</hi> of our neighbour on the other: which are both notorious breaches of the <hi>morall law.</hi> And in another place, he combineth <hi>vsurie, and Idolatrie</hi> togither. For so I read that place with <hi>Tremellius (per appositionem)</hi> in his 18. chapter:<note n="a" place="margin">

Now, who knoweth not, that no breach of the <hi>Iudiciall</hi> law is equall to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,</hi> and that <hi>Idolatrie</hi> is one of the greatest trespasses against the <hi>morall law?</hi> If therefore <hi>vsurie</hi> doe in any measure answere <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> it will follow from thence, that the committing thereof, is a breach of the <hi>morall law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, I sée no reason why the lawes concerning <hi>vsurie</hi> should not be reputed and taken for <hi>morall,</hi> as well as those which concerne <hi>Incest</hi>: of which no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi> (to my knowledge) euer doubted, but that they ought to abide perpetuall and inuiolable, as preceptes of the <hi>morall law.</hi> For, if it be obiected that the lawes of <hi>vsurie</hi> haue receiued some exceptions: it is euident that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13264:69"/>
the lawes of <hi>Incest</hi> haue receiued exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation also. In the time of the law, <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <hi>Gen</hi> 4.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Cain knew his wife, which conceiued and bare Henoch.</hi> Now whom could he know for a wife, or of whom could hee beget children at that time, but either of <hi>Heuah</hi> his owne mother, or of some of her daughters, his owne sisters? For <note n="f" place="margin">

Now, to say that <hi>Caine</hi> knew his mother, is vnsauery, and a <hi>Paradoxe</hi>: the other therefore followeth of necessitie.

                  <hi>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy sister, the daughter of thy mother.</hi> Such exceptions therefore had the lawes of <hi>Incest</hi> of which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing no man euer doubted, but that they were branches of the <hi>morall law.</hi> And if any man will obiect against this instance of <hi>Caine,</hi> that the law of <hi>Incest</hi> was to be broken in the first creation for very necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties sake: I answere, that it being graunted that God would create but one man and one woman in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and that by them alone hee would propagate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind: it was of necessitie to fall out, that men must

                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.6.</note> contrary to the law. But this was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitas ex hypothesi, necessitie by supposition, not simple</hi> nor <hi>absolute</hi> as the <hi>Logitians</hi> speake. For what neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie could compell God, to create onely one man and one woman, to bee the fountaine of mankinde, when <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Malachy.</hi> 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>he had abundance of spirite</hi> (as the Prophet speaketh,) and could as easilie haue made many women of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ribbes, yea many women of one ribbe; as hee made one <hi>Heua</hi> of one bone to be the mother of vs all. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therfore <hi>a pari from</hi> the comparison of <hi>the equall.</hi> The lawes of <hi>Incest</hi> are <hi>morall,</hi> and yet haue receiued sundry exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: &amp; why not then, likewise the lawes of <hi>vsurie</hi>: howsoeuer they receiued sometime some such exception, as can no way exempt them from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the <hi>morall law</hi>? But that remaineth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to be declared.</p>
               <p>Lastly for this first <hi>obiecton,</hi> the very reasons which God annexeth as <hi>appendices</hi> or appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the lawes of <hi>vsurie,</hi> may euince them to bee <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> For the Lord sayth in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee shall not oppresse him with vsurie.</hi> Now to oppresse thy neighbour, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>morall lawe</hi>: and therefore if <hi>vsurie</hi> bee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of thy neighbour (as after shall bee shewed) then without question <hi>vsurie</hi> is against the <hi>morall law.</hi> Againe, <hi>Moses</hi> alledgeth this for a reason why GOD forbiddeth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take <hi>vsurie</hi> of his brother: <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.35</note> 
                  <hi>So</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall he liue with thee,</hi> that is, so shall hee bee able in some measure, to support his outward estate: yea, <hi>that his life may be with thee,</hi> for so <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tremel. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Leuit.</hi> 25.35.</note> 
                  <hi>Tremellius</hi> obserueth it to be read <hi>verbatim</hi> from the <hi>Hebrue.</hi> Now, to doe, or not to doe a thing by which thy brothers good estate may bee furthered, or hindered, or by which his life may bee shortned, or prolonged: are things, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding, or commaunding whereof belongeth to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13264:70"/>
                  <hi>morall lawe.</hi> And therefore in consideration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, I conclude it to bee mine opinion (submitting my reasons to them that are able to confute these, and to alleadge better to the contrarie) that the precepts concerning <hi>vsurie</hi> deliuered by <hi>Moses,</hi> and afterwarde reuiued by the Prophets, are essentiall branches and parts not of the <hi>iudiciall</hi> or <hi>politicall lawe,</hi> which was proper to those times and that nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi>: but of the <hi>morall lawe</hi> of God, common to all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and times, and countries of the world: and so consequently to be kept inuiolablie, and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of vs and of the generations to come.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The second obiection in defence of vsurie: it was permitted to be exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
                  </note> But it is secondly obiected that the lawes touching <hi>vsurie</hi> cannot be <hi>morall</hi> because they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued speciall exception, yea and by them <hi>vsurie</hi> is in some case suffered and permitted. For <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Deut</hi> 23. <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Extraneo foeneraberis, vnto a stranger thou maist lende vpon vsurie.</hi> Now, the dueties of the <hi>morall lawe,</hi> are the same to a stranger, that they are to our néerest friende: and therefore sith <hi>vsurie</hi> is forbidden to the one and permitted to the other, it séemeth that it is no transgression against the <hi>morall lawe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To this I answer. First, that it is no good argument to conclude in this manner: the lawes of <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie</hi> receiue exception: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are no parte of the <hi>morall lawe.</hi> For, besides the instance afore giuen of <hi>incest,</hi> it is manifest that many other <hi>morall lawes</hi> haue by the speciall dispensation of God the lawe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, receiued euident exceptions. As for example, this is a <hi>morall lawe</hi>: <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy.</hi> And againe, <hi>In it thou shalt doe no manner of worke.</hi> And yet, <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioshua</hi> 6.3.4.</note> the <hi>Israelites</hi> are commaunded to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Iericho</hi> in their armour, with the Priestes, and the arke caried before them, and to continue their marching in that order, for the space of seuen dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13264:71"/>
One of which seuen, must of necessitie be the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in which God had forbidden the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by the morall law to doe any manner of worke. Againe this is a <hi>morall lawe,</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.13.</note> 
                  <hi>thou shalt not kill:</hi> and yet, <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> had a speciall commaundement to sacrifice his sonne. Againe this is a <hi>morall law,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not steale,</hi> &amp; yet God <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.2.</note> commaundeth the <hi>Israelites</hi> to borrow, with a purpose of robbing the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Euen so, and in like manner, this may be a <hi>morall lawe, Thou shalt not lende to vsurie,</hi> and yet vpon speciall occasion receiue this speciall exception, <hi>extraneo foeneraberis, to a stranger thou maiest lend vpon vsurie.</hi> And no maruaile: for, if that be true which is saide in our common spéech, <hi>the Prince is aboue her lawe,</hi> and wee sée that she may doe, and doth many times, by her royall prerogatiue giue <hi>mandatum,</hi> and dispensation contrarie to the lawe: farre be it from vs to imagine, that GOD who is the most absolute <hi>Lorde</hi> of all the world, should not haue authoritie, to giue exception, and dispensation, euen to his <hi>morall lawe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I answer to this <hi>obiection</hi>: that in this spéech of <hi>Moses, vnto a stranger thou maist lend vpon v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie:</hi> wee are to consider what kinde of <hi>aliants,</hi> and <hi>strangers</hi> they were, towards whom the practising of <hi>vsurie</hi> was permitted. I am not ignorant, that some by the name of a <hi>stranger</hi> in that place, doe comprehende <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Caluin serm.</hi> 134. <hi>in deut.</hi> 23.</note> all the nations and countries adiacent to <hi>Palestina,</hi> as <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> the <hi>Iles of the sea,</hi> and such like. Now, although I dare not resolutelie denie, but it may bée so, yet I am very hardly induced, and perswaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that it should be so. Partly, because we haue not so much as one iot, or title in the Scriptures, that mentioneth any <hi>vsurie</hi> exercised betwéene <hi>Iudea,</hi> and other countries: which it is not likely, the holy Ghost would altogether haue omitted, (if it had béen so) to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13264:71"/>
note a difference of the <hi>Iewish</hi> traffique, betweene themselues and with other nations. And partly also, I can hardly condiscend to that opinion, because it is not easie to say, that <hi>foenus nauticum,</hi> or billes of mart, or such like exchanges, were then vsed among mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, as are now in vre and practise among vs: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which conueyances, or the like, securitie cannot be made betwéene trades men, or marchants of diuerse iurisdictions. I doe therefore vnderstand with S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> by the name of <hi>strangers</hi> in that place, <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambros. lib. de Tobia. c.</hi> 15.</note> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites</hi> and <hi>Amorites,</hi> and the other nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: which being not vtterly rooted out by the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> at their first entrance into the lande of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> grew vp and increased among them, to their incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible annoyance.

But</hi> (sayth he) howsoeuer God in the preceptes belonging to those commaundementes, make mention by name of widdowes, orphanes, and poore folkes: yet, <hi>it followeth not from thence, that an iniurie done to maried perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to persons of ful yeeres, to mightie men, to rich men, &amp;c. is no sinne.</hi> Euen so is it in this case: howsoeuer GOD in the lawes of <hi>vsurie</hi> make mention of the <hi>poore</hi> by name, for some causes which afterwards shall bee alledged: yet it followeth not from hence, by any consequence of argument, that therefore to lend vpon <hi>vsurie</hi> to the rich, is no offence or breach of the lawe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to this point I answere, that howsoeuer in these places aforenamed, there is speciall mention made of the <hi>poore</hi>: yet in other places, where the same thing is forbidden, there is no mention, nor recitall of them at all. As <hi>Deut</hi> 23. <hi>Psal.</hi> 15 <hi>Ezec.</hi> 18. and others. Yea, and it is not nothing to this purpose, that <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> iustifying against <hi>Appion</hi> the lawes and statutes of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> reciteth this for one, <note n="z" place="margin">

                  <hi>Mutuans non ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat vsuras:</hi> it is sayth he, a lawe among vs, that <hi>the lender shall take no vsurie</hi>: making no mention, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the <hi>poore</hi> and néedie at al. Now, why should those places which mention the <hi>poore</hi> by name, rather
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13264:75"/>
restraine the other which make no mention of them: then the other which make no mention of the <hi>poore,</hi> should inlarge those that name them? especiallie, if wee consider that those places which mention not the <hi>poore,</hi> were the later written. Now, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>L. A.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Posteriores libri, ideò fere scripti, vt priorum interpretes essent: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bookes</hi> of the scripture <hi>were written somewhat to this purpose, that they might be interpreters</hi> and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors <hi>of the former.</hi> And therefore, the latter written scriptures concerning <hi>vsurie,</hi> making no mention of the <hi>poore,</hi> may argue that the former scriptures are not to be tyed and restrained to them alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I answer, that if the law of lending to the <hi>poore</hi> without <hi>vsurie,</hi> should inferre the lawfulnes of lending to the rich vpon <hi>vsurie</hi>: then it is euident that Gods intendement in those lawes for the benefite of the <hi>poore,</hi> should rather proue a hurt and hinderance vnto them: because by this meanes it would come to passe that the <hi>poore</hi> should not borrowe at all. For, who will lende to the <hi>poore</hi> for nothing, that might lawfully lend to the rich for <hi>vsurie?</hi> of which point wee haue so lamentable and euident experience in these daies, as no man, no not the <hi>vsurer</hi> himselfe is able to gainesay it. Yet of the two it were better for the <hi>poore</hi> man that hee should borrow vpon <hi>vsurie,</hi> then that hee should not be able to borrow at all: now borrow at al he shal not, if it be lawfull to lend to the rich for <hi>vsurie,</hi> and not vnto him. And therefore as one sayd, <hi>Maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta glossa quae corrumpit textum: Accursed be that glosse</hi> or commentarie <hi>that destroyeth the text</hi>: so may I say in this case, euill fare that interpretation which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the intent &amp; purpose of the commandement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and lastly, I answer to this third <hi>obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>: that it is no marueile though God in the lawes of <hi>vsurie</hi> doe specially and by name forbid lending in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13264:76"/>
that manner to the <hi>poore.</hi> For, he doth it, partly to shew what care hee himselfe hath ouer them, who are commonly and vsually neglected of men: and partly, because the <hi>poore</hi> are soonest and easiest oppressed of the rich, as the lowest hedge is easiliest stepped ouer: yea, and partly also, because <hi>vsurie</hi> sitteth hardest vpon the skirtes of the <hi>poore,</hi> and will sooner bite and deuoure them, then it will the rich, able, and substantiall men in the world. So that for these causes the <hi>poore</hi> had néede of a speciall caueat, to be put in on their behalfe. Wee sée that God speaketh to the same effect in other places: <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Oppresse not the widdowe, nor the fatherles, the stranger nor the poore:</hi> and many such other speeches hath God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those parties in the holy scripture.

And that (say some) appeareth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes of the text. For <hi>Moses</hi> sayth, <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25.</note>

Yea, and that the scripture onely forbiddeth <hi>biting vsurie,</hi> may appeare (say they) also by the nature and <hi>Etimologie</hi> of the word, which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost vseth to that purpose.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13264:77"/>
answer vnto it, moe waies then one. First, I say, that not only <hi>biting vsurie,</hi> but generally all measure of <hi>vsurie</hi> is forbidden in the worde. For the text is plaine, <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou lende money to my people, &amp;c. non eris ei sicut vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius: (Tremel. tanquam foenerator,) Thou shalt not be as an vsurer vnto him.</hi> Now, what is this that he sayth, <hi>Thou shalt not be as an vsurer vnto him?</hi> his meaning is, thou shalt not deale with him as <hi>vsurers</hi> are wont to deale with men. Well then, if thou lend couenanting for gaine, and aduenture not the principall: whether it <hi>bite</hi> him, or <hi>bite</hi> him not, whether thou demaund of him more or lesse for increase: yet in that manner of bargaining, thou art to him <hi>as an vsurer,</hi> for thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractest with him in that manner which an <hi>vsurer</hi> prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiseth towards men, and therfore thou art therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the word of God.</p>
               <p>Besides that, it is euident from the Scripture, that not onely <hi>bitting vsurie (Naeshaech)</hi> but generally all <hi>Increase</hi> of that kinde and nature (which the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> call <hi>Tarbith</hi>) is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the law. For <hi>Moses</hi> saith in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.36.37.</note> 
                  <hi>thou shalt take no vsurie of him, nor vantage.</hi> And agayne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place, <hi>Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsurie, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.</hi> And <hi>Ezekiell</hi> condemneth the people of his time, not onely for taking of <hi>vsurie (Naeshaech)</hi> but also for taking of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, (Tarbith.)</hi>

in other wayes, that it maketh so full a supply to the payment of increase, for that which he boroweth, as by that meanes hee féeleth not the <hi>biting</hi> and griping of the <hi>vsurie</hi> which he payeth. And euen as we sée it is in theft or robberie, if a man steale but twelue pence out of a rich mans purse, though the want of it be little felt, by reason of his store and abundance, yet he is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that looseth it, and he is a théefe that taketh it: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so is it in <hi>vsurie,</hi> though it be taken of a rich man, and in so small a measure, as that his abundance hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffereth the euill thereof to be perceiued, yet is hee <hi>bitten</hi> that payeth it, and hee that taketh it an oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.</p>

they will conclude (I trowe) either that the <hi>newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> giueth more libertie to sinne, then the <hi>olde,</hi> which were monstrous blasphemie against the Gospel of Christ: or at the least, (to speake the best of them) that the lawes touching <hi>vsurie</hi> are not <hi>morall:</hi> and so, not to abide to vs that are christians, vnder these daies of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Whereunto may bee answered: first, that this is no good argument, nor consequence in reason, <hi>vsurie</hi> is not named in the <hi>newe Testament: Ergò,</hi> it is not forbidden in the <hi>morall lawe.</hi> For many sinnes are forbidden in the <hi>morall lawe</hi>; which are no where mentioned in the <hi>new testament.</hi> As for example, the sinnes of <hi>Polygamie,</hi> of <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> of <hi>Treason,</hi> of <hi>Ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> and many others, which come not to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, are manifest breaches of the <hi>morall lawe.</hi> And yet, I suppose, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can shew them to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and reproued by those very nanies, in the <hi>new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</hi> Yea, I procéede further: there are infinite breaches, and trespasses against the <hi>morall law,</hi> which are not specified by name, either in the <hi>olde,</hi> or in the <hi>new testament.</hi> The lawe of God condemneth many thinges, <hi>a puri, àmaiori, à reinoni, &amp;c.</hi> by condemning the <hi>equal,</hi> or the <hi>greater,</hi> or the <hi>lesser</hi> offence. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, it includeth the particulars in the generall, and sometimes, the general in one particular: sometimes, it condemneth the cause, from the iniquitie of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte: sometimes, the effecte, from the iniquitie of the cause: whereas notwithstanding, the thing that is condemned, is no where recited by name, in the holy scriptures. <hi>Nazianzene</hi> sayd truely, <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Quaedam &amp; sunt, &amp; dicuntur in scripturis: quae dam sunt in scripturis, &amp; non dicuntur. Some thinges are both conteined, and named in the scriptures: some thinges are conteined in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but are not named</hi> in them. Which saying of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13264:80"/>
that ancient father, as it may be verified in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, (for the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> the <hi>persons</hi> in the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> the <hi>vnitie</hi> of <hi>substance</hi> in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> are things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in déede, but no where expresly named in the word of God:) so is it most certainely true, in this case which we haue in hand.

                  <hi>Quod etiam pro suo iure facere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerunt,</hi> sayth <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>: the fathers might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and rightly, thus sticke close, to the defence of the worde <hi>consubstantiall: Maxime verò, cum viderent eam vocem, ex diuinis literis necessariò conclude: Especially, when they saw, that that worde,</hi> though it were not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet was <hi>necessarily concluded,</hi> and gathered <hi>out of the holy scriptures.</hi> Nowe I note the example, and practise of the fathers, to this ende and purpose. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth thereby, that they held for trueth, and for the word of God, not onely that which was named, and expressed in the scriptures: but also that, which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or <hi>illation,</hi> might be concluded from the same. And therefore, although the scripture hath no where the very name, or worde <hi>consubstantiall:</hi> yet because the matter which they would signifie in that worde, was partly expressed, and partly, to be concluded from the scripture: therefore, they doubted not, to receiue it, as a pointe of faith, grounded assuredly vpon the word of God. And so say I, concerning this case of <hi>vsurie.</hi> It is true, that the very name, and worde of <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie,</hi> is no where found, nor mentioned in the <hi>newe testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi>: yet because the matter, and practise signified in that worde, is by necessary consequence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, inferred to bee forbidden in the writinges
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13264:81"/>
of the <hi>Euangelistes,</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi>: therefore, I doubt not, but I may boldly affirme this for truth, that <hi>vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> is condemned euen in the <hi>new Testament.</hi> Now, that it is by many, and manifest inferences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the <hi>new Testament,</hi> may easily appeare in these instances, and examples. The <hi>new Testament</hi> saith, <note n="p" place="margin">

                  <hi>what soeuer ye would, that men should do to you, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so do ye to them.</hi> Now, <hi>vsurie</hi> obserueth not this rule: for the <hi>vsurer</hi> imposeth that burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, which he will not gladly beare himselfe: therfore <hi>vsurie</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, in the <hi>new Testament.</hi> Againe, the <hi>new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> saith, <note n="q" place="margin">

                  <hi>Those that say that the lawes</hi> in England <hi>do allow of vsurie, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense men to commit it freely: doe slaundor the lawes, and are worthie of reprehension.</hi> For, that <hi>Queene E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisabeths statute</hi> doth not allowe nor approue <hi>vsurie,</hi> may appeare euidently by these reasons. First, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>An Act,</hi> (not <hi>for or in defence,</hi> but) <hi>against vsury.</hi> Secondly, it calleth <hi>vsurie</hi> a vice, or sinne: <hi>the vice of vsurie.</hi> Thirdly, it saith, that <hi>all vsurie is forbidden by the lawe of God, and is sinne and detestable.</hi> Fourthly, wheras commonly <hi>penal</hi> lawes are administred with as fauourable exposition as conueniently they can be, for the benefit of the subiect offending: in this <hi>statute,</hi> there is a speciall <hi>prouiso</hi> that <hi>It shall bee most largely and strongly construed to the suppressing of vsurie.</hi> And lastly, it is so farre from approuing any, as that it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth <hi>vsurie</hi> euen to the lowest degree and measure. For, whereas whosoeuer lendeth to <hi>vsurie,</hi> must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie lend either for tenne, or aboue tenne, or vnder tenne in the hundred: it punisheth him that lendeth for aboue tenne, with a treble forfeiture of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall: and him that lendeth for tenne, or vnder tenne, with the forfeiture of the <hi>vsurie</hi> and increase. So that, neither the taking of tenne, nor more then tenne, nor lesse then tenne, no not the taking of one penie in the hundred is approued by that <hi>statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O sir (will some man say) but <hi>Queene Elisabeths statute,</hi> exempteth from the penaltie thereof, all <hi>vsurie</hi> taken for the reliefe of <hi>orphanes</hi> in the citie of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:13264:90"/>
and such other places. I answer: the lawe generally condemneth <hi>vsurie</hi> in it selfe and in the owne nature: but it is compelled to tolerate it in that particular case, for very necessities sake. <hi>M Beza</hi> hath a notable saying, fully fitting this purpose. <note n="e" place="margin">

Sed impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitate hominum, coguntur multa duntaxat moderari, quae penitus tollere non possunt: But by reason of the wickednes of men, they are compelled onely to moderate manie thinges, which they cannot altogether take away. Et haec sunt quae permitti legibus dicuntur: And these are the things which are sayd to be permitted,</hi> or tolerated <hi>by lawe.</hi> An instance of this hee giueth in this very case of <hi>vsurie</hi>: which many magistrates are compelled to permit, because they see it cannot bee vtterly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.

So then by the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>statute</hi> lawe of this lande, <hi>vsurie</hi> is condemned.</p>
               <p>Come we now vnto the <hi>ciuill lawe,</hi> and we shal find that therein also <hi>vsurie</hi> is prohibited. For the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whereof, we are to remember, that the bodie of the <hi>ciuill law,</hi> is deuided as it were into three parts. The first conteineth the lawes made before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> estate became a <hi>monarchie</hi>: and with them, those lawes which were made after it arose to a <hi>monarchie,</hi> from the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> vnto the raigne of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the great. And these are called <hi>Pandectae,</hi> the lawes or volumes of the <hi>pandects.</hi> The second parte containeth those lawes which were made from the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> vnto the raigne of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi>: comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding also some of <hi>Iustinians</hi> lawes.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13264:91"/>
And those be called the <hi>Code,</hi> or the lawes of the <hi>Code.</hi> The third containeth the latter lawes made by <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>: and they be commonly called <hi>Nouellae constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,</hi> or <hi>Autenticae, The lawes of the Autentiques.</hi> Now, it must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, that by the <hi>Pandects,</hi> and the <hi>Code, vsurie</hi> is not simplie forbidden, <note n="i" place="margin">

But by the <hi>Autentiques,</hi> which are the latter lawes, (and so doe abrogate the former) it is euident and manifest that <hi>vsurie</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether prohibited.

               <p>Now if any man reply (as happily some will) that the <hi>Councell</hi> forbiddeth <hi>vsurie</hi> onely in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> persons, and so will inferre, that notwithstanding that <hi>canon,</hi> it is lawfull in the common people: he must knowe that howsoeuer <hi>Church men,</hi> or <hi>Cleargie men,</hi> (as we call them) are onely named and specified in that decree: yet because the reason which induced them to enact that <hi>Canon</hi> is drawen from the worde of God, (for they alledge the words of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:) and the worde of God is a rule and squire, not onely to the <hi>Cleargie,</hi> but also to the <hi>layetie,</hi> that is, both to men of the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; to men of the <hi>Common weale</hi>: therefore the receiued iudgement of the lawe and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers is, that <hi>vsurie</hi> is by it forbidden in all estates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, and callinges of men.
